we wont have an ending until terry anderson and the others 
are released she said

house leaders scoured the capitol for votes 
friday for a compromise budget that would reach into the pockets of 
the rich raise medicare recipients bills and add an extra nickel 
to everyones gasoline tax 
top democrats and republicans said they believed the house would 
endorse the giant deficitcutting package for the rank and file 
the vote the climax of the 101st congress raucous year was a 
chance to make a statement and return home in time for election 
day 
democrats have a message of fairness to carry home and i want 
to get out of here so i can do it said rep tom mcmillen dmd 
im voting against this because its not necessary to raise 
taxes on anybody let alone everybody said rep richard armey 
rtexas 
sensing that support could only wane with time house leaders 
planned to bring the measure to the floor as soon as it was drafted 
into legislative language a painstaking process not expected to 
be over until well after midnight 
just a week after the house and senate approved separate 
budgets bargainers molded the final details of a compromise 
bearing about 140 billion in new taxes and 100 billion in 
spending cuts for the next five years 
the original 250 billion size of the package shrank by about 9 
billion as leaders dropped unpopular items such as forcing state 
and local government workers to join medicare as a tradeoff for 
votes by late afternoon leaders said the finetuning was 
complete 
its over said house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo were done 
even some conservatives who would have preferred deeper spending 
cuts supported the plan arguing that at least it took a whack at 
the governments growing red ink 
i dont know if it was confucius or garfield who said when 
you find yourself in a hole the first rule is quit digging 
said rep charles stenholm dtexas 
when enacted the bill is to be the heart of an effort to shrink 
the deficit by 500 billion over the next five years the remaining 
savings are to come from restraints on defense spending and from 
lower interest payments because of reduced borrowing 
white house officials said president bush liked the way the 
package was shaping up but he contended anew on a campaign trip in 
california that the democrats were to blame for letting the federal 
deficit rise so high that he had to go back on his nonewtaxes 
pledge to support the deficitcutting effort 
meanwhile the treasury department reported that the red ink 
figure for fiscal 1990 which ended oct 1 reached 2204 
billion the second highest ever 
passage of the budget package would ease the way for an end to 
the long and troubled congressional session on friday the house 
and senate also dealt with a flurry of other legislation 
the senate gave final congressional passage to a 268 billion 
defense bill that made modest cuts in weapons systems 
the senate passed 898 a comprehensive overall of the 
nations immigration laws but the house threw the bill onto a 
siding facing an uncertain future when it voted 235186 not to 
approve ground rules for debate 
a conference committee of the interior approprations bill voted 
to accept the mild antiobscenity on arts financing in the house 
bill dropping the tougher provisions of the senate version 
the house approved on a voice vote and sent to the senate a 
bill toughening sanctions against banks and savings and loans 
convicted of money laundering for drug dealers 
the house passed and sent to the president a bill requiring 
more nutrition information on food labels 
a housesenate conference committee reached agreement early 
friday on a 155 billion foreign aid bill that among other 
things would forgive 67 billion in egyptian military 
indebtedness to the united states 
although legislative leaders expressed confidence that the 
budget deal would make it through congress they spent much of the 
day hunting for votes among the rank and file 
top democrats sought the support of the congressional black 
caucus but many of its 24 lawmakers all democrats said they 
would oppose the budget unless the senate took another crack at 
overriding bushs veto of the civil rights bill the senate fell 
one vote short of override this week 
then we could declare victory and all go home said rep 
charles rangel dny 
once the bargaining was over and the deficitreduction bill 
moved through the house it was expected to have little trouble in 
the senate 
the package nearing completion contained a jump in the federal 
gasoline tax to 14 cents a gallon from 9 cents new levies also 
would be aimed at alcohol tobacco furs and costly private planes 
the ballooning costs of medicare would be reined in by 44 
billion over the next five years most of the reductions would be 
in payments to doctors and hospitals but 10 billion of the cuts 
would come directly from the elderly and handicapped people the 
program serves 
their monthly premiums for doctors coverage would swell from 
2860 this year to 4620 in 1995 and their annual deductible 
would be bumped from 75 to 100 
for the uppermiddle class the 145 percent payroll tax that 
supports medicare now deducted only up to 51300 in earnings 
would extend to a persons first 125000 of income 
people earning more than 100000 annually would lose some of 
their incometax deductions and face a phaseout of the 2050 
personal exemption 
the incometax rate on the 600000 richest americans would rise 
from 28 percent to 31 percent the top rate on the 4 million next 
most welltodo individuals earning more than about 80000 
would drop from 33 percent to 31 percent 
cuts would also be made in programs ranging from agriculture to 
student loans but the measure did contain some provisions that 
eased the pain 
included were 25 billion in tax breaks for the gas and oil 
industry compliments of sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
there were also expansions of the medicaid program which helps 
the poor afford medical care there was new spending for home care 
of lowincome elderly and services for children and new 
protections against abuses by companies that sell health insurance 
to senior citizens

jon grunseth the gubernatorial 
challenger in trouble over reports he swam nude with teenage girls 
in 1981 announced late thursday he will stay in the race after 
planning earlier to withdraw 
i came here tonight to withdraw from this race grunseth 
told about 100 supporters 
but there has been just an incredible outpouring of love 
and prayer for this family that has overwhelmed both vicki his 
wife and me we are going to press forward no matter what he 
said 
a source speaking on condition of anonymity said earlier that 
grunseth would withdraw on the condition that the partys 
325member state central committee name his successor on the 
ballot 
grunseth kept reporters and anxious supporters waiting for hours 
as he huddled with advisers far past 7 pm the time he set for a 
news conference at which he had been expected to announce his 
withdrawal from the race 
grunseth had been running close to democratic incumbent rudy 
perpich before oct 15 when two women charged in sworn statements 
that grunseth encouraged them to join him in a nude swim in 1981 
when they were 13 and 14 
grunseth 44 denied the allegation but had been under 
increasing pressure from his party to quit the race he had 
consistently vowed to remain on the ballot 
the source in the grunseth camp said grunseth would throw his 
support to cal ludeman a tracy farmer and former state legislator 
who was the republican candidate for governor in 1986 
ludeman scheduled a news conference for later thursday in the 
same bloomington hotel but it was never held 
the grunseth partisan said grunseth did not want to 
automatically hand the gop spot on the ballot to arne carlson who 
launched a writein campaign on monday after losing to grunseth in 
the sept 11 primary 
grunseth who considers himself a moderateconservative had 
said carlson a leader of the moderate wing of the party is not 
acceptable to him as the partys gubernatorial candidate 
elam baer executive director of grunseths campaign met 
privately with republican us sen rudy boschwitz who said during 
a swing through southern minnesota earlier in the day that 
republicans cant win the gubernatorial race with both carlson and 
grunseth in the race against perpich 
we have a situation where two republicans are running and one 
democrat is running boschwitz told reporters our base simply 
is not big enough to cut it in half 
carlson was not immediately available for comment he was en 
route to alexandria but canceled the appearance and headed back to 
the twin cities said his campaign press secretary dave sampsel 
until we know officially that jon is out of the race we dont 
have much reaction sampsel said up until this point everyone 
in the grunseth campaign has maintained rather steadfastly that jon 
was going to stay in the race until the end 
ray bohn perpichs press secretary said the governor was not 
immediately available he said he did not know if perpich would 
comment after grunseths news conference 
were sitting 12 days away from a general election and we hope 
in the next few days the republican party will clean up its mess 
and decide whos on the ballot to face governor perpich said 
perpichs campaign manager john stanoch

tough antitax proposals in half a dozen states and a radical 
schoolchoice scheme on oregons ballot have turned election 90 
into a watershed for public schools and colleges 
educators in california nebraska massachusetts utah oregon 
and several other states are warning of school district 
bankruptcies teacher layoffs and campus closures if tax revolt 
measures are approved nov 6 
we would be on the brink of an educational meltdown said 
harold raynolds jr education commissioner of massachusetts 
voters there are about to decide on the harshest tax revolt measure 
anywhere a proposed 2 billion tax rollback if approved it would 
be the nations largest voterinitiated tax cut in history 
taxes and government waste not schools are the usual targets 
of voter wrath in most states but thats small comfort to school 
officials who claim theyd suffer more than most if taxing and 
spending curbs are approved 
latest opinion polls suggest that the education forces may be 
beating back antitax measures several states including 
massachusetts 
but no one is taking victory for granted 
it seems like the mood of the public is sort of 
antieverything said chris pipho a spokesman for the education 
commission of the states 
many voters are so blinded by an antitax mentality that it 
doesnt matter what the tax is for said richard novak director 
of state education policy and finance for the american association 
of state colleges and universities in washington dc 
and all eyes of the nations education establishment are on 
oregon where the most farreaching choice scheme ever 
considered would grant parents a 2500 tax credit to send their 
kids to any school even churchrelated or to teach them at home 
the bush administration calls choice a cornerstone of school 
reform the national education association the nations largest 
teachers union has been leading the fight to defeat it it says 
the plan could well determine the fate of education for years to 
come 
polls have flipflopped but recent opinion surveys show the 
choice plan trailing 
among key ballot contests 
massachusetts question 3 the proposed tax rollback has 
educators talking about closing college campuses 5000 or more 
teacher layoffs no new texts or extracurricular activities even 
bankruptcy for the poorest districts 
public education would not exist as we know it a year from 
now said john r correiro superintendent of the impoverished 
fall river school district 
a poll last week for the boston globe and wbztv showed 59 
percent opposed to the rollback 
nebraskas proposed measure 405 the 2 percent solution to 
its proponents would amend the constitution to limit state and 
local budget increases to 2 percent the lid could be overridden by 
referendums at the local level or by a vote of 40 of the 49 
legislators at the state level 
omaha school officials warn passage could lead to sharp program 
cuts including an end to many sports programs 
a second proposition would repeal a yearold school finance 
reform law that shifted the burden of school finance from the 
property tax to the state sales and income tax 
the contest pits educators and landowners who stand to benefit 
from lower property taxes against many of the states business 
interests who insist higher sales and income taxes would put the 
state at a competitive disadvantage 
polls suggest a close vote 
colorados proposed amendment 1 dubbed taxpayers bill of 
rights by supporters would require voter approval for state and 
local tax increases and limit the rate of increase in state 
spending effective dec 31 
in addition to the choice plan oregon voters will weigh 
measure 5 a proposed 15 percent cap on property tax increases by 
1995 
california proposition 136 would require a twothirds 
legislative or popular majority on future tax increases 
in utah college officials warn that as many as 9000 students 
could be denied entry if voters approve a proposed repeal of the 
sales tax on most food higher education officials figure theyd 
lose 31 million more than any other state agency 
arizonas proposition 103 the classroom improvement 
initiative would require the state to boost spending by 100 per 
student every year for the next 10 years cost estimates run from 
6 billion to 10 billion and several gop critics say its just 
throwing money at the states school problems 
kansas voters will decide an amendment stripping the state 
board of education and the board of regents of much of their 
independent authority and giving control of public and higher 
education to the legislature

loic wacquant stepped into a boxing ring 
suffered a broken nose nursed broken ribs and was kod injuries 
the sociologist chalks up to the pursuit of thesis material on life 
in the inner city 
the university of chicago doctoral candidate is studying race 
class and joblessness in chicago 
two years ago he stumbled upon the woodlawn boys and girls club 
and decided the south side youth organization would provide a 
perfect study field for his dissertation 
i felt that both the popular and scholarly literature on 
poverty and black america was full of stereotypes and caricatures 
and wanted to find out what really was going on in a black 
neighborhood wacquant said 
i was as they say seduced by the world of boxing 
the catch however was a rule that only people willing to hop 
into the ring could hang around the gym 
so the 29yearold native of montpellier france spnt months 
at the gym really just a ring and a few punching bags trying to 
get the hang of boxing 
people used to come to the gym just to laugh at me wacquant 
said i went through a procession of nicknames from frenchman 
with an attitude to bad dude to busy louie 
they call me busy louie because i throw a lot of punches in 
the ring because i have no defense he said 
by february the 5foot8inch 159pound frenchman whose name 
is pronounced looee vahcohnt believed he was ready for his 
first fight in the chicago golden gloves tournament three rounds 
later he wasnt so sure 
neither was his wife elizabeth who trained with him 
i thought he would be killed she said 
his trainer dd amour said he retired wacquant from the 
ring because he has a major physical weakness for boxing his nose 
bleeds like a faucet 
wacquant said the gym in a neighborhood of boarded up buildings 
and empty lots gives hope to neighborhood youngsters 
sports such as football basketball and boxing are very 
attractive to poor inner city youth as conspicuous examples of 
success and masculine achievement said wacquant who also is 
filming a documentary on the gym 
intense bodily discipline protects from pressures and 
insecurity of ghetto life he added it is a stable 
organization where they can channel their energies 
the sociologist recently named a fellow at harvard university 
worked with the french government and a colleague in paris to 
organize an exchange of underprivileged young boxers between the 
two countries 
wacquants adviser william j wilson a professor of sociology 
and public policy at the university of chicago said wacquant was a 
brilliant graduate student 
hes a very very resourceful student and extremely 
creative wilson said would you get into a ring for 
research

rest easy gothamites batman has a new robin 
the caped crusader who saw his sidekick blown to bits by the joker 
two years ago has found somebody to fill the boy wonders shoes 
although the footwear and the rest of his outfit are new 
tim drake who turned up at stately wayne manor one year ago is 
now robin no 3 drake joins bruce waynes alterego this month in 
batman comic no 457 where he manages to rescue batman and vicki 
vale from the clutches of the psychotic scarecrow 
the third robin you say yes the original of course was dick 
grayson who now works as a solo superhero called nightwing his 
successor jason todd was murdered in batman no 428 an episode 
called a death in the family 
like his predecessors drake is an orphan taken in by 
millionaire wayne i think its part of the job description 
said dc comics spokeswoman martha thomases 
drake who used his powers of deduction to figure out that 
bruce and batman were one and the same has been hanging around 
the batcave for the past year handling the more mundane aspects of 
crime fighting 
but the folks at dc comics decided the time was right for a 
replacement robin and drake holy sidekick batman has stepped 
in 
over the last year he has proven himself mentally morally 
spiritually and physically capable of taking over batman editor 
dennis oneil said thursday today is his rite of passage 
the 90s robin also should help batman psychologically the 
crimefighter would soon skew into a nasty insanity if he did not 
have someone to care for someone to maintain a link with common 
humanity explained oneil 
drake stakes his claim to robin status by overcoming the 
scarecrow who has terrorized gotham city by mailing out druglaced 
christmas cards that sent the recipients into homicidal frenzies 
afterward batman officially makes tim the new boy wonder in a 
batcave affair attended by the evertrustworthy butler alfred the 
new robin gets a new outfit as well one designed in the comics 
by batman and approved in real life by batman movie director 
tim burton 
did anybody say sequel 
due to the demise of his last partner batman has come up with 
new robinwear that is heavy on safety gone is robins old yellow 
cape in its place is a black model fashioned from bulletresistant 
kevlar the same material is used for the shirt which has an 
armored collar 
the utility belt is still there albeit a colorcoordinated 
version that looks like it was designed by perry ellis rather than 
bruce wayne a new r logo appears on his outfit his shoes are 
no longer green boots but fireresistant and bulletproof black 
numbers 
the net result robin looks sharp and batman should sleep 
easier i think batman psychologically felt that to put a new kid 
on the firing line he needed a new safer costume said dc editor

thomas campbell told his family that being 
held hostage for 14 hours at the camp hill state prison one year 
ago was more torturous than handtohand combat in vietnam 
in vietnam campbell could defend himself 
campbell was one of 18 prison employees taken hostage by inmates 
during the uprising on oct 2527 1989 in which 123 people were 
injured 
guards say they warned before the riot that trouble was brewing 
and complain that little has been done since then to improve the 
situation 
inmates used a nailstudded board to beat campbell on his back 
and legs they pounded his body with a metal baseball bat stabbed 
him with a screwdriver sliced open the back of his left hand and 
hit him between the eyes with a piece of lumber 
when he was finally rescued the 42yearold guard had about 80 
puncture wounds in his back seven stab wounds in his left side and 
knees that looked like basketballs his mother said 
i went in to him that morning he was in intensive care and i 
didnt even recognize him his face was so swollen said his 
mother barbara campbell i said honey youre going to be all 
right look what youve been through 
he said mom this was worse than vietnam 
campbell spent 11 days in a hospital and several months in 
therapy and athome rehabilitation he is expected to return to 
work nov 5 
it has cost the state millions of dollars to begin repairs at 
the mediumsecurity prison shift inmates temporarily from ruined 
cellblocks to the federal prison system and pay overtime 
cumberland county district attorney michael eakin said more than 
a quarter of his staffs time and money has gone to prosecute the 
estimated 200 inmates allegedly involved in the riots the prison 
is in cumberland county about five miles from the state capital 
harrisburg 
its a logistical can of worms and a burden on the attorneys 
in the office and the clerical staff eakin said its going to 
end up costing the county over a million dollars 
gubernatorial candidate barbara hafer and other republicans have 
tried to turn the riot into a factor against gov robert p caseys 
bid for reelection in november they point to unrepaired damage 
and to guards repeated warnings that it could happen again 
two cell blocks the main dining hall gymnasium greenhouse and 
auditorium are still gutted and only half of the education building 
is usable 
guards say the prison is woefully understaffed forcing them to 
pull 12hour shifts sometimes six days a week officials say 50 to 
70 guards and staff have not returned to work since the riots 
nothings changed its gotten worse said daniel murdock a 
guard with 11 years experience he said officials dont listen to 
what guards have to say 
before the riots 2700 inmates were housed at the prison which 
was designed to hold 1826 said john palakovich camp hill prison 
spokesman the riot left housing only for 1537 prisoners but 2193 
inmates are still there 
more than 500 remain in 31 federal prisons across the country 
at a cost to the state of about 25700 each day officials say 
they are ready to bring them back at one point 806 inmates had 
been farmed out to the federal system 
administrators say things have improved 
casey spokesman vincent carocci said the administration 
responded adeptly by establishing a commission to investigate the 
riots the commissions 57page report included several key 
recommendations which officials say have already begun the prison 
administration also was replaced 
prison officials point to a new 68 million concrete and steel 
modular cell unit that can house 256 inmates new security fences 
inside the prison and steel mesh to cover cell doors they say the 
hiring of more guards has been approved and prison expansion is a 
priority 
department of corrections spokesman ben livingood said the 
damaged buildings should be repaired by spring and four additional 
maximumsecurity housing units should be constructed in about nine 
months

the pentagon is sending additional troops to 
saudi arabia partly to counter a recent hardening of iraqs 
defenses in occupied kuwait officials say 
defense secretary dick cheney said thursday that more american 
gis possibly as many as 100000 will be shipped to the saudi 
desert to join the 220000 us forces already in the persian gulf 
area following iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
he said no final decision has been made on which additional 
units will be sent 
cheney and other officials said the troop addition does not 
signal a switch in us policy from defending against a possible 
iraqi invasion of saudi arabia to laying the groundwork for an 
offensive against iraq 
cheney said the extra troops some of which may come from us 
bases in germany that are scheduled to close will give us 
military authorities more leverage in dealing with iraqs huge 
army which includes an estimated 3500 tanks in kuwait 
our decision to add forces results from iraqs almost doubling 
of forces in kuwait and southern iraq from approximately 265000 in 
early september to about 430000 today the pentagon said in a 
statement released after cheney disclosed the decision in 
television interviews 
iraqi president saddam hussein continues to fortify his 
positions in kuwait and southern iraq and continues to accumulate 
significant forces that could conceivably go south the 
statement said 
cheney also said the pentagon was planning to send fresh troops 
to the saudi desert to replace units due for rotation back to their 
home stations he said final decisions were pending on which units 
to rotate and in what order 
on capitol hill rep les aspin chairman of the house armed 
services committee said the us force in saudi arabia appeared 
illfitted for the bush administrations stated aims 
its the wrong size force the wisconsin democrat said 
its too big to stay there and too small to attack 
echoing cheneys remarks cia director william webster said 
thursday that saddam was greatly improving the quality of his 
defenses in kuwait making any us offensive operation more 
problematic and costly 
pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters the iraqi 
occupation forces were fortifying their positions by digging 
antitank ditches laying mines and building berms or earthen 
walls to protect and hide their armor he said they also were 
building roads to allow for quick reinforcements 
while the iraqis have dug in that is an indication to our 
analysts not that they have lost the capability to go on the 
offensive but rather that they dont show any sign of letting go of 
kuwait williams said 
cheney stressed that bush has not ordered him to prepare for an 
offensive action against iraq but he noted that the president has 
not ruled out the use of force 
the pentagon chief said us forces are in the gulf area to 
deter saddam from invading saudi arabia to defend the saudi 
kingdom in the event of an attack and to enforce united nations 
sanctions against iraq 
we want to have the capability for the president to make the 
decision to use other options should that become necessary in 
response to a provocation for example cheney said 
at another point he said for a number of reasons i would 
expect a continuing flow of forces to the gulf in the period 
ahead 
asked whether as many as 100000 more troops might be sent the 
secretary said its conceivable that well end up with that big 
an increase 
williams indicated that cheney was considering transferring as 
many as 50000 troops from germany to saudi arabia but that plans 
were incomplete 
the saudi ambassador prince bandar bin sultan said after a 
late afternoon meeting thursday with senior state department 
officials the issue of peace or war is in the hands of saddam 
hussein 
asked why the united states was sending more troops the 
ambassador replied it just means we will not take any chances

none of the spending was sought by the bush administration or 
authorized by house committees with jurisdiction over scientific 
research none of the house members projects were in the senate 
bill nor were any of the senators projects in the house measure 
but when the two different versions were merged in a conference 
committee all of the projects survived intact despite 700 
million in cuts from other energy and water programs to meet 
deficitreduction goals 
frankly what we are doing is ignoring the science the 
judgments of the scientists and we are depending upon the 
judgments of the politicians said rep don ritter rpa a 
former research engineer 
rep robert walker of pennsylvania the top republican on the 
house science space and technology committee tried in vain last 
week to stop the unauthorized pork barrel projects 
not a chance the house voted against him nearly 31 the word 
on the floor he said was you better be with us on this or 
were going to take a look at your projects too 
congress struggle to find 20 billion in spending cuts this 
year as a part of a fiveyear 500 billion deficitreduction plan 
is not stopping lawmakers from taking care of their home districts 
all politics is local former house speaker thomas p 
oneill often said and with an election coming up nov 6 
lawmakers are well aware their job security hangs as much on 
bringing home the bacon as on their voting records 
im over outrage im into nausea said walker the fact 
is that when we are allocating money it is not based upon merit 
other than the people who are sitting in the room divvying up the 
money 
but members of the appropriations committees show no remorse in 
exercising their power to fund projects back home 
this is research that has to be done said rep john myers 
of indiana the top republican on the house appropriations 
subcommittee on energy and water projects he got 48 million for 
a new technology center at indiana state university 
maybe they are located in some of the districts of members 
but we know more about them there myers said 
lawmakers dont have to be on the appropriations committee to 
get money for the folks back home though sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny this week trumpeted senate approval of 325 
million for five recreational and cultural projects in new york 
including construction of the womens rights park in seneca falls 
the appropriations process often ends up in a public tussle 
this week virginia lawmakers told constituents that a housepassed 
bill means a newport news va shipyard will win a coveted 
contract to build the 17 billion ssn21 seawolf submarine 
we have won the struggle declared rep herbert h bateman 
rva 
not so fast said lawmakers from connecticut rather they said 
the bill requires newport news to compete with the general dynamics 
corp submarine construction yard in groton conn 
a congressional staffer familiar with the legislation said 
general dynamics still could win the contract 
byrd a 32year senate veteran gave up the more prestigious 
majority leaders job two years ago to head the appropriations 
committee where i can best serve the people of my state 
my proposals for west virginia come under the sharpest 
scrutiny more so because im the chairman byrd said thursday 
this nation must invest in its infrastructure its research and 
its people my efforts to strengthen west virginias economic 
bases reflect that belief

the masked ball is back in stockholm at the 
metropolitan opera and luciano pavarotti and aprile millo are 
starring in the new production 
they were in splendid voice and juan pons singing as the 
husband vocally held up his side of the triangle when the new 
production premiered on thursday night 
verdi set the masked ball in 1792 stockholm but italian 
censors rejected that and he moved it to boston the production 
that this one replaces last seen at the met in the 198282 season 
had scene 1 in what looked like a spartan bare wood courtroom the 
sumptuousness of a throne room is more fun for an audience and the 
music pavarotti sings and the way he sang it thursday are 
suitable for a king 
pavarotti sang with the beauty that has made him a worldwide 
star he may have started singing verdi too soon in the mid1970s 
but now hes right for it and sounding wonderful 
miss millo is a real verdi soprano with the right roundness of 
voice confidence strong projection and lovely youthfulsounding 
top notes 
james levine conducted sensitively keeping orchestra volume low 
during thoughtfilled arias 
harolyn blackwell sang effectively we especially like her 
light coloratura singing as the kings page she must have been 
frustrated by opening night mishaps her hat fell off four times 
and she dropped a cloth draped over her arm but she carried on 
with aplomb 
elena obraztsova sang ulrica the fortune teller with deep 
slavicsounding chest tones consistant with the character 
piero faggioni did set costume and lighting design pavarotti 
dons a royal cape in act 1 with a train that extends down four 
stairsteps his other capes and jackets were bordered in gold miss 
millos first costume was a striking flamboyant gown and big 
feathered hat even in disgrace with her husband at home she 
wasnt shabby 
there is wonderful music in a masked ball duets ensembles 
and choruses but verdi lavished even more in other operas 
though we like the swedish court better than boston there are 
quibbles about this production on act 2 steam puffed out maybe 
meant to be clouds but it was distracting in act 3 it puffed up 
behind and above interior rooms 
a ceiling with a row of skylight windows was always present 
looking especially odd outdoors in act 2 act 2 looked overly 
wagnerian with steps down mountains on each side and a cut between 
mountains in the center some of the staging with walkways above 
walkways and lots of people onstage was in the massive zeffirelli 
style 
this production does solve the kings death scene difficulties 
by carrying him from the floor to his throne during the time when 
tenors in previous productions have seemed to expire then rouse to 
sing some more

the slaying of 19 palestinian arabs during a 
riot in jerusalem brought the united states into open conflict with 
israel its closest ally in the middle east 
but next door in lebanon the death toll is far greater and 
the bush administration is keeping its head down 
there is some discussion of the countrys plight in united 
nations corridors and the state department this week implicitly 
criticized syria for not curbing the bloodshed 
but no one is demanding a un inquiry and the bush 
administration is not blaming anyone publicly for the violence 
by contrast the united states was the chief sponsor of the 
resolution approved oct 12 by the un security council that 
condemned israel for the shooting deaths of the 19 palestinians 
during a riot on the temple mount four days earlier 
the united states voted against israel again wednesday for 
refusing to admit un investigators 
one of the reasons israeli leaders gave for rejecting the un 
investigation despite a plea from president bush was that the 
security council had already reached its conclusions finding 
israel at fault for the slayings 
when it comes to lebanon however the administration is not 
assessing blame for the nearly daily slayings that have torn the 
country apart 
the us embassy in beirut was closed last september ambassador 
john mccarthy and his staff were recalled for their safety 
lacking an official us presence the state department says it 
is unable to determine who is responsible for particular acts of 
violence 
the killings increased after gen michel aoun the last major 
christian holdout against syrian influence over lebanon gave up 
the fight two weeks ago 
we have seen the many press reports of atrocities carried out 
in east beirut since the surrender of general aoun said state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
she added if those reports are true whoever is responsible 
the united states would condemn them in the strongest terms 
the administration had urged aoun to end his resistance he has 
taken refge in the french embassy 
we have told the syrians they have a special responsibility 
given their control over parts of lebanon to ensure that such 
abuses do not take place in areas under their control ms 
tutwiler said 
syria which has influence over the lebanese government headed 
by president elias hrawi is a key arab ally of the united states 
in its campaign against iraqs occupation of kuwait about 4000 
syrian troops are in saudi arabia to help defend the kingdom 
against iraqi attack 
yet syria remains on the state departments list of countries 
that promote terrorism 
when secretary of state james a baker iii called on president 
hafez assad last month in damascus he made a point of the us 
allegations 
raymond tanter a university of michigan professor who served on 
the national security council at the outset of the reagan 
administration commends bush for his response to iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
yet tanter who has just written a book titled whos at the 
helm lessons of lebanon accuses the administration of 
exhibiting benign neglect when syria increased its troops in beirut 
this month 
why would bush deploy over 200000 troops building up an 
international coalition impose an economic blockade and embargo 
and threaten military action against saddam hussein of iraq while 
ignoring the takeover of lebanon by hafez assad of syria tanter 
asked thursday 
the answer he said in a telephone interview is simple 
although there is firm evidence linking assad to all manner of 
terrorist acts including the downing of pan am 103 it is more 
important to focus attention on saddams rape of kuwait and to hold 
together the coalition against him than it is to aid lebanon 
tanter said 
however he said this approach could send the wrong signal to 
damascus encouraging assad to challenge israel or to move against 
jordan 
a palestinian group with strong ties to syria the popular front 
for the liberation of palestinegeneral command is suspected in 
the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland in which 270 people perished 
syrian foreign minister farouk shara said during a news 
conference with baker there was no hard evidence the popular front 
was responsible for the tragedy he said syria condemned terrorism 
in all its forms

iraqi occupation forces are pulling 
kuwaiti license plates off cars and refusing gasoline to owners who 
wont change them to new kuwaitiraq plates kuwaitis fleeing 
their country say 
traffic has fallen off sharply at this dusty border post with 
only 16 cars crossing into saudi arabia in a fivehour period 
compared to up to 300 a day in recent days a senior saudi official 
told reporters thursday 
one kuwaiti at the border who gave only his first name falah 
said iraqi soldiers stopping cars at checkpoints were removing 
plates and confiscating identity cards 
they are arresting our young men and beating them he said 
every day all over the place they have checkpoints 
he stood under a concrete canopy as saudi border police searched 
his car even using a search dog to sniff out the trunk the 
saudis and other persian gulf nations have been searching 
incoming travelers closely for weapons and other materials that 
might be used in iraqiinspired terrorism 
but the senior official who spoke on condition of not being 
named said there had been no arrests of iraqi spies and no 
seizures of prohibited goods at the border 
nearby a tent village originally set up to handle the flood of 
fleeing kuwaitis and foreigners from kuwait stood almost empty the 
tents canvas doors flapping in the hot desert wind only 20 people 
were using the tents 
many arriving kuwaitis have no identity papers they are given a 
certificate that will help them with formalities in saudi arabia 
such as checking into hotels 
kuwaitis confirmed that gasoline was only being provided to cars 
with the new kuwaitiraq plates the senior saudi official said 
the iraqi order limiting gasoline supplies appeared to be a factor 
in the decline in numbers of cars crossing the border 
gasoline rationing went into effect tuesday private cars are 
allowed 8 gallons a week and trucks 24 gallons 
the kuwaitis said that long lines of cars have formed at the 
three centers set up in kuwait to allow them to convert their 
plates 
kuwaiti officials in exile say such moves are designed to 
obliterate the notion of kuwaiti nationality tens of thousands of 
iraqis are reportedly being settled in kuwait in an attempt to 
change the demographic balance there

federal health authorities reporting 45 
hospitalizations and two deaths in police training in massachusetts 
and firefighter fitness tests in new york called for a balance 
between training and safety 
in a report thursday the centers for disease control didnt 
criticize the programs or the public safety officials involved but 
the atlantabased agency did warn that the programs can be 
dangerous 
the need for physical performance testing must be balanced 
carefully with the safety of persons participating the cdc 
cautioned 
massachusetts cases came in a highly publicized episode in 
september 1988 when 13 of 50 trainees from local police 
departments became ill and were hospitalized during a 14week 
mental stress and physical training program at a 
statesponsored police academy one trainee died 
in new york city 32 out of 16506 firefighter candidates were 
hospitalized between may 1988 and december 1989 after fitness tests 
designed to simulate the rigors of firefighting again one died 
in both locations symptoms included back pains nausea and 
either dark or decreased urine four new york firefighter 
candidates and six massachusetts police recruits required kidney 
dialysis the cdc said 
the cases are characterized as exerciserelated breakdowns in 
muscle fiber accompanied by acute kidney impairment in both 
locations health investigators found those most likely to become 
ill were recruits not accustomed to vigorous exercise the cdc 
said 
breakdown in muscle tissue is a natural consequence of 
vigorous physical activity including athletics and military 
work but in persons unaccustomed to regular exercise it can be 
extensive and kidney impairment can also occur the cdc said 
in new york the fire fitness test was offered over a two to 
threemonth period every four years in 198889 it was repeatedly 
suspended for health concerns 
the timed test lasted only a few minutes and included the 
performance of firefighting tasks while wearing heavy equipment 
after the illnesses the city department of health recommended that 
the test be modified before it is given again 
the massachusetts training program included strenuous exercise 
under hot conditions and limited water availability it 
subsequently was revised and the state attorney general urged an 
overhaul of the agency responsible

a plan by the european community to ban 
imports of us meat on grounds it is produced under unsanitary 
conditions is seen by industry and agriculture department officials 
as a flagrant example of a nontariff trade restriction 
besides infuriating us officials the ec plan puts a further 
snarl in uruguay round negotiations under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade which are supposed to conclude by the end of the 
year 
one of the goals of the gatt talks is to bring some kind of 
order to international health standards for food and agricultural 
products 
but the 12nation ec a major player in the gatt talks plans to 
announce soon a ban on imports of us pork beginning on oct 31 
and beef imports by the end of the year 
the plan was outlined by ray macsharry ec commissioner in a 
letter this week to agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
macsharry said the longsweltering issue over us meat products 
had not been resolved to the satisfaction of the community 
further he said many of the sanitary problems noted by ec 
authorities still exist in us hogslaughter plants including 
insufficient general hygiene and veterinary control insufficient 
postmortem inspections and trichinella treatment or inspection 
macsharry continued i am afraid that these results show that 
no matter how much patience and goodwill is shown on the part of 
the ec there remains an absence of commitment on the part of the 
us authorities concerning establishments producing fresh meat for 
the community 
yeutter who was in south america this week replied in a 
statement issued by his office that the ecs intention to ban meat 
imports was an absurd idea 
a 1989 restriction on imports of us beef products because of 
potential hormone contamination was eased but not until the united 
states had countered with high tariffs on imports of ec 
agricultural products 
yeutter said usda has been working with the ec the past two 
years to make regulatory requirements and technical methods 
acceptable to both sides 
while we and the us meat industry do not agree with the ecs 
allegations many us companies have made changes within their 
plants to comply with the ec requirements even though these 
changes do not result in a superior or safer product he said 
yeutter added it is exasperating that the ec has ignored the 
attempts by the us meat industry to comply with its requirements 
and has taken this action to stop us meat exports into the ec 
meat makes up a relatively small part of the total us 
agricultural exports to the ec which last year totaled about 657 
billion according to agriculture department trade statistics meat 
and meat products were put at 1477 million or about 2 percent of 
the total 
however europe is an important market for variety meats 
the edible offals such as livers tongues and other organs not in 
great demand among american consumers 
according to yeutter and others close to the gatt talks 
agreements are being sought to ensure that sanitary and 
phytosanitary rules are used for legitimate food safety purposes 
not to build trade barriers 
current gatt rules state that the 97 member countries of the 
agreement have the right to adopt any measure considered necessary 
to protect human animal or plant life or health 
but the rules are so vague that many countries use health 
requirements to shut out certain imports when they choose to do 
so 
this is an artificial trade barrier not a food safety 
issue said mike wehler president of the national pork producers 
council 
this is one more example of the ecs fortress mentality when 
it comes to trade barriers that protect its pork industry he 
said 
under procedures being developed during the gatt talks a 
country would be able to challenge anothers claim that 
healthrelated import regulations were necessary to protect 
domestic human or plant life or health the challenge then would be 
settled within the gatt framework 
each nation would still be able to set its own food safety 
standards based on its definition of acceptable risks however 
international standards would serve as a reference for settling a 
dispute under gatt proceedings 
the idea is to formulate food safety standards based on 
scientific evidence and science and to eliminate their use as 
trade barriers according to a usda background report 
three international scientific organizations would serve as the 
basis or initial reference point for settling disputes within the 
gatt 
codex alimentarius commission established in 1963 with a 
membership of 135 countries it is concerned with protecting the 
health of consumers ensuring fair practices in food trade and 
promoting the coordination of food standards 
international office of epizootics with 106 members it is 
concerned with health and sanitary requirements for animal imports 
and exports it was founded in 1924 and is the oldest international 
veterinary organization 
international plant protection conference with 88 member 
countries it develops plant quarantine requirements and other 
measures to prevent the spread of plant pests and diseases from 
country to country it was formed in the 1950s and works mainly 
with regional groups such as the north american plant protection 
organization

fortyone students were injured thursday 
when gymnasium bleachers collapsed just after a high school 
assembly ended 
the bleachers gave way about 11 am at st marks high school 
as students were being dismissed from an antidrug rally state 
police said 
the bleachers of 12 rows each are in sections lining both 
sides of the gym nine of 12 rows of one section collapsed 
the injured students were treated at two area hospitals and 
released john laforgia spokesman for the medical center of 
delaware said the most serious injury was a concussion 
there were a lot of bumps and bruises and a couple of sprains 
one person had broken teeth laforgia said 
the bleachers have been in the school since it opened in 
september 1969 principal ronald r russo said 
he said the bleachers are maintained by the schools maintenance 
workers he did not know when they were last inspected 
he said none of the bleachers will be used until all are 
inspected by a structural engineer russo said he plans to have the 
manufacturer inspect the damage and may schedule an independent 
examination the schools insurance company was also expected to 
inspect the damage

international experts say bulgarias only 
nuclear power complex is dangerously understaffed due to a brain 
drain but shutting it down could cripple the countrys economy 
the dilemma extends across eastern europe where nuclear plants 
run by the soviet unions former allies have raised concern about 
their design and operation the german government plans to close 
five sovietbuilt reactors in what once was east germany by 
december 
the five plants at bulgarias kozlodui nuclear complex on the 
danube river bordering romania generate 30 percent of the 
countrys electricity 
but ferdinand franzen of the viennabased international atomic 
energy agency said thursday that the facility was in a critical 
phase and that the seriousness of the problem should not be 
underestimated 
franzen said there was a dramatic brain drain of qualified 
technicians that endangered a sixth reactor under construction and 
could lead to a possible shutdown of the fifth unit 
franzen spoke to the bulgarian news agency bta after the iaea 
team he led finished a twoweek review of conditions at kozlodui 
80 miles northeast of the capital sofia 
the fifth and sixth reactors at the complex are the same design 
as the reactor that exploded at chernobyl in april 1986 the soviet 
union has decided to stop building those reactors and is closing 
chernobyl 
earlier this month workers at kozlodui said the sixth reactor 
was plagued with safety violations and would explode if started up 
parliamentarian krassen stanchev said the agencys report 
creates a dilemna for bulgaria 
a shutdown would force the government either to close 
industries risking mass unemployment or add electricity to the 
long list of food and household items that are rationed to 
consumers he said 
we need the nuclear station at any price but the additional 
measures to improve the safety are very expensive for us said 
stanchev an opposition member and head of the environmental 
commission in bulgarias parliament 
stanchev said sufficient safety measures would cost an extra 
400 million without western aid they would be impossible he 
said in an interview wednesday in vienna where he was attending a 
conference on the environment 
premier andrei lukanov acknowledged there was a shortage of 
personnel at the plant but said the facility offers a way out of 
bulgarias energy crisis 
bulgaria already is short of energy as a result of the persian 
gulf crisis a shortfall in soviet supplies and its own economic 
ills 
energy shortages already have led to shutdowns of electric power 
in sofia and other parts of bulgaria where staple food items gas 
and heating oil are being rationed 
the economic crisis has led to renewed protests against the 
ruling socialist party which was the communist party until it 
changed its name last year 
other former east bloc countries also rely heavily on nuclear 
energy it accounts for more than 27 percent of czechoslovakias 
electricty and nearly 50 percent of hungarys according to 1989 
statistics published by the iaea 
an iaea team visiting romania earlier this month found poor 
construction quality and lackadaisacal attitudes among workers at 
the cernavoda plant under construction there the westerndesigned 
plant would be romanias first 
czechoslovakia has acknowledged that one of its two nuclear 
reactors does not meet world safety standards 
eastern europes energy crisis is not likely to be overcome 
soon the soviet union is to begin demanding hard currency for its 
oil exports starting jan 1 higher world prices sparked by the 
persian gulf crisis will add to the burden 
growing environmental consciousness rules out further 
development of such heavy polluters as brown coal another possible 
source of electricity

the middle east wont be safe until iraqi 
president saddam hussein is contained says cia director william 
webster 
the bush administration is reluctant to see saddam remain in 
power regardless of what happens in kuwait webster suggested 
thursday 
can you put him back in his box he asked 
officials have no real confidence that the area will ever be 
secure again as long as he saddam is still there unless he is 
disassociated from his weapons webster said a regional 
peacekeeping force would be the best way to east tensions in the 
long term he said 
saddam has amassed one of the largest military machines in the 
world he also possesses chemical weapons and reportedly is 
developing nuclear weapons us officials estimate he has 400000 
troops in or around kuwait which he invaded aug 2 
because of saddams tight security operation any successful 
effort to oust him likely would have to come from his small inner 
circle cia officials have said 
saddam has ruthlessly squashed dissidents killing them or 
frightening them into exile in london and other world capitals 
webster said however there have been some encouraging 
reports of some dissatisfaction with saddam inside iraq economic 
sanctions imposed by the united nations are beginning to take their 
toll he said 
iraqs rigid dictatorship and extensive internal security 
apparatus make the country a difficult place for us intelligence 
agents to work according to webster and other officials 
if the cia were to pursue any covert action in iraq president 
bush would have to sign a finding allowing such action 
there have been unconfirmed reports that bush has signed a 
finding but neither cia officials nor congressional sources would 
comment on such a secret document 
the term finding dates from 1973 legislation that says no 
money can be channeled to covert action unless the president 
finds that such an operation is important to the national security 
of the united states 
findings must be presented to key members of congress before the 
operation or soon afterward 
new legislation passed by congress this week spells out the 
finding must be in writing and must coincide with identifiable 
foreign policy objectives bush is expected to sign the measure 
which grew out of the irancontra affair 
david whipple head of the association of former intelligence 
officers said findings usually deal with specific operations not 
broad goals they detail how much an operation will cost what it 
is designed to achieve and how it will be carried out 
president reagan came under intense criticism in the irancontra 
affair for making an oral rather than a written finding that 
authorized the first armsforhostages swap and for failing to 
tell congress about the finding for more than a year 
in addition to the finding requirement a 1976 executive order 
bars anyone working for the united states from plotting or carrying 
out assassinations the order was drawn up after congressional 
investigators found evidence of cia involvement in attempts to kill 
cuban leader fidel castro 
bush and congress agreed to review the rules governing covert 
action following the unsuccessful october 1989 coup attempt by 
panamanian opponents of manuel noriega american intelligence 
officials did not help the coup plotters either logistically or 
with advice 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said congress and the administration agreed to relax the 
restrictions so the united states would not be liable if someone 
were killed in a covert action 
if a person might be killed incidental to a coup thats 
quite a bit different from a premeditated assassination said 
sen william cohen rmaine vice chairman of the intelligence 
panel

federal prosecutors won convictions in the 
first south carolina statehouse corruption trial 
state rep luther taylor one of 10 lawmakers indicted after 
being snared in an fbi sting was convicted thursday of accepting 
4300 in bribes for his support of a parimutuel betting bill he 
faces up to 120 years in prison and a 15 million fine 
the 40yearold columbia democrat was convicted of six counts of 
violating the hobbs act a federal antibribery law an indictment 
accused him of accepting five separate bribes and conspiring to 
solicit those bribes in exchange for his support of the parimutuel 
bill 
four other lawmakers caught in the sting labeled operation 
lost trust pleaded guilty to bribery charges and resigned their 
seats one lawmaker pleaded guilty to drug charges and resigned a 
lobbyist caught in the sting also pleaded guilty to drug charges 
the remaining four lawmakers face trial in november and 
december 
people are not going to put up with public officials selling 
the public trust us attorney bart daniel said after thursdays 
verdict 
he refused to link the taylor case with the trials of the other 
four lawmakers but he said the verdict at least partially 
vindicated the sting against charges of racial bias 
its pretty easy to make accusations daniel said but 
theres no evidence of racial bias 
four of the 10 legislators are black including taylor and three 
of the four awaiting trial leading to some complaints that the 
sting was slanted more toward black members of the legislature 
the jury in taylors trial had three blacks and nine whites a 
racial makeup close to that of south carolinas population 
jurors reached their verdict after about six hours of 
deliberation taylor sat expressionless as the verdict was read 
but said outside court he was not happy 
he remains free on 25000 bond pending sentencing he and his 
lawyer joel collins said no decision had been made on whether to 
appeal 
videotapes and informant ron cobb dominated the prosecutions 
side of the trial cobb a former democratic house member who had 
become a lobbyist worked undercover for the fbi after getting 
caught in a drug deal 
he testified he had bribed taylor with 2500 to help recruit 
other lawmakers to support the parimutuel measure which would 
have let voters decide whether to allow betting on horse and dog 
racing in south carolina 
videotapes showed cobb giving the cash to an appreciative 
taylor 
taylor maintained throughout his testimony that cobb was giving 
him campaign contributions but he acknowledged that he slipped 
cobb a note during a meeting last january that said for my 
undivided attention 2500

astronomers reported today they have found the 
largest galaxy ever discovered in a concentration of stars that 
stretches for 6 million light years or more than 60 times the size 
of the milky way 
a central galaxy in a distant cluster of galaxies called abell 
2029 has more than 100 trillion stars said a study published in 
the journal science the milky way which includes the sun and its 
solar system has about 3 billion stars 
the stellar structure is the largest single galaxy that has 
been resolved said jeffrey r kuhn a michigan state university 
astronomer who coauthored the study 
if we talk about the galaxy and the halo diffused light 
around the galaxy as a single entity then it is the largest 
object that we are aware of he said 
until this study the largest known galaxy was markarian 348 
which was identified in 1987 it is 13 million light years in 
diameter 
kuhn and his coinvestigators juan m uson of the national 
radio astronomy observatory and stephen p boughn of haverford 
college determined the size of the galaxy using a series of 
observations from the kitt peak national observatory in arizona 
sixteen photos taken by the observatorys 36inch telescope were 
processed through a computer that removed from the view all of the 
light from other sources this enabled the scientists to precisely 
measure the brightness and size of the galaxy although individual 
stars could not be resolved 
later a second series of photos from kitt peak confirmed the 
findings 
kuhn said the abell 2029 cluster of galaxies is about a billion 
light years away and includes about a thousand galaxies each with 
billions of stars 
if you were to look up into the sky and could see this 
cluster they would occupy an area a little smaller than the 
moon he said of course they are much fainter than the eye 
can see 
a light year is 589 trillion miles the distance that light can 
travel in one year in a vacuum 
the very large galaxy classified by astronomers as a cd for 
central dominant emits more than a quarter of all the light 
radiated by the entire cluster 
kuhn said that by analyzing the diffuse light by computer the 
group was able to determine that there was little stellar matter 
between the cd galaxy and others in the abell 2029 cluster this 
suggests he said that the cd galaxy and the cluster itself formed 
about the same time 
one of the theories about cd galaxies has been that they form 
by collisions of galaxies kuhn said when galaxies collide 
stars in the smaller galaxies end up being stripped away and fall 
into this giant galaxy in the middle 
but the cd galaxy in abell 2029 he said is much too large to 
have been formed by stripping it seems likely that it formed at 
the same time that the cluster formed and it may have formed out of 
remnant material that did not fall into the small galaxies 
also kuhn said if stripping was a factor in the formation of 
the galaxy there would still be clumps of debris giving off light 
between the galaxies but the observations detected only a smooth 
empty space 
richard mushotzky an astronomer at the goddard space center in 
maryland said the work may help solve one of the underlying 
mysteries in astronomy 
we dont understand how clusters are built mushotzky said 
if this abell 2029 study can be verified it could 
substantially advance our understanding of how galaxies and 
clusters are formed

drivers smokers and drinkers are about to be 
socked to cut the federal deficit but many wealthy americans 
especially those with big families may feel theyre being soaked 
a 150 billion fiveyear tax increase making its way through 
congress would hit especially hard at highincome people one new 
provision affecting the welltodo is being criticized as nothing 
less than a tax on children 
it would phase out the tax saving from personal exemptions as 
family income rises above 150000 a year losing that tax saving 
would have the effect of raising the marginal tax rate on those 
families and the larger the family the higher the rate 
the dependent exemption is the most vital profamily feature 
of the income tax code gary l bauer president of the 
conservative family research council said thursday by phasing 
out this exemption members of congress are thumbing their noses at 
the practice of adjusting tax liability to reflect differences in 
household size 
congressional analysts said the emerging bill would raise from 
154 percent to 161 percent the portion of the federal tax burden 
paid by those with incomes over 200000 a year their taxes would 
rise on the average by 63 percent 
on the other hand those with incomes under 20000 would get a 
tax cut because of an increase in the earnedincome credit for poor 
working families with children those with incomes between 20000 
and 200000 would face tax increases in the range of 2 percent 
although the added bite on those between 50000 and 75000 would 
average only 15 percent 
for most people with incomes under 50000 the bills only 
increases would come from consumer taxes 
but for those with higher incomes especially over 100000 the 
bill would bite in several ways the biggest change would come from 
raising from 28 percent to 31 percent the top income tax rate paid 
by the 600000 wealthiest couples and individuals 
this would mean a tax increase for single people with taxable 
income after deductions and exemptions above 97620 and for 
fourmember families over 208690 
on the other hand as many as 4 million with taxable incomes 
between 78400 and 208690 fourmember families or between 
47050 and 97672 singles would get tax cuts because their 33 
percent top rate would drop to 31 percent analysts note that most 
members of congress fall into that income range 
however those tax cuts could be illusory in addition to losing 
their exemptions as income rises those taxpayers would have to 
give up part of their itemized deductions when their income before 
subtracting exemptions and deductions tops the 100000 mark 
this same group of taxpayers would get the bills only tax break 
for capital gains a limited cut on profits from the sale of 
investments that is far less than president bush wants the bill 
would prevent anyone from paying a capital gains rate above 28 
percent which would cut taxes on those who now pay a 33 percent 
rate 
the bill would raise the 9centagallon gasoline tax and the 
15cent diesel tax by 5 cents 
the 16cent cigarette tax would rise to 20 cents on jan 1 and 
to 24 cents two years later taxes on snuff cigars and other 
tobacco would go up by 25 percent in each of those years 
the 16cent levy on a sixpack of beer would double negotiators 
are deciding whether to raise the tax on liquor now 1250 for a 
gallon of 100proof to 1370 or 14 taxes on wines which vary 
according to alcohol content would go up the 3cent levy on a 
750milliliter bottle of table wine for example would rise to 21 
or 25 cents 
airline passengers would pay 6 more on an average 300mile 
roundtrip ticket the current 8 percent tax would rise to 10 
percent 
a new tax would take 10 percent of the price of certain 
expensive luxuries cars boats planes jewels and furs for 
example the tax would apply only to that portion of the price of 
cars exceeding 30000 and jewelry over 5000 
the 145 percent tax that finances basic medicare coverage would 
cost higherincome workers and their employers more it now applies 
only to the first 51300 earned each year the bill would raise it 
to 125000 or 130000 
a worker earning 85000 a year for example would pay 1233 
or 489 more than present law a 50000 earner would pay no more 
the tax is matched by the employer

research with mice at yale university may lead 
to a vaccine to protect humans from lyme disease and perhaps even 
syphilis said a study published today 
yale scientists reported in the journal science that they found 
a laboratory mouse that can be infected with the lyme disease 
spirochete bacteria and then used genetic engineering techniques to 
make a vaccine that protects the animal against the disease 
the work could point the way to vaccines for humans said 
richard a flavell leader of the yale team but that is several 
years away 
its very likely that well be able to get a good lyme vaccine 
for humans from this technique he said if it works on this 
disease then it may be used to develop vaccines against other 
diseases with spirochetes such as syphilis 
a harvard researcher however said the success of a lyme 
disease vaccine even for mice cannot be proven until the immunity 
is tested against disease in the way it is naturally spread 
through a tick bite 
david h persing of the harvard school of public health said the 
saliva of lyme diseaseinfected ticks also contains substances that 
depress some immune functions a vaccine would be proven he said 
only when it is shown to give protection against the effects of 
these substances also 
lyme disease was first identified in 1975 and named for the 
connecticut town where a yale study was conducted the disease is 
spread by a small deer tick that passes along the spirochete when 
it sucks blood from a victim 
the disease can cause heart problems arthritislike joint pain 
skin rash and even brain disorders diagnosed early it can be 
successfully treated with antibiotics 
flavell said that to develop the vaccine the yale scientists 
first had to find a special inbred strain of laboratory mice able 
to contract lyme disease 
stephen w barthold a yale veterinary scientist tested many 
strains before he found that a mouse called c3hhe could be 
infected with the lyme disease spirochete and develop symptoms 
within five days 
to make the vaccine the researchers cloned a gene for a 
protein called ospa that is on the surface of the lyme 
spirochete 
the gene was then spliced into a common laboratory bacteria 
which in turn produced the ospa protein 
a purified form of ospa was injected into a group of mice and 
tests showed that the rodents developed antibodies to the protein 
inoculated mice then were challenged with lyme disease by 
injecting them with the lyme spirochete 
mice that received shots of ospa protein did not get lyme 
disease antibodies made by the mouse immune system in response to 
the ospa protein were able to keep the bacteria in check other 
mice that had not received the ospa shots developed the lyme 
symptoms 
dr erol fikrig a member of the yale team said the study 
required use injected bacteria because the researchers had to know 
exactly how much spirochete each mouse received using a tick to 
spread the disease he said would be highly variable and could 
not be reproduced precisely 
fikrig acknowledged that laboratory work is not a true test of 
vaccine effectiveness against the tickborn disease 
in nature things could be different and further studies on 
that will have to be done he said 
the importance of the study he said is that some immune 
protection was demonstrated against a spirochete bacteria 
the fact that we can make a vaccine against this organism is 
certainly encouraging that vaccines against other spirochete 
illnesses can be developed as well and that includes syphilis 
said fikrig 
flavell said it will take five to eight years of additional 
laboratory work before the candidate lyme disease vaccine can be 
tried experimentally on humans 
science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

a new 25 billion program of grants to the 
states is emerging as the centerpiece of major childcare 
legislation nearing enactment in congress 
key house and senate sponsors said their agreement on the 
program would break a monthslong deadlock over childcare 
assistance 
differences remain over additional related elements including 
an expansion of tax credits for lowincome families but 
congressional sponsors said those differences would be resolved 
with the pending deficitreduction tax package and would not hamper 
the grant program 
the senate passed a version of the bill more than a year ago 
and the house approved a more ambitious measure earlier this year 
but the issue has been stalled in conference panels for months 
sen christopher dodd dconn told reporters thursday that 
final negotiations had gained the support of house leaders for the 
childcare agreement he worked out with administration officials 
earlier this month 
im confident whatever the budget reconciliation bill looks 
like child care will be a part of it dodd said 
the agreement calls for establishment of a program of block 
grants to the states to provide direct assistance to lowincome 
families for childcare and support to schools and community 
agencies that provide child care 
details of a roughly 13 billion expansion of the earned income 
tax credit sought by congressional tax writers remain to be worked 
out the money would go to lowincome working families with 
children but it would not be tied to child care expenses 
dodd said the credit expansion was intended primarily to make 
the total package of tax increases in the budget bill more 
progressive 
rep tom downey dny a sponsor of the houses childcare 
bill balked last week after dodd agreed with the white house on 
the grant program and the senate quickly incorporated it into its 
version of a deficitreduction package 
downey said thursday he now will go along with the grants but is 
trying to add a program of childcare assistance for poor families 
under the social security act 
the price tag on that would be an additional 15 billion over 
five years downey and dodd said the money could come from scaling 
back the tax credit 
the grant program would carry a 25 billion authorization over 
three years and dodd said he expected it to reach 5 billion in 
five years a portion 180 million of the 750 million firstyear 
total would go to early childhood education and latchkey 
afterschool care based in schools or run by community groups 
the long holdup in final congressional approval and the scaling 
back of the package from earlier versions drew criticism from 
members of the congressional caucus for womens issues they also 
complained that no women were included in two conference committees 
that considered the bill 
minuscule rep mary rose oakar dohio said of the 
legislation its about a quarter loaf compared to what the 
house passed 
well take whatever it is and build on it next year said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
on other domestic legislation thursday 
the house approved by voice vote a compromise 574 billion 
housing bill it would restructure housing programs shore up the 
financially troubled federal housing administration and extend the 
life of lowinterest mortgage programs 
the bill authorizes 275 billion this fiscal year a 63 percent 
increase over the previous years appropriations and 33 billion 
over what would be required to maintain current policies it 
provides 299 billion in fiscal 1992 
the fha overhaul will assess a new annual premium on borrowers 
of fhabacked loans that would increase minimum upfront closing 
costs for example the buyer of a 65000 home would need 3639 
in cash about 800 more than the current average requirement 
the house rejected for a second time a bill that would permit 
taxpayerfinanced abortions in the district of columbia the bill 
was identical to the appropriations bill for washingtons city 
government that the house rejected 211185 last saturday this 
time the vote to reject was 211195 
rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the dc appropriations 
subcommittee said he would return the bill to a housesenate 
conference and delete the expanded abortion provisions the bill 
would permit the city government to use locally raised taxes for 
abortions and would permit use of federal money for abortions for 
poor women in cases of rape or incest 
a 182 billion spending bill for the labor education and 
health and human services departments was held up by unrelated 
senate amendments the bill which would increase spending by 22 
billion over last years levels is the largest domestic 
appropriations bill 
a 78 billion spending bill for the veterans affairs and 
housing and urban development departments and independent agencies 
was approved by the senate and sent back to the house with 
amendments it includes 14 billion for the national aeronautics 
and space administration whose 14 percent increase was the largest 
of any agency in the bill

doctors who transplanted part of a womans 
lung into her dying daughter said the procedure believed to be a 
first in this country greatly reduces the chances of transplant 
rejection 
the girl 12 and her mother 46 whose names were withheld at 
the familys request were reported in good condition after their 
operations thursday at stanford university medical center 
the mother was a far closer tissue match than could have been 
expected from an unrelated donor said dr vaughn starnes who 
heads the medical centers heartlung transplant team 
kidneys and a portion of a liver have been transplanted from 
living donors but all lung transplants in this country have 
previously involved braindead donors stanford officials said 
people have survived removal of a disease lung 
starnes said that the mother and child matched on four of six 
genetic markers or tissue antigens compared with no more than two 
such matches in previous lung and heart transplants involving 
braindead donors 
he said transplants from related live donors are particularly 
important for children because youngsters have a higher rate of 
rejection than adults 
half of 14 children who have received heartlung transplants at 
stanford suffered rejection severe enough to impair lung function 
thats nearly twice the rejection rate of the 71 adults who have 
undergone the same operation at the medical center 
these children have so much trouble with rejection that the 
transplant almost isnt worth it with an unrelated donor said 
marguerite brown a nurse who coordinates stanfords donor program 
during thursdays surgery doctors removed the upper onethird 
of the mothers right lung and transplanted it in the childs chest 
in place of her right lung 
the girl suffers from a rare malady called bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia that causes scarring and high blood pressure of the 
lungs 
the child was already experiencing difficulty breathing and 
required home oxygen and therefore was going to sustain serious 
damage starnes said 
he said the mother should regain almost total function of her 
partial lung the daughter is expected to be able to fully use the 
transplanted lung which will likely increase in capacity and may 
even grow in her body 
both mother and daughter are expected to resume normal 
activity within a few months starnes said 
stanford doctors expect the girl to remain hospitalized for 
several weeks the mother probably will go home earlier

officials of the national institute on drug 
abuse are trying to find out why drug testing by a 
governmentcertified laboratory in north carolina incorrectly 
identified five people as using illegal methamphetamines 
in each case the labs confirmatory tests confused the 
stimulant drug with high doses of overthecounter cold medications 
containing ephedrine and other stimulants said dr joseph autry 
director of applied research at the government institute 
this is one type of test in one lab for one drug and its 
the only time a false positive has happened in a nidacertified 
lab autry said were taking it very seriously 
the case that brought the problem to the governments attention 
was that of a truck driver who was removed from his job last july 
despite his vehement denials that he was falsely accused officials 
said 
officials did not identify him and said his case has resulted in 
litigation he was tested under transportation department 
regulations requiring drug testing of employees in 
departmentregulated industries this testing must be done by one 
of the 57 labs certified by the institute 
the laboratory that conducted the tests was suspended last week 
while institute officials try to determine whether the problem was 
with the labs testing or was inherent in the testing procedure 
itself autry said 
the testing problem could have broad repercussions such as if 
the case were used by critics to try to block drug testing 
altogether he said 
the lab was identified in the federal register as roche 
biomedical laboratories of research triangle park nc company 
officials did not return a telephone call for comment thursday 
in the case of the truck driver his vehement denial of 
methamphetamine use prompted more confirmatory testing by the lab 
this further testing showed the previous result to have been 
incorrect 
when institute officials learned of the false positive they 
checked the seven other samples that had tested positive for 
methamphetamines by roche in recent months and found five were 
negative officials said 
nida officials alerted the 56 other laboratories the institute 
has certified for drug testing and found that eight were using the 
same methamphetamine test roche was about 100 samples tested by 
these labs had come out positive and all are being rechecked 
autry said he expected results in about two weeks 
the testing procedure being questioned is used to confirm the 
presence of methamphetamines several other methods also are used 
and no false positives have been discovered with any of those 
autry said 
he said he did not know how many private testing laboratories 
may be using the method roche was using 
transportation department testing regulations require that a 
worker who tests positive for methamphetamines amphetamines pcp 
opiates marijuana or cocaine be removed from a safetysensitive 
job 
but if the finding is reversed regulations do not require that 
the worker be reinstated they only prevent the employer from 
refusing to reinstate the worker on the basis of the inaccurate 
test

republicans enlisted bart simpson without his 
permission chevy chase added 50000 to dianne feinsteins 
campaign and angela lansbury was lambasted for what critics called 
distortions she wrote 
its lights camera and political action in hollywood where a 
few golden words from a celebrity can speak decibels louder than 
dozens of stump speeches by politicians 
movie and television stars are getting behind gubernatorial 
candidates from both parties as well as big green a sweeping 
state environmental initiative 
there are many entertainers who by their past work have become 
trusted by the public and for them to research and then support an 
issue like big green helps us spread the word said initiative 
spokesman duane peterson 
as the political freeforall nears its nov 6 election day 
conclusion one cartoon celebrity found himself backing a cause he 
didnt embrace and a highly regarded tv star opposed a pair of 
measures she didnt fully understand 
bart simpson the animated underachiever of tvs the 
simpsons was quoted at length in a republican news release about 
democrat feinsteins use of crib notes during a debate against us 
sen pete wilson 
if youre gonna use cheat sheets man use em right bart 
was quoted as saying he even offered this advice the best is 
taping the notes in your shoe dude 
the fox broadcasting co which broadcasts the simpsons 
never gave permission to use the character or his words but barts 
creator cartoonist matt groening shrugged it all off 
that doesnt surprise me said groening republicans think 
they own everything anyway 
television commercials by miss lansbury star of cbs murder 
she wrote opposing a pair of intiatives that would limit terms 
for most state officials went on the air tuesday and drew harsh 
criticism from supporters 
lewis uhler a primary author of one bill labeled the tv spots 
distortions she wrote 
the actress did not know the commercials were paid for by state 
legislators and did not fully understand other provisions of the 
bills said her son and agent david shaw 
proponents of the uhlerwritten bill said the commercials 
incorrectly suggest that the measure would require public funding 
of campaigns 
she doesnt really read newspapers shaw said adding that 
his mother does oppose term limits and would not seek to have the 
ads pulled 
station kcbstv said thursday is planned to pull the ads until a 
dispute over truth in advertising was resolved ads typically must 
include a mention of who paid for them 
feinstein got a boost from comedy actor chase with his 50000 
donation he also performed at an event that featured henry mancini 
and michael tucker and jill eikenberry of la law

wilson got his share of celebrity support at an october fundraiser 
headlined by first lady barbara bush among the stars on hand were 
chuck norris donald oconnor scott baio phyllis diller efrem 
zimbalist jr and entertainment tonight hostess mary hart 
for sheer star power nothing beat the campaign for big green 
which would affect a wide range of environmental issues including 
toxic dumping offshore oil drilling and trash recycling 
the campaign is cosponsored by assemblyman tom hayden of santa 
monica and state attorney general john van de kamp who lost to 
feinstein in the democratic primary 
celebrity supporters include jane fonda meryl streep robin 
williams bette midler goldie hawn cher olivia newtonjohn and 
ted danson 
this is not a point of view danson said im not 
comparing environmental issues to other issues 
the environment just pretty much is its rocks are hard 
water is wet you may agree or disagree but it has nothing to do 
with the reality of whats happening acid rain is not a point of 
view dirty harbors are not a point of view its reality

the 1990 farm bill an omnibus measure that 
could reshape american agriculture is headed to president bush 
who is expected to sign it 
the senate approved the bill 6036 thursday two days after 
318102 passage in the house 
bush administration officials who worked with congress in 
devising the package have said the president would be satisfied 
with the fiveyear 408 billion measure the bill sets policy for 
virtually every operation in the agriculture department 
it establishes new environmental rules for farmers sets the 
governments nutrition programs including food stamps determines 
trade policy for food products and sets the governments support 
programs for commodities 
opposition to the bill came from senators who feared for farmers 
in their states if a 15 percent reduction in subsidized acreage in 
the measure goes into effect 
the change in support hinges on congress passing a 136 billion 
spending cut for agriculture over the next five years 
sen thomas daschle dsd who voted against the bill said 
the change in the subsidy program amounts to a slow economic 
death sentence for the nations family farmers 
sen max baucus dmont said it threatens the livelihood of 
one out of every three farmers 
i dont think the senators know what they will be doing to 
american farmers if this bill becomes law baucus said next 
year we must make improvements in the farm program 
but sen richard lugar rind the ranking republican on the 
senate agriculture committee said debate over farm bills often 
includes forecasts of dire consequences for farmers 
predictions for the last two farm bills were egregiously off 
the mark lugar said he said farm income need not fall simply 
because subsidized acreage is reduced 
lugar said target prices have been frozen and loan rates in some 
areas raised he said farmers would be able to use the 15 percent 
of the acreage being taken off government subsidized crops to plant 
according to consumer demand 
american farmers will determine their income by the expertise 
they have he said 
throughout debate on the bill senate agriculture committee 
chairman patrick leahy dvt emphasized its environmental 
provisions he called it one of the most important environmental 
laws passed by this congress 
he blamed freewheeling spending policies of the reaganbush 
administrations for the need to cut farm subsidies 
if wed had more of this reality over the last 10 years we 
wouldnt have the deficit we have today leahy said 
the legislations environmental measures would 
allow farmers to drain wetlands for farming without net loss of 
important wildlife habitats by selling the federal government a 
conservation easement on their property that can be restored to 
wetland status 
create an incentive program to help farmers prevent 
contamination of ground and surface water on 10 million acres of 
land 
require the agriculture department to help farmers meet state 
and federal environmental standards 
require farmers to keep records of hazardous pesticide use and 
authorize the first effort to assess the threat of global climate 
change on agriculture 
the conference committee dropped a provision in the original 
senate bill that would have prohibited export sales of pesticides 
banned or unregistered in the united states chemical companies 
said it would cause grave economic damage but leahy said he would 
reintroduce the measure next year 
the bill also 
establishes a program to protect 25 million acres of private 
forestland 
creates national standards for organic farming 
creates a rural development administration within usda to help 
communities recover economically from the loss of farms 
sets up a satellite program for rural hospitals and schools to 
receive information from urban areas 
establishes a matching fund program for rural businesses 
authorizes increased funds for existing water and sewer 
programs in rural communities to improve drinking water and waste 
disposal 
freezes target prices on wheat at 4 a bushel corn 275 a 
bushel grain sorghum 261 a bushel barley 236 a bushel oats 
145 a bushel cotton 73 cents a pound rice 1071 per hundred 
pounds 
sets an 18 cent loan rate on sugar 
freezes government dairy prices at 1010 per hundred pounds 
but requires the agriculture secretary to report to congress on 
other options for the dairy program by aug 31 1991 an assessment 
will be levied on dairy producers if government surpluses exceed 7 
billion pounds 
sets a 502 a bushel loan rate on soybeans with a 2 percent 
service charge

democrat david walters is billing himself 
as a political outsider while republican opponent bill price is 
emphasizing his crimefighting credentials in a bitter governors 
race in oklahoma 
price is suing walters for libel walters is accusing price of 
trying to buy the election and the republican is emphasizing 
walters ties to massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
president bush flies to oklahoma on monday to campaign for price 
and vice president dan quayle was in oklahoma on oct 9 on a 
fundraising mission for the republican 
for walters a victory would be a comeback the 38yearold 
businessman became mired in a long legal battle over a questionable 
162500 campaign loan in 1986 when he won the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination he lost in the general election four 
years ago to republican henry bellmon who is retiring 
price 42 is making his first political race but he was a 
highprofile federal prosecutor in the early 1980s heading an 
investigation into a county commissioner kickback scandal in 
oklahoma in which some 240 people were convicted 
walters as he did in 1986 is offering himself as a political 
outsider who can bring a new approach to government 
price has portrayed walters as a liberal in a conservative 
state walters was the oklahoma chairman of dukakis presidential 
campaign 
walters is the person who tried to ram michael dukakis down 
the throats of oklahomans says one price radio ad 
the reduced office rental rate which walters gave dukakis is the 
subject of a federal election complaint filed by the state gop 
chairman 
the waltersprice race is the most expensive political campaign 
in oklahoma history 
walters is expected to spend more than 2 million and price 
upwards of 18 million the bill for the governors race counting 
losing candidates in the primaries is expected to be about 8 
million more than double the amount spent four years ago the 
walters campaign collected 600000 at a fundraiser this week 
walters has accused price of trying to buy the election by 
putting 435000 of his own money into the race 
walters alleged this month that price was involved in price 
gouging on oil taken from land held in a family trust price 
according to walters was among a group of people fined 174 
million for oil overcharges price denied the accusations and filed 
a libel suit against walters and a campaign consultant 
bill price can dish it out but he cant take it walters 
told price on a radio broadcast this month 
you have a total disregard for the truth price snapped 
the clashes over campaign financing political affiliations and 
business practices have obscured issues such as education and 
taxes 
the two candidates differ on repeal of a 223 million school 
reform and tax bill enacted earlier this year with bellmons 
backing walters opposes repeal saying that would cause too many 
problems for schools and hurt the states image nationally 
price says the threat of repeal through an initiative petition 
is the only way to force the legislature to enact what he views as 
needed education reforms such as an open transfer policy for 
students and merit pay for teachers 
there has been no publicly released independent polling data on 
the governors race walters is considered the frontrunner mainly 
because democrats outnumber republicans by a 2to1 ratio in 
oklahoma also price was embroiled in an unusually heated gop 
primary price had to rally from a secondplace showing in the 
primary in order to upend businessman vince orza in a runoff 
election

congress is taking final action on a 1991 
defense bill that slashes president bushs budget request for the 
strategic defense initiative and barely keeps alive the b2 stealth 
bomber program 
the senate was expected to approve companion military spending 
and authorization bills today 
the spending bill totals 268 billion a cut of 19 billion from 
bushs initial proposal in january 
among the provisions in the bills are a nearly 2 billion cut in 
the presidents 47 billion request for the antimissile sdi 
program a reduction in funds for the b2 bomber that keeps the 
program alive for at least one more year and sharp cuts in money 
for landbased nuclear missiles 
the bill also provides money for the v22 osprey the tiltrotor 
aircraft that defense secretary dick cheney has tried to cancel for 
two years 
the house on thursday gave voicevote approval to the spending 
bill which largely tracks the authorization bill but diverges from 
that blueprint on several issues 
the spending plan calls for a troop cut of 78500 from the 
21millionmember active force just over 900 million for the 
milstar communications satellite and fullscale development of the 
advanced tactical fighter 
bush requested 283 million for fullscale development and 763 
million to complete the demonstration and validation phase of the 
prototype aircraft 
the defense blueprint provides 964 million for the program but 
prohibits fullscale development in the current fiscal year which 
began oct 1 
the authorization bill emphasizes the need for the air force to 
finish demonstrating several technologies including aerodynamic 
performance low observability and engine capability before 
beginning fullscale development of the new fighter 
the pentagon plans to begin buying the first of 750 planes 
intended to replace the air forces f15 in 1996 
the spending bill concurs with the administrations request on 
the fighter as well as its proposal for the sramt a tactical 
nuclear weapon 
the authorization measure reduces us troop levels by 100000 
but bowing to pressure from the pentagon gives the defense 
secretary added authority to limit the troop cut to 80000 if he 
believes the us military buildup in the persian gulf warrants 
such a step 
the authorization bill also provides 600 million for milstar 
but again responding to pentagon demands permits cheney to 
transfer money from other accounts for the program

truck drivers pressmen and hundreds of other 
union workers for the daily news went on strike thursday night 
after months of bickering erupted in violence over a worker sitting 
down on the job 
news management published a friday edition relief drivers 
trucked the first copies out of the papers garden city ny 
plant early friday past 200 to 300 picketing strikers police said 
five picketers there were arrested 
within an hour six trucks accompanied by 25 police officers in 
riot gear carried papers out of the news kearny nj plant the 
vehicles windows were covered with duct tape to protect them 
against rocks thrown by the crowd of 200 strikers 
a short time later three trucks surrounded by 100 police 
officers rolled past jeering protesters outside the news printing 
plant in the city borough of brooklyn 
strikers there pelted buses carrying replacement workers with 
bottles rocks and eggs breaking some windows a fireworksstyle 
explosive was set off underneath one bus police reported two 
arrests 
michael alvino president of the drivers union got cheers from 
his membership when he announced the strike 
seven of the newspapers 10 unions followed the drivers lead 
said george mcdonald head of the allied printing trades council 
the umbrella group for the unions a ninth union the newspaper 
guild said it would honor the picket lines 
the 10th union for typographical workers had said it would not 
strike because it has lifetime guaranteed jobs for its 200 members 
about 1800 workers went on strike the newspaper guild whose 
members planned to meet friday has about 800 members 
picket lines were set up at the newspapers manhattan building 
and outside its three printing plants 
about 2 am friday three to four hours later than usual the 
first copies of fridays edition were trucked out of the garden 
city plant said a news management source who spoke on condition 
that his name not be used 
the source could not say how many copies would be printed the 
papers usual weekday circulation is 118 million 
the trucks have been in and out the papers are getting out 
lt william fitzpatrick of the garden city police confirmed he 
said five of 200 to 300 picketers were arrested mostly on 
disorderly conduct charges he reported no serious injuries 
two people were charged with disorderly conduct at the brooklyn 
plant police said one threw a rock at a bus carrying replacement 
workers but missed and hit a police officer details of the second 
charge were not immediately available 
it is indeed unfortunate that a strike was provoked by these 
unions against the daily news at a time when we were involved in 
the collective bargaining process to resolve our differences 
said john sloan the newspapers vice president for labor 
relations 
the strike comes more than six months after the expiration of 
contracts between the daily news and its 10 unions months marked 
by bitter exchanges but stalemated negotiations 
the strike followed a walkout early thursday at the brooklyn 
printing plant in a dispute over a union workers right to do his 
job sitting down a bus carrying replacement workers at the plant 
was attacked by about 200 employees with sticks smashing its 
windshield police cited two workers 
following the attack labor accused management of a lockout 
a coalition of the newspapers 10 unions met thursday afternoon 
then sent leaders to a meeting with management at the daily news 
headquarters they emerged 50 minutes later shaken 
the daily news is the nations second largest metropolitan daily 
and has 3500 employees but during the past decade it has lost 
about 115 million and seen daily circulation slip by about 
700000 
the daily news has been caught in one of the nations fiercest 
newspaper wars and analysts have questioned whether the city can 
support three tabloids and the new york times 
the new york post and new york newsday planned to increase press 
runs 
the daily news managers say they need to end labor abuses have 
the ability to set staff sizes and save 50 million to 70 million 
annually 
the unions say the newspaper is trying to break them and they 
have called for an advertisers boycott 
the workers walked out early thursday after their business 
agent seymour goldstein was ejected from the plant by management 
according to george mcdonald president of the allied printing 
trades council a union umbrella group 
its indeed unfortunate no 1 that the drivers union has 
struck the daily news when we are in the process of collective 
bargaining and no 2 its indeed unfortunate that they resorted 
to unruly and violent behavior responded sloan 
sloan said about 800000 copies of thursdays news had been 
printed 
the crisis apparently began when goldstein became involved in a 
dispute involving a drivers union member who was working while 
sitting down 
mcdonald said the mans job did not involve driving but 
required him to make sure newspapers properly came off of a 
conveyor belt that he was on light duty because of a 
disability and that many healthy workers normally sit and read 
magazines while doing the job 
when supervisors told the man to work standing goldstein said 
he appealed to me i told him to sit down they gave me two 
choices leave or be escorted out they escorted me out 
when goldstein went out so did the drivers mcdonald said 
sloan said goldstein was expelled for countermanding a direct 
order from the supervisor as far as we are concerned whether the 
employee is disabled is not the issue here the employee was 
suspended 
the bus carrying replacement workers arrived little more than 
half an hour later 
this was an organized plan to lock us out goldstein said 
security is under orders to not let us in 
two men were given tickets for criminal offenses one for 
allegedly inciting workers to do further damage the other for 
letting the air out of delivery truck tires neither was held 
other news employees were seen draining radiators on delivery 
trucks and police later said the radiators of 40 trucks were 
punctured firefighters put out a small fire in the back of a 
delivery truck and another truck was gutted by fire 
angry employees also blocked the street with about 20 delivery 
trucks

retired supreme court justice lewis f powell 
says he probably made a mistake in casting the pivotal vote in 
a 1986 decision that denied the right of privacy to consenting 
homosexuals 
but he still regards the decision upholding georgias 
antisodomy law as one of little or no importance because no 
one actually had been prosecuted for homosexual conduct powell 
said 
his current views on the matter were revealed during a 
questionandanswer session after a lecture the retired justice 
delivered at new york university school of law on oct 18 
according to the national law journal powell told the law 
students i think i probably made a mistake in that one when 
asked about the 54 ruling in 1986 
in a report to be published monday the legal newspaper quotes 
powell as saying in an interview that he now believes sodomy 
decision conflicts with the courts approach to privacy rights in 
its 1973 roe vs wade decision which legalized abortion powell 
voted with the majority in that ruling 
i do think the 1986 decision was inconsistent in a general 
way with roe powell told the newspaper when i had the 
opportunity to reread the opinion a few months later i thought 
the dissent had the better of the argument 
powell told the associated press on thursday he stands by the 
statement he made to the national law journal but he said he is 
surprised his reevaluation of the 1986 ruling is considered 
newsworthy 
i thought it was a frivolous case powell said i still 
think it was a frivolous case but perhaps on more reflection i 
could have reached a different result 
the 1986 ruling was one of the most publicized and controversial 
high court rulings of that term the washington post later reported 
that powell originally planned to vote to strike down georgias ban 
on sodomy 
the newspaper quoting anonymous sources said powell voted at a 
private conference of the nine justices to strike down the georgia 
law such votes are tentative and justices may change their minds 
before the decisions are announced 
justice byron r white who wrote the courts majority opinion 
in the 1986 case said the proposition that any kind of private 
sexual conduct between consenting adults is constitutionally 
insulated from state proscription is unsupportable 
the decision has been bitterly denounced by gay rights groups 
the courts interpretation of the scope of privacy rights 
remains one of the hottest issues confronting the justices 
especially in the area of abortion the court has held that 
americans have a fundamental privacy right to marry have children 
and practice birth control 
the georgia law was challenged by michael hardwick an atlanta 
bartender and homosexual who was arrested in 1982 for allegedly 
committing sodomy in his home prosecutors later dropped the 
charge which carries a maximum 20year prison penalty upon 
conviction 
the case reached the supreme court after hardwick sued georgia 
officials to have the law declared unconstitutional 
in atlanta the atlanta gay alliance said it understood hardwick 
had moved to key west fla there was no telephone listed for him 
there

a scientist who pioneered utahs cold 
fusion research and dropped out of contact before skipping a state 
oversight committee meeting belatedly agreed to meet with the panel 
early next month 
members of the fusion energy advisory council on thursday voted 
to try to force electrochemist b stanley pons to appear for the 
nov 7 review minutes later pons agreed in a telephone call to 
show up 
i told him he was wanted that it was necessary chief 
deputy attorney general joe tesch told the council stan pons 
committed he would be here on nov 7 
the telephone call arranged by pons attorney appeared to ease 
the panels irritation with pons and british colleague martin 
fleischmann for missing the meeting and being virtually 
unreachable except through their lawyer 
we are perfectly willing to fund the work but we do expect 
accountability said raymond hixson council chairman we must 
know what we are getting for the money 
the advisory council oversees the states interest in the 
research the legislature appropriated 5 million following the 
electrochemists march 1989 announcement that they had achieved a 
fusion reaction in a tabletop experiment at room temperature 
if true the achievement could prove a cheap solution to energy 
sources but most scientists remain skeptical fritz will director 
of the national cold fusion institute told the panel in an 
overview of the institutes research 
will said dozens of scientists around the world have reported 
achieving similar results he said experiments continue to produce 
excess heat and other nuclear fusion indicators 
he declined to discuss the specific experiments being done by 
pons and fleischmann 
fusion is the process that powers the sun stars and hydrogen 
bombs it is achieved when atomic paticles fuse and release large 
amounts of energy the process usually requires millions of degrees 
of heat to get started 
the panels unanimous decision to ask university of utah 
president chase peterson to apply pressure on pons to attend a 
review grew out of its frustration with his unexplained absence 
the pairs attorney c gary triggs told tesch the researchers 
were reluctant to appear thursday because of a patent application 
they were preparing 
hixson said that argument was faulty because the state will own 
any patents produced from the work and panel members are sworn to 
secrecy 
fleischmann reached at his home in tisbury england said he 
had not learned of the council meeting until a journalist told him 
late wednesday 
will said he had faxed a notice to fleischmann more than a week 
ago and later telephoned the scientists office only to be told he 
was unavailable 
we have attempted to have the two present during an external 
review in october we have abundantly explained they have 
categorically refused will said before the meeting 
triggs said pons and fleischmann had explained they would be out 
of the country during october 
the attorney would not say where pons had gone although the 
teacher of his young son said wednesday the family had told her 
they would be in france for a year or two 
pons has applied for a oneyear sabbatical peterson said the 
request would be handled by the chemistry department whcih pons 
once chaired 
besides the scientific review the institute is scrambling for 
renewed funding an audit was completed recently but state auditor 
tom allen said he would not disclose its recommendations until the 
institute has responded

the senate ethics committee says it has 
arranged for an outside investigation of unauthorized disclosures 
after news leaks from its probe of five senators linked to a failed 
savings and loan 
the panel after a lengthy closed meeting thursday also labeled 
as false a report saying it was considering giving charles h 
keating jr who headed failed lincoln savings amp loan association 
an assurance that information he gives to congress will not be used 
against him 
the committee has at no time discussed or considered granting 
immunity to charles keating jr the panel said reports to the 
contrary are incorrect 
the los angeles times quoted unidentified committee sources in a 
thursday report that said ethics committee members were weighing a 
guarantee known as limited immunity for keating the times 
national editor norman miller said thursday the newspaper stood 
by its story 
we believe our sources are accurate miller said it may 
be theres some technical difference that could account for their 
statement but were confident we were given a correct story 
a grant of limited immunity for a defendant appearing before 
congress could jeopardize a criminal prosecution this kind of 
immunity means a prosecutor can make no use of the testimony 
the committee is investigating whether the socalled keating 
five senators violated ethics rules in interceding with federal 
regulators on behalf of lincoln savings hearings are scheduled to 
begin nov 15 
sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini dariz donald 
w riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio and john mccain 
rariz received a total of 13 million in campaign 
contributions or donations to favored causes from keating former 
chairman of phoenixbased american continental corp lincolns 
parent company 
all five have denied any connection between keatings money and 
their help for the irvine califbased thrift which was seized by 
the us government in april 1989 at a potential cost to taxpayers 
of more than 2 billion 
if the committee eventually decides senate rules were broken it 
could recommend that the full senate impose severe sanctions such 
as a censure or expulsion or it could administer a mild punishment 
itself such as a letter of rebuke 
in a statement signed by sen howell heflin dala the 
chairman and vicechairman warren rudman rnh the panel said 
thursday it appears some committee sensitive documents have 
been disclosed to the press 
some of these press articles have contained a number of 
inaccuracies distortions and misstatements it said because 
some of these disclosures may have come from the committee itself 
we concluded that an outside organization would be best able to 
conduct an independent and impartial inquiry into this matter 
the panel said it asked the general accounting office an 
investigative arm of congress to conduct the probe 
the committee will not speculate upon motives the statement 
said but does observe that such conduct discredits the 
individuals responsible and violates the committees rules 
keating 66 and the three associates face 42 counts of 
securities fraud related to the sale of 200 million in bonds by 
lincolns southern california branches to thousands of investors 
lincoln collapsed in april 1989 rendering the bonds worthless 
bailing out lincoln could cost taxpayers 2 billion regulators 
have said 
keating is free on 300000 bail trial in superior court in los 
angeles is set to begin on nov 26 
documents recently obtained by the associated press and others 
indicate that cranston deconcini and riegle had more extensive 
relationships with keating than they previously acknowledged 
for example the documents show that cranston wrote keating to 
thank him for a 250000 contribution to a cranstonbacked voter 
registration project and at the same time expressed his pleasure 
that keating met with the top thrift regulator to plead his case 
about lincoln

resignations charges of influence 
peddling and infighting are damaging the image of president 
fernando collor de mellos 7monthold conservative government 
the government retains its authority but its credibility has 
been substantially weakened said prominent sociologist helio 
jaguaribe collor must take action soon to control the damage 
the charges are especially harmful because collor promised to 
build a new brazil with morality and austerity as its 
foundations waging a painful war on inflation 
even though the president has not been directly implicated in 
any alleged wrongdoing his image appears to have suffered 
on wednesday collor addressed the subject for the first time 
during a fiveday visit to portugal saying he would dismiss any 
government official who sacrificed the ideas that are taking us 
forward 
the president reportedly called a monday cabinet meeting to 
discuss the situation 
collors administration has been shaken in recent weeks by a 
series of wellpublicized events among the most damaging 
on oct 19 luis octavio da motta veiga head of the huge state 
oil monopoly petrobras was forced to step down he said the cause 
was his refusal to approve a 40 million loan to a sao paulo 
businessman despite pressure from collors friend and power broker 
paulo cesar farias 
presidential spokesman claudio humberto rosa e silva said motta 
veiga was fired due to incompetence and insubordination motta 
veiga said he would not reply to a circus helper 
justice minister bernardo cabral resigned in early october 
after the press revealed he was having an affair with economy 
minister zelia cardoso de mello cabral accused rosa e silva of 
plotting behind his back and calling the press spokesman 
worthless 
the media observed that cabrals resignation broke an earlier 
pledge by collor that all his ministers would serve until his term 
expired in 1994 
despite official denials the economy ministers job is also 
rumored to be in jeopardy due to the romantic scandal and slow 
progress in bringing inflation down from its current monthly level 
of more than 12 percent 
eduardo cardoso a brasilia businessman and also a friend of 
collor recently received a large loan with generous terms from the 
caixa economica federal the government savings bank some charged 
it was granted on political grounds 
so far negative fallout from the events and rumors seems 
largely limited to the small middle class and the 
universityeducated elite most observers say brazils poor 
majority are far more concerned with breadandbutter issues than 
political intrigue 
but luis eduardo soares a political science professor at rios 
university research institute said political opinion in brazil 
is largely formed by a very small group it is exactly those people 
who have reacted most negatively to all the current noise 
carlos castello branco the countrys most prestigious political 
writer recently noted a growing apprehension about events 
taking place 
the impression being formed is that new brazil is in fact no 
more than a remake of old brazil he wrote in a wednesday 
newspaper column 
jaguaribe said the government was being surrounded by an aura 
of corruption due to a few bad apples 
some analysts say collors difficulties have been exaggerated 
however they note conservatives won major victories in oct 3 
congressional and gubernatorial elections greatly strengthening 
the presidents hand 
too much significance is given to these court skirmishes 
which are really quite usual said political analyst sergio 
abranches

when the israelis jailed palestinian leader 
faisal husseini in 1987 he spent much of his 18 months behind bars 
teaching himself hebrew 
the son of the palestinians most famous war hero used his new 
language to launch a campaign urging israelis to back his peoples 
drive for independent statehood 
on thursday fresh from another spell in jail husseini renewed 
his appeal this time in english and his native arabic 
we are fighting to free our people not to enslave any other 
people he told a crowded news conference in arab east jerusalem 
we are fighting to build our state not to destroy any other 
state 
husseini was arrested oct 8 on suspicion of fomenting riots on 
the temple mount in which jewish worshipers were stoned and israeli 
gunfire killed at least 19 palestinians 
he walked free 17 days later into a new circle of blood as 
he put it a wave of arab attacks on jews and jewish vengeance 
assaults he condemned the bloodshed 
there is no difference for me between the crying of a 
palestinian woman who lost her son or the crying of an israeli 
woman who lost her son husseini said 
husseini denies fomenting the temple mount violence he blames 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs government for creating a sense 
of hopelessness among palestinians by refusing to negotiate peace 
and by settling jews on occupied land that is home to 17 million 
palestinians 
he said israels refusal to accept a un probe of the temple 
mount incident could spur further violence 
if there is no hope if israel decides to be outside 
international legitimacy they are ensuring we will live in a 
jungle husseini said 
israel says such an investigation wold challenge its 
selfproclaimed sovereignty over arab jerusalem 
an outspoken voice for coexistence husseini is recognized by 
both palestinians and israelis as the palestine liberation 
organizations top supporter in jerusalem and the political leader 
of the 34monthold uprising against israeli occupation 
balding asthmatic and not given to rousing oratory 50yearold 
husseini nonetheless arouses strong emotions in both camps 
when his name came up during a televised debate wednesday night 
all four israeli lawmakers on the panel began talking heatedly at 
once 
uzi baram of the opposition labor party argued that husseini 
represented palestinian moderation and that if israel didnt talk 
to him it might end up having to talk to hamas the moslem 
fundamentalist movement 
but uzi landau of the ruling rightwing likud bloc wouldnt hear 
of it the difference between faisal husseini and hamas is 
exactly the same as the difference between saddam hussein and the 
ayatollah khomeini he said 
arab opinion is divided too 
his friend and colleague sari nusseibeh says husseini is a 
natural leader who feels the responsibility to lead 
a recent islamic fundamentalist tract however pounds husseini 
for conducting armchair politics instead of fighting in the 
streets 
such resentment stems partly from husseinis highprofile 
contacts with israelis noteably yael dayan daughter of the late 
israeli war hero moshe dayan they made a joint lecture tour of the 
united states this year 
husseini was a child of revolution 
he was born in baghdad where his father abdul khader husseini 
was hiding from the british army for participating in the 193639 
arab uprising in what is now israel he was 7 when his father died 
leading an assault on israeli troops in the 1948 battle for 
jerusalem 
husseini attended universities in baghdad cairo and beirut but 
never graduated later he joined the palestine liberation army a 
military arm of the plo scattered in the arab world 
husseini thinks his muchrevered father would identify with his 
activities today would understand the shift from the battlefield 
to the international political arena 
i believe he was fighting starting from his love for his 
people for his land not starting from hating others husseini 
said 
the israelis first arrested husseini in 1967 after they captured 
arab jerusalem parts of a gun were found in his house and he 
spent the next year in jail 
in 1987 he was detained without charge for two periods adding up 
to 18 months on wednesday he was freed on personal bail and 
police say inquiries continue

once replaced by a fatter breed of cattle 
the legendary texas longhorn is on the comeback trail in grocery 
stores as americans become more healthconscious cattle raisers 
say 
probably the largest hurdle we have is convincing oldtime 
cattle raisers they need to change bill anthony president of 
the international texas longhorn association said at the groups 
first meeting thursday 
anthony an ardmore okla rancher started raising longhorns 25 
years ago and has fallen in love with the breed 
they are extremely intelligent you can make housepets out 
them if you want 
but its not their intelligence that is putting them back on the 
market 
the bottom line is the longhorn has qualities consumers want 
on their dinner plates and the qualities many ranchers are seeking 
to develop in their livestock said mike moeller deputy state 
agriculture commissioner 
moeller said longhorn beef has 10 percent fat and yields a 
greater percentage of lean beef than any other breed the hardy 
breed had been replaced by fatter stock by the turn of the century 
for cattlemen longhorns are a lowmaintenance genetic gold 
mine 
descended from spanish cattle brought here centuries ago the 
longhorn has adapted to severe climates can forage on poor quality 
grass is resistant to several diseases and produces rich milk 
when bred with other breeds the longhorns cut down on the 
number of calving problems moeller said 
also there is the mystique of raising an animal that helped 
create the cowboy and turn the country into a people of beefeaters 
when you have something that has been for so many years of 
historical greatness its hard not to be fond of texas longhorn 
cattle anthony said 
the first longhorns were sent out of texas to new orleans in the 
1840s a few were driven to missouri later in that decade in the 
1850s longhorns were herded all the way to chicago 
but the civil war intervened and the men who had been driving 
cattle took up arms or sold the cattle they raised to armies from 
both sides 
after the war driving longhorns to railheads in kansas became 
big business 
the texas state historical association estimates that 10 million 
longhorns were driven northward on the chisholm trail during the 
first 25 years after the the civil war 
the longhorn replaced the buffalo as meat for men who were 
building the railroads and helping the population move westward 
the huge buffalo herds had been decimated by too much hunting

a drug newly approved for fighting a painful and 
fertilitythreatening condition among millions of women also may 
help treat premenstrual syndrome benign breast tumors and other 
ailments doctors say 
the drug lupron depot was approved by the federal food and 
drug administration this week for treating endometriosis a 
sometimes painful condition that occurs when tissue lining the womb 
migrates to the abdomen and pelvis if it develops in the ovaries 
or fallopian tubes it can cause blocking scarring and infertility 
lupron depot previously had been approved only for use as a 
prostatecancer medicine but doctors had for years prescribed it 
to women suffering from endometriosis because they knew it worked 
insurance companies however refused to cover its costs 252 
per monthly injection typically administered for six months 
because it did not have approval for that use 
doctors said this weeks ok could also encourage its use in many 
other gynecological applications 
these agents in the same class as lupron depot are clearly 
effective for a number of other diseases such as premenstrual 
syndrome uterine fibroids and polycystic ovary syndrome said 
dr robert l barbieri chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at 
state university of new york at stony brook 
premenstrual syndrome is marked by irritability tension or 
depression in possible combination with breast tenderness fluid 
retention and headaches fibroids by the growth of benign tumors in 
the womb and polycystic ovary syndrome by the growth of cysts in 
the ovaries 
dr edward l marut director of reproductive endocrinology and 
infertility at michael reese hospital and medical center in 
chicago said lupron depot also may be useful in treating benign 
breast tumors 
in combatting endometriosis the drug suppresses production of 
the female hormone estrogen which controls the growth of the 
tissue lining the womb called the endometrium 
an estimated 2 million to 5 million women have endometriosis it 
is mild or symptomfree in some people but in others it can cause 
severe menstrual cramps pain during sexual intercourse painful 
urination or painful bowel movements 
doctors say side effects of lupron depot resemble those of 
menopause including hot flashes but the effects are not permanent 
and may be relieved with other medication 
the main downside of the drug is it does cause a low estrogen 
state and it may cause thinning of vertebral bones barbieri 
said he added that further study will be necessary to determine 
whether the amount of bonethinning is significant 
in essence what were doing is creating a temporary medically 
induced menopause a reversible menopause that in turn stops the 
stimulation of the endometriosis said dr james miller medical 
director at tap pharmaceuticals which manufactures the drug 
barbieri said the only other drug products approved for 
endometriosis treatment are synarel a nasal spray that has a 
similar biological mechanism as lupron depot and costs about the 
same and danazol a derivative of the male hormone testosterone 
that costs about half as much 
synarel has the disadvantage of requiring twice daily doses for 
six months and being poorly absorbed by the body he said danazol 
has the disadvantage of causing women to develop male traits a 
deepening of the voice facial hair oilier skin and upper body 
muscles

readytowear fashions for summer shown recently offered 
splitpersonality alternatives 
will the real paris fashion world please stand up observers at 
last weeks shows are tempted to ask 
on one hand there were unabashed nubile silhouettes molded by 
lycra body stockings with fancy toppers 
on the other paris still opts for fitted chic suits and a new 
line of looser fluid dresses and blousons airy shirtjackets or 
flared tops to keep women of all ages moving in comfort 
lacy lingerie inspirations decolletes hot pants navelbaring 
braandsarong outfits abound 
but for the 1990s theres also a refreshing return to looser 
looks in airy long duster jackets or trapeze coats or newlooking 
billowing party pants in silky turkish style theyre done with 
panache at both givenchy with genteel chic and saint laurent 
with showy glitz 
highlights from the collections offer ideas for everybody 
claude montana turned in an outstanding collection of short 
skimpy mini dresses in full belted coats or modified alines they 
came most often in silk fabrics with hemlines often swooping deep 
in the back 
in white or ivory spangled with silver or in acidic shades of 
pink yellow and green montanas clothes were stunning displays of 
talent 
statesmens teenage daughters rather than their wives will 
now want to dress at chanel as shown by karl lagerfeld 
youngsters took up his idea of wearing just a long jacket over 
tights or leggings and now lagerfeld has varied the menu with a 
bevy of great jackets short or long and they can be worn with 
other things than merely tights or pleated minis 
but winds of change are also blowing for chanel in new loose 
and easy toppers 
christian lacroixs collection was as vibrantly glowing with 
color as ever with a calculated risk in mixes of plaids and 
patterns brocades taffetas and chiffons 
even the lacroix solidcolor suits with their typical fitted or 
flyaway bolerojjackets and straight minis or shaped oval skirts 
came in mixes of hotcolored raw silks 
like many paris designers lacroix could not resist the call of 
the body stocking he showed some of the liveliest puccistyle 
prints in town on lycra bodysuits and easy shirtjackets 
ungaros flowery extravaganza went both new in style with his 
blousing chemise dresses and typically ungaro sexy in style with 
fitted draped lateday wear he also offered a fine array of 
lessconstricting dresses with jackets or suits typical of this 
great tailor 
jeanlouis scherrer the animallover whose star model and 
daughter laetitia also hosts a weekend tv wildlife show brought 
out his panoply of jungle and wildanimal prints in clothes fitted 
and loose 
nearly everyone from saint laurent to guy laroche and scherrer 
showed impeccable yet individual mariner styles in navy white and 
sometimes red 
safari or bush jackets are another favorite along with a welter 
of wellcut long and tailored or slim pants to vie with the 
bodysuits hot pants and wider flaring shorts in 1930s style 
there is hope for those who wish for longer skirts as women 
still wear them on the streets even in paris a few new versions 
in slim or flared midcalf skirts crept in at saint laurent sonia 
rykiel and kenzo 
fabrics to watch for spring and summer are on the light side 
lightweight gabardine and broadcloth or cashmere blends come out in 
spring coats and suits 
colors run the gamut with plenty of navy and white in classic 
daytime wear there is heavy emphasis on reds and pinks from smoky 
and tea rose to mandarin orange dayglo or shocking pink

sana yemen ap yemen a nation born only five months ago 
from the merger of north and south yemen is already at odds with 
its powerful neighbor saudi arabia 
more than 400000 yemenis have left saudi arabia in the past 
five weeks in what yemens foreign minister says is a saudi bid to 
cripple its fledgling government 
the foreign minister abd alkarim aliryani said saudi 
pressure was not over yemens support for iraq but rather 
territorial claims and other issues 
he said saudi arabia had already complained officially that 
yemen would not move on certain aspects of our relationship 
which iryani described as boundaries in a potentially oilrich 
quarter 
the two yemens united on may 22 raising old border issues 
predating the establishment of saudi arabia in the 1930s 
the saudis hoped that yemen would be overwhelmed by the deluge 
of refugees iryani said also the remittances from yemenis in 
saudi arabia had made up a third of the gross national product so 
the saudi move was a financial blow 
we are easily reabsorbing 400000 people iryani said 
there will be difficulties of course but we will not go down 
the drain as the saudis wish us to do 
on sept 18 saudi authorities withdrew special status for the 1 
million to 2 million yemenis in the kingdom many of whom had been 
residents for more than 30 years they were given a month to find a 
saudi sponsor or go home 
on tuesday the saudis extended the deadline by a month 
we are simply saying that all foreigners are created equal 
a senior saudi official told the associated press on monday why 
should we give them special treatment when they turn on us 
iryani dismissed as malicious nonsense what he called 
saudiinspired rumors that saddam hussein had promised yemen the 
disputed asir region or that iraqi missiles were installed here 
yemen condemned the invasion of kuwait he said and objected 
only to nonarab troops in the region 
he said yemen abstained on crucial security council votes 
against saddam because its envoy was awaiting word from the arab 
league 
yemen never took a firm stand in support of iraq he said 
yemen like jordan argued that saddam should be pushed out of 
kuwait but not by hardening his position with a western presence 
the saudis expected us to toe the line without question 
iryani complained 
he acknowledged that saudi arabia had committed 100 million a 
year in budgetary support and had made major concessions to yemen 
we are not denying they have done very well in helping yemen 
but to what end do you want to help he said 
quite clearly we have discovered it was not for simple 
neighborliness common faith common destiny apparently it was 
intended for something else 
western diplomats in sana estimate the returnees at about 
350000 one who had toured the border area said he saw no sign 
that saudi authorities had prevented them from selling their 
holdings and bringing out property 
it looks like they can absorb 400000 without too much 
trouble said the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
but what happens if it goes to a million 
the saudis dispute the 350000 figure as inflated 
iryani estimated that yemens economy would taken up to three 
years to recover from the shock but would emerge stronger as a 
result the main hope he said is oil 
hunt consolidated inc of dallas is already producing 210000 
barrels a day near marib at the southern end of the empty quarter 
recently saudi engineers reported a find in the south that might 
increase their reserves by 20 percent 
that iryani said was the heart of the dispute 
if there is oil to the south and oil to the north it is 
likely there is oil in the middle

century moslem mosque with a hindu temple in the uttar pradesh city

crisis the partys defection deprived singh of a parliamentary 
majority 
singh said he would seek a vote of confidence on nov 7 to prove 
he could still muster a parliamentary majority 
but the congress party the largest opposition party said it 
would oppose singh in any vote of confidence because of his 
handling of the religious dispute

moves under way to oust him as party leader 
the times of india newspaper reported a concerted effort in top 
party circles to replace singh so janata dal could remain in power

the bharatiya janata party has cost him his majority 
the opposition congress party and its allies hold 210 seats the 
remainder are held by smaller parties and independents

shrine in ayodhya a town of 40000 in uttar pradesh 
tens of thousands of hindus have converged on ayodhya this week 
to help build the temple the government has dispatched tens of 
thousands of police and paramilitary troops to prevent violent 
clashes 
singh and his janata dal party allies who run uttar pradeshs 
state government have tried to halt construction of the temple 
until a court can rule on the religious dispute 
moslems comprise only 12 percent of indias 880 million people 
india is officially a secular state but the hindus make up 82 
percent of the population and dominate the government

an administration energy expert says consumers 
can expect the price of gasoline to hover between 130 and 162 
over the next year that is if no war breaks out in the persian 
gulf 
us energy information administrator calvin kent also told a 
senate panel thursday to expect home heating oil prices to range 
between 113 and 145 per gallon through 1991 roughly equal to 
the high levels heating oil reached in last winters cold snap 
kents forecast came in the opening session of a threeday 
hearing on why oil prices shoot up on the slightest rumor of 
trouble in the mideast but dont seem to come down on rumors of 
peace 
kent told the senate governmental affairs committee that an 
improvement in the mideast situation might lower the price of crude 
oil but an immediate response at the gasoline pump shouldnt be 
expected 
prices go up more quickly than they come down kent said 
kents price estimates assume that the persian gulf crisis does 
not dissolve into war that the winter is normal in severity and 
that market factors such as inventories and daily oil production 
remain relatively stable 
also assumed in his forecast was that crude oil remains at about 
30 per barrel that assumption seemed open to question even as he 
testified in new yorks mercantile exchange oil jumped 317 per 
barrel in early trading to 3425 by mid day

a large majority of roman catholics oppose the 
involvement of us bishops in abortion politics according to a 
survey released by a private group of catholics 
the poll commissioned by catholics for a free choice found that 
71 percent of catholics and 74 percent of all respondents said 
catholic bishops should not use the political arena to advance 
their moral opinions results of the survey were made public 
what we find is that catholics and noncatholics are opposed 
to the style and approach the bishops are taking on abortion 
politics frances kissling president of catholics for a free 
choice said at a news conference 
helen alvare public information director at the prolife office 
of the national conference of catholic bishops disagreed with the 
results of the survey 
it promotes the idea that the bishops shouldnt speak out on 
the human rights issue of abortion she said it would prefer 
to gag us as moral leaders in the public square 
in fact the bishops wont be silenced on any human rights 
issue including things like economic justice civil rights or 
abortion alvare said contending that most of the poll questions 
involved the churchs getting involved in elections which we 
dont do 
she also said the survey did not distinguish between regular 
churchgoing catholics and catholics who dont go to church 
regularly 
kissling said the us catholic conference and a number of 
bishops were inappropriately participating in the political process 
by attacking individual candidates and elected officials whose 
views on abortion differ from theirs

adjutant postal company says she has become a concientious

the daily news once americas largest 
newspaper has seen its circulation and financial stability slowly 
erode in recent decades 
the tabloid slipped to being the nations second largest 
metropolitan daily this year giving up the top spot to the los 
angeles times before the strike called thursday circulation stood 
at 118 million on weekdays and 146 million on sunday 
the daily news first went to print in 1919 as the illustrated 
daily news founded by late publisher joseph medill paterson it 
billed itself as new yorks picture newspaper a slogan that 
still appears on the masthead 
it gained a reputation as a feisty tabloid specializing in 
crime stories exposes and colorful local features 
in 1928 one of the most gruesome but spectacular newspaper 
pictures ever published was the papers frontpage shot of ruth 
snyder in sing sing prisons electric chair as she was executed for 
the murder of her husband 
the photo was snapped secretly by a photographer with a camera 
strapped to his leg and smuggled out under the noses of prison 
officials 
when president ford decided not to bail new york city out of its 
fiscal crisis in 1975 the news published one of its most famous 
headlines ford to city drop dead 
circulation reached its zenith in the years after world war ii 
when it sold 24 million copies on weekdays and 47 million on 
sundays the largest ever for a us newspaper 
like many of its competitors the paper began to experience 
harder times television lured people away and bluecollar workers 
formerly loyal to the daily news began to move out of the city and 
turned to suburban newspapers 
along the way such notable new york dailies as the herald 
tribune the sun the worldtelegram the journalamerican and the 
daily mirror folded the news survived along with the new york post 
and the new york times 
in 1980 the paper embarked on a disastrous attempt to lure 
afternoon readers away from the post with an evening paper called 
tonight the experiment folded after one year 
by the end of 1981 the news was offered for sale by its owner 
chicagobased tribune co but no buyer surfaced and the paper 
struggled on through various costcutting efforts 
unions representing most of the newss 3500 employees have been 
locked in bitter negotiations with management since january the 
news claims losses of 115 million from 1979 to 1989 on revenues of 
4 billion 
management says it needs to eliminate featherbedding and other 
alleged labor abuses and save 50 million to 70 million annually 
so that it can invest 500 million in new color presses to remain 
competitive 
the allied printing trades council an umbrella group of 10 
unions at the news says the tribune co is really interested in 
making the paper lean enough to interest a buyer or it will shut 
down the paper 
by destroying the unions first the paper would save 100 
million in shutdown costs union leaders say 
central to the negotiations has been the news determination to 
give management broad powers over staffing levels work rules and 
other areas of operations now controlled largely by the unions 
george mcdonald head of the allied has said the unions will 
never agree to the management rights concept 
during the past few months the news has been preparing to print 
and deliver the paper without its union workers recruiting 
replacement workers and training management in various areas of the 
papers operations

who erected barricades to block streets at least 50 shacks were 
burned but no other casualties were immediately reported

armed police units roamed the township

house and senate negotiators agreed early 
today on a 155 billion foreign aid bill for the coming year that 
will set a new us policy direction in el salvador and forgive 
egypts military debt to the united states 
accord came after a marathon and at times stormy allnight 
bargaining session that hinged on the administrations swallowing a 
50 percent cut in military aid to el salvador in return for the 
67 billion debt relief for egypt which president bush badly 
wanted 
the compromise package now goes back to the full house and 
senate for ratification before going to bush whose advisers have 
threatened a veto over the el salvador provisions 
administration officials have said erasing egypts past military 
debt from the books is crucial to maintaining the international 
coalition that has been built against iraqs occupation of kuwait 
the entire us and world position against iraqi president 
saddam hussein and iraq will be at risk if the debt were not 
forgiven as bush promised said sen robert kasten rwis the 
senior gop member of the senate appropriations foreign aid 
subcommittee 
but house subcommittee chairman david obey dwis countered 
that he would have difficulty winning votes for the bill in the 
house if it fully forgives egypts debt and he complained heatedly 
that bush made the promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak 
without first consulting lawmakers 
the el salvador provision calls for an immediate 50 percent cut 
in this years 85 million in military aid as a step toward 
creating incentives for the san salvador government and the leftist 
fmln rebels to end their decadelong civil war with a negotiated 
political settlement 
if the rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
walk away from unsponsored peace talks the aid could be 
restored but if the government fails to pursue peace it could 
lose the other half of its military aid 
the arrangement represents a major change in us policy toward 
el salvador which has received aid at a rate of nearly 1 million 
a day in recent years it also was a victory for congressional 
opponents of administration policy who are weary of 10 years of 
aid that has done little to encourage moderation in the central 
american country 
in other provisions the bill pointedly omits any specific 
earmark for pakistan which in past years has been the 
thirdlargest recipient of us aid in fact it erects new hurdles 
before aid can be granted including certification that this weeks 
elections were free and fair and restoration of full civil 
liberties in the country 
in the past pakistan has been particularly important because of 
its role in supplying anticommunist rebels in neighboring 
afghanistan the united states has looked the other way when 
pakistan advanced its nuclear weapons program but with us 
participation in that war winding down congress is taking a more 
critical look at the aid 
as usual israel is the top beneficiary of the bill with some 3 
billion in cash military and economic aid and millions more in 
noncash benefits the conferees agreed to include a section that 
would let the united states give israel up to 700 million worth of 
new weaponry from pentagon stocks 
in addition to the debt forgiveness egypt is the secondlargest 
cash aid recipient with 21 billion the money for the two middle 
eastern countries stems from their camp david peace accord and 
their status as staunch us allies in the region 
the bill provides a total of 31 billion for economic aid and 
46 billion for military aid congress is giving the 
administration more latitude than usual to decide how to distribute 
the money 
but lawmakers did include specific earmarks for several favored 
countries jordan 35 million in economic aid morocco 20 
million in economic and 43 million in military aid greece 350 
million in military aid turkey 500 million in military aid and 
625 million in economic aid for peru bolivia and colombia 
the bill also includes 800 million for subsaharan africa 75 
million for lebanon 20 million for ireland 364 million for 
eastern europe and up to 20 million for humanitarian and 
development aid in cambodia 
the philippines would get 160 million for this years payment 
on a fiveyear 1 billion aid program called the multilateral 
assistance initiative that is 40 million less than the 
administration had asked and the same as last years amount

the lower house of parliament today voted 
to abolish the governments monopoly on radio tv telephones and 
postal services which would formally open the door to private 
ventures in those sectors 
the law was approved by the sejm on a vote of 256 to 1 with five 
abstentions it must still be passed by the senate and signed by 
president wojciech jaruzelski but approval was expected 
the move is another step in the former communist countrys 
freemarket reform program that began the first of the year 
private radio stations and at least one tv station already have 
been functioning during the past year with the official 
acquiescence while the new legislation was being drafted 
the new law allows for the assigning of specific broadcasting 
frequencies to licensees under the supervision of the ministry of 
communications 
it would end the governments legal monopoly over postal 
services telecommunications radio and television 
before passage the sejm accepted one amendment to limit radio 
frequencies assigned to military and police before whole sections 
of the wave spectrum were assigned to these units but now they 
will be limited to specific channels 
several foreign companies have expressed interest in helping to 
establish a third commercial tv channel in poland in addition to

nasa decided to suspend the magellan 
spacecrafts venus mapmaking mission today three days earlier 
than planned because a planetary lineup is affecting its 
navigation and communications with earth 
it will be at least 12 days before magellan can resume its 744 
million mission to use radar to make pictures and maps of 
cloudcovered venus said jim scott mission director at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory 
the space agency had planned to halt mapping by magellan for 
nine days starting monday 
but laboratory spokesman jim doyle said increasing difficulty 
with magellans navigation communications with earth solar panels 
and ability to make quality pictures prompted the decision to 
suspend operations today 
scott said the problems may stem from an astronomical event 
called superior conjunction 
that occurs next thursday when venus and earth are at their 
maximum distance from each other about 161 million miles and 
the sun lies almost directly between the two planets 
magellan was launched from the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 it went into orbit around venus 2 months ago and started 
mapping venus fulltime sept 15 
so far its radar pictures have shown extensive quake faults a 
wide variety of volcanos and lava flows los angelessized 
meteorite impact craters and 600milewide bulges that are like the

dragged out of a grocery market on his stomach when the store 
manager mistook his semiconscious condition for drunkeness 
bampm market cashier charelle m white said the man was left 
outside for 20 minutes thursday morning before paramedics were 
called the victim identified as james drumright 57 of 
baltimore died at liberty medical center 
paramedics said they couldnt determine if drumright would have 
lived had he received medical assistance sooner 
police said a community relations officer and members of the 
group alliance of rosemont community organizations planned to 
investigate 
alliance president leslie c howard said the incident could 
inflame racial tensions because the stores owners are korean and 
the victim was black 
many korean store owners operate in predominantly black 
neighborhoods in baltimore and cultural differences have caused 
misunderstandings several storekeepers have been the targets of 
violence 
in new york city blacks have been demonstrating since early 
this year over an incident in brooklyn where a black woman claimed 
she was roughed up by a korean store worker 
several angry passersby stayed at the bampm market until late

human hair has been grown in a test tube for the 
first time and the discovery could lead to a cure for baldness by 
the year 2000 a cambridge university scientist said today 
this is the real thing said dr terence kealey leader of 
the research team at the department of clinical biochemistry we 
have for the first time succeeded in getting hair to grow in 
vitro 
the balding scientist stressed in a bbc radio interview that 
growing hairs in a test tube is not in itself a cure for 
baldness but it does provide the perfect arena for experiments 
the next step he said is to find out why the normal 
kickback mechanism that triggers the growth of new hair when 
existing hair follicles come to the end of their normal growth 
cycle stops working in many middleaged men 
i hope that within 10 years we could come up with a cure for 
baldness he said 
he said the successful growth of testtube hair came after a 
team member dr michael philpott devised a method for extracting 
hair follicles from the skin without damaging the hair roots 
the two top layers of skin have to be carefully sliced away 
before removing the follicles with fine tweezers he said the 
follicles are then grown in a synthetic blood substitute maintained 
at body temperature 
watching human hair growing in a test tube is an amazing 
sight kealey said it grows absolutely identical to normal 
hairs at the same rate of 0012 inches a day and in the same 
shape 
he said his team will now expose the testtube hair to a variety 
of different biological materials and observe the results 
the teams research funded by the anglodutch consumer giant 
unilever and britains science and engineering research council 
will be published in next months issue of the journal of cell 
science 
kealey said the research could also produce a much more 
effective depilatory for women to remove unwanted hair 
he explained that hairs grow for about two years and then 
spontaneously shed if you can promote that process up you 
have a natural depilatory he said 
in fact what we can do now in the laboratory is persuade hairs 
to shed in this very natural manner and so we hope that we might 
quite quickly start trying to work on improved depilatories as well 
as a cure for baldness 
cambridge is known for its scientific breakthroughs including 
discoveries of the electron the neutron and the structure of dna 
the building blocks of genetic material 
asked how the testtube hair compared with the other scientific 
breakthroughs kealey replied 
were absolutely thrilled to have made this breakthrough but 
i think honestly as an intellectual breakthrough it has to be 
viewed as rather trivial i am myself bald but i dont think its 
something that bothers me very much 
but kealey added one has to be fairly catholic and understand 
that for many people it is intensely traumatic maybe because it 
is the first visible sign of advancing age

not declared sovereignty from the central soviet government is 
kirgizia the republic is a mountainous region in central asia with

take the step soon the republics most famous native son writer

kazakhstans parliament said its decisions would hold sway in 
cases of conflict with national laws and it claimed control over 
the republics natural resources interfax reported 
gorbachev has been trying to persuade the republics to negotiate 
a new treaty that would redefine and preserve the union as a 
confederation of sovereign states 
kazakh lawmakers have indicated willingness to join such a 
confederation but the leaders of many republics have been 
reluctant to participate and negotiations have yet to begin in 
earnest 
while the republics are pushing for autonomy from the central 
government in moscow some also are simultaneously trying to stop 
separatist movements in smaller regions inside their territory 
moldavia faces independence movements not only by the gagauz 
but also by a smaller number of ethnic ukrainians in another corner 
of the republic the socalled dneister republic

congressional negotiators inched toward final 
approval of a deficitreduction plan today as the chairmen of two 
taxwriting committees agreed on most elements of a 250 billion 
package of tax increases and spending cuts staff members said 
the only remaining issue in the plan was how to restrain 
spending for medicaid health services for lowincome americans 
spokesmen for rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
house ways and means committee and sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
who heads the senate finance committee said details of the final 
agreement would be announced later in the morning 
the plan includes increases in consumer taxes on gasoline 
tobacco alcoholic beverages and luxuries it carries a 
considerable tax increase on upperincome americans medicare 
recipients would foot 10 billion more of their own health costs 
under the bill 
the deficitreduction package was one of the last major items of 
business for a fractious wearying congressional session that 
extended several weeks beyond expectations i think this session 
has gone on long enough said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
the house ways and means committee and the senate finance 
committee arranged meetings later in the day to give their approval 
to the package that would open the way for congress to get the 
bill to president bushs desk by sunday 
although there was stiff opposition to the bill from many 
lawmakers in both parties house democratic and republican leaders 
predicted its passage white house chief of staff john sununu said 
bush considered the plan real and credible 
i havent been working on this for so long to have something 
go down said house minority leader robert michel rill 
in other action as congress pushes toward the end of it its long 
electionyear session 
the house gave voicevote approval to a 268 billion defense 
spending bill while the senate planned to vote today on that 
measure and the companion military authorization bill the spending 
bill is a cut of 19 billion from bushs initial proposal in 
january it slashes the presidents request for the strategic 
defense initiative and barely keeps alive the b2 stealth bomber 
program 
the senate voted 6036 thursday to send bush the 1990 farm 
bill passed by the house two days earlier the president is 
expected to sign the fiveyear 408 billion measure which sets 
new environmental rules for farmers sets government nutrition 
programs including food stamps and aims to reduce subsidized 
acreage for farmers by 15 percent 
house and senate sponsors announced agreement on a new 25 
billion program of child care grants to the states as the 
centerpiece of a longdebated child care bill differences remain 
over some elements including an expansion of tax credits for 
lowincome families 
the house approved by voice vote a 574 billion housing bill 
including 275 billion this fiscal year and 299 billion in 
fiscal 1992 
the massive deficitreduction package product of half a year 
of partisan brawling and interminable negotiations would affect 
almost all americans 
it raises the 9centagallon federal gasoline tax by about a 
nickel and increases levies on alcohol tobacco and jewelry as 
well 
it boosts from 28 percent to 31 percent the incometax rate 
on the richest americans but drops the rate paid by the 
uppermiddle class from 33 percent to 31 percent the measure also 
reduces the deductions available to people earning more than 
100000 yearly by 3 percent and phases out their 2050 personal 
exemptions 
the details were subject to change in late negotiations 
bargainers agreed informally late thursday to slow the growth of 
medicare benefits by 10 billion through 1995 officials said 
that figure matched a house proposal that was about 7 billion 
lower than the reductions the senate voted for medicare helps pay 
medical bills for about 33 million elderly and disabled people 
an official demanding anonymity said that under the agreement 
the 75 annual deductible paid by beneficiaries would increase to 
100 the monthly premium 2860 this year would grow gradually 
to 4620 by 1995 
disagreement remained over the exact size and nature of cuts in 
medicare reimbursements to doctors and hospitals those reductions 
were expected to total about 33 billion over the next five years 
the plan cuts student loans farm aid and other benefit 
programs 
final agreements were being sought over medicaid which helps 
the poor pay medical bills although the program will be cut 
liberals wanted to provide an additional 29 billion for 
lowincome elderly people the bush administration was trying to 
reduce that figure 
also under negotiation were 25 billion worth of tax breaks for 
the oil and gas industry championed by senate finance committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas the senate also wanted 56 
billion worth of tax breaks for businesses including those doing 
research and individuals for items such as employerprovided 
educational benefits 
with election day approaching members were getting itchy to 
halt the budget bickering and return home for campaigning 
if the leaders were reading their votes correctly the house and 
senate where few problems were expected would dispose of the 
bill quickly and let congress adjourn for the year over the 
weekend 
michel expected only about 50 of the houses 175 republicans to 
vote for the plan mainly because of disgruntlement over its 
approximately 150 billion in new taxes and spending cuts 
considered by some as insufficient but a gop pep rally for the 
plan on capitol hill attended by sununu and budget chief richard 
darman left supporters encouraged

republican sen larry pressler is a 
selfproclaimed political maverick who often is at odds with gop 
party leaders but on election days past he has been a consistent 
landslide winner 
democrat ted muenster hopes the disenchantment of gop leaders is 
spreading to voters but polls indicate hes not having much 
success the sioux falls businessman is trying to derail presslers 
campaign for a third senate term 
muenster casts pressler as an ineffective publicityseeking 
professional politician 
pressler laughs off such charges he says he ruffles feathers 
because he sometimes votes against the white house and republican 
congressional leaders to do whats best for his home state 
i march to my own drum ive been criticized for being 
independent but i put south dakota first the senator says 
the tactic has worked well in past elections particularly when 
he won reelection in 1984 with the most votes ever cast for a 
south dakota candidate 
earlier this year muenster was touted as one of the democratic 
partys best hopes for defeating a republican senator 
but an independent poll taken early this month showed pressler 
leading by a wide margin pressler was supported by 60 percent of 
those surveyed and muenster by 26 percent in a poll with a 45 
percentage point margin of error 
muenster says his own polls show a much closer race he says 
hes winning the undecided voters many of them swayed by ads done 
for him by democratic sen tom daschle probably south dakotas 
most popular elected official 
pressler says most of his gop critics are people who want his 
job 
the real test of all this is not what people say but what the 
voting results are he says 
muenster acknowledges pressler has been immensely popular but he 
maintains that voters are coming to believe the gop senator is 
ineffective and gets no respect from other members of congress 
he portrays that as independence but he is not independent 
muenster said in fact hes out of it in terms of being a factor 
in congress 
most gop grumbling comes in private conversations 
but when former gop gov bill janklow was asked last year to 
list presslers significant achievements he said i honestly 
cant think of anything 
sioux falls businessman david billion briefly considered 
challenging pressler in a gop primary saying pressler hadnt 
accomplished much for south dakota 
on thursday pressler came under democratic fire on the floor of 
the senate after he complained about lax limits on the use of 
congressional mailings by members of the house 
sen wendell ford dky rose to question pressler about his 
own mass mailings i believe that he was the newsletter king 
last year ford said 
pressler responded that he had mailed just one congressional 
newsletter this year senate records show that last year he sent 
out 10 mass mailings for every household in his state more than 
any other senator 
last month ford made a campaign appearance for muenster in 
which he said pressler doesnt mingle and doesnt prepare for 
anything 
muenster says congress isnt dealing with the nations problems 
particularly the need to balance the budget and that pressler is 
an example of whats wrong 
im not a professional politician he said we need more 
citizen members of congress and fewer professional politicians 
pressler responds by citing a long list of accomplishments for 
south dakota he says hes helped save a rail line protected 
federal highway funding and air service fought for senior citizens 
and small businesses and for open international markets for us 
farm products 
the point is i put south dakota first he says

tens of thousands of high school students staged 
protests today across france intensifying pressure on education 
authorities to improve safety at crumbling crimeridden public 
schools 
the demonstrations were the latest in a twoweek series of 
strikes by students fed up with campus violence overcrowded 
classrooms and what they see as government indifference to the 
poor condition of their schools 
on wednesday education minister lionel jospin promised that 100 
security guards would be added to schools most troubled by the 
surging wave of campus violence that led to the original strikes 
but student leaders in paris derided the measure as 
insufficient 
police reported about 7000 students marched today in the 
streets of toulouse 5000 in valenciennes 4000 in amiens 4000 
in saint etienne and 18000 in seven other provincial cities 
regional authorities near montpellier in southern france 
reported that four student demonstrators fell off a staircase and 
were injured two were hospitalized 
the marches began a week ago in the tough northern suburbs of 
paris with a few hundred students but have since swelled as a 
prelude to the oneweek all saints day vacation period 
the recent surge of crime at high schools has included the rape 
of a girl in a school lavatory assaults on several teachers and 
cases of extortion 
thousands of teachers held a protest last weekend in sympathy 
with the students and to demand higher pay 
but jospin warned teachers on wednesday that salary increases of 
1192 promised this year would have to be cut to 384 due to 
budget constraints 
the move seemed certain to escalate tensions between the 
government and teachers unions 
the most violent schools are those built in the 1960s near 
hastily erected highrise projects built to house immigrant workers 
and poor french families 
french media reported this week on schools with crumbling 
concrete holes in the ceilings graffitiscarred hallways and 
classrooms with no desks or chairs

we actually didnt know until last week that the funding had even 
been asked for 
she said the family would have preferred the money come from 
private sources but sen quentin burdick dnd thought federal 
money could help 
as the senator said its for the town its not for lawrence 
welk press secretary jean broadshaug said today the money will 
help with the towns plans to build a small hotel community center 
and restaurants 
everyone does what they can for their own constituents she 
said replying to contes remarks and i think in this case 
anyone who has ever been to strasburg can recognize it needs some 
help 
welk heritage inc applied for a federal grant three months ago 
after a board member saw an application in a farmers home 
administration office 
many in strasburg a town of 600 in southcentral north dakota 
say the money could have been put to better use but that the town 
may as well take it if theres money to throw away we might as 
well have it said fred martin a resident of the strasburg 
nursing home farmers will get their share 
if you want to do something with the money why dont they do 
something to help the roads and bridges said resident neis 
norman were a farming community and if farmers dont have 
anything the town doesnt either he said 
welk lived on the farm near strasburg until he was 21 then 
with a new accordion he formed a band in yankton sd and began 
his career as one of the countrys most successful bandleaders 
the total cost of the restoration project is estimated at 
750000 including 500000 for a trust to maintain the museum 
after it opens work began this summer in anticipation of a june 2 
grand opening 
i can well understand that citizens are very concerned that 
tax dollars are going into this project schaefbauer said but 
its very common for museums and so forth to get federal grants 
from time to time 
its more than just the birthplace of lawrence welk she 
said its a perfect example of how their homes were built in 
that time frame 
i think the payoff will probably come down the line in another 
generation when our children will be able to go there and see how 
the pioneers lived

having failed as the good example he might have been the 
defendant must now become an example of another kind jackson 
said 
in issuing the sentence jackson forged a middle ground between 
the recommendations of prosecutors who urged that barry be given 
the maximum oneyear sentence and the defense which argued for 
parole or community service 
for the first time in his 10month legal drama barry himself 
spoke in court and asked for leniency from the judge 
i stand here truly remorseful and ask this court to impose 
community service as a sentence barry said 
in court papers submitted late thursday barry for the first

a congressional committee has approved an 
investigation into the role of former president alan garcia in the 
1986 massacre of 250 prisoners 
the committee which is headed by leftist legislator julio 
castro gomez approved the measure unanimously on thursday there 
is sufficient proof for the investigation to proceed castro 
said 
garcia who served as president from 1985 until july 28 has 
already renounced his congressional immunity and could be jailed 
if found guilty of ordering the massacres 
as a former president garcia was named senator for life when he 
handed over power to president alberto fujimori 
opposition congressmen say garcia should share the 
responsibility for the june 1986 massacre which occurred when the 
armed forces put down riots in three lima prisons most of the dead 
were members of the maoist shining path guerrilla movement 
a 1987 senate investigation produced a report blaming garcia and 
his cabinet for the killings it said garcias decision to place 
control of the situation in the hands of the military led directly 
to the massacre 
garcia has maintained he and military leaders at the time were 
innocent he accused lowerranking military officials of carrying 
out summary executions of prisoners after they surrendered 
in december a military court found a police colonel and 
lieutenant guilty of killing 60 to 70 rebels in the lima prison of 
lurigancho the court absolved another 76 army officers and 
policemen 
garcia who at age 36 became the youngest president to be 
elected in perus history brought on an unprecedented economic 
crisis 
his freespending centerleft administration left the country 
with 3000 percent annual inflation and a 20 billion foreign debt 
on which no payments have been made since 1987 
during garcias tenure the rural insurgency and poverty 
increased amid charges of widespread government corruption

a northwest airlines captain had his 
pilots license suspended after authorities said he buzzed a 
snowmobile race in one small plane and crashlanded another because 
of a fuel problem 
martin roy redman of rural faribault and members of his 
family escaped injury when a twinengine beechcraft plane he was 
piloting crashlanded at faribault airport in august 
chris zurales a federal aviation administration attorney said 
tuesday that the national transportation safety board already was 
investigating redman for allegedly buzzing the race on cannon lake 
last winter the board issued an emergency revocation of redmans 
license sept 11 in response to the august crash zurales said 
redman appealed the revocation at an oct 910 hearing before an 
ntsb administrative law judge who ordered a ninemonth suspension 
of redmans license 
bob gibbons spokesman for the minnesotabased northwest said 
today that after a suspension a pilot must requalify to fly for 
the airline 
hell have to go through ground training and simulator flight 
training and be evaluated by the northwest training department and 
the faa gibbons said 
rick rabeneck a sheriffs deputy who was at the snowmobile 
race said redman caused a panic when his 1948 monocoupe plane 
dived toward the crowd passing over it at 25 or 30 feet 
redman says he saw what looked like a runway and made a slow 
descent to get a better look he then flew the plane over the race 
course 
it was not a dive he said 
redman admits he broke faa regulations by flying lower than 
1000 feet above a crowd but calls rabenecks allegations 
exaggeration 
in the second incident an faa official said an engine quit 
because of fuel starvation the faa found that redman had placed a 
fuel selector in an incorrect position but the pilot insists a 
mechanical failure in the fuel system was the likely cause

albania today condemned as an ugly 
act the defection of the countrys leading writer which 
embarrassed communist leaders hosting their first highlevel 
international conference in decades 
ismail kadare probably albanias bestknown public figure after 
president ramiz alia requested political asylum thursday during a 
visit to france with his wife and two daughters france granted his 
request hours later 
the announcement came as albania seeking to emerge from decades 
of selfimposed isolation hosted foreign ministers from the other 
five balkan nations bulgaria turkey greece romania and 
yugoslavia 
albania is seeking to join the 34nation conference on security 
and cooperation in europe it was the only country in europe which 
refused to sign the 1975 helsinki final act which spawned the 
conference 
officials said thursday the timing of kadares defection did not 
appear coincidental he picked his moment an official from the 
albanian journalists union said on condition of anonymity 
official albanian media only reported the defection friday the 
official ata news agency cited foreign media as the source of the 
news 
the foreign press reports say that the writer ismail kadare 
requested political refuge in france thursday ata said 
through this ugly act which is a grave offence for the 
patriotic and civic conscience of our people he abandoned the 
people and homeland and placed himself in service of the enemies of 
albania and the albanian people 
the statement smacked of the stalinist terminology often used by 
eastern europes hardline communist leaders before the soviet bloc 
was swept by democratic revolutions late last year 
the defection dealt a blow to the communist leadership just as 
it is introducing cautious reforms in the hope it can avoid the 
fate of eastern europes fallen stalinists 
in a country where writers and intellectuals traditionally play 
a part in political movements kadare was seen as a spiritual 
leader for reform as well as the nations greatest author 
last year he was made deputy chairman of the democratic front a 
leading communist group and had begun speaking out for human 
rights in albania he had strongly criticized the countrys secret 
police 
some officials did not believe the news of kadares defection 
foreign minister reis malile suggested thursday it was a 
setup though he did not say by whom kadare is dead 
democratization is not dead malile said suggesting that gradual 
reforms would continue 
kadare was respected especially among the young because of his 
international standing his books are relatively wellknown in 
france a few have been published in the united states 
he has never been a dissident in his own country even under 
enver hoxha the countrys postworld war ii founder and dictator 
until his death in 1985 he was revered as a writer 
kadares elevation by authorities to a leadership role in the 
ruling paty indicated he was supposed to help the process of 
gradual reform but in his statement from paris kadare said reforms 
werent coming fast enough 
the promises made were not kept and my disillusion like that 
of the immense majority of albanians was all the more bitter he 
said 
in may albania loosened emigration controls and about 5000 of 
the countrys 3 million citizens fled abroad 
a draft election law published this week provides for more than 
one candidate to contest each parliamentary seat and for secret 
ballots but it does not foresee a multiparty system

the battleship uss iowa which survived two 
wars and a catastrophic explosion and fire that killed 47 crewmen 
was decommissioned today for a third time 
the world war ii and korean war veteran with 16inch guns that 
sent their 2000pound projectiles at targets as far away as 20 
miles was taken out of service 47 years after it first joined the 
navy 
strong wind and rain forced the ceremony to be moved from a pier 
at the norfolk naval base to the bridge of the ship several 
hundred former iowa crewmen and their families gathered in the 
ships mess hall where they chatted but could not hear the 
ceremony 
also aboard were some relatives of crewmen who were killed in 
the explosion and fire on the ship on april 19 1989 
he would want us to be here said paula schwarz of 
levittown ny whose brother peter bopp died in the blast 
in the ceremony the iowas chaplain said the ships crewmen 
living and dead should be remembered for their role in preserving 
democracy 
although we bid farewell to the teak decks and steel plates 
we do not say goodbye to iowa for iowa is us said the chaplain 
cmdr joseph c cappar 
during world war ii the ship carried president roosevelt to a 
war conference the ship was fitted with a bathtub for roosevelt 
who had trouble standing because of polio to this day the iowa 
remains the only ship in the navy with a bathtub 
after serving in the pacific providing protection for aircraft 
carriers the iowa was decommissioned in 1949 
the battleship stayed in mothballs for little more than two 
years before it was brought back to service in august 1951 its 
guns fired more than 4000 rounds during the korean war 
the ship was put in storage from 1958 until 1984 when it was 
recommissioned as part of the navy buildup to a 600ship fleet at 
a cost of 435 million the ship was modernized into a platform for 
cruise missiles the big guns were considered a bonus 
perhaps the most shattering incident in the ships history was 
the explosion and fireball that raced through the no 2 turret 
during an open seas gunnery exercise last year the crew fought the 
fire and saved their ship 
in less than 60 days the ship was able to make a scheduled 
mediterranean deployment with its no 2 turret sealed but because 
of federal budget deficits officials decided not to spend the 
estimated 13 million it would cost to repair the ship 
a navy investigation into the explosion laid the blame on a 
disgruntled gunners mate who died in the blast navy officials 
said the gunners mate deliberately sabotaged the guns 
that report has been challenged by some of the families of the 
47 sailors and some members of congress earlier this year the 
navy reopened a portion of the investigation

officials arent legally responsible for 
the murder of a former district attorney by a man he once 
prosecuted even though they didnt warn him that the released 
convict was in trouble with the law again a court ruled 
the state appeals court ruled thursday in a suit filed by the 
family of william weissich against authorities for allegedly 
breaking a promise to warn weissich about the convict who had 
threatened his life 
the suit said officials of sonoma and marin counties and the 
state knew that malcolm schlette was convicted of possessing guns 
in 1983 eight years after his release from prison but failed to 
tell weissich 
weissich marin county district attorney from 1953 to 1960 was 
shot to death in his san rafael law office in november 1986 by 
schlette who then killed himself 
in upholding a judges dismissal of the suit the 1st district 
court of appeal said law enforcement officers may have made a 
binding promise in 1975 to warn weissich about any menacing actions 
by schlette 
but any legal duty to warn the former prosecutor had expired by 
1983 when schlette was arrested again for the guns possession the 
court said 
the duty of a good samaritan is of limited duration said 
the 30 ruling written by justice gary strankman a person who 
has performed a voluntary duty is not required to render aid 
indefinitely 
marin county counsel douglas maloney said the court had to 
draw the line somewhere 
theres a limit to how much protection you can give anyone 
he said he said the murder was a terrible tragedy but the law 
cant solve all these things 
alvin goldstein a lawyer for weissichs widow rosemary and 
her family said the ruling would be appealed 
schlette was convicted of arson and sentenced to 20 years in 
prison in 1955 and threatened the lives of weissich and others in 
the case he was paroled in 1966 and was promptly arrested again 
carrying a list of names of people involved in the prosecution he 
finished his sentence in 1975 
the suit said county and state officials then promised to tell 
weissich of any threatening behavior by schlette but they failed 
to tell him in 1983 when schlette was arrested by federal agents 
pleaded guilty to illegal gun possession and was placed on 
probation the suit said 
it also said sonoma county learned in may 1986 that schlette 
again had guns but failed to detain him or warn weissich 
weissich who installed a bulletproof door and took other 
security measures after schlettes earlier threats moved to a new 
office and relaxed his guard after authorities promised to warn 
him his familys suit said 
a similar suit is pending in federal court accusing the federal 
government of improperly releasing schlette on probation after his 
1983 arrest

a gale blew a dredge into the only bridge 
to hatteras island today severing the span and stranding thousands 
of people without power 
the islands estimated 5000 residents and an unknown number of 
tourists had no way off the island ferry connections to via 
neighboring ocracoke island couldnt be used because winds were 
gusting to 60 mph creating waves of 5 to 7 feet in pamlico sound 
no injuries were reported in the crash which collapsed a 
250foot section of the herbert c bonner bridge severed utility 
lines that run along it and grounded the dredge northerly island 
another 50foot section of the bridge was in danger of falling 
police said 
the 2milelong bridge connects hatteras island with bodie 
island to the north along north carolinas outer banks 
there is no way to get across that bridge its gone 
collapsed said gwen white dare county public information 
officer 
the accident knocked out electrical and telephone service to 
hatteras island and to most of ocracoke island located to the 
south and accessable only by ferry 
renee hoffman of the state emergency management division said 
authorities were trying to figure out how to get temporary 
electrical service set up it is hoped that ferry service can be 
reestablished witin 24 hours she said this morning repairing 
the bridge could take months 
dare county commissioner gaskill austin who lives on hatteras 
island said residents were literally in the dark out here but 
were used to minor power outages because of the frequent storms 
as the word spreads im sure my phones going to be jammed 
he said in an interview conducted by ham radio 
a big need will be generators and to save as much 
foodstuffs as we have here in the stores that and the water is my 
primary concern at this point 
county emergency officials believe nobody was on the bridge when 
the 200footlong dredge struck it at about 130 am they had 
gotten word a half hour earlier that the dredge had broken free of 
its anchor and they closed the bridge 
highway patrol trooper ac joyner was on the bridge when the 
dredge hit about 300 yards south of him 
the bridge started bowing out in a westerly direction and it 
bowed out from one to two to three feet as the ship was pressing 
against it joyner said the bridge collapsed about an hour 
later he said 
there was an electrical explosion and all the power lines and 
telephone lines were destroyed he said the dredge was stuck in 
the bridge but later authorities said it appeared to be grounded 
possibly on pieces of the collapsed bridge 
four of the 10 people on the dredge got off safely by climbing 
to the top of the dredge and onto the bridge the six others were 
expected to remain on the dredge until the waves subsided said 
mikey daniels chairman of the dare county board of commissioners 
they were not in danger authorities said 
daniels estimated the islands permanent population at 5000 
about 500 to 600 people live at ocracoke the outer banks are a 
popular destination for tourists and while the peak summer tourist 
season has passed its still a prime season for fishermen 
repairing the bridge could take six months daniels said ms 
white said state officials said the repair job was so big that a 
private contractor would have to be hired 
the bridge was the only route to the island from the north 
residents would have to drive to a ferry taking them to ocracoke 
island then to one of two ferries to the mainland the detour for 
someone trying to reach nags head about 10 miles north of the 
severed bridge would involve more than 125 miles of driving and 
the two ferry rides one about 25 miles long

kidnapped american journalist terry 
anderson the longestheld among 13 westerners missing in lebanon 
turns 43 on saturday his sixth birthday in captivity 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped at gunpoint in moslem west beirut on march 16 
1985 there has been no indication that his proiranian shiite 
moslem captors plan to free him 
former hostage brian keenan of northern ireland who was 
released on aug 24 said he spent part of his more than four years 
in captivity with anderson 
he said anderson whom he last saw some time ago suffered 
from a digestive ailment and was frequently in pain 
but keenan noted that anderson bore his pain stoically because 
in truth all pain and illness was generally dismissed by our 
keepers although they would eventually supply us with some form of 
antibiotics 
he said anderson who with other hostages was kept in chains and 
blindfolded much of the time suffered periods of despair and 
would seek solace in his family 
but he noted that anderson has been allowed to receive letters 
from his family and has a photograph of his youngest daughter 
sulome 5 who was born three months after he was kidnapped 
terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak 
with great pain and remorse and longing for his daughter keenan 
said 
on saturday lebanese newspapers plan to publish letters to 
anderson from sulome her lebanese mother madeleine and peggy 
say his sister 
the arabiclanguage papers said they will also publish the 
original english texts of the letters in the hope that anderson 
will be allowed to read them anderson did not know arabic when he 
was kidnapped 
during his captivity he has lost his father glenn r anderson 
and elder brother glenn richard jr both died of cancer as far as 
is known anderson is unaware of those deaths 
andersons father died 11 months after the kidnapping and his 
46yearold brother died june 7 1986 four days after making a 
videotape from his hospital bed pleading with andersons kidnappers 
to release him 
apart from anderson the missing westerners include five other 
americans four britons two west germans and an italian 
altogether 89 foreigners have been kidnapped or disappeared in 
lebanon since january 1984 sixtyseven have been freed or said 
they escaped and nine have been killed 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the us military 
deployment in the persian gulf have complicated efforts to free 
anderson and the other americans with proiranian shiite moslem 
leaders close to the kidnappers denouncing both developments 
hussein musawi reputed mentor of some of the hostageholders 
has repeatedly emphasized that an early release of the american 
captives was unlikely 
we denounce saddam husseins invasion of kuwait and we also 
denounce the american military deployment in moslem lands he 
said 
a fundamentalist shiite faction called islamic jihad or islamic 
holy war claims to hold anderson and another american 58yearold 
educator thomas sutherland who was kidnapped on june 9 1985 
the last statement from islamic jihad that referred to anderson 
and sutherland was issued on oct 24 1989 it renewed the groups 
demand that 15 convicted terrorists imprisoned in kuwait be freed 
but the terrorists jailed for bombing the us and french 
embassies in kuwait in december 1983 are no longer in kuwaiti 
hands 
at least two witnesses who escaped from kuwait when the iraqis 
invaded said they saw the terrorists getting into cars before the 
iraqis reached kuwaits central prison 
the 15 were mostly iraqi shiites opposed to iraqi president 
saddam hussein but they included two lebanese shiites related to 
islamic jihad leaders the prisoners were apparently set free by 
their guards 
shiite sources have reported that the two lebanese terrorists 
whom islamic jihad particularly wanted freed were now back in 
lebanon 
syria the main powerbroker in lebanon recently helped crush a 
rebellion by a lebanese christian general but neither the syrians 
nor the lebanese army has challenged the fundamentalists in their 
beirut strongholds where the western hostages have been held 
one shiite source who is familiar with the kidnappers 
thinking said the issue of the american captives has become a 
puzzle 
the american military deployment in the gulf makes it 
embarrassing for iran to pressure the captors into releasing 
americans he said adding that even iranian moderates such as 
president hashemi rafsanjani would find such a move difficult 
of course the kidnappers are proiranian and can be 
influenced by iran but one shouldnt forget that america has been 
the great satan in irans eyes since ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
rose to power in 1979 said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists has been 
seeking to have all the westerners freed in line with his drive to 
improve tehrans relations with the west and attract badly needed 
investment and advanced technology but he is opposed by irans 
antiwestern radicals

trailing by 40 points in the polls 
republican gov edward d diprete is up against two tough 
opponents 
one is democrat bruce g sundlun the other more formidable 
according to political scientists is the regions battered 
economy 
i would say its almost impossible for gov diprete to come 
back says brown university political scientist darrell west 
whether he deserves it or not people are tying him to the 
economy 
diprete is quick to pull out a moodys credit report that says 
the states longterm fiscal management has been solid although 
the current budget threatens to hemorrhage red ink 
i wouldnt concede its out of anyones control but its 
certainly making it more difficult for us to get our message out 
a subdued diprete said 
his consultant paul j manafort the architect of president 
bushs victory says that if voters dont buy the 
forgetthepastiamthefuture message i wouldnt say were 
dead we just dont win 
diprete portrays sundluns promise to slash millions of dollars 
of waste from the 15 billion state budget as draconian cutting 
into services needed by the poor and elderly but fiscal experts 
within and outside government suggest diprete may have to do the 
same thing 
the governor seeking his fourth twoyear term says he alone 
has enough experience to lead rhode island through a recession 
and that he is the bulwark against democrats who dominate every 
other statehouse office and the general assembly 
hes proposed sweeping ethics and campaign finance reforms a 
broad restructuring of state government and apologized for any 
mistakes he might have made 
but the reaction generally has been why not before this 
hes running an election where paul manafort cant control the 
agenda said one of the states highest republican officeholders 
who spoke on condition of anonymity to make it work hes got to 
raise bruce sundluns negatives and it just wont fly 
diprete 56 has spent more than 2 million and bush twice has 
attended fundraising events sundlun a millionaire businessman 
who largely finances his own campaigns has spent about 3 million 
in the race including the cost of the bitter threeway primary he 
won sept 11 
sundlun 71 never known for the light touch in two previous 
campaigns against diprete has played like an incumbent while 
contending hes not a professional politician but hes is trying 
to guard against cockiness 
one of the problems i have right now is that the media is 
trying to make me the governor and im leaning over backwards not 
to be the governor he said that would be presumptuous 
its that touch of overconfidence that diprete hopes will cause 
sundlun to make a major gaffe 
im playing the role of the underdog diprete said and 
yet i think i can reverse this if i can pull him out a little 
but it wont mean much if people dont vote and theres every 
indication they may not rush to the polls nov 6 
there were 12300 requests for mail ballots in 1988 this year 
the number of requests is down by 5000 
however there were 4000 ballot requests for the september 
primary twice the usual number 
they were mad in september said henry kinch an aide to 
secretary of state kathleen connell now theyre just fed up

two top minnesota republican leaders 
today urged gop candidate jon grunseth to drop out of the 
governors race hours after grunseth had been on the brink of 
doing so before changing his mind 
grunseth whose campaign has been crippled by allegations that 
he swam nude with teenage girls nine years ago called a news 
conference thursday to announce he was dropping out of the race but 
switched at the last minute 
senate minority leader duane benson and house minority leader 
bill schreiber held a news conference at the capitol today to 
publicly urge grunseth to leave the field to state auditor arne 
carlson a republican running as a writein candidate 
my message here today is a very simple one that jon 
grunseths candidacy is hurting the entire ticket said benson 
senator benson and i are of one mind on this issue said 
schreiber there is no question that the governors race is 
bringing down politics in minnesota to a level never before 
experienced 
grunseth 44 who held up his news conference for more than 
three hours while he reconsidered late thursday said he had 
definitely decided to quit the race earlier in the day 
but there has been just an incredible outpouring of love and 
affection and support and prayer he said we spent hours 
agonizing over this decision and we decided about a halfhour ago 
that we were going to press forward no matter what 
the decision leaves next months gubernatorial election a 
threeway race between the grunseth carlson and democratic 
incumbent rudy perpich 
carlson lost to grunseth in the republican primary he mounted 
his writein effort after fellow republicans began to urge grunseth 
to quit the race 
grunseths campaign was thrown into turmoil oct 15 when it was 
reported that two women said in sworn statements that he tried to 
get them to swim nude with him during a 1981 pool party at his 
home 
the women who were then 13 and 14 said they refused but that 
grunseth his teenage daughter and a 16yearold girl took off 
their bathing suits one of the women also said grunseth tried to 
pull down her bathing suit top and touch her breast 
grunseth has denied the allegations 
some republicans complained thursday that his decision not to 
quit could give the nov 6 election to perpich who seeks an 
unprecedented fourth term 
if he cant have it his way hell take the whole business down 
to catastrophe said former gov elmer l andersen a carlson 
supporter 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn indicated earlier in the day that 
the republican party couldnt unseat perpich with two candidates 
our base simply is not big enough to cut it in half he 
said so that were going to have to some way repair that 
situation 
perpich was preparing for tonights debate with grunseth and 
carlson and was unavailable for comment spokesman ray bohn said 
today 
a member of grunseths finance committee said that after 
grunseth told 15 to 20 committee members he was dropping out they 
tried to get him to change his mind 
jon told us he definitely was not going to stay in said rod 
hendrickson but after some very persuasive conversations by 
certain members we felt he was going to reconsider 
committee members told grunseth they would provide him an 
additional 200000 in campaign funds if he would remain in the 
race the saint paul pioneer press reported today 
one contributor offered grunseth 90000 if he would stay in the 
running the star tribune of minneapolis reported campaign manager 
leon oistad said grunseth wont hold that person to the offer 
which was made in the emotion of the moment but the campaign would 
welcome it

unbeknownst to the cuban people president 
fidel castro has a wife with whom he has had five children a 
soviet newspaper says he also has 32 houses and 9700 guards 
responsible for his personal security it says 
these tidbits all unverifiable about castros personal life 
appeared in a recent edition of komsomolskaya pravda a leading 
liberal daily in moscow they added a new dimension to the trend 
toward more candid reporting about cuba in the soviet press 
this is the most biting article yet because it goes after 
fidel castro personally one bush administration official said a 
translation of the article appeared in a us government 
publication that monitors the foreign media 
castros private life is a mystery to the cuban public cubans 
are aware that he was married in the late 1940s has a son 
fidelito by that marriage and that he was divorced in the 
mid1950s 
all details concerning the personal life of fidel castro and 
the whole partystate elite in cuba are shrouded in an impenetrable 
veil of secrecy begins the article by a novikov 
it said that apart from fidelito castro also has an 
illegitimate daughter alina fernandez revuelta about 34 years 
old 
castros present wife works in the cuban institute of 
oceanography and they have five sons all of whom have first names 
starting with a aloin alex anatolio and so on the story 
said 
the sons all studied in the soviet union it said and were 
taken care of by a married couple who were cuban state security 
employees 
some details in the article were corroborated by georgie ann 
geyer a syndicated columnist who has written a soontobereleased 
biography of castro guerrilla prince the untold story of fidel 
castro 
the woman referred to in the article apparently is daria soto 
del valle ms geyer said she too said that the couple has 
produced five children and added that her research indicates castro 
may have fathered 14 or more offspring over the years 
explaining castros passion for secrecy ms geyer said a 
charismatic leaders power depends on his not being known 
the komsomolskaya pravda article continued fidel has 32 
houses state houses of course scattered around the whole 
country in havana he has three houses and two underground 
bunkers where if need be the commander in chief can hide 
together with his retinue of 57 generals 
the account apparently touched a raw nerve in cuba when a 
mexican television crew in moscow reported on the story earlier 
this week cuban authorities retaliated by expelling a crew from 
the same network which was on assignment in havana 
komsomolskaya pravda is described as a leading practitioner of 
the new wave journalism introduced in recent years in the soviet 
union it is a supporter of the countrys best known radical 
politician boris yeltsin who is president of the russian 
republic 
us officials said the details of castros personal life 
apparently were leaked to the publication by soviet officials who 
believe moscow should loosen its ties to cuba 
relations remain outwardly cordial but trade between the two 
countries has fallen sharply partly because of the economic chaos 
in the soviet union 
the story said that the marriage of castros brother raul 
broke down five years ago but the couple still appear together in 
public raul is no 2 in the cuban hierarchy 
at the moment raul is illegally married to a bulgarian 
woman and apart from this has an illegitimate daughter by a woman 
who is the director of cuban television it said 
none of the contentions in the article could be verified 
independently 
the article says that castros personal guard numbers 9700 
people throughout the country 2800 of whom are in the capital 
but when he visits any province the deployment of additional 
units can mean that up to 28000 people are mobilized for the 
security of one single person it said 
when castro goes bathing or sailing on one of his three yachts 
122 divers comb the sea bed inch by inch in search of underwater 
mines and traps it added 
cuban officials have justified the tight security around castro 
by citing ussponsored assassination attempts against him a 
senate study 15 years ago concluded ther were eight such attempts 
while castro himself has put the figure at 25

president bush today blamed democrats for 
the higher taxes his administration is negotiating with lawmakers 
saying the democraticcontrolled congress has been on an 
uncontrolled spending binge for years 
bush who promised during his presidential campaign he would not 
support tax increases said he was forced to compromise to get a 
deficitreduction agreement through the house and senate 
noting that democrats for 36 years have controlled the house he 
said that year after year after year they have presided over 
these budget deficits and they appropriate every dime and they tell 
me how to spend every dime 
yes ive had to compromise havent liked that a bit but ive 
done it because the president must at certain times put the overall 
good of the country first he told a fundraising breakfast for 
the california republican party 
in accepting his presidential nomination at the 1988 republican 
national convention bush said and the congress will push me to 
raise taxes and ill say no and theyll push and ill say no 
and theyll push again and ill say to them read my lips no new 
taxes 
bush complained that a top democrat was criticising his 
leadership in this mornings newspaper apparently a reference to 
statements by rep richard gephardt published today in the 
washington post 
i think george bush can be beaten in 1992 said gephardt 
house majority leader in the last two months hes shown a real 
failure of leadership he needed to explain to the american people 
why they were being asked to swallow strong medicine but he didnt 
do it 
bush said the american people know that strong medicine 
is required because the democratic congress simply has been on an 
uncontrolled spending binge for years you dont have to be a 
rocket scientist to know that congress has been spending more than 
we take in for far too long 
the deficitreduction agreement that we get wont be the 
best deal possible but in my judgement it will be the best deal 
possible with this congress he said 
bush was to appear later at a campaign luncheon for sen pete 
wilson californias gop gubernatorial candidate running against 
former democratic mayor dianne feinstein of san francisco 
wilson did not attend this mornings breakfast speaking instead 
by telephone loudspeaker he said he stayed in washington to work 
on the budget negotiations which are nearing completion 
in the budget fight members of the presidents own party 
defected from the bipartisan package he approved earlier because it 
contained tax increases 
charles black spokesman for the republican national committee 
said earlier that bush was preparing a new partisan sharp 
message but holding off on the most venomous antidemocratic 
rhetoric until the bipartisan budget agreement was signed 
after his california appearances the president was heading to 
hawaii to stump for senate candidate rep pat saiki and meet with 
leaders of 11 pacific island nations en route home he will make 
another stop for wilson in san francisco and then in oklahoma to 
campaign for gop gubernatorial candidate bill price 
bush delayed his thursday departure and canceled stops in 
arizona and new mexico while final details of the budget pact were 
nailed down 
his trip ends monday just a week before election eve and 
continues his pattern of helping republicans whose loyalty to him 
has been selective 
wilson and saiki have bucked the white house on key issues both 
helped defeat the deficitreduction pact backed by bush that was 
the forerunner to the package emerging this week 
wilson in a neckandneck race against democrat dianne 
feinstein issued a statement at the time saying its tax hikes 
will only encourage congress to spend more and more 
saiki also voted for the sweeping civil rights legislation that 
bush vetoed she was preparing to vote to override his veto before 
the override was killed in the senate her office said 
in a related development thursday white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater all but invited the national republican congressional 
committee to fire cochairman edward j rollins for a recent memo 
in which he told house gop candidates do not hesitate to oppose 
either the president or budget proposals advanced in congress 
fitzwater said rollins remarks were not helpful i think the 
committee will be able to take charge of this situation 
asked whether rollins should be dismissed he said thats up to 
the committee

european community leaders get their 
first formal chance this weekend to discuss the persian gulf 
crisis but their talks may be overshadowed by a sharp clash over 
plans for modest cuts in farm subsidies 
the leaders of the dozen west european nations will open a 
minisummit saturday evening at the palazzo madama or italian 
senate in rome and wind it up sunday morning italy holds the 
communitys rotating presidency 
during the eight hours of talks they are expected to cover 
issues ranging from the gulf crisis and troubles in the soviet 
union to futuristic plans for giving the community a single voice 
in foreign policy 
but the meeting could turn sour if the leaders are forced to 
break a deadlock over a community proposal for snipping farm 
subsidies by 30 percent over 10 years 
such a discussion would be totally unproductive and i would 
even say disastrous said jacques delors president of the 
communitys executive body 
but british prime minister margaret thatcher is expected to 
raise the issue if agriculture and trade ministers are unable to 
end the dispute before the summit it would be disastrous not to 
have it on the agenda said a british source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
german chancellor helmut kohl whose government faces elections 
in december opposes the plan for farm cuts his aides insist on 
special aid to offset any income losses suffered by farmers 
germanys action backed by france and ireland has threatened 
the ambitious uruguay round of international trade talks a 
fouryear effort to revamp the world trade system final bargaining 
will begin in five weeks 
the leaders are expected to discuss the gulf situation and 
possibly aid to jordan turkey and egypt hard hit by the trade 
embargo on iraq for its invasion of kuwait the leaders have 
discussed the issue in bilateral talks but not all together 
the economic woes of the soviet union and the new democracies in 
eastern europe also will be on the agenda although new aid offers 
appear unlikely 
at a june summit in dublin the leaders asked aides to put 
together proposals for shortterm loans and other assistance for 
the kremlin 
but community officials say they are not ready the work has 
been hampered by the soviets lack of statistics and delay in 
adopting an economic reform plan they also say the soviet union 
the worlds largest crude oil producer will be helped by the 
recent surge in oil prices 
the leaders may spar as in the past over farreaching plans to 
form a political merger with a common foreign and security policy 
and an economic and monetary union with a joint currency and 
central bank 
special conferences will open in middecember to make changes in 
the communitys founding treaty of rome to set out new powers 
mrs thatcher has opposed some of the more radical suggestions 
for joining forces with her allies on the continent arguing 
against giving up national powers to new institutions 
we see no prospect of a united states of europe she said in 
an interview with londons independent newspaper 
but there are many practical ways in which europe can grow 
together she said the community should not stand still 
she is certain to oppose a push by italian prime minister giulio 
andreotti to set a date likely jan 1 1994 for the start of work 
on a central bank 
moreover andreotti according to spokesman pio mastrobuoni 
will urge support for eventual creation of a single currency an 
idea flatly rejected by mrs thatcher 
turning to political union a new italian report said the 
community is increasingly a major factor of stability in europe 
and one of the major players in international affairs 
it will be able to fully play this role only if it acquires 
stronger unity and can act with its own identity on the 
international scene the report said 
germany aware of fears the newly united nation will become too 
powerful supports closer political ties it is essential for us 
that we strengthen europe said a german source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but britain and france want to retain a good deal of power in 
their own hands while smaller countries worry about being left 
out 
our interests would be better protected in an organized 
structure where there is room for everybody not just the larger 
countries a dutch official said 
some want the community to take on a defense role too italian 
foreign minister gianni de michelis wants the community to adopt 
the western european union a security grouping of nine ec nations 
but neutral ireland would balk at any attempt to turn the 
community into a military powerhouse while close us allies 
oppose moves to weaken the north atlantic treaty organization

the court reversed warners and schiebels convictions on the 
three securities counts that alleged they covered up home states 
precarious financial position in circulars distributed to raise

was sent back to the lower court for possible new trial

dismissed warners convictions on the six counts that he oversaw 
unauthorized transfers of home state money to esm the court said 
the state did not present sufficient evidence

costs and that schiebel pay 25000 in court costs

university of new orleans 
none of the spending had been sought by the bush administration 
or authorized by any house committees with jurisdiction over 
scientific research 
all of it plus another 45 million that key members of the 
senate appropriations committee wanted showed up in a negotiated 
compromise between the two houses directing president bush just 
where to spend department of energy funds next year 
this is research that has to be done myers maintains 
maybe they are located in some of the districts of 
appropriations committee members but we know more about them 
there 
but to many of the 449 members of congress who dont hold seats 
on the house or senate appropriations committees the 29 senators 
and 57 who do often abuse their power of the purse in directing 
just where 183 billion for various domestic programs will be spent 
in fiscal 1991 
im over outrage im into nausea says rep robert walker 
of pennsylvania the fact is that when we are allocating money 
it is not based upon merit other than the people who are sitting in 
the room divvying up the money 
walker the top republican on the house science space and 
technology committee tried in vain last week to stop what he 
called the unauthorized porkbarrel projects 
the house voted against him nearly 3to1 the word on the 
floor was you better be with us on this or were going to 
take a look at your projects too he said 
sometimes lawmakers efforts involve more than just getting 
money for their home states and often it requires more than a 
single years effort 
for example hawaii sen daniel k inouye the no 2 democrat on 
the senate appropriations committee got 5 million for his states 
department of business and economic development to verify potential 
geothermal resource sites 
but he also set in motion getting 50 million next year to help 
pay for renovating the medical center of george washington 
university in washington 
a graduate of the universitys law school and now a member of 
its board of trustees inouye got the senate last week to authorize 
a 50 million grant for the school as part of the medical devices 
act 
an aide to him described it as a lure to help the university 
raise 100 million in matching funds from its alumni so that inouye 
can seek actual appropriations for the project next year as part of 
the fiscal 1992 budget 
the unabashed champion of directing federal money to his home 
state is robert c byrd of west virginia the president protempore 
of the senate and democratic chairman of its appropriations 
committee 
a 32year senate veteran he gave up the more prestigious 
majority leaders job two years ago to succeed retiring mississippi 
sen john stennis as appropriations chairman where i can best 
serve the people of my state 
byrd included 10 million for alzheimers research at west 
virginia university in the measure that walker tried to stop he 
also helped ax 55 million that president bush wanted for hiring 
1000 new irs agents to instead build a new 80 million federal 
courthouse in charleston 
and last spring he won 185 million to relocate the fbis 
fingerprint laboratory a law enforcement priority that would 
have to be built somewhere from washington to clarksburg wva 
my proposals for west virginia come under the sharpest 
scrutiny more so because im the chairman byrd said this week 
citing the depressed economy in his state this nation must 
invest in its infrastructure its research and its people my 
efforts to strengthen west virginias economic bases reflect that 
belief

the israeli investigation into the temple mount 
killings said today that police use of live ammunition was 
justified but that there was indiscrimnnate shooting 
the probe severely criticized israels police chief and 
jerusalems two top officers for ignoring advance signs of trouble 
at the holy site 
the threeman commission also that palestinians provoked the 
riot but that police showed little sensitivity to the temple mount 
as a holy place for jews and for moslems who call it haram 
essharif 
the report said that when police broke into the temple mount 
compound to confront palestinian rioters there was 
indiscriminate use of live ammunition 
it said the use of live ammunition was unavoidable to rescue 
two policemen thought to be trapped in a station on the temple 
mount and to secure their armory of three submachine guns and 43 
pistols 
however the report did not give details of the indiscriminate 
shooting discussing it only in general terms near the end of the 
59page report and not even mentioning it in the reports main 
conclusions 
but the report implied that police may have fired when they were 
not in danger and may have continued firing after it was no longer 
necessary to gain control of the area the use of live fire was 
without strict supervision by officers it said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir named the commission two days 
after the rioting on oct 8 to examine what led to the 
confrontation which began after arabs stoned jews praying at the 
western wall below the temple mount 
police said at the time that 19 palestinians were killed and 
more than 140 wounded in israeli gunfire but todays report said 
20 were killed 
the massacre prompted two un security council resolutions 
both of which brought the united states into conflict with israel 
its closest ally in the middle east the united states was the 
chief sponsor of a resolution approved oct 12 by the council that 
condemned israel for the shooting deaths of the palestinians on the 
temple mount and called for a un investigation 
the united states voted against israel again on wednesday for 
refusing to admit un investigators 
israel fears accepting the un mission would be tantamount to 
accepting world objections to israels annexation of predominantly 
arab east jerusalem captured with the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip in the 1967 war 
israel had said its internal investigation will be adequate 
todays report justified the police use of force to capture the 
area up to the line of the two mosques on the temple mount but 
questioned whether police needed to go north of the line and make 
arrests 
groups and individuals acted on their own judgment north of 
the line of the mosques it said some of them ran into 
difficult situations and had to open fire but it is doubtful 
whether the cleaning up of the area and the conduct of arrests 
was essential in the conditions that prevailed on the mount the 
report said 
it said that the force that charged onto the mount was 
unsupervised put together at random and not fully briefed 
the report referred without elaboration to initiatives taken 
by commanders after the stabilization of the mosque area 
these could be justified in an emergency it said but on the 
temple mount because of its distinctiveness and in nonemergency 
conditions such an initiative is dangerous 
it cited one such case saying we did not find that this 
officers initiative caused injury or loss of life but the action 
remains grave 
the report said police had prior reports of the possibility of 
riots on the temple mount it said police commanders failed to 
recognize passions aroused by the 34monthold palestinian 
uprising iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the inflammatory 
calls of moslem clerics a week earlier to block a rumored march 
to the mount by jewish zealots 
the report criticized the top police echelon for being absent 
even when it became obvious a dangerous situation was brewing 
jerusalem police commander aryeh bibi should have hurried 
immediately to the temple mount while jerusalem district 
commander rahamim comfort should have joined him to supervise the 
situation personally the report said 
it said the police who were attacked by an incited mob 
feared for their lives and the lives of tens of thousands 
worshipers who were at the western wall for a holiday prayer 
after the massive pelting with stones and other materials the 
police fired tear gas grenades and rubber bullets and hoped this 
would deter the rampaging crowd and force it some way back from the 
western wall the report said 
it said the police fell back through a gate leading out of the 
mosque compound which the arabs then blocked while continuing to 
throw stones at the western wall also known as the wailing wall 
the police having fled then heard over their walkietalkies 
a desperate cry for rescue by two policemen manning a regular 
post inside the compound which also contains dozens of weapons 
and ammunition the report said 
the police charged back into the compound not knowing the two 
officers were by now safe and used gas grenades and even live 
fire as the crowd bombarded them with rocks and other materials 
that threatened their lives 
it was at this stage that the heavy losses of life were caused 
among those congregated on the mount and when the congregants went 
into the mosques an order to cease fire was given the report 
said

international poll watchers said friday 
they found no evidence to support ousted prime minister benazir 
bhuttos claims that her party lost a parliamentary election 
because of widespread voter fraud 
ms bhutto rejected the findings and declared today we have a 
constitutional dictator after an electoral coup detat 
the winning alliance said it hoped the investigation would 
persuade washington to resume vital economic and military aid to 
pakistan 
ms bhuttos centerleft pakistan peoples party was defeated by 
the rightwing islamic democratic alliance more than 21 in 
wednesdays election 
the 37yearold former premier whose government was dismissed 
aug 6 on corruption and mismanagement charges has refused to 
concede defeat she has accused the armybacked caretaker 
government and her opponents of massive voterigging and said she 
will challenge the election results in court 
the alliance a looseknit coalition of 18 parties called ms 
bhutto a sore loser and said such largescale tampering would be 
impossible 
at a news conference in this southern port city a 40member 
observer team from the washingtonbased national democratic 
institute said it had found no evidence to support ms bhuttos 
claims 
we have not found any evidence of irregularities which could 
have altered the outcome of the elections significantly voting 
took place in a peaceful and positive atmopshere said vahit 
halefaglu a prominent turkish diplomat and leader of the 
delegation 
halefaglu said the team which monitored 30 constituencies 
nationwide would probably release its final report in about three 
months 
the institute sent observers from 18 countries to monitor the 
election of a new national assembly the lawmaking lower house of 
parliament that will choose pakistans next prime minister 
earlier this week a 15member team from india nepal sri lanka 
and bangladesh said its preliminary findings showed the poll was 
fair and free 
both teams will monitor legislative elections in pakistans four 
provinces saturday seen as a test of strength for the alliance and 
a measure of the erosion of ms bhuttos popularity 
ms bhuttos lawyer and former interior minister aitzaz ahsan 
said the peoples party stands by its claims regardless of the 
institutes findings 
the tampering is selfevident if then ndi is saying this was 
a fair election then the ndi hasnt seen anything ahsan said 
sartaj aziz finance minister in the caretaker government and an 
alliance member said he hoped the institutes initial findings 
would reinforce the notion that pakistans political institutions 
are able to hold free fair elections 
the united states and other western countries had threatened to 
cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in economic and military 
aid if the election was rigged and ms bhutto victimized 
earlier this month washington suspended a 573 million aid 
package because pakistan had not given enough guarantees that it 
did not possess or want to possess nuclear weapons 
before asssitance resumes congress has demanded certification 
that this weeks polls were free and fair 
halefaglu said that although the group did not rule out the 
possibility of some rigging the voting overall was orderly and 
peaceful 
despite these positive conditions the election process was 
not without problems he said 
the team found the monthlong election campaign was conducted in 
a highly polarized political environment he said that was in part 
because of the dismissal of ms bhuttos government and the 
establishment of special tribunals to try her and members of her 
government for corruption 
halefaglu was critical of election coverage by staterun 
television saying it was heavily biased in favor of the caretaker 
government 
he also said the team had received complaints of party workers 
being killed reports of armed attacks on election officials and of 
ballot boxes being switched 
the team is investigating complaints and also comparing the 
final ballot count to voter lists halefaglu said even if the 
complaints were proved he said it would not have altered the 
outcome

a 12yearold girl was breathing on her own 
friday after receiving part of her mothers lung in whats believed 
to be the nations first livedonor lung transplant hospital 
officials said 
the operation offers hope to perhaps hundreds of children a year 
who suffer from certain lung diseases because transplanted tissue 
from a relative reduces the risk of rejection said dr vaughn 
starnes who led the surgical team 
mother and daughter remained in good condition a day after 
surgeons replaced the daughters right lung with a lobe removed 
from the mothers right lung said joyce b thomas a spokeswoman 
for stanford medical center 
both are doing fine thomas said 
the mother started breathing on her own shortly after the 
fourhour operation thursday 
doctors had given the girl 1218 more months to live but they 
now expect her to fully recover doctors expect the girl to remain 
hospitalized for several weeks the mother will probably go home 
earlier 
doctors said its likely the transplanted lung will expand 
capacity and may even grow 
the girl probably wont be a sprinter but certainly she can 
go to school participate in games and activities and go on dates 
do all the normal things that kids can do stanford spokesman 
mike goodkind said 
the mothers lifestyle is not expected to be changed by the 
procedure goodkind said 
very commonly for lung cancer for example an entire lung is 
removed people can function normally with one lung goodkind 
said 
transplants from related live donors are important for children 
because they have a higher rate of rejection than adults which 
might have something to do with their more active immune 
systems starnes said 
the most likely benefactors are patients with a large hole in 
the diaphragm high blood pressure on the lung or scarring of the 
lung said goodkind 
the fact is this is not a procedure that would have wide 
application for millions of people it is a specific treatment for 
a select group of child patients who are terminally ill goodkind 
said 
the fact that it was a livedonor transplant was in this 
case subordinate to the idea that the recipient was so closely 
related to the donor 
the 46yearold mother and her child matched on four of six 
genetic markers or tissue antigens compared to no more than two 
such matches in stanfords previous brain deaddonor lung and heart 
transplants starnes said 
seven of 14 children who have received heartlung transplants at 
stanford suffered rejection severe enough to impair lung function 
thats nearly twice the rejection rate of 71 adults who have 
undergone the same operation according to stanford 
the girl suffers from a rare malady called bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia which causes scarring of the lungs and high blood 
pressure the condition was the result of being placed on a 
respirator after being born prematurely said goodkind 
the malady also affects her remaining left lung but wont 
impair the transplanted tissue goodkind said 
the patients names were withheld at the familys request

saddam hussein is seeking to make peace with iraqs kurdish 
minority a baghdad newspaper said today the kurds have in the 
past been the target of poison gas attacks and forcible relocation 
by the baghdad government 
saddams reported bid to reconcile with the kurds comes several 
weeks after the iraqi president made peace with another 
longstanding foe iran so he could move tens of thousands of 
troops from the iranian border to occupied kuwait and the saudi 
arabian border 
it was not immediately clear why saddam would want to placate 
the kurdish minority but he may want to eliminate all internal 
opposition to prepare for possible combat with the multinational 
force arrayed against him 
the iraqi forces occupying kuwait have arrested two americans 
who had been hiding in the occupied emirate to avoid internment in 
saddam human shield western diplomats disclosed today 
uwe jahnke 47 of washington depot conn and john stevenson 
44 of panama city fla were brought to baghdad on oct 22 a day 
after their arrest in kuwait said the diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
they said the pair were taken to the governmentrun 
mansourmelia hotel where scores of other foreigners are being 
held 
in another development iraqs foreign minister criticized the 
united states and britain saying they were trying to block any 
arab solution to the persian gulf crisis 
tariq aziz in remarks reported today by the official iraqi news 
agency also accused the usled multinational force of seeking to 
seize control of the regions oil resources 
if the multinational force eventually moves to evict iraq from 
kuwait and the emirate is destroyed in the process that will not 
be too high a price to pay for liberation kuwaits exiled prime 
minister was quoted as saying today 
what is left of kuwait after what saddams soldiers did to 
it said prime minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah 
according to the saudi daily asharq alawsat 
as a citizen and a responsible official i am ready to 
sacrifice everything for the sake of regaining my land and 
liberating it and that is how each ordinary kuwaiti thinks said 
sheik saad who is also the crown prince 
kuwaits governmentinexile has also disclosed that casualties 
from the invasion were far higher than initially reported the 
governmentrun kuwait news agency monitored in bahrain said 4200 
kuwaitis were killed during the invasion initial reports had said 
several hundred died 
the news agency citing kuwaiti government officials also said 
12000 kuwaiti soldiers weretaken prisoner out of a total 
preinvasion kuwaiti military force of about 20000 
fears about war in the gulf sent oil prices up more than 3 per 
barrel in the futures market thursday light sweet crude rose 317 
to 3425 a barrel for december delivery contracts on the new york 
mercantile exchange a key market it was crude oils thirdbiggest 
oneday jump in the mideast crisis 
when the market reopened today oil prices jumped again up 95 
cents to 3520 per barrel its definitely just the increased 
war fears and seeing the war premium getting put back in the 
market annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson 
lehman brothers inc said in new york 
in the report about saddams effort to make peace with the 
kurds the baghdad newspaper aljumhuriya reported the iraqi 
president visited the northeastern kurdish province of suleimaniya 
on thursday it said he walked the streets and prayed with 
residents 
give us five years during which we will not resort to the 
rifle and if we see that the situation is improving we will go 
ahead and bury the rifle and say that the issue has come to an 
end saddam was quoted as telling one resident 
there are up to 35 million kurds in iraq they have campaigned 
since the beginning of the century for an independent homeland 
together with fellow kurds in iran and turkey 
kurds were suspected of collaborating with iran during the 
eightyear iraniraq war that unofficially ended in 1988 and 
baghdad used poison gas to kill thousands of them the killings 
drew international outcry iraq also relocated thousands of kurds 
to areas away from the iranian border region 
saddam is ready to use chemical weapons against if the 
predominantly american multinational force in the gulf attacks him 
former prime minister edward heath has told british legislators 
press association reported today 
heath met with saddam on sunday and negotiated the release of 32 
british passport holders 
britains domestic news agency said heath was understood to have 
told conservative party lawmakers at a private meeting thursday 
that saddam said he also would mistreat foreign hostages if 
attacked 
mr heath is said to have expressed the view that the iraqi 
leader was ruthless cold and calculating but not mad press

a hairraising experiment at cambridge university 
has raised hopes for bald men but experts said friday it could be 
years before scientists can apply their test tube hair growth to 
shiny heads 
this is the real thing said dr terence kealey leader of 
the research team which grew hair in a synthetic blood product at 
the department of clinical biochemistry 
we have for the first time succeeded in getting hair to grow 
in vitro he said 
the balding scientist stressed in a bbc radio interview that 
growing hair in a test tube is not in itself a cure for 
baldness but he added it provides the perfect medium for 
experiments and could lead to effective treatment within 10 years 
the results of the research are to be published in the journal 
of cell science next month 
experts welcomed the achievement saying it could lead to 
preventing hair loss in men genetically disposed to baldness 
any knowledge of how hair grows and metabolizes could have 
various offshoots in preventing baldness from happening said dr 
ken maxted a dermatologist with the glasgow health board who went 
bald at 18 
whether it is a cure for people who are bald im not quite 
sure i think its rather nice having a waterproof head he said 
in an interview 
dr john firmage a consultant at the scalp and hair hospital in 
london said the research was an important first step to 
understanding what affects hair growth and loss 
until now it has been very difficult to know what happens 
except that the process of balding is hereditary dr firmage said 
hence the many lotions and potions which are produced 
dr john romano at st vincents hospital and medical center in 
new york said scientists would be able to test new chemicals on 
testtube hair without worrying about injuring someones scalp 
researchers can use many more different chemicals because they 
dont have to worry about toxicity he said in a telephone 
interview 
kealey said the next step is to find out why many middleaged 
men suffer a disruption in the normal mechanism that triggers the 
growth of new replacement hair 
i hope that within 10 years we could come up with a cure for 
baldness he said 
the successful growth of test tube hair came after a team 
member dr michael philpott devised a method for extracting hair 
follicles from the skin without damaging the roots kealey said 
this is done by carefully slicing away the top two layers of 
skin to remove hair follicles with fine tweezers the follicles 
then are grown in a synthetic blood substitute maintained at body 
temperature he said 
watching hair growing in a test tube is an amazing sight 
kealey said it grows absolutely identical to normal hairs at 
the same rate of 0012 inches a day and in the same shape 
the research was funded by the anglodutch consumer giant 
unilever and britains science and engineering research council he 
said 
kealey said the research also could lead to a more effective 
depilatory for removing unwanted hair 
hairs grow for about two years and then spontaneously shed he 
said adding that a natural depilatory would result if the shedding 
process could be hastened 
in fact what we can do now in the laboratory is persuade 
hairs to shed in this very natural manner and so we hope that we 
might quite quickly start trying to work on improved 
depilatories kealey said 
cambridge university is known for its contributions to 
scientific research including discovery of the electron the 
neutron and the structure of dna the building blocks of genetic 
material 
kealey said that although he was thrilled at the teams 
breakthrough as an intellectual achievement it has to be viewed 
as rather trivial 
nevertheless many men will find the breakthrough welcome news 
since kealey said the onset of balding can be intensely 
traumatic maybe because it is the first visible sign of advancing 
age 
i am myself bald but i dont think its something that 
bothers me very much he added

not all the pumpkins decorating homes 
this fall were scooped out and carved into jackolanterns some 
are 5 feet high 4 feet wide and stuffed with leaves 
giant stuffapumpkins 260gallon plastic leaf bags with black 
pumpkin faces are the rage this halloween season ornamenting 
millions of lawns across america 
we dont have any trees in our yard so we went out one night 
and robbed the leaves of the people next door said betty brown 
a west hartford mother of three whose family of stuffapumpkins 
peer down from her frontporch roof 
it was fun filling them said her 11yearold daughter 
jennifer kids on the bus see them on the roof and they ask me 
whered you get em 
the bags are made by stamfordbased sun hill industries inc 
sun hill gave the world those tiny stickon digital clocks 
plastic banana ears and cool sounds a beach cooler with a radio 
built into the lid along with mostly seasonal novelties like 
floating ghosts pumpkin lampshadecovers and easter egg decorating 
kits 
the giant stuffapumpkin is its biggest seller ever said 
benson zinbarg president of the company 
its a selfadvertising product he said when people see 
it on their neighbors lawn they want to have it in their yard 
one of sun hills executives dreamed up the idea in late 1988 
during one of its brainstorming sessions 
zinbarg couldnt get bank financing to develop and market the 
pumpkin bags he ended up gambling all his savings and persuading 
friends to invest 
the bags were in stores last fall but didnt take off until 
this year they are now sold in nearly every major retail chain 
said zinbarg a former plastics engineer 
zinbarg wouldnt disclose sales figures for his privately held 
company but said he will be able to pay off his creditors by next 
month thanks to the stuffapumpkin his employees can except a 
nice bonus too he said 
susan feinberg a spokeswoman for k mart corp in troy mich 
said the chain ran out of the bags within a couple of weeks at its 
2100 stores nationwide 
the giant stuffapumpkin sells for 398 retail but can be 
found for as little as 198 in some discount stores 
sun hill recently added pumpkin patch bags in papa mamma 
and baby sizes of 32 gallons 21 gallons and 11 gallons then 
theres the stuffabat stuffacat and stuffawitch but the 
giant stuffapumpkin is the blockbuster zinbarg said 
stamfordbased sun hill obtained a patent for its 
stuffapumpkins in august a few imitations have cropped up but 
five manufacturers have agreed to stop producing the phonies

mayor marion barry was sentenced today to six 
months in prison fined 5000 and given one year probation for his 
conviction on a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge 
barry declared himself truly remorseful and asked us 
district judge thomas penfield jackson for leniency but jackson 
told the mayor he had abused his office and the collective trust of 
the community 
having failed as the good example he might have been the 
defendant must now become an example of another kind jackson 
said 
the sentencing ended a 10month legal drama that began with the 
mayors arrest jan 18 in an fbi sting operation that caught him on 
videotape smoking crack cocaine with a former girlfriend the night 
before sentencing barry in a letter to the judge said he wasa 
recovering alcoholic and drug addict 
i stand here truly remorseful and ask this court to impose 
community service as a sentence barry told jackson at todays 
hearing 
barry said he was willing to take full and personal 
responsibility for all my actions all my attitudes 
but jackson said barrys position as mayor and his breach of 
public trust alone warrants an enhanced sentence the judge also 
said 
the public rumors of defendants frequent and conspicuous drug 
use never dispelled and now unfortunately shown to have been true 
has given aid comfort and encouragement to the drug culture at 
large and contributed to the anguish that illegal drugs have 
inflicted on this city in so many ways for so long 
jackson also said he found evidence from the trial that barry 
had obstructed justice however the judge gave some weight to 
barrys admission that he was an alcoholic and a cocaine user 
in issuing the sentence jackson forged a middle ground between 
the recommendations of prosecutors who urged that barry be given 
the maximum oneyear sentence and the defense 
jackson also ordered barry to join a drug rehabilitation program 
while in prison and said the mayor will be subject to random drug 
testing during his year of probation 
the mayor whose term expires in january is currently running 
for city council the sentence does not affect his position as 
mayor or his candidacy 
barry ducked reporters waiting for him outside the us 
courthouse and left by a side entrance but his attorney r 
kenneth mundy said he planned to appeal the conviction and the 
sentence saying the final chapter has not been written 
the mayor asked later about his sentence said i should have 
been shocked and stunned but im not i understand that there are 
different sets of standards for different people and thats the 
american injustice system 
asked whether he should continue his bid for a citywide council 
seat barry responded absolutely why not 
mundy said he and the mayor were disappointed by the sentence 
the defense attorney said prosecutors had made barry a whipping 
boy for all the ills that beset the district of columbia 
us attorney jay b stephens said he would comment later in the 
day 
barry was convicted on aug 10 of a single cocaine possession 
charge and acquitted on another after a dramatic 10week trial the 
jury deadlocked on the remaining 12 counts and prosecutors said 
they would not seek a new trial 
the judge made clear that he disagreed with the jurys failure 
to convict the mayor of the other charges jackson said he would 
ignore what i perceive to have been the defendants efforts 
to induce the jury to disregard the law and the evidence 
the jurors will have to answer to themselves and to their 
fellow citizens for the way in which they discharged their duty 
he said in a stinging criticism of the panel 
barrys place of confinement has not yet been determined and 
will be assigned by the federal bureau of prisons 
in a 19page presentencing memorandum stephens said barry has 
shown a flagrant disregard for the law and seriously impugned the 
integrity of his office 
in short the defendant is not genuinely remorseful about his 
criminality the memo said he is sorry only that he got 
caught 
stephens said barry in his presentencing interview with chief 
deputy us probation officer arthur carrington admitted to two 
dozen unspecified cocaine possessions 
the prosecutor wrote that barry had a brazen disregard for the 
law which conveyed a particularly devastating message to a 
number of people iccluding the citys youth and law enforcement 
officers who were struggling to bring drugdriven crime in the 
capital under control 
the mayor who underwent substance abuse treatment at two 
clinics following his arrest has acknowledged abusing alcohol and 
prescription drugs but he had never previously admitted using 
illegal street drugs although his lawyer had called him an 
occasional user 
prosecutors built their case against barry on the testimony of 
former girlfriends friends allies from the civil rights movement 
and city employees who testified that they had used drugs with the 
mayor and supplied drugs to him

lashback here said maureen gail mulvaney a conference speaker 
from the united states 
other delegates including nonsmokers maintained they were 
attending the conference to fight for civil rights

right to enjoy smoking tobacco 
i dont smoke but the threat to the freedom of smokers is a 
threat to the freedom of all of us smokers now drinkers next

countries with the strictest antismoking laws however delegates 
soon filled the conference room in finlandia hall with smoke

it was here after all that the helsinki human rights accords

got off to a good start said saarinen who was the official host 
of the conference 
what we want is detente between smokers and nonsmokers

disagree with them can speak out said bob browning a 
businessman from australia

the uss iowa which survived two wars and a 
fiery explosion was decommissioned friday with relatives of some 
of the 47 crewmen killed in the 1989 blast among those on board 
i was on her when they commmissioned her and i wanted to be on 
when they decommissioned her said bob smith 65 a retired truck 
driver from webster mass who served aboard the battleship in 
world war ii 
its hard to see her go into mothballs ill start counting 
the days until she comes out again said dr jack b martin one 
of several former crewmen who predicted the iowa would return to 
service someday 
this world isnt at peace yet said martin 70 a world war 
ii veteran who is an optometrist in clarinda iowa 
adm jerome l johnson vice chief of naval operations agreed 
that the battleship may be called back to active duty 
if we need her again she will be there johnson said at the 
ceremony 
strong winds and rain pushed the decommissioning ceremony from a 
pier at the norfolk naval base to aboard ship while the ceremony 
took place on the ships bridge current and former crewmen and 
their family members milled around the rainsoaked wooden decks or 
drank coffee in the mess hall 
among those on board were several relatives of the 47 crewmen 
killed during the april 19 1989 gun turret explosion 
paula schwarz and mary messina of levittown ny wearing 
sweatshirts that read remember the iowa 47 said they came to 
honor their brother peter bopp who died in the blast two days 
before his 22nd birthday 
he loved the ship he would have been here ms messina 
said 
the ships chaplain cmdr joseph c cappar said the iowas 
living and dead crewmen should be remembered for their role in 
preserving democracy 
although we bid farewell to the teak decks and steel plates 
we do not say goodbye to iowa for iowa is us cappar said in the 
ceremony 
the ship will be moved to the norfolk naval shipyard in 
neighboring portsmouth for decommissioning work before it goes into 
mothballs at the philadelphia naval yard next year 
shortly after the ship was commissioned in 1943 it carried 
president franklin roosevelt to a war conference for the trip the 
ship was outfitted with a bathtub and to this day remains the only 
navy ship with a bathtub 
after protecting aircraft carriers during pacific battles the 
iowa was decommissioned in 1949 two years later it was returned 
to service for the korean war 
the ship was back in mothballs from 1958 to 1984 when it was 
recommissioned as part of the navy buildup to a 600ship fleet the 
navy continued to use the ships 16inch guns which could fire at 
targets as far away as 20 miles and added cruise missiles 
after the april 1989 explosion off puerto rico the ship 
returned to sea within two months with the damaged gun turret 
sealed officials estimated repairs would cost 13 million which 
led to the decision to mothball the ship as part of efforts to cut 
the federal budget deficit 
navy investigators said a disgruntled gunners mate sabotaged 
the guns but questions about the findings from the victims 
families and members of congress led to a new probe that should be 
completed in a few months 
the battleship uss new jersy will be decommisioned in february 
leaving the navy with two battleships the uss wisconsin and the 
uss missouri

colombias two main cocaine cartels have 
resumed their bloody war with a series of titfortat kidnappings 
and murders police said friday 
twelve men were kidnapped thursday from a slum hotel in 
medellin colombias secondlargest city and within hours two were 
found murdered and a third was wounded according to a national 
police report 
all the men were residents of cali home base to a cocaine 
cartel that competes with the medellin clan for access to the 
lucrative us drug market 
police said the two murdered men had long criminal records they 
were apparently in medellin to take revenge for the murders last 
month of 19 people killed by members of the medellin cartel in the 
outskirts of cali the police said 
also thursday two men and a woman were found murdered at a 
private house in the capital of bogota the police report said 
their bodies were discovered bound and gagged 
red paint sprayed on the walls read death to those of the 
medellin cartel security forces found a car packed with about 70 
pounds of dynamite police said was apparently for use in terrorist 
attacks in the capital 
the report added that bogota police on thursday also arrested 
three men suspected of carrying out terror attacks for the medellin 
cartel the suspects possessed blueprints of an army recruiting 
building where they apparently were planning an attack the report 
said 
on friday security forces shot dead nine people allegedly 
responsible for a kidnapping 23 days earlier the three abducted 
people were freed during the operation in a small town about 45 
miles south of bogota bogota police commander yazim yanine said 
he said police had not determined if the kidnappings were linked 
to drug traffickers 
so far this year 950 people have been kidnapped in colombia 
according to official figures drug traffickers leftist guerrillas 
and common criminals seeking ransom money are most often 
responsible 
the medellin and cali cartels have been fighting each other for 
two years to gain control of the multimilliondollar us cocaine 
markets 
authorities say the medellin cartel the main target of a 
government antidrug crackdown has lost ground to the cali gang in 
recent months 
the medellin cartel has been blamed for killing about 550 
colombians including three presidential candidates since the 
government and the cartel declared war on each other in august 
1989 
the medellin mafias most recent offenses were the kidnappings 
two months ago of seven journalists including the daughter of a 
former president and the news editor of the countrys leading 
newspaper el tiempo 
the journalists and marina montoya sister of colombias 
ambassador to canada are still in captivity drug traffickers are 
apparently trying to force the government into granting them a 
pardon 
in a related develpment antonio navarro the first exguerrilla 
to hold a cabinet position resigned as health minister friday to 
run for a seat in colombias national assembly which will reform 
the countrys 104yearold constitution 
navarro was appointed in august months after his m19 leftist 
guerrilla group signed a peace treaty with the government recent 
public opinion polls indicate that navarro would be a shoein for 
one of 70 seats in an upcoming constitutional assembly

house and senate negotiators agreed early 
friday to give president bush the debt relief he seeks for egypt 
but at the same time defied the president in slashing aid to el 
salvador 
after an allnight and often stormy marathon bargaining session 
the two sides set up a difficult choice for the president whether 
to swallow an unwanted 50 percent cut in el salvador military aid 
to win forgiveness of egypts 67 billion in past military debt 
both new provisions are part of a 155 billion foreign aid bill 
for the year that began oct 1 which includes economic and 
military support for americas friends and allies around the globe 
bargainers faced with a likely weekend adjournment of congress 
began thursday and worked all night to come up with a compromise 
package that could be sent to the full house and senate in time to 
get the bill enacted 
bushs senior advisers have threatened a veto over the el 
salvador provisions which are a departure from nearly 10 years of 
us policy begun during the reagan administration 
but the erasure of egypts debt intended as a reward for 
cairos leadership of the arab response in the persian gulf crisis 
is a powerful incentive for bush to accept the package 
the entire us and world position against iraqi president 
saddam hussein and iraq will be at risk if the debt is not 
forgiven as bush promised said sen robert kasten rwis the 
senior gop member of the senate appropriations foreign aid 
subcommittee 
and subcommittee chairman patrick leahy dvt said the gesture 
was nothing less than a test of american resolve i dont want a 
war to start in the middle east because people questioned the 
commitment of the united states he argued 
but house subcommittee chairman david obey dwis countered 
that he would have difficulty winning votes for the bill in the 
house if it fully forgives egypts debt members facing elections 
just two weeks away will find it hard to support such a gesture 
while voting for higher taxes for their constituents he said 
and obey complained heatedly that bush made the promise to 
egyptian president hosni mubarak without consulting lawmakers 
first the congress got sandbagged on this issue he said 
the el salvador provision calls for an immediate 50 percent cut 
in this years 85 million in military aid as a step toward 
creating incentives for the san salvador government and the leftist 
fmln rebels to end their decadelong civil war with a negotiated 
political settlement 
if the rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
walk away from unsponsored peace talks the aid could be 
restored but if the government fails to pursue peace it could 
lose the other half of its military aid 
the arrangement represents a major change in us policy toward 
el salvador which has received aid at a rate of nearly 1 million 
a day in recent years it also was a victory for congressional 
opponents of administration policy who are weary of 10 years of 
aid which has done little to encourage moderation in the central 
american country 
in other provisions the bill pointedly omits any specific 
earmark for pakistan which in past years has been the 
thirdlargest recipient of us aid in fact it erects new hurdles 
before aid can be ranted including certification that this weeks 
elections were free and fair and restoration of full civil 
liberties 
israel is the top beneficiary of the bill with some 3 billion 
in cash military and economic aid and millions more in noncash 
benefits the conferees agreed to include a section that would let 
the united states give israel up to 700 million worth of new 
weaponry from pentagon stocks 
in addition to the debt forgiveness egypt is the secondlargest 
cash aid recipient with 21 billion the money for the two middle 
eastern countries stems from their camp david peace accord and 
their status as staunch us allies in the region 
the bill provides a total of 31 billion for economic aid and 
46 billion for military aid the remaining funds go for other 
programs including health and environmental assistance and 
contributions to the world bank and other multilateral 
institutions 
congress is giving the administration more latitude than usual 
to decide how to distribute the money 
but lawmakers did include specific earmarks for several favored 
countries jordan 35 million in economic aid morocco 20 
million in economic and 43 million in military aid greece 350 
million in military aid turkey 500 million in military aid and 
625 million in economic aid for peru bolivia and colombia 
the bill also includes 800 million for subsaharan africa 75 
million for lebanon 20 million for ireland 364 million for 
eastern europe and up to 20 million for humanitarian and 
development aid in cambodia 
the philippines would get 160 million for this years payment 
on a fiveyear 1 billion aid program called the multilateral 
assistance initiative that is 40 million less than the 
administration had asked and the same as last years amount

an israeli report on the temple mount killings 
exonerated police friday for using live gunfire on rioting stone 
throwers but it severely criticized police commanders for ignoring 
warning signs of potential riots 
the report drew immediate criticism from palestinians and 
israeli leftists and brought renewed demands for israel to allow a 
united nations investigation into the deaths of 20 palestinians in 
the oct 8 bloodbath 
the threeman israeli investigative team said palestinians 
started the riots still it accused police commanders of failing 
to heed the danger that rioting could easily erupt in the heated 
atmosphere among moslems at the shrine and it said there was 
indiscriminate use of live ammunition 
the panel appointed by prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
danger to policemens lives justified the overall use of gunfire 
but also emphasized the immediate need to develop alternatives to 
the use of live ammunition 
in the riots at the shrine in jerusalems walled old city more 
than 140 people were wounded by gunshots in addition to those 
killed according to hospitals 
police intially listed 19 dead but fridays report increased 
the toll to 20 
the killings brought a hail of international criticism of 
israel on oct 12 the un security council condemned the use of 
excessive force and on wednesday it delored israels refusal to 
accept a un investigation 
both resolutions were backed by the united states israels 
chief ally 
fridays 59page report blamed the start of the rioting on 
violent and threatening calls through loudspeakers at the 
mounts two mosques including an exhortation to slaughter the 
jews 
a barrage of rocks and metal objects was then unloosed at 
policemen on the mount the report said 
the commission has concluded tat the lives of the police on 
the temple mount were endangered and that they feared for their 
lives and for the lives of thousands of worshipers at the western 
wall the report said 
stones hitting jews caused an intensely emotional reaction since 
the wall also known at the wailing wall is revered as the last 
remnant of the ancient jewish temple 
initial reports said the stoning began when as many as 20000 
jews were at the wall for prayers during the eightday festival of 
sukkot but the report noted that the first stones were aimed at 
police on the mount above 55 minutes after the prayers ended when 
jews began moving away 
it listed nine jews injured at the wall and 21 police hurt by 
rocks during the 40 minutes before police issued a ceasefire 
order 
after tear gas and rubber bullets failed to halt the rioting 
police retreated from the mosque compound the report said it said 
they began to use live ammunition as they charged back onto the 
mount 
the live fire also was justified by pleas for rescue from two 
police on the mount the report said however it later turned out 
the men already had been rescued by moslem officials 
the use of uncontrolled fire by police was not mentioned until 
the nexttolast page of the report 
it said there was indiscriminate use of live ammunition 
implying it came when lives were no longer in danger and the temple 
mount area was under control 
the reports strongest criticism was aimed at jerusalem police 
chief aryeh bibi and district commander rahamim comfort saying 
they did not recognize the potential for rioting and were not even 
present in the area 
police had prior reports of the possibility of riots on the 
temple mount but the two commanders reacted with an attitude that 
was routine and even mistaken the report said 
it added we found virtually no attitude of special 
sensitivity when masses of jewish worshipers were in the 
western wall plaza while at the same time opposite on the temple 
mount thousands of impassioned youths were gathering 
the temple mount is also holy to moslems who call it the haram 
essharif and believe it is the spot where prophet mohammed 
ascended to heaven 
the rioting erupted on a day when a group of extremist jews had 
announced a gathering to lay a cornerstone for the building of a 
third jewish temple atop the moslemcontrolled mount 
although police blocked the march the groups members were 
allowed in the area and rumors persisted among moslems that the 
zealots were going to assault the mount 
the commission did not recommend disciplinary action against 
police officials saying that was not part of its mandate but 
police minister roni milo told reporters that after he studied the 
commissions findings the necessary conclusions will be drawn 
after the report was released the liberal shinui party and the 
communists both urged the government again to allow a un team to 
probe the killings 
tzali reshev of the peace now movement charged that the report 
left many questions unanswered palestinians said it did not take 
their side of the story into account 
this was not a committee of investigation but one formulating 
the government of israels stand said faisal husseini the 
leading plo supporter in jerusalem

hundreds of hopeful coal miners created 
the soviet unions first nationwide independent trade union friday 
unanimously accepting an ambitious plan to reduce government 
control over their lives 
the new association of independent unions of miners will act as 
an umbrella organization for an unlimited number of local unions 
membership could include 2 million miners and an unknown number of 
students engineers rescue workers and others who work at the 
countrys 600 mines 
it could become the countrys largest mass organization outside 
the 18 millionmember communist party 
the new confederation created during the second nationwide 
miners congress in this industrial ukrainian city plans to use 
national strikes to push its demands which range from better 
medical care and mining equipment to profitsharing and higher 
salaries 
the 900 delegates to the congress put off calling any strikes 
until the parliament of the russian federation the largest soviet 
republic finishes its special session in december 
the union registered its first victory just hours after its 
formation when a deputy minister of the coal industry agreed to 
dispatch a special commission to investigate complaints about 
unfair firings at several mines 
however the new union still faces several hurdles in 
establishing itself 
the soviet coal industry and its official union administer 
dozens of schools hospitals vacation resorts and housing 
complexes in addition to mines and mineral processing factories 
miners have become accustomed to the stateprovided services and 
the new union has yet to decide which of the tasks it can or should 
try to take over 
it was also unclear how many miners might join the new union or 
remain loyal to the official one 
we have created a new union but the old one still exists 
konstantin fesenko a miner from donetsk told the congress the 
old and new unions at some point might negotiate to come together 
but the current apparatchiks must go first 
the delegates many of whom fear for their jobs without 
government guarantees and subsidies were deadlocked for most of 
the congress over whether and how to create an independent union 
the impasse was broken when a group of 130 miners fed up with 
the delays split thursday night to form an independent union led 
by radicals from the kuznetsk basin a mining region in western 
siberia 
on friday morning the congress voted by unanimous show of hands 
to absorb the radicals union into its new much larger 
confederation 
vyacheslav golikov leader of the radicals drafted a charter 
that became the basis of the new confederation it calls for the 
union to represent and defend miners interests in negotiations 
with the government take actions based on a consensus of its 
members administer a strike fund and set up a bank for the miners 
on friday the congress approved the charter and created a 
20member executive bureau to plan the unions first conference no 
date or location was set 
miners were told to return home to solicit members for the new 
local unions that will in turn elect representatives to a union 
legislature 
the union will be funded by deductions from miners monthly 
wages which average 673 about onethird more than the national 
average 
delegates at the congress represented hundreds of workers 
committees that sprang up during a series of strikes across the 
country in 1989 the biggest wave of strikes that summer threatened 
nearly half the countrys energy supplies and forced concessions 
from the government including promises to improve safety equipment 
and supplies of consumer goods 
however the miners say many of the promises have not been kept 
at their first congress in june they demanded the resignation of 
the national council of ministers or cabinet led by prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov 
the central government has not fulfilled its promises said 
alexander sergeyev a kuznetsk miner now we demand financial and 
material support from the government during the countrys 
transition to a market economy the official union also must give 
back dues to workers who are leaving to join our new union 
in a parallel congress in moscow this week the official central 
council of trade unions voted to reconstitute itself as a voluntary 
organization previously all trade unions had been required to 
belong to it 
organizers of the donetsk congress denounced the central 
councils move as a facade to hide continuing government control of 
unions a representative of the council told the congress friday 
that the councils leaders would meet soon to decide whether to 
recognize the new union

a federal commission on friday proposed a 
carrotandstick approach to deter and punish corporate crime 
promising massive fines for unrepentant wrongdoers 
the us sentencing commission announced a complex set of 
alternatives designed to assure that businesses operate within the 
law 
i am convinced that the guidelines the commission ultimately 
adopts will motivate organizations who might otherwise commit 
crimes to conform to acceptable standards of behavior said 
commission chairman william w wilkins jr a federal appellate 
judge 
the proposals are premised on a carrotandstick approach that 
provides incentives for organizations to establish meaningful 
compliance programs that deter detect and report criminal conduct 
by their agents and employees he said 
the sevenmember commission asked for public comment on the 
guidelines which could be amended before they are submitted to 
congress early next year 
for example in one set of alternatives the commission proposed 
a range of fines from 5000 to 165 million depending on the 
severity of the offense 
businesses could lessen the fines by promptly and voluntarily 
reporting the offense prior to a government investigation by 
adopting programs to prevent future abuses and by proving that the 
companys management was not involved 
jail terms for individual offenders are not covered by the 
proposals 
the commission formed in 1985 established sentencing 
guidelines for individuals in 1987 the constitutionality of those 
guidelines covering all forms of criminal behavior were upheld by 
the supreme court and are unaffected by the proposed business code 
an earlier commission draft on punishing corporations was 
attacked at a public hearing in february business groups said they 
were too tough public interest representatives said they did not 
go far enough 
the sevenmember panel then revised the draft 
the new proposals by offering incentives for compliance are 
designed to meet some of the business opposition without 
excessively softening the penalties 
wilkins in a speech thursday said the plan rewards the 
organization for its positive actions taken to prevent and detect 
criminal conduct but significantly punishes the organizatoon 
that does not have its house in order it rewards the good and 
punishes the bad 
other proposals by the commission would 
require corporations to surrender all illegal gains in addition 
to any fines 
require they pay restitution to compensate victims 
force out of business any enterprise created for criminal 
purposes by seizing its assets 
give judges power to impose extra penalties for businesses that 
engage in particularly serious offenses such as threatening the 
environment or national security 
put businesses on courtsupervised probation to assure future 
compliance

thomas root the lawyer who was found 
with a gunshot wound following an airplane crash in the atlantic 
pleaded no contest friday to 364 counts of securities fraud 
conspiracy and related charges 
under a plea bargain root agreed to a 15year prison sentence 
and a 5000 fine which will not be imposed until january he also 
agreed to testify against others indicted in an alleged securities 
scam 
the state dismissed 91 other charges against root 
root who faced up to 1812 years in prison if convicted of all 
455 charges called the agreement an offer so attractive to me 
that i could not refuse it 
i continue to suspect that my name was included in the 
indictment not because of my culpability but rather because my 
notoriety from my illfated airplane flight in july 1989 ensured 
the prosecution of getting plenty of press attention for the 
indictments he said 
root 37 who is a washington lawyer passed out in the cockpit 
of his singleengine plane during a flight from washington to rocky 
mount nc the plane which was shadowed by military planes 
eventually crashed in the ocean off the coast of florida 
root was pulled from the ocean after the crash and rescuers 
discovered he had been shot in the abdomen root has insisted that 
a pistol he kept in the plane discharged during the crash but 
experts have questioned his explanation of the wound 
fifteen years is a pretty good sentence said secretary of 
state rufus edmisten whose office was investigating root and 
sonrise management services at the time of roots aerial odyssey 
it indicates were not going to tolerate securities fraud in this 
state 
a nash county grand jury in june returned 24 indictments 
containing 2695 counts against root and other officials of sonrise 
management and telemedia inc 
sonrise helped form partnerships to federal licenses for 
lowpower fm radio stations edmisten said only a handful of 
sonrises 1600 investors ever received a license 
in all 1018 people in north carolina contributed more than 
8 million to this organization edmisten said nationally 
more than 16 million was invested by people from 25 states

federal sentence he receives root pleaded guilty to five federal 
securities charges in june and is awaiting sentencing

with prime minister felipe gonzalez after arrival friday raisa 
maximovna changed into a black tweed suit and set out to see the 
spanish capital 
her arrival at plaza de espana a square in the heart of 
downtown madrid best known for its monument to don quixote and as a 
haven for homeless african refugees startled pigeons and 
passersby

even if congress agrees on a massive 
deficitreduction plan the nations deficit is still expected to 
hit a record 250 billion this year and the 3 trillion federal 
debt will continue to swell 
as usual the public is being overpromised or the rhetoric is 
such that its misleading that this is the deal that will do away 
with the deficit once and for all said stan collender who 
watches federal budget policy for the price waterhouse accounting 
firm 
analysts said many americans are probably unaware that the 250 
billion deficitreduction plan which congress and the bush 
administration spent months feuding over will rein in deficit 
spending but wont eliminate it 
the white house estimates the deficit for the current fiscal 
year which began oct 1 will be 294 billion the budget 
legislation before congress would trim that by roughly 40 billion 
so another 254 billion will get added to the nations longterm 
debt 
the size of the deficit which totalled 2204 billion in the 
fiscal year ending sept 30 could be even worse in fiscal 1991 if 
the nations struggling economy continues to sour 
next year when the projection of the deficit is released 
theres going to be a continued amount of cynicism the publics 
probably going to say we went through all this and the deficit 
is still going to be 250 billion collender said 
still the budget watchers stress the significance of the 
deficitreduction plan noting its the largest oneyear reduction 
ever 
its a bloody miracle they managed to keep it as big as they 
have its a very significant achievement carol cox president 
of the committee for a responsible federal budget said of 
congress 250 billion fiveyear package of new taxes and spending 
slashes 
the impact of the deficit reduction plan is relative collender 
said 
compared to what the deficit would be if you didnt do this 
it will make a significant dent compared to zero its pretty 
big he said 
the deficit is the amount by which spending exceeds revenue in a 
given year while the national debt is the compilation of years of 
deficits 
the national debt reached its first trillion in 1981 and has 
tripled since then as reagan cut taxes at the same time a military 
buildup was occurring the inability to reduce the federal deficit 
was considered the major economic failure of the reagan 
administration 
the bill now going through congress would cut the deficit 250 
billion over the next five years by raising taxes and limiting 
medicare and other mandatory spending another 250 billion would 
come principally from scaling back military spending and cutting 
interest expenses by reducing government borrowing 
the bill envisions that todays federal debt of 3 trillionplus 
will soar to 5 trillion by the end of the fiveyear period 
the only way to make a bigger stab at the debt is to even out 
spending with revenue income analysts note 
theres no magic to it you cut spending or increase taxes 
which means you need a certain amount of political will that 
doesnt exist right now collender said

the government of moldavia clamped a state of 
emergency on its southern region friday after the gagauz ethnic 
minority declared sovereignty from the republic and began holding 
local elections 
the communist party newspaper pravda said the republic was on 
the brink of civil war as volunteer brigades of collegeage 
moldavians arrived in the disputed area to try to stop the 
separatist movement 
about 150000 gagauz who are of turkish descent live in 
moldavia and make up about 3 percent of its 43 million people 
they claim 11 percent of its territory 
the largely agricultural republic which borders romania is the 
latest of several soviet republics to face separatist movements and 
ethnic tension 
the conflicts in moldavia armenia georgia and elsewhere are 
fragmenting the country and pose a serious obstacle to president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
on thursday the graingrowing republic of kazakhstan declared 
sovereignty becoming the 14th of the 15 soviet republics to assert 
some form of autonomy from moscow 
as its first act of defiance the kazakh legislature banned 
nuclear explosions anywhere on its territory including 
semipalatinsk one of the main soviet sites for testing warheads 
the only soviet republic that has yet to declare sovereignty is 
kirgizia a mountainous region of central asia the kirgiz 
parliament has been debating the issue and is expected to issue a 
declaration soon 
moldavian parliament speaker alexander moshanu appealed on 
television thursday night for maximum restraint calm and 
tolerance to prevent clashes between volunteers and the gagauz 
people 
militants on both sides are ready to cast us into the abyss of 
violence moshanu warned 
tass the official soviet news agency said moldavias 
parliament imposed the state of emergency after gagauz leaders 
refused to negotiate with moldavian president mirca snegur 
the parliament also voted to abolish local government bodies in 
the region and replace them with committees appointed by the 
republic tass said 
movement in and out of the region was restricted and public 
rallies and other meetings banned for two months the state of 
emergency will be enforced by soviet interior ministry troops under 
the control of officials in the republic tass said 
the gagauz people who are predominately christian fled to 
moldavia from turkish moslem rule in northeastern bulgaria in the 
early decades of the 19th century they speak a turkic language and 
are traditionally farmers and shepherds 
in recent years they have complained of discrimination by the 
moldavian majority objecting in particular to a law making 
moldavian the republics official language and replacing the 
cyrillic alphabet with the roman one 
police blocked roads leading to the gagauz region on friday 
after columns of buses carrying volunteers in their late teens and 
early 20s began arriving from central moldavia the independent 
interfax news agency said 
interfax quoted moldavias interior ministry as saying that 
20000 to 25000 volunteers arrived in the south of the republic 
to prevent the further conducting of the elections 
the volunteer brigades were organized by the moldavian peoples 
front and other nationalist organizations 
auriel sorokovich a spokesman for the peoples front said in a 
telephone interview that as many as 50000 unarmed volunteers were 
headed to the region to help the militia in case of violence 
volunteers now serve as a psychological attack on the gagauz 
leaders to prevent them from inciting any undesirable 
developments he said 
they will be used only after the militia decide that they 
cant cope with the situation themselves the volunteers are now 
placed in the vicinity of the republics key points they are ready 
to occupy buildings and capture documents if the need arises he 
added 
interfax said gagauz independence activists were also organizing 
volunteer units and it quoted unidentified sources as saying that 
soviet paratroopers and military equipment were taking up positions 
to prevent likely interethnic clashes 
tass said a dozen armored personnel carriers were sent to the 
town of chemishlia 50 miles southwest of the moldavian capital 
kishinev it said several thousand moldavians were massing in the 
town 
the conflict was precipitated by the gagauz elections which 
were to choose an autonomous government 
soviet republics and smaller regions like gagauz have been 
breaking away at an acclerating pace since march when the baltic 
republic of lithuania declared independence 
in addition to being the first to seek autonomy lithuania has 
gone further than any of the other republics or regions asserting 
full and immediate independence as a separate state 
most of the others have declared only a limited form of 
sovereignty usually defined as the right to overrule national laws 
and control natural resources 
nevertheless the moves toward autonomy could impede gorbachevs 
efforts to put an economic reform plan into effect throughout the 
country because some republics want to move further and faster 
toward a market economy than others

the us treasury said it will pay 16 
million to indians in michigans upper peninsula for land they gave 
up more than 100 years ago 
weve been waiting a long time my grandparents and my parents 
taught us about the indian money myrtle tolonen of the keweenaw 
bay band of chippewa indians said thursday 
the checks will be paid to more than 2070 members of the tribe 
said art staples a tribal operations specialist with the federal 
bureau of indian affairs the tribes governing body received a 
matching sum of money several years ago 
the money compensates the tribe for a host of wrongs between 
1850 and 1910 when the united states took land and timber from the 
western great lakes region some indians were underpaid for their 
land and others were swindled out of their holdings staples said 
tribal chairman fred dakota said the amount seems too small 
weve gotten so little and given so much he said 
staples said the checks will be written as soon as the federal 
government finishes reviewing the names submitted by the tribe 
all tribal members as of oct 17 1983 the date the 
distribution plan was approved by congress are eligible for the 
money which will be divided evenly among them each check should 
be about 770 
it took the keweenaw tribe seven years to compile the list of 
names 
tolonen the tribes enrollment director said her office in 
baraga has been swamped with inquiries from tribal members about 
when the checks will arrive 
the people are frustrated she said they were supposed to 
have these done by sept 13 
the payment is one of many ordered by the us court of claims 
staples said several other chippewa tribes in wisconsin and 
minnesota already have received land claim payments 
ottawa and chippewa tribes in michigans eastern upper peninsula 
and western lower peninsula still are negotiating among themselves 
how to split more than 10 million they were awarded in the 1970s 
staples said interest on that claim has swelled the amount to 
almost 46 million

the senate gave final congressional approval 
friday to the nations first postcold war defense budget a 268 
billion package that embraces modest cuts in weapons systems geared 
to the soviet threat 
by a vote of 8017 the senate adopted legislation that 
represents a 14 billion reduction from spending in the last fiscal 
year but is far less than the reduction congress clamored for when 
the warsaw pact was collapsing 
this budget has as its primary goal to help protect our nation 
against the threat that we face in a dangerous world said sen 
sam nunn dga 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee cited the 
soviet unions continued modernization of its strategic forces and 
iraqs conquest of kuwait as the argument against drastic cuts in 
military spending 
an opponent of the legislation sen william roth rdel said 
the budget fails to reflect the most startling political 
developments in the western world since the end of world war ii 
congress is no longer a new breed of budgetcutters but 
cold war warriors roth said 
the legislation now goes to the white house where bushs 
approval was anticipated shortly after the vote the senate 
adopted the budgets companion authorization bill 
the bills fail to terminate any weapons in the pentagons 
arsenal and continue limited production of the b2 bomber the 
stealth aircraft built to locate targets in the soviet union after 
a nuclear war 
among the other provisions are 
a cut of 2 billion from bushs budget request of 47 billion 
for the proposed antimissile shield commonly called star wars 
a troop reduction of about 80000 from the 21 million level of 
active duty forces the administration had suggested a cut of about 
38000 
the creation of a 680 million budget for landbased nuclear 
missiles bush proposed 22 billion for the mx missile and a plan 
to move them from fixed silos to railroad cars and 202 million for 
development of the midgetman missile 
although the package won quick house approval thursday debate 
and final passage took just 11 minutes the budget for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 touched off fierce disagreement on the 
senate floor 
we must continue to press for defense spending reduction at 
least down to the prereagan cold war average said sen tim 
wirth dcolo and a member of the senate armed services committee 
wirth charged that the bill fails to reflect the lessening 
soviet threat specifically it includes bushs full request of 
118 million for the sramt a nuclear weapon designed to be fired 
from aircraft stationed at nato bases in europe 
has the world changed my lord it certainly has the berlin 
wall is down the warsaw pact doesnt exist anymore the soviet 
union is falling apart wirth said here we are building cold 
war systems it makes no sense whatsoever 
the ranking members of the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
defense argued that deep reductions would leave the military in a 
precarious state and call into question the us commitment to its 
volunteer force 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii who lost his arm in world war ii 
recalled how after the conflict thenpresident truman submitted an 
11 billion defense budget hat congress cut in half 
somehow it sent a signal to governments around the world the 
rest is history inouye said referring to the korean war 
the legislation also doubles the callup period for combat 
reserves from 180 days to 360 days lawmakers have urged the use of 
combat reserves in the military buildup in the persian gulf

a 79yearold physician will leave the 
bulk of his estate 10 million to the college of the ozarks to 
inspire others to give the small school money officials said 
its a very unusual story college president jerry c davis 
said 
the california man whose identity was not made public by the 
liberal arts school took an interest in the college after reading 
about it in the wall street journal in 1973 davis said thursday 
after visiting the school nestled in scenic ozarks hills the 
doctor decided to make the donation after his death to get others 
to give money davis said 
that article was the only contact he had with the school 
davis said in fact he had never been here until about a year 
ago 
the 10 million will be used to endow a school of natural 
sciences professorships and scholarships and to construct a new 
classroomoffice building to be named after the man 
it is my hope that this commitment will enable you to start 
your campaign to raise substantial sums of money the man wrote 
in a letter to davis i want to challenge others to help 
strengthen and prepare the college for the future 
davis said the colleges emphasis on work experience contributed 
to the mans decision 
the college has an enrollment of about 1400 including 1200 
fulltime students all the fulltime students work at one of 65 
campus jobs or industries to pay for part of their education the 
remaining portion is provided through scholarships gifts and 
donations 
college of the ozarks formerly school of the ozarks was 
founded in 1906 to educate students who were financially unable to 
enter other schools 
the school has been ranked in us news and world report 
magazine as one of the top 10 liberal arts schools in the midwest 
for the past two years and the best buy college in the region

mayor marion barry drew a sixmonth prison 
term friday for cocaine possession from a judge who said barrys 
drug use had given aid comfort and encouragement to the 
illegal drug culture barry said the sentence came from the 
american injustice system 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson could have merely 
sentenced the mayor to probation but said barrys breach of 
public trust alone warrants an enhanced sentence 
the judge stayed the sentence which also includes a 5000 
fine pending an appeal which defense attorney r kenneth mundy 
formally filed later in the day 
pleading for leniency before the sentence the mayor said he had 
led an exemplary life since his arrest last january in a 
downtown hotel barry had been lured there by former girlfriend 
rasheeda moore and was videotaped smoking crack cocaine by fbi 
agents operating concealed cameras 
after the sentencing barry said i should have been shocked 
and stunned but im not i understand that there are different 
sets of standards for different people and thats the american 
injustice system 
mundy who argued during the trial that barry had been singled 
out for prosecution because he is a wellknown black official said 
after the sentencing that the judge had made the mayor a whipping 
boy for all the ills that beset the district of columbia 
in addition to his biting criticism of barry the judge also had 
harsh words for the jury which acquitted barry of another 
misdemeanor drug possession charge and deadlocked on 12 other 
counts nine misdemeanors and three felony perjury charges 
the jurors will have to answer to themselves and to their 
fellow citizens for the way in which they discharged their duty 
jackson said 
the judge recommended that federal prison authorities place 
barry in a drug treatment program 
barry who is running for city council after declining to seek 
election to a fourth term as mayor was also ordered to serve a 
year of probation following his release from prison during that 
time jackson said the mayor would be required to submit to random 
drug tests 
the misdemeanor conviction and sentence does not disqualify 
barry from holding or seeking public office 
barry was also ordered to reimburse the federal government for 
the cost of his incarceration the mayors imprisonment would cost 
5167 if as is likely he is sent to a minimumsecurity prison 
according to bureau of prison figures 
the prevalence of the public rumors of defendants frequent 
and conspicuous drug use never dispelled and now unfortunately 
shown to have been true has given aid comfort and encouragement 
to the drug culture at large jackson said 
barrys drug use contributed to the anguish that illegal drugs 
have inflicted on this city in so many ways for so long jackson 
said 
having failed as the good example he might have been to the 
citizens of washington dc and in particular to the young who 
are much more likely to respond to example than to admonition the 
defendant must now become an example of another kind the judge 
said 
the judge said that he would ignore what i perceive to have 
been the defendants efforts once prosecution had commenced to 
induce the jury to disregard the law and the evidence 
us attorney jay b stephens told reporters he was satisfied 
with what he called a fair sentence even though prosecutors had 
sought a oneyear prison term barrys drug use contributed to 
this citys and our nations most devastating problem stephens 
said 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement that 
barrys sentence brings this case to a just conclusion and sends 
a clear and continuing message that the use of illegal drugs will 
not be tolerated in our society 
but mundy the mayors lawyer said outside the us courthouse 
that the final chapter has not been written 
there were people in the district of columbia who were using 
drugs before the mayor used drugs and there will be people who will 
keep using drugs after the mayor stops using drugs he said 
mundy also said that others convicted of far more serious 
offenses had been given probation in the same courthouse the 
lawyer cited former white house aide michael k deaver whom 
jackson placed on probation for lying under oath about his lobbying 
activities 
in court barry who was accompanied by his wife effi and his 
mother told jackson that if i appear to be nervous i am my 
stomach is in knots 
the mayor described how he sat down several months ago to begin 
composing a letter to the judge in which acknowledged he was a 
recovering drug addict and alcoholic 
i stand here truly remorseful the mayor told jackson 
prosecutor judith e retchin scoffed at barrys expressions of 
contrition first he blamed the government then he blamed 
rasheeda now he blames alcohol

following are excerpts from the probe into this 
months temple mount killings the report presented to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir on friday was translated in part by the 
government press office and in part by the associated press 
the moslem gathering on the temple mount exceeded the intended 
norms of a holy site the members of the waqf moslem religious 
authority knew that the high court refused the temple mount 
faithful petition to lay the cornerstone of the third temple and 
did not respond to requests by israeli police officers on the 
morning of the incident to calm the crowd 
the incident began when suddenly violent and threatening calls 
were sounded on the speakers allah akbar god is great 
jihad holy war itbakh alyahud slaughter the jews 
many in the incited rioting mob threw stones and metal objects 
from a very short range and some even wielded knives 
the storming of more than 2000 moslems toward border police 
some of whom were wounded compelled them to use tear gas shoot 
rubber bullets and retreat in alarm at this stage live fire was 
shot by only two commanders at the same time border police warned 
worshipers at the western wall also known as the wailing wall to 
begin evacuation 
the breaking into the temple mount came as a result of the 
continued rioting and barrage of stones and in fear for the lives 
of two policemen caught in the temple mount police station due 
to lack of communications the police commanders did not know that 
the policemen trapped in the station succeeded in escaping on their 
own 
the charging police forces gathered hastily in his orders to 
the forces jerusalem commander aryeh bibi permitted use of live 
ammunition in accordance with police regulations at this point the 
commander bibi knew the lives of the two policemen on the temple 
mount were in danger 
the forces organized randomly for the charge and not all heard 
the orders some arrived as reinforcements from other units and 
were not known to the commanders 
during the charge there was indiscriminate use of live 
ammunition the rescue of the two policemen trapped inside the 
temple mount police station and the ammunition there justified a 
quick operation the use of fire rubber bullets and tear gas 
and finally of live ammunition against the stone throwers was 
justified 
in other instances in which the rioters continued to throw 
stones and to threaten the lives of the charging police use of 
live ammunition was justified when police were under attack and 
their lives were in danger 
in the advance of the police to the line of the mosques and the 
police station on the mount the police were caught in a 
lifethreatening situation the use of live ammunition was without 
strict supervision by officers groups and individuals acted on 
their own judgment north of the line of the mosques some were 
caught in difficult situations that forced them to use their 
weapons the capture of the line between the police station and 
alaqsa mosque was essential but it is doubtful whether the 
cleaning up of the area and the conduct of arrests was 
essential in the conditions that prevailed on the mount 
after the stabilization of the line between the mosques 
officers initiated actions on their own judgment such initiatives 
in special emergency conditions have justification but on the 
temple mount because of its special nature and in nonemergency 
conditions such an initiative is dangerous there was a prominent 
case in which such an initiative was taken we did not find that 
this officers initiative caused injury or loss of life but the 
action remains grave 
in the incident on the temple mount there was no lack of 
advance information general warnings by the gss general security 
service israels intelligence agency and preachers leaflets 
and the numbers of groups of masked assailants who called for the 
gathering on the temple mount 
the mistake of the commissioner the commander of the southern 
district and the commander of the jerusalem region was in the 
evaluation of the information and in focusing on the assumption 
that if the laying of the cornerstone by the zealous temple mount 
faithful could be prevented everything would settle down 
peacefully as in the past 
a correct reading of the situation given the change in 
circumstances and conditions would have rendered possible the 
preventive deployment action that was demanded and necessary given 
this mistake the police did not deploy forces along the lines of 
past formats a forward command post was not set up as it should 
have been and a deterrent force was not concentrated to intervene 
as is acceptable 
there has to be an immediate implementation of the lessons of 
oct 8 faults have to be rectified the functioning of forces in 
the temple mount area in times of emergency as well as under 
regular conditions has to be reevaluated

the protesting students have complained about rundown schools 
rocard said he had instructed education minister lionel jospin 
to organize committees of student and teachers to ensure that 
conditions improve 
however one student leader shot back basically we havent 
won anything 
well stay in the street well keep up the pressure after 
vacation the student said speaking on condition of anonymity 
he spoke on the eve of a weeklong break for the nations students 
despite the strikes some students have been attending classes 
while others have boycotted them 
jospin said wednesday that 100 security guards would be added to 
schools most troubled by a wave of violence that touched off the 
strikes two weeks ago 
but student leaders in paris derided the step as insufficient 
and organized a march friday on the the citys left bank police 
estimated the crowd at 10000 students said 30000 took part 
sympathy strikes sprang up friday in smaller cities in lyon

two were hospitalized 
the marches began last week with a few hundred students in 
lowincome paris suburbs the violence that sent them into the 
streets included the rape of a girl in a bathroom assaults on 
several teachers and cases of extortion 
the hardesthit schools are those built in the 1960s near 
highrise projects hastily erected to house immigrant workers and 
poor french families

general mikhail a moiseyev the soviet 
armed forces chief of staff suggested friday that direct phone 
links be established between nato and soviet command posts 
he also proposed a permanent liaison between the panels of nato 
and soviet chiefs of staff 
speaking to reporters after three days of talks with senior nato 
military and political officials moiseyev said the moves would 
reflect the thaw in eastwest relations 
moiseyev said phone links between nato and soviet command posts 
could prevent a repeat of the scare on july 4 1988 when a soviet 
combat plane strayed into nato airspace its pilot had ejected over 
poland after an equipment malfunction 
the pilotless plane overflew germany the netherlands and 
belgium and crashed onto a house near the belgianfrench border 
killing one person 
on other topics moiseyev said the defense of all soviet 
republics some of which are clamoring for independence from 
moscow must remain with the soviet armed forces 
he said there was no disagreement about that not even in 
republics most ardently seeking to loosen moscows grip on them 
he brushed aside rumors that the armed forces might try to seize 
control of the soviet government to reverse the economic and 
political changes 
we support the people said moiseyev who was flanked by 
several highranking officers 
do we look like people who are preparing a coup detat dont 
be afraid take it easy and calm your colleagues he told 
reporters 
earlier in the week moiseyev had called for the dissolution of 
nato as a military organization saying the warsaw pact threatens 
no one in the east or west 
nato secretary general manfred woerner rejected that suggestion 
in a statement friday 
we need nato as a defense alliance woerner said that 
classical threat has gone but on the other hand there are many 
risks remaining uncertainties instabilities in the soviet 
union in eastern europe and in the crisis region of the persian 
gulf 
moiseyev said moscow was well on its way to removing its forces 
from eastern europe he said 20000 tanks 20000 artillery pieces 
and 860 combat aircraft had already been withdrawn along with 26 
submarines and 45 surface ships 
moiseyev said the soviet union was ready to negotiate the 
removal of all nuclear arms from europe we would like to see a 
europe and a world free of nuclear arms he said

president bush trying to escape blame for 
higher taxes accused the democraticcontrolled congress on friday 
of creating the federal budget mess that made him abandon his 
nonewtax pledge 
bush also accused democrats of playing politics with the civil 
rights bill that he had vetoed on the grounds that it would force 
employers to adopt hiring and promotion quotas 
theyre sitting around up there now bush said of congress 
referring to his alternative hiringdiscrimination proposal bush 
said they could pass it in 20 minutes if there was a genuine 
interest in civil rights and less interest in trying to embarrass 
the president of the united states 
bush unleashed his partisan attacks as he opened a fourday 
western campaign swing that will take him as far as hawaii he 
spoke at a gop fundraiser in conservative orange county and then 
flew to los angeles to stump for sen pete wilson in his close race 
for governor 
some veteran hollywood stars turned out to welcome the 
president including frank sinatra andy williams mel torme buddy 
ebsen and donald oconnor 
the president praised democrats for helping forge a budget deal 
but then turned around and blamed them for creating the deficit by 
being on an uncontrolled spending binge for years 
it is the united states congress that must be changed if this 
country is going to move ahead bush said you dont have to be 
a rocket scientist to know that congress has been spending more 
than we take in for far too long 
seizing on voters discontent with politicians bush endorsed 
the idea of limitations on the terms of members of congress he 
said it was one way to correct the abuse of power and the 
unbridled influence of an entrenched congressional staff and i say 
its an idea whose time has come 
with election day 11 days away republicans are worried that 
they will suffer heavierthanexpected political losses bush 
himself has plunged in the polls amid deep republican divisions 
over taxes and confusion over the presidents stands 
in accepting his presidential nomination at the 1988 republican 
national convention bush said and the congress will push me to 
raise taxes and ill say no and theyll push and ill say no 
and theyll push again and ill say to them read my lips no new 
taxes 
he took back that pledge back months ago saying revenue 
increases as well as spending cuts were necessary to fight the 
soaring federal deficit congress was putting the final touches on 
the budget package friday and bush was expected to sign it 
however bush said that democrats in congress were the real 
problem and he declared i believe the american people have had 
enough 
bush met with republican congressional leaders at the white 
house on thursday to plot the themes of his stump speeches and he 
came out of the gate swinging on friday 
some think that the differences between the parties are 
blurred and to that i say nonsense bush said republicans 
believe that power should be in the hands of people not in the 
government in washington dc 
bush said the deficitreduction package had forced him to make 
unpleasant compromises 
yes i have had to compromise havent liked that a bit he 
said yet bush said presidents sometimes have to bend for the good 
of the country 
even so he placed the blame for the deficit and thus the need 
for higher taxes squarely on the democrats 
in particular bush bridled at comments by house majority leader 
richard gephardt who accused the president of failing to tell 
americans why they were being asked to swallow strong medicine 
for 36 years his party the democratic party has controlled 
the house of representatives and year after year after year they 
have presided over these budget deficits they have appropriated 
every dime and they tell me how to spend every dime 
but the american people know all too well that strong medicine 
is required because a democratically controlled congress simply 
has been on an uncontrolled spending binge for years bush 
charged 
the president blended his attack with an appeal for approval of 
the deficitreduction deal 
the agreement that we get wont be the best deal possible but 
in my judgment it will be the best deal possible with this 
congress he said 
he briefly complimented house and senate democratic leaders for 
cooperating on the deficitreduction plan for that i salute 
them because i firmly believe that we must get an agreement to 
start getting these deficits under control bush said he did not 
mention the house gop revolt that helped scuttle the original 
deficitreduction deal 
democrats control the senate by 5545 and the house by 258175 
republicans had hoped to trim the senate margin and hold their 
house losses to fewer than 10 seats next month 
in addition to his orange county appearance bush was attending 
a los angeles luncheon for sen pete wilson who is in a tight race 
for governor with congress still in session wilson remained in 
washington but spoke to the irvine group by telephone 
after his california appearances the president was heading to 
hawaii to stump for senate candidate rep pat saiki and meet with 
leaders of 11 pacific island nations en route home monday he will 
make another stop for wilson in san francisco and then stop in 
oklahoma to campaign for gop gubernatorial candidate bill price

thousands of people were stranded without 
power friday on hatteras island after galeforce winds tore a 
dredge from its moorings and slammed it into the bonner bridge 
toppling a 369foot segment 
the 2mile span the only road link between the mainland and 
hatteras may be closed for months 
no injuries were reported 
state highway patrol sgt ac joyner rushed to close the bridge 
early friday after it was struck by the dredge northerly island 
the wind was blowing at 4550 mph and gusting to 60 mph when the 
collapse occurred less than an hour later 
you could see both of the guard rails move toward the west and 
then it just snapped joyner said 
nothings built for that kind of stress said clayton 
jenson superintendent of mclean contracting of chesapeake va 
which built the 26yearold bridge another section of the bridge 
was unstable jenson said 
its just a guess but i think its going to take five to six 
months to fix the bridge jenson said 
the accident combined with storms that kept ferries in port 
stranded thousands of people on the island and without power 
an estimated 5000 people live yearround on the island 
water supplies were limited state officials said 
tourism officials said the loss of the bridge at the peak surf 
fishing season could devastate hatteras economy 
authorities said ferries would be used saturday to shuttle food 
fuel and people across the inlet 
the bridge carries telephone and power lines to hatteras and 
the accident left some of those lines dangling over the inlet 
power was out on hatteras and on much of nearby ocracoke island 
home to 500600 people electric and telephone companies were 
waiting for weather conditions to ease before trying to restore 
service 
gwen a white a dare county spokeswoman said the county hoped 
to be able to run lines that could restore electricity within 48 
hours 
cars lined up at the ferry landings on hatteras and at ocracoke 
waiting for service to resume 
the accident came at the peak of the surf fishing months said 
gene obleness director of the county tourist bureau he estimated 
that if the bridge was closed for three months it would mean an 
18 million to 20 million loss 
gov jim martin declared a state of emergency after flying to 
the coast to survey the situation 
state transportation secretary thomas harrelson said the state 
was looking at landing points for ferries and was planning to set 
up a temporary crossing of the bridge 
if we could get one lane it would be a big help a good 
shot in the arm for the people of hatteras island mikey daniels 
chairman of the county commissioners told martin 
without the bridge to hatteras island the detour for someone 
trying to reach nags head about 10 miles north of the severed 
bridge would take more than 5 hours that trip includes more than 
125 miles of driving and two ferry rides one lasting 40 minutes 
and another taking 2 hours 
four of 10 people on the 200foot dredge scrambled up its 
3storyhigh pilots cabin to the top of the bridge before the 
collapse the six others decided to remain aboard to try to save 
the vessel the coast guard said they were fine 
the dredge was under contract to the army corps of engineers to 
dig the channel said richard adams of north american trailing co 
of oakbrook ill which owns the dredge

the mayor attempted on friday to defuse racial 
tensions at a grocery story after an intoxicated customer who died 
of a heart attack was dragged outside on his stomach 
angry residents of the poor predominantly black area were 
urging a boycott of the store owned by a family of 
koreanancestry the man who died james drumright 57 was black 
and many area residents said he would not have been dragged from 
the store if he was white or korean 
at the request of mayor kurt l schmoke however residents 
dispersed and owner kenny kang closed the bampm market for the day 
schmokes spokesman clint coleman said kang also apologized for 
the incident 
the mayor does not want the community to overreact to what is 
clearly an unfortunate situation coleman said 
drumright lay on the sidewalk for 20 minutes thursday morning 
before a passerby ran to a fire station for help about the same 
time the owner came to check on the man and called 911 for an 
ambulance drumright died a short time later at a hospital 
drumright had a bloodalcohol count of more than 20 percent 
when he died john smialek chief state medical examiner said 
after an autopsy was performed friday the level of legal 
intoxication in the state is 10 percent the autopsy also showed 
evidence of liver disease indicating drumright was a chronic 
alcoholic smialek said 
weve determined that mr drumright died from severe heart 
disease smialek said but he was also intoxicated from alcohol 
so it could have been difficult for someone to tell what was 
happening to him 
an informal picket was set up outside the store thursday night 
police escorted kang out when he closed for the night 
the stores manager marcus gaffney who is black said friday 
he removed drumright from the store when he found him slumped 
against a meat counter with a bottle of liquor poking out of his 
back pocket gaffney said drumright urinated on himself when 
gaffney tried to rouse him 
a cashier said the store owner ordered the man removed 
if we had any idea he had had a heart attack we would have 
called the paramedics kang said the protestors have a false 
assumption that they dragged him out knowing he had a heart 
attack 
cashier charelle m white said kang told gaffney and another 
worker to take the man outside 
they dragged him on his stomach outside the store where he 
lay until paramedics were called white said 
many koreanamerican store owners operate in predominantly black 
neighborhoods in baltimore and cultural differences have caused 
misunderstandings some storekeepers have been the targets of 
violent crime 
in new york city blacks have been demonstrating over an 
incident in brooklyn in which a haitian woman complained of being 
attacked by a korean store worker

rep don young ralaska who fought the bill every step of its 
way through congress said it would seriously damage the economy of 
southeastern alaska 
it was not a compromise he said it was the environmental 
groups across this nation not understanding what they were doing to 
the alaskan people 
but rep george miller dcalif who chairs the subcommittee 
that handled the legislation said some factions wanted an even 
bigger part of the forest removed from logging 
we believe this is a compromise that brings some finality to 
this issue he said 
environmental groups for years have criticized logging practices 
allowed by a 1980 law governing the 17 millionacre tongass forest 
though 55 million acres were precluded from timber harvesting 
by that law it also contained a business arrangement with logging 
companies allowing taxpayerowned timber to be sold at extremely 
low prices 
it required 40 million of federal funds to be spent each year 
on roadbuilding and other activities to help logging companies it 
set a harvest goal of 450 million board feet a year 
the new legislation requires the forest service to prepare only 
enough timber for sale to meet market demand it eliminates the 
automatic appropriation of 40 million for timber management 
requiring that the forest compete with others federal forests each 
year for funds in the normal budget process 
it modifies the contracts with the timber companies working in 
the tongass to bring them in line with agreements governing other 
national forests 
the legislation also declares about 1 million acres offlimits 
to timber harvesting and creates offlimits buffers 100 feet wide 
along rivers and streams important to fishing the original bill 
passed by the house legislation would have protected nearly twice 
as many acres from timber cutting 
the tongass stretching across the alaska panhandle is the 
countrys largest national forest and home to a rich array of 
wildlife including grizzly bears and bald eagles it also is a 
major source of timber

the government friday condemned the 
countrys leading writer saying his defection to france was an 
ugly act that placed him in service of the enemies of 
albania 
the charge carried by the state news agency came a day after 
ismail kadare announced his defection during a visit to france with 
his wife and two daughters france granted him immediate asylum 
kadare is probably albanias bestknown public figure after 
president ramiz alia who has been making gradual moves to lift 
albania out of three decades of virtual isolation from the rest of 
the world 
albania on thursday hosted its first highlevel international 
meeting in decades a conference of foreign ministers from 
yugoslavia bulgaria romania greece and turkey alia was asking 
those countries to help albania renew its ties with europe 
albania whose late president enver hoxha turned his back on the 
soviet union in 1961 and china in 1977 because of the 
revisionist form of communism in those countries is seeking to 
join the 34nation conference on security and cooperation in 
europe 
albania refused to sign the 1975 helsinki human rights accords 
that spawned the csce the united states the soviet union canada 
and all other european nations are signatories 
ata reported kadares defection a day late after the foreign 
ministers meeting was over it cited foreign press reports as the 
source for the news 
through this ugly act that is a grave offense for the 
patriotic and civic conscience of our people he abandoned the 
people and homeland and placed himself in service of the enemies of 
albania and the albanian people ata said 
the association of albanian refugees in france issued a 
communique in paris criticizing france for the quickness it granted 
kadares asylum request it noted hundreds of albanian refugees who 
arrived in france in july are awaiting rulings on asylum 
applications 
kadare was seen in albania as a spiritual leader for reform and 
the nations greatest author last year he was made deputy 
chairman of the communistrun democratic front and had begun 
speaking out for human rights 
kadares elevation to a leadership role indicated the ruling 
party was warming to his liberal ideas but in his statement from 
paris kadare said the regime was merely paying lipservice to 
reform 
the promises made were not kept and my disillusion like that 
of the immense majority of albanians was all the more bitter he 
said 
the government this year has liberalized travel regulations 
abolished the death penalty for those caught fleeing the country 
illegally and lifted some restrictions on religious life 
a draft election law published this week would allow more than 
one candidate to compete for each parliament seat and provide for 
secret ballots however it does not foresee a multiparty system 
about 5000 dissatisfied albanians took refuge last july in 
foreign embassies until they were permitted to emigrate

the government put former contra 
rebels in charge of the police in a northern region that witnessed 
some of the heaviest fighting during nicaraguas nineyear war an 
official said friday 
the unprecedented concession of power to the exrebels was made 
by the interior ministry controlled by the leftist sandinistas 
although they lost februarys presidential elections after 
several weeks of disturbances in the area 
interior ministry envoy jaime cuadra on thursday night ordered 
sandinista police officers in rio blanco 150 miles northeast of 
managua to withdraw to the local army battalion and turn the 
police station over to the former contras the sandinista police 
force consisted of about 20 men 
cuadra also put excontras in charge of the towns of mulukuku 
waslala and the surrounding hamlets encompassing a rural area 
inhabited by about 20000 people 
he told the associated press the move was provisional until 
the government makes a final decision 
the contra force that will take control of the police is called 
the rural police the unit originally was authorized by the 
government to police areas where former contra rebels were being 
resettled after laying down their arms 
residents of rio blanco had held street protests for two days 
against the sandinista police over grievances that began when a 
former contra rebel was killed in town 
a sandinista police officer suspected in the murder was arrested 
and sent to the provincial capital matagalpa where he was 
promptly released 
the authorities had given no response to complaints by the 
population of crimes and abuses said rio blanco town council 
member adonay meza that is why the people had public 
demonstrations to demand the substitution of noxious elements in 
the police 
cuadras home in matagalpa was bombed earlier this month a few 
days after he returned from putting down other contra disturbances 
in the northern towns of quilali and waslala 
the residents of the region around rio blanco a mountainous 
area of small cattle ranches and farms were among the strongest 
backers of the contra rebels during the war 
about 20000 contra fighters demobilized in june after an 
agreement with the government of president violeta barrios de 
chamorro which defeated the sandinistas in feb 25 elections and 
took over two months later 
the former rebels remain deeply resentful that the sandinistas 
kept control of nicaraguas police and army which even retain the 
name sandinista and still are largely made up of sandinista 
front militants 
they also have complained that mrs chamorros government has 
dragged its feet on promises to help them 
the contras ended the war with promises they would be given 
farmland food clothing medicine and materials with which to 
build simple homes in the countryside most of the decomissioned 
rebel soldiers are peasants 
former contras also were involved in protests last week in the 
remote atlantic town of puerto cabezas where they looted 
government warehouses to protest a lack of provisions sandinista 
police arrested 21 people

two irishmen flew home from iraq on friday saying 
iraqi president saddam hussein granted them permission to leave as 
thanks for good work on his new palace 
nick drury 19 and michael sands 31 said they were confident 
that other foreigners working on the project would soon be allowed 
to leave baghdad 
sands a civil engineer said his company had been negotiating 
for six weeks for the release of all the men working on the palace 
he did not provide the name of the company 
we were given a letter by saddam hussein after he visited the 
palace saying we could all get out he was impressed with the work 
and wanted to reward the foreigners by giving them exit visas 
sands said 
he said that he and drury were the first british citizens to 
test saddams promise on wednesday 26 portugese workers on the 
project were allowed to leave he said 
sands said he believed all 27 workers from northern ireland and 
23 britons would be allowed to leave over the next three weeks 
in a phased release 
i am confident it will happen said drury a student who had 
initially gone to iraq to visit his father and had taken a 
temporary construction job at the palace he gave us his word and 
i dont think hell go back on it 
drurys father george was not part of the palace project and 
had not been permitted to leave baghdad 
i am concerned but he was pleased to see me getting away 
hopefully he will be back with us by christmas drury said 
the two men said the foreigners remaining in the iraqi capital 
were beginning to show signs of stress 
tempers are maybe a bit shorter but to counteract that 
people are trying to put on a good face sands said 
he said life was fairly normal for the britons and that they 
all had enough food 
but drury added the stress really does get to you i never 
realized it until i was actually on the plane home it was like a 
big hand being lifted from my shoulder 
both men arrived at londons heathrow airport via zurich and 
were to continue to belfast later friday 
the foreign office says there are about 650 britons left in 
kuwait mostly in hiding like other westerners and about 800 
britons trapped in iraq including 340 held at strategic locations 
since the aug 2 invasion 
on wednesday former prime minister edward heath brought home 32 
holders of british passports from iraq the release followed two 
days of negotiations between heath and saddam

cubas vice president said his government has 
opened a dialogue with moderate exile groups that seek a transition 
to democracy and the peaceful replacement of president fidel 
castro 
vice president carlos rafael rodriguezs comments were broadcast 
on state radio and monitored here thursday a week after a 
coalition of moderate exile groups publicly invited discussions 
about democratizing the communist nation 
rodriguez said cuba shunned contacts with more militant 
anticommunist exiles in miami but confirmed the government has 
opened discussions with moderates whom he did not identify 
he said those exiles propose to liquidate fidel castro 
through dialogue they are offering talks the miami herald 
reported 
in washington us state department officials said they 
believed it was premature to suggest the cuban leadership was open 
to democratic reform but the rodriguez statement was potentially 
significant the officials spoke with the associated press on 
condition of anonymity 
in miami carlos alberto montaner whose exile party belongs to 
the moderate cuban democratic platform umbrella group said his 
organization has met with cuban officials to seek a solution to 
cubas mounting problems 
there have been indirect contacts with carlos rafael and other 
important officials in the regime montaner said we all agreed 
that the era of castros communism has reached its end and that we 
must look for a czechoslovakian solution before intransigence 
imposes a romanian solution on us 
montaner referred to the peaceful transfer of power from 
czechoslovakias communist leaders to the current democratic 
government in contrast to the bloody romanian revolution that led 
to the execution of former communist leader nicolae ceausescu 
in the long interview the cuban vice president divided the 
exiles into three groups 
he criticized the reactionary and ultrarightist wing headed 
by jorge mas canosa who leads the powerful cuban american national 
foundation and armando valladares us representative to the un 
human rights commission a second group he said consisted of 
people trying to return to cuba for visits 
the third group which he did not identify by name consists of 
exreactionaries who have abandoned violent strategies 
we are increasing relations with the third group he said 
there is an ongoing process 
mas dismissed rodriguezs comments about his group saying the 
foundation and valladares were working with the bush administration 
to bring liberty to cuba 
he said he was not aware of cuban government conversations with 
other groups

5yearold daughter in her car because she didnt trust baby 
sitters pleaded guilty friday to a reduced charge 
in an emotional plea for leniency chante fernandez 24 
admitted it was wrong to leave her daughter in the car while she 
worked weekends at a shopping mall but said she felt she had no 
other choice 
i was only trying to get us out of the situation we were in 
ms fernandez told superior court judge robert figarotta i hope 
somehow you can understand 
ms fernandez pleaded guilty to a disorderly persons offense 
was given a 100 suspended fine and was spared probation she had 
faced a maximum of 30 days in jail and a 500 fine 
ms fernandez from elizabeth was arrested saturday after 
police found her pajamaclad daughter anjuli in the back of her car 
at the woodbridge center mall where she worked parttime on 
weekends 
anjuli is being cared for by the state division of youth and 
family services which scheduled an oct 30 hearing to determine 
whether to reunite mother and daughter 
ms fernandez was initially charged with criminal restraint and 
spent two days in jail before posting 5000 bail she faced up to 
five years in prison and a 7500 fine but prosecutor alan rockoff 
said he decided to reduce the charge after his office was flooded 
with telephone calls in support of ms fernandez

in the trepidation of feeling she was destitute without a job

worked at the shopping mall because she could not find a baby 
sitter she trusted she also said she could not get government 
child care services 
she said she checked on her daughter during work breaks and left 
the rear seat folded down so anjuli could sleep in the trunk 
ms fernandez was desperate and did what she did out of love 
for her child said her lawyer kenneth weimer 
my client made a bad judgment call she was up against the 
wall weimer said 
after the hearing ms fernandez and weimer said the lenient 
sentence was a surprise and that they would concentrate on 
reuniting mother and daughter

medicare recipients would see their 
outofpocket health costs rise under congress compromise 
deficitcutting plan but the elderly would also find new 
protections against medigap insurance abuses 
the plan also would expand medicaid with new spending to help 
more lowincome elderly pay their medicare premiums and to provide 
them with home care that could keep them out of a nursing home 
senior citizens say the package is kinder to them than a 
previous one put together by the white house and congressional 
leaders but rejected by the house but they still say the 
budgetcutting strategy hits them hard 
the damages are less extensive but its still going to 
hurt said john rother of the american association of retired 
persons 
under the plan the elderly and disabled on medicare would see 
their monthly premiums for doctors coverage rise from 2860 this 
year to 4620 in 1995 and their annual deductible would go from 
75 to 100 
over the next five years the plan would reduce spending on 
medicare the fastest growing federal program by 42 billion 
beneficiaries would contribute about onequarter of that 
savings with doctors and hospitals providing most of the rest 
rep ron wyden dore said the medigap changes he helped 
engineer would offer seniors not only new protections against 
abuses by insurance companies selling them the supplementary 
healthcare coverage but the possibility of cost savings as well 
this is one of the few things a member of congress can take 
home and say this will help keep your health costs down wyden 
said 
more than 80 percent of senior citizens have medigap policies 
extra coverage beyond medicare and as many as 30 percent of those 
have more than one the measure would prohibit agents from selling 
a policyholder duplicate coverage and would standardize coverage 
into 10 different policies 
the changes also would require medigap insurance companies to 
pay 65 cents in benefits for every dollar in premiums if they 
dont meet this loss ratio they would have to give policyholders a 
refund to make up the difference wyden said 
the medicaid expansions include 580 million for use by state 
medicaid programs to cover home health care for lowincome elderly 
so they can avoid more costly nursing home care 
medicaid which pays the medicare premiums for senior citizens 
whose incomes are up to 90 percent of the poverty line would pay 
these costs for seniors up to 120 percent of poverty by 1995 
another expansion was to allow more children access to medicaid 
services but details on that were still being worked out friday 
afternoon 
on the savings side medicaid would save 19 billion over the 
five years by requiring drug companies to offer price discounts to 
the program as many companies already do for volume buyers such as 
the veterans administration and health maintenance organizations

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
friday took a break from headaches on the home front and opened a 
threeday spanish visit seeking to convert his personal appeal 
abroad into aid for the struggling economy 
torero torero hundreds of spaniards some hanging from 
balconies yelled to the 59yearold kremlin chief using an 
accolade usually reserved for courageous bullfighters 
gorbachev grabbing madrid mayor augustin rodriguez sahagun by 
the arm waded into the crowd crossing yellow barriers and a 
cordon of police outside madrids 17thcentury city hall 
the reception served to remind gorbachev increasingly 
unpopular at home because of worsening economic conditions and 
ethnic tensions of the respect he commands in foreign lands 
though gorbachev is seeking help for the soviet economy he also 
had some hard words for the iraqi occupation of kuwait 
we favor taking advantage of all possibilities for a 
politicial solution nevertheless no one should take the search 
for these joint or bilateral solutions as a sign of weakness or 
for vacillation over implementation of un security council 
resolutions gorbachev told the spanish parliaments foreign 
affairs committee 
the united nations has condemned iraq for its aug 2 invasion 
and ordered an international embargo on iraqi trade to force 
president saddam hussein to withdraw his forces from kuwait 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on friday told 
his spanish counterpart francisco fernandez ordonez there were 
new but still not encouraging signals from iraq 
it appears that iraq is searching for some kind of dialogue 
but there is no possibility of that until iraq withdraws from 
kuwait unconditionally a spanish foreign ministry spokesman 
quoted shevardnadze as saying the pair met at the ministry 
offices 
the ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity did 
not elaborate on reports that iraq might be open to discussions 
for his part saddam told channel 3 radio of algiers algeria 
when the greater interest demands it everything is open to 
consideration but he went on to rule out ceding our rights 
gorbachev was scheduled to discuss the persian gulf crisis with 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez later friday and saturday 
their spokesmen said the two met for 2 hours earlier friday and 
discussed european economic aid to the soviet union 
it was gorbachevs first foreign trip since receiving the nobel 
peace prize oct 15 and the first by a soviet head of state to 
spain 
like the prize the visit highlighted the importance gorbachevs 
personality has played in winning western support for the soviet 
union

a citrus industry committee on friday 
asked state and federal authorities to impose a quarantine and 
fruit shipping restrictions around a grove infested with a virulent 
strain of citrus canker 
the quarantine would establish a strict inspection and 
eradication program and restrict marketing of fruit from the grove 
owned by florida citrus commissioner ed smoak 
canker is a bacterial disease that could spread and devastate 
floridas billiondollar citrus industry scientists say 
steve poe a scientist representing the us department of 
agriculture on the committee investigating the canker infestation 
said the agency may impose a quarantine within the next two weeks 
but the us department of agriculture wont rush because the 
400acre grove is isolated and not productive so the disease is 
unlikey to spread to floridas 700000 acres of commercial groves 
thats one reason were taking our time on this poe said 
its really pretty sparsely inhabited and only a total of about 
55 acres are in production in there 
the asiatic or astrain of the disease blemishes and blisters 
tree stems leaves and fruit 
other citrusproducing states like texas california and arizona 
rely on federal shipping embargoes and quarantines to keep the 
disease from spreading into their groves 
the outbreak has tentatively been traced to another small 
infestation discovered elsewhere in florida in 1986 
state agriculture officials believe a former employee of the 
cankereradication program took infected material to his home near 
the smoak grove 
leon hebb acting director of the states canker eradication 
program said the man may have taken the infected material for 
private research 
poe said the usda was working with state investigators to 
determine if the man caused the infestation 
its a real detective story poe said were doing 
everything to trace the whole thing down

the social democratic government began 
dismantling the welfare state it built friday proposing sharp cuts 
in benefits and state jobs to stop the countrys economic decline 
prime minister ingvar carlsson presented an austerity package to 
slash 265 billion from the national budget and eliminate 10 
percent of the approximately 185000 civil service jobs over the 
next three years 
the government proposed cuts in sick pay defense education and 
price subsidies in an attempt to control inflation increase worker 
productivity and restore confidence in the currency 
i think voters realize that we have a problem carlsson 
said 
he acknowledged the forceful steps represent a drastic 
turnaround from the traditional policies of the social democratic 
party which has dominated politics in this country of 8 million 
people for more than 50 years 
in the past the party has focused on a bigger better public 
sector with more services for the people now carlsson said his 
government aims to consider the high costs and the poor results of 
some of the states largesse 
but union spokesmen opposition party leaders and economists 
said the proposals were insufficient to slow the 115 percent 
inflation rate inflation in western europe averages less than 5 
percent 
carlsson also said he would push for sweden to join the european 
community militarily neutral sweden previously has preferred to 
remain outside the 12member community of western european nations 
the conditions have improved with all that has happened in 
europe during the last year he said 
finance minister alan larsson predicted this week the austerity 
measures would cause a public uproar among swedes used to 
cradletograve security 
generous social spending and liberal working conditions have 
resulted in low worker productivity which in turn has led to high 
inflation and taxes 
last week the central bank was forced to twice raise interest 
rates from 12 percent to 14 percent and then to 17 percent 
because foreign currency was flowing out of the country at the 
highest rate ever amid rumors the kronor would be devalued 
most of carlssons proposals would not be implemented until 
parliament considers a new budget in january in holding a news 
conference to announce them carlsson hoped to stem the rumors of 
instability 
the next elections are due in september 1991 polls show the 
lowest level of support ever for the social democrats who remain 
in power only because backing for conservative parties is 
fragmented 
the moderates the second largest party in sweden have been 
pushing many of the proposals that carlsson announced friday for 
years 
about 1 billion of the cuts would come out of the states sick 
benefits program care of the sick has been one of the cornerstones 
of social democratic policy 
swedes take an average 25 days per year of sick leave among the 
highest rates in europe 
several other proposals particularly in connection with 
education involved reallocating rather than cutting funds the 
government suggested making swedens higher education more 
internationally competitive by diverting resources from 
administration to teaching 
it also suggested sending children to school earlier to save 
money on the vast child daycare programs 
the government also proposed reducing tariffs which would lower 
the price of food and increasing some real estate taxes food 
prices in sweden are the highest in europe the daily dagens 
nyheter reported this week

saturdays elections are likely 
to give new zealand a new government unless the ruling labor party 
can win over a large segment of apathetic voters 
opinion polls released this week showed the conservative 
national party leading labor by 11 to 16 percentage points with 
nearly a quarter of the electorate undecided 
polls had given the conservatives a 21point lead eight weeks 
ago when prime minister geoffrey palmer resigned 
palmers successor mike moore 41 is a popular politician who 
draws heavily for his image on his workingclass backgound and 
impoverished childhood with a widowed mother 
but a sagging economy has spurred widespread disillusionment 
with labor policies and boosted the fortunes of national party 
leader jim bolger 
unemployment at 79 percent the highest since since world war 
ii tops voter concerns in the south pacific island nation of 35 
million people 
the two main parties differ primarily on domestic issues the 
national party has pledged to maintain labors no nuclear 
policy of refusing to allow port calls by us warships because 
they would not state whether they were carrying nuclear weapons 
in response to the policy the united states in 1986 cut 
highlevel contacts with new zealand and dropped the country from 
the anzus military alliance which also includes australia 
the national party says it would seek a reconciliation of some 
sort with washington us officials welcomed bolger at a time hen 
they were shunning top labor officials 
if poll results hold true bolger the 54yearold son of irish 
immigrants who left school to work on the family farm is likely to 
win a threeyear term as new zealands 35th prime minister 
national has pledged to cut unemployment by half hold inflation 
under 2 percent lower taxes and hire additional police 
economic policy has been the most vexing problem for labor 
palmer became prime minister 15 months ago with the resignation of 
the charismatic david lange lange ostensibly quit due to health 
reasons but he also suffered from the fallout of a political 
dispute over economic reform

a federal appeals court ruled friday that a 
board set up by congress to regulate the safety of the governments 
nuclear weapons plants cannot meet secretly 
a threejudge panel unanimously rejected arguments by the 
defense nuclear facilities safety board that it was exempt from 
both the freedom of information act and a law requiring open 
meetings by government agencies 
we find nothing to indicate that congress intended to excuse 
the board from complying with foia or the government in the 
sunshine act the court said 
the fivemember board appointed by the president subject to 
senate confirmation was set up last year to police the safety of 
the nuclear weapons plants operated by the energy department where 
serious environmental problems have been uncovered in recent years 
until the boards creation the energy department had sole 
responsibility for monitoring the safety of the plants which are 
exempt from oversight by the nuclear regulatory commission 
the commission regulates commercial nuclear power plants 
the ruling by a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of 
appeals for the district of columbia was made on a lawsuit brought 
by environmental groups to force the fivemember board to hold 
public meetings and respond to requests for documents 
it reversed an earlier finding by us district judge john g 
penn that the board was exempt from the information act and the 
sunshine law 
the fivemember board has already held several secret meetings 
said dan reicher an attorney for the natural resources defense 
counsil 
reicher said congress created the board to ensure that the 
longsecret environmental problems in the weapons plants were 
exposed to public scrutiny 
this is the agency that is going to make some very fundamental 
decisions about whether the nuclear weapons plants which are shut 
down all over the country should be restarted he said 
the secrecy they were trying to maintain would have done 
nothing to add to the publics faith in the decisions they made 
reicher said 
the ruling against the bush administration was the first opinion 
written by circuit judge a raymond randolph recently appointed by 
president bush 
randolph was joined by two conservative appointees of former 
president reagan dh ginsburg and james l buckley 
there was no answer at the office of the board 
its five members are chairman john conway former executive vice 
president of consolidated edison co andrew eggenberger a private 
nuclear energy consultant herbert kouts formerly a physicist for 
the energy departments brookhaven national laboratory john 
crawford jr a former deputy assistant energy secretary and edson

an attorney said friday he hoped to force white 
supremacist tom metzger and his son out of the hate business by 
having their assets seized to satisfy a 125 million judgment in a 
racist killing 
attorney james mcelroy said he planned to go after all the 
metzgers assets including their home bank accounts and cash 
contributions sent to their white supremacist organization the 
white aryan resistence 
we will have the very nice irony of those who are contributing 
to war putting money in the pockets of the victims of their hate i 
think thats poetic justice mcelroy said 
the elder metzger did not immediately return a telephone message 
the associated press left at his television repair shop in 
fallbrook 65 miles north of san diego 
monday a portland jury ruled in a wrongful death lawsuit that 
metzger his 22yearold son john and two of their followers 
should pay damages to the family of a black man beaten to death by 
racist skinheads 
the jury found that the metzgers and war helped incite the hate 
and violence of the portland skinheads including those involved in 
the 1988 beating death of ethiopian immigrant mulugeta seraw 
mcelroy is an associate of morris dees the lead attorney for 
seraws family the attorneys have donated their time and any 
assets seized from the metzgers will go to seraws father and son 
mcelroy said 
the asset forfeiture proceedings are expected to take weeks 
we have two goals to compensate the family for the loss of 
their son mcelroy said the second goal is to put mr metzger 
out of the hate business this is a forprofit business this is 
how he makes his money he peddles hate and hate turns into 
violence 
mcelroy said the metzgers will have to testify and produce 
documents at the assets hearing 
attempts to hide assets or improperly transfer them to someone 
elses control could lead to further penalties or even criminal 
charges he said 
mcelroy said he already has blocked a move by metzger to 
transfer ownership of the familys 90000 home to his wifes name 
meanwhile the metzgers show no signs of abandoning their white 
supremacist preachings 
dont think because of the recent court proceedings in 
portland ore that our activities will cease vowed a message 
on wars telephone hot line 
this case has convinced us to go the extra mile take the 
extra steps to put the blood on the streets were putting the 
system on notice that if you want to play hardball with the big 
boys youd better be prepared to pay the piper

the governors office friday criticized 
state tax commissioner john boehm for staking out a newspaper 
building where his employees had gone to complain to a reporter 
that he was stifling their free speech 
from this administrations viewpoint that was a severe error 
in judgment said natalie peetz chief of staff for gov kay orr 
i think john realizes that and we certainly agree with his 
statement 
in retrospect i made a mistake boehm said thursday it 
was an error in judgment 
orr spokesman doug parrott said the situation is a 
departmental matter and it is being handled at that level mr 
boehms assessment that he made a mistake is accurate 
boehm was appointed to office by the republican governor who is 
waging a tough fight for reelection against democrat nominee ben 
nelson 
earlier this month a dozen department of revenue employees went 
to the journalstar printing co building to talk to a reporter 
boehm acknowledged that he and deputy tax commissioner anne 
erwin drove around the building which houses the lincoln journal 
the lincoln star and lincoln office of the associated press 
a day later boehm distributed a memo to department 
administrators it discussed discipline for employees who made 
insubordinate remarks during staff meetings about the governor 
department heads or other supervisors 
three of those who went to the newspaper building said thursday 
that department employees felt they put their careers in jeopardy 
if they disagreed with boehm or criticized the orr administration 
they said boehms surveillance of the building enhanced their 
concerns 
their fears are unfounded boehm said i went there 
because i had been told that maybe 40 or 50 department people were 
going to be there and i was curious i wasnt taking names 
i knew who the ringleaders were everyone in the department 
knew who the instigators of this were boehm said 
boehm said employees who talked to reporters would not be 
disciplined

a judge said friday he will unseal 
transcripts of secret grand jury proceedings in the charles h 
keating jr securities fraud case but delayed disclosure for a week 
to give lawyers a chance to appeal 
superior court judge lance ito rejected arguments by lawyers for 
the arizona developer and his codefendants who said publicity 
surrounding such a disclosure would damage the chances of finding 
unbiased jurors for the trial 
ito accepted the position of lawyers for the orange county 
register and the los angeles times which argued that first 
amendment case law supports free access to court records 
the judge said he would excise from the 4600page transcript 
the prosecutions opening statement and closing argument which he 
said were slanted against the defendants and might be prejudicial 
if i am not precluded by any higher court i will order next 
friday for the grand jury reporter to disseminate transcripts to 
anyone with a checkbook the judge said 
the grand jury stenographer sells transcripts he produces 
keating the former head of american continental corp was 
jailed for 33 days on a 42count indictment he posted a reduced 
bail of 300000 last week 
american continental controlled the irvinebased lincoln savings 
and loan association experts have estimated lincolns failure may 
cost taxpayers 2 billion making it the costliest thrift failure 
yet 
keating and three top officials at his companies are charged 
with setting up a scheme to steer elderly investors away from 
governmentinsured certificates of deposits at lincoln branches and 
into risky junk bonds issued by american continental 
the bonds became worthless when american continental declared 
bankruptcy and lincoln was seized by regulators 
prosecutors have said more than 17000 bondholders lost more 
than 250 million on the junk bonds the indictment however lists 
only 20 victims who lost 11 million prosecutors said they wanted 
a clear tight case 
keating was originally held on 5 million bail set by a state 
superior court a federal judge reduced the bail to 300000 
ruling the original amount was excessively high 
bail was posted by family members who pledged houses as 
security 
keating came to symbolize the excesses of the thrift industry 
with his investments in risky real estate ventures and junk bonds 
he maintains hes being made a scapegoat by regulators and 
legislators hoping to avert blame for the debacle 
keating 66 controlled lincoln savings through american 
continental drawing huge salaries and maintaining a lavish 
personal lifestyle 
the indictment carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison 
the criminal case is separate from charges in civil lawsuits 
that contend keating looted lincoln 
keatings lawyer suggested outside court that keating is anxious 
to testify before the senate ethics committee if he is granted 
immunity in return for the testimony 
mr keating has a wealth of information and insight 
attorney stephen neal told reporters if it were up to mr 
keating he would be talking to all of you about it at the present 
time that is just not appropriate 
reports surfaced earlier this week that the committee was 
considering giving keating limited immunity to testify in its probe 
of five senators to whose campaigns and causes keating gave 13 
million the reports were denied 
if i were an appointed or an elected public official i 
would think long and hard about ways to enable mr keating to share 
the information and insights he has on all of the issues including 
campaign financing neal said 
it was keatings first court appearance since he was released 
from jail he stood beside his attorney but would not comment 
asked if he had anything to say he declared im hungry and 
im going home to eat 
on a defense request the judge delayed until nov 9 a hearing

the bush administration for the first time 
friday declared the kingdom of jordan in compliance with un 
sanctions against neighboring iraq and suggested wealthy countries 
such as saudi arabia help its stricken economy 
although state department spokesman richard boucher did not 
explicitly urge saudi arabia to end its oil cutoff and ease its icy 
stance toward king husseins government the message was obvious 
the saudis have been very forthcoming and generous boucher 
said 
jordan fell into disfavor both in washington and in saudi arabia 
when it hesitated on applying sanctions against iraq after the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait 
questions were raised about the kingdoms adherence to the ban 
on trade imposed by the un security council although jordan 
shouldered a heavy burden of caring for refugees from iraq 
at the same time king hussein avoided criticizing iraqi 
president saddam hussein for his occupation of kuwait and along 
with the palestine liberation organization staked out a middleman 
role in seeking a negotiated settlement 
the kings ambiguous approach was considered by some analysts an 
attempt to stay on relatively good terms with western democracies 
while not alienating saddam hussein his powerful and unpredictable 
neighbor 
jordans diplomatic effort has not been productive and jordans 
economy has continued to sink its treasury is short of hard 
currency and trade is suffering 
japan germany and a few other wealthy countries are assisting 
jordan with aid to offset the cost of taking care of the refugees 
criticism of jordans behavior on sanctions ebbed meanwhile 
leading up to bouchers announcement that after some initial 
concerns we now consider jordanian compliance with sanctions 
good 
the spokesman added that the united states has made known its 
concerns and jordan has addressed them and taken steps to meet 
them 
boucher said jordans economy warrants generous support 
later a us official who demanded anonymity said the bush 
administration intended to provide special assistance to jordan 
through various emergency funds 
the idea the official said is to pump more hard currency into 
jordans treasury 
the saudi ambassador to washington prince bandar bin sultan 
discussed jordans plight thursday with undersecretary of state 
robert kimmitt it is our view jordans complicity warrants 
generous support in the expectation that jordan will continue to 
meet its obligations to enforce unmandated sanctions the 
state department said in a statement friday night 
meanwhile on capitol hill lawmakers clashed over president 
bushs failure to declare a national emergency in activating the 
reserves to support operation desert shield in the persian gulf 
short of declaring a national emergency bush has the authority 
to activate up to 200000 selected reserves including combat 
reserves for a period of 90 days with a 90day extension 
the senate in giving final approval to the 1991 defense bill 
questioned a provision in the bill doubling the callup period for 
combat reserves from 180 days to 360 days 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee contended that doubling the length of time for the 
callup without declaring a national emergency goes beyond the 
laws intent 
but sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee on defense said the measure was the 
only option left for his panel since bush has failed to declare a 
national emergency 
were risking the lives of 240000 men and women if that is 
not an emergency i dont know what is inouye said

lawyer jack litman said friday rehearsing for 
the role of a juror in this weekends benefit production of 
twelve angry men reinforced his belief that intellect alone 
cannot sway a jury 
litman is one of 12 top new york attorneys stepping inside the 
jury box for the showing at a law school of reginald roses play 
which starred henry fonda in the 1957 film version 
you cant ignore the palpable emotions people have you 
cant address jurors on a purely intellectual level said 
litman a defense lawyer 
litman represented robert chambers in his 1988 murder trial 
chambers unexpectedly pleaded guilty to firstdegree manslaughter 
in the strangulation of jennifer levin in central park in 1986 
twelve angry men is a play about a jury deciding the fate of 
a boy accused of stabbing his father to death as they argued in 
their tenement apartment in new york 
as the jurors begin deliberations there are 11 votes for a 
guilty verdict and one vote for acquittal but the lone juror in 
favor of acquittal played here by michael kennedy ivana trumps 
lawyer and fonda in the movie gradually persuades the other 11 
to change their votes 
the character litman plays a violent man obsessed with his son 
who ran away from home is the last to change his mind 
among other lawyers starring in the production is gus newman 
the lawyer for us rep floyd flake a new york democrat who 
pleaded innocent in august to conspiracy fraud and tax evasion 
charges stemming from allegations that he diverted money from 
programs of the church where he was a pastor 
also in the show is is robert fogelnest from the socalled 
pizza connection drugtrafficking conspiracy case thirteen men 
were convicted 
litman president of the new york association of criminal 
defense lawyers said he came up with the idea to do the show 
because i thought it would be a good vehicle to get away from the 
frenetic law practice have a lot of fun and raise money for a good 
cause 
the shows proceeds will help create scholarships for legal aid 
attorneys public defenders and attorneys for the indigent it was 
scheduled to run friday and saturday nights at new york university 
school of law 
toni kotite winner of the first bob fosse fellowship for 
directors and choreographers said she cast litman as juror no 3 
because he is a very strong man very driven and with a huge 
high energy level 
kennedy was her choice for the fonda role because his approach 
to problems is laid back and he is a cool calculator and i wanted 
juror no 8 to be a man of reason but also a grand master of the 
art of manipulation 
the lawyers were naturals for their roles kotite says 
they are playing the jury the people they manipulate all the 
time she says these guys are really pretty good actors in 
real life they arent plumbers or professors they are used to 
thinking publicly and persuading

the international civil aviation organization 
asked member nations friday to impound and return 15 kuwaiti 
commercial jets seized by iraq during its invasion 
the general assembly of the aviation organization a un 
agency made the call in a resolution that also condemned the 
confiscation of the jets now being used by iraqi airways 
it was not immediately clear what impact fridays decision might 
have on iraqs commercial air operations 
jaber mubarak alsabah head of kuwaits civil aviation 
authority praised the decision the official said it prevents the 
iraqis from using the jets abroad and he said they are not 
suitable for domestic use 
he called aviation agencys move a victory for the whole 
world because it adds to the international outcry over iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but he also said it is unlikely the aircraft now registered as 
part of the iraqi airways fleet will be returned to kuwait 
the motion sponsored by kuwait and five other persian gulf 
states passed without a formal vote because neither iraq nor any 
other state requested one 
however the iraqi delegation had opposed the resolution saying 
the agency is a technical organization and should not consider a 
motion motivated by political pressures 
kuwait is a province of iraq and whatever is in kuwait 
belongs to iraq tariq salbi head of iraqs civil aviation 
authority said during a break in the meeting 
the seized aircraft are valued at a total of 800 million not 
including confiscated spare parts iraqi airways did not have any 
jets of the type taken from kuwait which include five airbus 310s 
and three airbus 300s 
kuwait airways is now operating from egypt with several planes 
including jumbo jets that were abroad at the time of the invasion 
fridays resolution also calls for the return of foreign 
aircraft trapped on the tarmac during the invasion when iraq 
bombed kuwait international airport 
a british airways boeing 747 is the only aircraft that has not 
been allowed to leave the region 
fred neal head of britains delegation to the un agency 
called on iraq to allow the departure of the aircraft and more than 
150 passengers and crew still being held 
the 162member international civil aviation organization deals 
with international safety and security issues

the arkansas supreme court stripped 
from the nov 6 ballot a proposal to establish a state lottery the 
court said the wording of the referendum lacked sufficient 
information 
the justices voted 43 to remove the proposal which would have 
amended the state constitution 
the decision came amid a state police investigation of 
allegations from lottery opponents that some signatures on 
petitions getting the proposal on the ballot were forged col 
tommy goodwin state police director said the inquiry wont be 
stopped by the courts decision 
in a 16page opinion associate justice david newbern said the 
referendum as explained on the ballot failed to tell voters how 
much power the amendment would give the fivemember lottery board 
those five people were already chosen and four of them were 
among drafters of the referendum the five names appeared on the 
petitions although one subsequently died 
newbern said the ballot title failed to mention how the 
commission would be a part of the checks and balances of state 
government 
the supreme court also questioned the validity of signatures 
gathered since the death of one of the lottery board members 
associate justice steele hays said in a dissenting opinion that 
voters not the courts should decide on a lottery the supreme 
court challenge was brought by lottery opponents 
one man who worked to get the proposal on the ballot said friday 
the court decision was no surprise 
maybe it was the best thing that could happen said robert 
walker referring to the controversy the referendum provoked 
wh sutton a little rock attorney who led opposition to the 
lottery proposal said the court did the right thing 
were very gratified with the courts decision it was such a 
terrible amendment it was nothing to fool around with so im glad 
that its dead no matter how its disposed of sutton said

a woman who says her nowdead dentist gave 
her aids will be allowed to file a 1 million claim with his 
malpractice insurance company a judge ruled 
kimberly bergalis got permission thursday to pursue the claim 
from a judge who denied approval of the dentists will which 
leaves assets to his mother 
bergalis 22 who went to dr david acer to have some teeth 
pulled told reporters she doesnt want the money for herself 
its not going to buy me a cure she said i might not 
ever see this money it could take a year or so i dont know if 
ill still be alive 
she added maybe i could take a trip somewhere but its not 
for me my parents are still paying off my college education its 
for them 
bergalis wants cna insurance co which provided malpractice 
insurance to acer to pay her the maximum limit on his policy by 
nov 1 
if cna refuses bergalis attorneys said they would file a 
lawsuit against the estate of the dentist who died sept 3 of 
aidsrelated cancer and seek a much larger amount 
it will be a showing of bad faith and i think they would be 
liable for any award more than 1 million by a jury said one of 
her lawyers david eaton 
the insurance companys lawyer dennis vandenberg said the 
company probably will not pay on nov 1 its too premature 
bergalis attorneys said the insurance policy is the only 
valuable asset of acers estate 
eaton said he plans to file a lawsuit next week against cigna 
the insurance firm that sent hundreds of patients including 
bergalis to acer for dental care 
bergalis tested positive for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome she says she is the woman referred to in a july report by 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta which said a 
florida woman had likely contracted aids from her dentist when he 
pulled two of her teeth in 1987 
two days before acer died he wrote an open letter to his 
patients saying he doubted he had infected any patients but he 
urged them to be tested for the virus 
state health officials said 543 of acers patients have been 
tested at the martin county public health unit of the 497 results 
received two of the tests came back positive an hrs spokeswoman 
said

good grief jerry seifert 
the paper mill worker was picked from about 1000 entrants as 
the man who most resembles peanuts character charlie brown in a 
nationwide contest by united feature syndicate 
to celebrate the comic strips 40th anniversary the syndicate 
asked readers of the 1200 us newspapers that carry peanuts 
to submit photographs of people who looked like charlie and essays 
about them 
seifert 29 who lives with his parents near erie was as 
wishywashy as his lookalike when asked about the award 
i guess i consider it an honor he said but i didnt 
think i looked like charlie brown i guess a few other people do 
seiferts mother carol submitted a photo of him with a kite 
caught in a tree she wrote in her contest essay that seifert is 
truly a charlie brown in looks as well as life 
once he borrowed a friends new car only to have someone cross 
the center line and hit him headon she wrote without a 
thought of himself he ran and gave aid to the guy who hit him 
while hunting he hit a house accidentally and gave himself 
up only to lose his hunting license and the list goes on 
seifert won a trip for four to knotts berry farms camp snoopy 
in buena park calif and an original strip signed by peanuts 
creator charles schulz 
well i guess im looking forward to meeting joe garagiola 
who chose him as the winner seifert said maybe hes really not

congress approved legislation friday to give 
consumers more nutrition information on the labels of the foods 
they eat sending the bill to president bush 
the house on a voice vote approved the bill passed wednesday 
by the senate setting specific standards for nutrition labels and 
requiring them to be on packaged foods 
the legislation also mandates that bulk food in bins raw fish 
and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or brochure 
providing nutritional information 
food sold by restaurants cafeterias hospitals and grocers with 
annual sales of less than 500000 is exempt 
consumers have long demanded this information but under 
current law it is optional said rep henry waxman dcalif 
chairman of the energy and commerce subcommittee on health this 
bill will once and for all settle the confusion surrounding health 
claims on food 
labels would be required to display 
serving size 
number of servings per container 
calories per serving and number of caloriers from fat 
amount of fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium total 
carbohydrates complex carbohydrates sugars dietary fiber 
protein 
the measure requires the department of health and human services 
to publish draft regulations 12 months after enactment and final 
regulation six months later 
waxman said the bill prohibits terms like light high and 
low unless they have been defined in a manner consistent with the 
food and drug administrations definition 
it forbids disease prevention claims unless the fda has found 
the contention supported by science 
health claims were not permitted on food until the 1980s 
said waxman when the fda relaxed its rules during the early 
years of the reagan administration it lost control of the 
marketplace and many unfounded claims began to be used for food 
this bill will reorganize the marketplace so only truthful 
claims can be used for food he said 
a private citizen phil sokolof of omaha neb was made an 
unofficial cosponsor of the bill for his unyielding lobbying of 
the senate to get a vote on the bill 
earlier this week when the measure appeared stalled in that 
body sokolof spent thousands of dollars of his personal fortune to 
run full page ads in major newspapers calling on the senators to 
pass the bill 
his ads played such an important role in educating the public 
and the congress said waxman what he was able to do on his 
own as an individual is an inspiration this bill is a tribute to 
his tenacity

it is an indication that perry doesnt have serious programs

i managed to put my finger under a lawn mower he quipped 
thursday if youll check your manual and remember what your mama 
said and what common sense tells us is dont do that

ford motor co said friday it was recalling 
55000 cars to search for approximately 133 of them believed to 
have defective drivers side air bags 
three other automakers general motors mazda and honda are 
notifying owners to return another 50 cars that were equipped with 
the faulty bags the national highway traffic safety administration 
said 
devices that cause the bags to inflate apparently were damaged 
during assembly the government agency said in a statement the 
manufacturer trw inc discovered the defect 
the bags could malfunction when deployed in a crash said jerry 
r curry administrator of the agency the bags would not inflate 
properly and might eject hot gases that ordinarily would flow 
through filters and cooling devices 
chances of an improper deployment during a crash are remote 
curry said some of the vehicles affected by this recall have 
been in service for more than a year and no improper air bag 
deployments have been reported 
but if the bags malfunctioned the gases could cause serious 
injury he said therefore owners of vehicles covered by this 
recall should limit their use until the vehicle has been 
inspected 
trw has discovered 183 potentially defective inflators and is 
looking for others curry said 
gm identified the owners of its 39 cars believed to have faulty 
air bags and is notifying them by telephone and firstclass mail a 
spokesman said also notifying owners are honda which has sold 
nine affected cars and mazda which has sold two 
ford is recalling 55000 cars because it could not pinpoint the 
133 it has sold that have the defective equipment 
covered by the recall are the 1990 and 1991 ford crown victoria 
and mercury grand marquis and the 1990 ford taurus mercury sable 
lincoln continental ford tempo and mercury topaz 
owners of those cars should take them to a dealer for 
inspection any car found to have the defect will be repaired free

burmas military rulers are telling 
their democratic opponents to either go to jail or sign an accord 
with only a vague timetable for a transfer of power a political 
source in rangoon said friday 
this week authorities summoned the leaders of opposition 
parties at the rate of six a day and ordered them to sign a paper 
outlining the militarys timetable the source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the handcuffs were right there on the table and they were 
given the choice between a ballpoint pen or the handcuffs the 
source said 
the source said the political leaders were from some of the 93 
political parties that took part in the may 27 parliamentary 
elections 
the national league for democracy won the elections but the 
military regime of gen saw maung refused to allow the winners to 
take power and placed many under house arrest 
on tuesday authorities detained 12 leagues leaders including 
four members of its central committee 
opposition leaders want the parliament to begin operating in 
september 
the military says it wont step down until a new constitution is 
drawn up a conference would be convened at an unspecified date to 
provide guidelines for the parliament to draft the constitution 
reports from mandalay 350 miles north of rangoon said troops 
had raided and occupied the major buddhist monasteries there since 
monday and detained as many as 50 monks 
the monks have been refusing to minister to soldiers since 
troops reportedly killed four people at an aug 8 prodemocracy 
demonstration in mandalay the refusal is tantamount to 
excommunication in the mostly buddhist country 
the government on sunday empowered army commanders to try 
dissident monks in military tribunals which can dispense the death 
penalty 
authorities in rangoon had searched the headquarters of the 
national league for democracy each of the previous three nights and 
shut some of the partys offices down the political source said 
the leagues chairman tin oo was jailed by a military tribunal 
in december on charges of subversion its general secretary aung 
san suu kyi has been under house arrest since july 1989 the 
leagues acting leader kyi maung and several other senior 
officials were arrested last month 
amnesty international a human rights group says the military 
government has arrested thousands of people for political reasons 
since it took power by crushing a popular uprising in 1988 
authorities at that time killed hundreds of people

if a speedy solution is not found in the near future the 
european community will have to consider ways to safeguard its 
interests said a statement issued by the communitys delegation 
in washington 
at issue in the wine fight is a chemical called procymidone 
used to kill fungi on grapevines us authorities have not 
completed their investigation of it 
wines from the beaujolais and burgundy regions of france from 
the italian region of asti and a cooking wine from spain are the 
primary varieties affected 
the statement in the name of andreas van agt head of the 
washington delegation did not say how the europeans might protect 
their wine trade often in such disputes the side that considers 
itself injured stops an equivalent amount of the exports from the 
offending country 
the dispute comes at a time when the united states and the 
europeans are at odds over the bigger issue of subsidies to farm 
products in general the bush administration wants to reduce 
subsidies faster than the europeans do the issue is threatening 
the success of four years negotiations by about 100 countries in 
the uruguay round of trade talks trying to write new rules for 
trade of all kinds before the end of this year 
van agt quoted the us environmental protection agency as 
saying that it did not believe that levels of procymidone found in 
imported wine amounted to a health risk 
unfortunately it appears that notwithstanding certain 
differences between ec and us regulatory procedures concerns 
other than consumer safety appear to be involved van agt said 
he did not specify what concerns he meant 
european growers reportedly have been asked not to use 
procymidone on plants producing for the us trade and the chemical 
is said to have been almost entirely eliminated this season but 
earlier vintages still have traces of it and shipments have been 
held up in us porss

last year harvards holdings in south africarelated stocks 
dropped 30 percent in value

time said elizabeth gray the subcommittees secretary much 
of this is due to an appreciation of stocks we already held 
theres an ebb and flow in the market and we may have a low point 
in our next financial report 
in the past harvard students have staged demonstrations to 
press the university to divest its holdings in companies with 
business in south africa

democrat john durkin on friday criticized a 
group of auto dealers for trying to elect people who support 
japans right to dump whatever it wants on the us market 
durkin was protesting a planned television advertising campaign 
against him by the automobile dealers and drivers for free trade 
pac durkin is running against us rep bob smith for the senate 
the pac which he said represents japanese automakers plans to 
spend 317200 on the ads which begin sunday 
that is more than were probably going to spend in this entire 
campaign durkin said 
according to the almanac of federal pacs 1990 the pacs primary 
objective is to promote free trade with japan contributors market 
japanesemade vehicles including toyota nissan honda mitsubishi 
and subaru 
durkin refuses pac contributions and has repeatedly attacked his 
opponent for taking them 
smith says the groups support his probusiness positions and 
denies the money influences his votes hes raised close to 1 
million half from pacs 
pac spokesman frank glacken based in jamaica ny said the 
auto dealers group had no contact with smith because that would 
jeopardize the independence of the effort he said the pac 
represents independent american businessmen and women who sell 
imported cars all over the country glacken said the committee 
opposes durkin because he voted with labor interests when he served 
in the senate from 197580 glacken said the committee gave no 
money to smith because that would be illegal 
asked about the ad campaign smith spokeswoman lisa stocklan 
said smith knew nothing about it it is not authorized by the

hardly any person who pays federal taxes would 
go unaffected by the tax bill on which congressional negotiators 
were completing work friday 
most americans would pay higher taxes but on their purchases 
rather than on their earnings the bite would be relatively light 
for all but the welltodo those with incomes over 200000 a year 
would see their federal tax liabilities rise by an average of 63 
percent 
many of the 70 million couples and individuals with incomes 
under 20000 would get a slight tax cut thanks to expansion of 
the earnedincome credit for poorer working families with 
children 
the national taxpayers union a nonpartisan organization that 
campaigns for lower taxes estimated the bill would boost the taxes 
of a 30000 family by an average of 109 a 40000 family would 
pay 166 more at 50000 214 70000 277 more 100000 542 
more and families at the 225000 level would face an average tax 
increase of 3572 
here are major provisions 
gasoline raise the 9cent gasoline tax to 14 cents a gallon and 
the 15cent diesel tax to 20 cents on dec 1 a motorist driving 
10000 miles a year in a car that gets 22 miles per gallon would 
pay about 23 more 
alcohol double the beer tax to 32 cents a sixpack raise the 
1250agallon tax on 100proof liquor by 1 or 20 cents a fifth 
raise taxes on most wines including for example table wine 
which would go from 3 cents a 750milliliter bottle to 21 cents 
tobacco raise the 16cent cigarette tax by 4 cents in 1991 and 
another 4 cents in 1993 snuff cigars and other tobacco would face 
25 percent tax increases each year 
air travel raise to 10 percent the 8 percent tax on airline 
tickets which had been scheduled to drop to 4 percent at year end 
the average roundtrip ticket which costs about 300 would 
increase by 6 
telephones make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and 
longdistance phone service which otherwise would expire dec 31 
luxuries impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of the price of 
cars above 30000 boats above 100000 jewelry and furs above 
10000 and private planes above 250000 a 40000 car for 
example would face a luxury tax of 1000 
tax rates raise to 31 percent the 28 percent top income tax 
rate paid by the 600000 couples and individuals with the highest 
incomes that would raise taxes on singles making more than about 
125000 a year and couples with incomes above the 200000 range 
cut to 31 percent the 33 percent rate that as many as 4 million 
uppermiddleincome people pay on part of their earnings this 
would reduce taxes for single people with incomes between about 
60000 and 125000 and couples between about 100000 and 
200000 however other parts of the bill would take back that tax 
cut in most cases 
raise from 21 percent to 24 percent the alternative minimum tax 
which is paid by fewer than 100000 highincome people with large 
amounts of deductions that otherwise could reduce tax liability to 
near zero 
capital gains tax profits from the sale of investments at a 
maximum rate of 28 percent this would provide a break for those 
investors who now pay a maximum rate of 33 percent there is no 
deep acrosstheboard cut in capitalgains taxes as president bush 
has demanded 
itemized deductions reduce by 3 percent the value of certain 
itemized deductions that may be written off against adjusted gross 
income over 100000 only 97 percent of deductions would be 
allowed against the portion of income above 100000 thus the 
allowable deduction would be reduced by 300 for each 10000 of 
income above 100000 the restriction would not apply to 
deductions for medical expenses casualty losses or investment 
interest the provision would affect about 25 million couples and 
individuals 
exemptions reduce personal exemptions which now are 2050 
for a taxpayer and each dependent as adjusted gross income rises 
above 100000 for a single person and 150000 for a couple this 
would raise taxes for people at those levels the exemptions would 
be reduced by 2 percent for each 2500 that income exceeds those 
thresholds the exemptions would be lost once income tops 225000 
single or 275000 couple 
lowincome increase the earnedincome tax credit which 
benefits about 5 million lowincome working families with children 
as a way of offsetting some of the higher excise taxes 
medicare taxes increase to 125000 the 51300 maximum annual 
wage to which the 145 percent medicare tax applies this would 
affect about 8 million wageearners the tax is withheld as part of 
the social security tax and paid by employees and employers 
medicare premiums raise the 2860 monthly premium for medicare 
part b insurance to 2990 next year and 4620 by 1995 about 30 
million elderly and 3 million disabled people are enrolled in part

medicare deductible raise to 100 through 1995 the present 75 
deductible which beneficiaries must pay before medicare starts

the ira on friday threatened 
more reprisals against civilians working for the british military 
after turning a defense ministry handyman into a human bomb 
this week 
police identified the man as patrick gillespie 42 he was 
killed wednesday when ira gunmen forced him to drive a 1000pound 
bomb into a military checkpoint near londonderry northern 
irelands second city 
five soldiers also died in the blast and a sixth soldier was 
killed in a simultaneous bombing at newry 100 miles southeast of 
londonderry a bomb failed to explode in a third attack 
in all three attacks roman catholic men who worked for the 
british security forces were tied up inside bombladen vehicles and 
ordered to drive into the checkpoints 
those involved in such work should desist or be prepared to 
suffer the consequences the outlawed irish republican army said 
in a statement it was sent to the belfast office of the british 
domestic news agency press association 
the family of john mcevoy the human bomb in the newry 
attack said friday they were cutting all contact with security 
forces mcevoy survived the bombing but suffered a broken leg 
mcevoys family owned a gasoline station outside newry which 
served security forces no service will be provided for troops or 
police at the service station the family said in a statement 
without making further comment 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule and 
unite this protestantdominated province with the republic of 
ireland under a leftist admiistration the ira is banned on both 
sides of the border 
gunmen killed a member of the political wing of the ira who was 
visiting friends friday near cookstown 30 miles west of belfast 
police said sinn fein the political arm of the ira blamed 
protestant guerrillas for the death of the man identified as tommy 
casey a house painter 
earlier two other victims of the spate of killings this week

irish republic aimed at restoring local government to northern

british and irish officials said they would try to overcome 
differences but the outlook was bleak 
we have gone as far as we can and that is generally accepted 
the situation is somber irish foreign minister gerry collins 
told reporters 
the officials said the main sticking point was when the irish 
government should become involved in the negotiations between 
northern irelands protestant and roman catholic leaders 
the irish republic wants to be involved at every stage while 
the protestants who are the majority in northern ireland envision 
a role for dublin only at the last stages

the house approved the first overhaul of 
federal clean air laws in 13 years friday night requiring new 
pollution controls to sharply reduce urban smog acid rain and 
industrial release of toxic chemicals 
the 1100page bill passed by a vote of 40125 and immediately 
was sent to the senate senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine scheduled a vote saturday 
the cost for meeting the new requirements eventually are 
expected to exceed 22 billion a year and affect virtually every 
segment of society 
many of the handful of congressmen who opposed the measure did 
so because of the burden imposed on midwest utilities that will 
have to undertake expensive measures to curb pollutants that cause 
acid rain 
but supporters hailed the legislation as the most farreaching 
piece of environmental legislation to be considered by congress in 
years this bill will be the standard by which we will judge 
environmental legislation in the 90s declared rep mike synar 
dokla 
despite its lopsided approval the bill was the product of 
months of intense bargaining by house members among themselves 
behind closed doors 
the highly technical and farreaching bill requires tighter 
emission controls on cars cleanerburning gasoline blends and 
pollution controls on businesses to combat urban smog 
smogproducing emissions from automobiles must be cut by 30 
percent to 60 percent and gasoline sold in areas with smog problems 
must be 15 percent cleaner toward the end of the decade 
more than 100 cities that are failing to meet federal 
airquality standards will have to impose pollutioncontrol plans 
to bring their air into compliance over the next five to 17 years 
depending on the severity of the problem the los angeles area is 
given 20 years 
at the same time the measure directs industry to cut toxic air 
pollution by 90 percent over the next eight years by installing new 
pollutioncontrol equipment to capture 189 hazardous chemicals and 
requires coalburning electric power plants to reduce chemical 
releases that cause acid rain by more than 10 million tons 
the industrial midwest will be hit hardest because plants in 
such states as ohio indiana and illinois rely heavily on 
highsulfur coal and will carry the greatest burden of reducing 
sulfur dioxide emissions which cause acid rain 
failure to meet the new federal requirements could open 
polluters to civil penalties of up to 25000 a day criminal 
penalties may be sought against corporate executives for willful 
release of hazardous air pollutants that pose a serious health 
threat 
most of the new pollution requirements would be phased in over 
10 to 15 years the requirements for cleaner burning motor fuels 
and reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions from coalburning power 
plants take effect by 1995 
the cleanair requirements are expected to have widespread 
effects on society consumers are likely to pay slightly more for 
automobiles as well as gasoline and in many of the midwestern 
states more for electricity small businesses and huge 
petrochemical plants alike will have to invest in pollutioncontrol 
equipment and improve the monitoring of chemical releases 
cost estimates for the new controls have varied widely the 
bills supporters have said the legislation will cost the economy 
about 10 billion a year beginning in 1995 and about 22 billion by 
the year 2005 when most of the requirements will be in effect 
industry estimates have been much higher with some studies 
predicting annual costs from the legislation by 2005 of more than 
60 billion environmentalists have criticized the industry figures 
as being based on inflated estimates and extreme or false 
assumptions 
the latest push for overhauling the 1970 clean air act which 
was last changed in 1977 began nearly 17 months ago when president 
bush unveiled his proposal for cleaning up the nations air noting 
that for nearly a decade political paralysis has plagued 
progress against air pollution 
but the task proved to be far from simple 
it took three weeks of intense closeddoor negotiations between 
senate leaders and the white house to craft legislation that would 
satisfy divergent regional and economy interests affected by the 
bill finally the senate passed a bill april 3 by a vote of 8911 
six weeks later the house approved its version 40121 after also 
after working out scores of tradeoffs and compromises 
but negotiations bogged down as the house and senate tried to 
resolve differences in the two bills each of which ran to nearly 
700 pages facing increasing time pressures negotiators for the 
two houses finally agreed on a compromise bill monday barely in 
time for final floor action before congress adjourns

was brought to baghdad on oct 22 a day after being picked up in 
kuwaitand taken to a hotel where scores of other foreigners are 
being held 
after his aug 2 invasion of kuwait saddam prevented thousands 
of foreigners from leaving iraq and the conquered emirate hundreds 
have since been released but saddam is apparently seeking anew to 
pry concessions from western governments in exchange for their 
citizens freedom 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said iraq had set 
a series of conditions for the release of about 400 germans 
but that germany would only accept their unconditional release 
he did not list the iraqi demands but said one was that he 
himself travel to baghdad genscher made his remarks after meeting 
with british foreign minister douglas hurd who also called for the 
unconditional freeing of all foreign hostages 
in canada prime minister brian mulroney rejected the idea of 
sending a highlevel envoy to win release of canadian hostages in 
iraq calling it a bid by saddam to divide the nations allied 
against him 
i think a special envoy is a ploy of saddam hussein for 
publicity purposes for propaganda purposes to destabilize the 
solidarity of the alliance thats all it is mulroney told 
reporters in ottawa 
iraq has said french nationals would be free to leave beginning 
saturday and france has insisted no deal was struck with saddam to 
win their freedom 
french officials also denied any knowledge friday of a letter 
saddam reportedly sent to french and soviet leaders offering to 
discuss mideast problems 
french president francois mitterrand and gorbachev are to hold 
two days of talks in paris beginning sunday the french television 
network la cinq said saddam told the two leaders he was open to 
all ideas in resolving the gulf crisis 
we have no information regarding such a letter said an 
official at the french presidential palace 
in his remarks in spain gorbachev said friday we favor 
taking advantage of all possibilities for a politicial solution 
nevertheless no one should take the search for these joint or 
bilateral solutions as a sign of weakness or for vacillation over 
implementation of un security council resolutions the united 
nations has condemned iraq for its invasion and ordered an 
international embargo on iraqi trade to force saddam to withdraw 
his forces from kuwait 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on friday told 
his spanish counterpart francisco fernandez ordonez there were 
new but still not encouraging signals from iraq 
it appears that iraq is searching for some kind of dialogue 
but there is no possibility of that until iraq withdraws from 
kuwait unconditionally a spanish foreign ministry spokesman 
quoted shevardnadze as saying 
in washington the bush administration for the first time 
declared the kingdom of jordan to be in compliance with un 
sanctions against iraq jordan had dragged its feet on enforcing 
the trade embargo drawing the ire of both the united states and 
saudi arabia 
state department spokesman richard boucher stopped short of 
urging saudi arabia to end an oil cutoff aimed at jordan now that 
it was complying but said its economy warrants generous 
support 
jordan was a major trading partner of iraq before the invasion 
and it has been hit hard by the sanctions against iraq 
saddam meanwhile was said to be seeking reconciliation with 
iraqs kurdish minority he has attacked the kurds with chemical 
weapons in the past 
the iraqi presidents motives were unclear but he could be 
seeking to quell internal dissent as he faces a huge multinational 
force in the gulf region 
a report in the baghdad newspaper aljumhuriya on friday said 
saddam visited kurdish homes in a northeast province on thursday 
chatting and even praying with residents iraqs 35 million kurds 
have fought for decades for an independent homeland 
in other developments 
kuwait says casualties from the invasion were far higher than 
initially reported the governmentrun kuwait news agency 
monitored in bahrain said friday that 4200 kuwaitis were killed 
during the invasion initial reports had said several hundred died 
in japan opposition mounted to a proposal to send japanese 
troops to the gulf thousands of demonstrators marched on the 
parliament building in tokyo on friday to protest the plan critics 
claim the deployment of troops even in noncombat roles violates 
japans postwar constitution

president bush has asked secretary of state 
james a baker iii to visit saudi arabia early next month for a 
general discussion with saudi leaders of the persian gulf standoff 
including military options the white house said friday 
it is not true that baker will ask the saudi government to 
approve military action against iraq said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
we want the united nations resolutions to be complied with 
fitzwater said there have been several security council 
resolutions demanding an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
no date has been set for the trip fitzwater said 
later aboard air force one en route to hawaii fitzwater said 
baker would discuss the implementation of un sanctions the 
status of us and multinational forces in the gulf general 
defense needs arab unity and military options 
fitzwater announced the trip in los angeles where bush was 
making a campaign appearance the president he said discussed 
persian gulf matters by telephone from his hotel suite with german 
chancellor helmut kohl italian prime minister giulio andreotti and 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers 
baker likely will stop in egypt and possibly other countries as 
well officials told the associated press 
the secretarys itinerary will be set by bush meeting with his 
four principal advisers baker cheney national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and joint chiefs of staff chairman colin powell 
one official said 
a trip by baker to the region would underscore us resolve to 
force iraq out of kuwait which it invaded 12 weeks ago 
on thursday defense secretary dick cheney said as many as 
100000 additional us troops may be sent to the persian gulf in 
response to the continuing buildup and fortification of iraqi 
occupation forces in kuwait 
last month baker visited saudi arabia egypt and the united 
arab emirates he also saw the ousted leaders of kuwait during his 
visit to taif the saudi summer capital 
his purposes were to coordinate strategy against iraq and obtain 
assistance from saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates 
to help offset the costs of the us military buildup in the gulf 
officials who discussed a possible baker trip with the 
associated press before fitzwaters announcement said bakers time 
would be squeezed if he went the united states wants new security 
council resolutions against iraq and baker will have to be 
involved in planning for those 
among the resolutions would be a demand that iraq pay 
reparations for its annexation of kuwait and seizure of the 
emirates oilfields british prime minister margaret thatcher is a 
strong advocate of the measure 
these officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
bakers trip would have three purposes to review the campaign 
against iraq to make further preparations and to discuss the 
campaign at the united nations which the bush administration hopes 
to push into high gear 
and yet they said baker has other commitments in the weeks 
ahead he will attend with the president a 34nation summit in 
paris in midnovember and go with him to monterrey mexico after 
thanksgiving also andreotti is visiting washington next month

fashion on oct 15 
barreras brother adolfo barrera blamed the attack friday on 
rightwing extremists death squads linked to various security 
forces have been blamed for countless murders in guatemala the last 
three decades though such cases are rarely solved 
why did they assassinate refugio byron barrera asked of a 
small group of journalists who visited him in hospital my dear 
wife was the innocent victim of acts of violence like this one that 
has orphaned my children 
too much blood is being shed and what is worse is that no one 
is arrested barrera said speaking with difficulty

watched and advised claudia arenas bianchi the presidential 
spokeswoman they were near my home and they followed me from 
there to my office barrera said

christian democratic party has been critically ill in the hospital 
since wednesday with acute inflammation of the pancreas 
cerezo decided to cancel a trip to honduras because of his 
friends illness said foreign minister ariel rivera irias

of rape 
the junior midshipman who was not identified by the academy 
was initially accused of raping the woman but academy spokesman

a 150 billion fiveyear tax increase making its way through 
congress would hit especially hard at highincome people one new 
provision affecting the welltodo is being criticized as nothing 
less than a tax on children 
it would phase out the tax saving from personal exemptions as

there are those who would say bah humbug 
to the idea of taping a christmas show in october dolly parton is 
not one of them 
in fact she was talking about it on the phone recently from her 
east tennessee theme park dollywood in pigeon force she had just 
finished a christmas show there that abc will air in early 
december 
she even admitted to doing a little studio work on the show in 
july when she also recorded a christmas album with the same name 
as her special home for christmas 
weird as it may sound it isnt all that unusual for show folk 
with busy schedules to tape their christmas specials a tad early 
even during muggy summers when santas hohoho is more of a 
gaspgaspgasp 
its not odd she said not if if youre a show person and not 
if thats the only way you can do it and if youve got a 
childlike spirit which i do you can make it happen nearly all 
the time 
the tiny star whose nature tends to be sunny side up has had a 
good run as a singer songwriter and actress despite such 
accidents as the film version of best little whorehouse in 
texas 
last year she was in a film success as a costar of steel 
magnolias 
this brought new film and television offers she reports 
anytime you have a successful thing it always opens up new stuff 
for you 
in the wings for example is a gospel musical film for 
paramount sister sunshine about the rise and fall of a female 
evangelist she says shes also recording a new album next month 
eagle when she flies 
and farther down the country road is a planned tv movie all 
three networks are interested she says shed film in nashville 
its called beula faye she hopes itd lead to a tv series 
also done in nashville 
the film is about the country music business she said shed 
play a singerhost of a television show its about the 
lifestyle about being on the road and work in the studio and 
trying to keep the business running 
its something ive wanted to do for a long time and 
basically its what i had tried and wanted to do with my other tv 
show that got so out of hand 
she meant abcs splashy dolly variety series of 1987 yet 
another network attempt to apply hollywood flash to country music 
begun in a blaze of publicity it fizzled out in one season 
it never really got off on the right foot parton said 
although she readily took responsiblity for what happened it was 
so hyped had so much attention drawn to it we never really had a 
chance 
when and if she returns to a tv series in beula faye she 
said i hope not to advertise it all that much and just let the 
people decide at least it wont be under such a magnifying 
glass 
that was one main problem with dolly she said the other 
was too many chiefs and not enough indians 
by chiefs she meant a swarm of executives from new york and 
hollywood who ran around the show issuing orders giving advice 
changing orders and throwing tums at each other 
she indicated it might have been wise to have the jolly green 
giant sit on them until each show was finished 
but its okay she said i learned a lot from it a lot of 
things not to do 
a major not is not to do another series in any place but 
nashville 
most of these people aint willing to move to the south she 
said id be safe here

america burned while washington fiddled 
thats what albert sindlinger said to himself as the numbers 
came from his computers they showed 10 more states had fallen into 
recession in the two weeks ended october 22 while congress debated 
and delayed the budget 
i was prepared for bad news he said but nothing like 
this 
sindlinger a student of economics and politics for more than 60 
years has been analyzing them professionally for more than three 
decades his information comes from the people his staff 
telephones hundreds each week 
much of the resulting information is distributed to corporate 
customers whose marketing departments pay dearly for it and to 
analysts of various sorts washington too his latest report he 
says will wake them up 
that report shows a deepening recession that envelopes the 
district of columbia and all but 10 of the lower 48 contiguous 
states the rest are weakening steadily he does not measure alaska 
or hawaii 
the 10 states that fell into recession during the past two weeks 
included what had been some of the strongest such as illinois 
indiana iowa michigan ohio and wisconsin states that had been 
holding the economy together 
they not only fell he said they fell badly they leave only 
nevada washington and oregon still safely in economic plus 
territory the others idaho montana utah wyoming missouri 
minnesota and kansas are borderline 
among the questions asked by sindlinger amp co from its office in 
wallingford pa is one on the presidents popularity that too 
has taken a nosedive from 826 percent positive on sept 17 to 
549 percent oct 22 
especially irritating he says is that much of the economic and 
political damage could have been avoided he contends that if 
government hadnt fudged job and gross national product figures a 
recession would have been obvious 
had that been the case the threat of automatic cuts via the 
grammrudmanhollings act would have been lifted and so also the 
necessity of making drastic budget cuts a recession threat would 
have delayed enforcement 
instead congress remained confronted with the threat of 
automatic cuts sought to avoid that eventuality but instead got 
caught up in what much of the country viewed as a futile debate 
the economy sank said sindlinger 
the octogenarian analyst who says he got some of his polling 
ideas from none other than a prewhite house herbert hoover knows 
all this he says because survey respondents express their 
feelings in each 12minute interview 
theyre scared to death he said theyre angry concerned 
and disgusted moreover he said their pocketbooks are hurting 
sindlingers staff determines if a household is in recession 
through a measurement it calls household liquidity based on 
answers to four questions 
a household is said to have negative liquidity when any question 
is answered negatively and a state is said to be in recession when 
more than half the households fall into the negative category 
these are the questions 
1 is total combined household annual income up or the same as 
it was six months ago 
2 will the total combined households annual income remain the 
same or be higher six months from now 
3 will there be more or the same number of jobs where you work 
six months hence 
4 will business conditions be the same or better in your 
community six months from now 
eight hundred five calls were made in the week ended october 22 
making a total of 3283 for the four weeks september 28 october 
22 
those 3283 sample calls were projected to be representative of 
9082 million telephone households and a total of 15647 million 
heads of households of the latter only 61006 million or about 
39 percent had positive liquidity 
to sindlinger the big political question is whether a 
disgruntled public will simply stay home and not vote or will they 
vote and take out their anger on incumbents

the international monetary fund which pumps 
billions of dollars into debtplagued economies around the world 
is taking on a project closer to home building a new church for a 
small congregation thats been its neighbor since 1973 
some time in the next few weeks the imf expects to close a deal 
to acquire the quarteracre property of the western presbyterian 
church bringing to a close negotiations that began in the 1960s 
in return the fund is buying a new site a few blocks away 
where it will build western presbyterian a new slightly larger 
home with a kitchen for feeding the homeless 
it will move the churchs english gothic sanctuary fieldstone 
by fieldstone and stained glass window by stained glass window and 
rebuild it as part of the new structure 
not only that it will provide western presbyterian with an 
endowment reported to be 4 million to do such things as 
construct housing for the homeless and help two congregations in 
ghana build churches 
all in all counting acquisition costs and an 85 million 
construction budget the deal totals around 225 million 
so how did a church with about 135 worshipers on a good sunday 
come into such a bonanza 
one might say by being in the right place at the right time 
in the 1960s the imf a specialized agency of the united 
nations with the mission of stabilizing currency exchange found 
itself short of space and in need of a new home 
it found the location it wanted three blocks from the white 
house and next door to the world bank 
since the block was residentially zoned at the time the only 
way the imf could get the bulk and density it wanted for an office 
building was to offer forth a plan that contemplated developing the 
entire block said james b kaiser imf projects manager 
there was just one problem the western presbyterian 
congregation didnt want to move from the block 
the church started in 1855 was already in its third home its 
first was a warehouse not far from the new site after a few years 
there the congregation built a new church across the street from 
its present structure it moved to its current location in 1935 
the sanctuary is gorgeous and they didnt want to lose 
that said the rev john w wimberly jr pastor of western 
presbyterian 
also they might have had to move out into the suburbs where 
land prices are somewhat cheaper 
there was considerable sentiment about the symbolic value of 
having the building located here in the middle of what people call 
the wall street of the world wimberly said 
so the imf proceeded to develop the rest of the block finishing 
one phase in 1973 and the second 10 years later with the church 
nestled into a ushaped green space 
meanwhile the funds staff continued to grow it now numbers 
about 2000 from 100 countries since only 1700 could be squeezed 
into the building the agency paid an estimated 3 million a year 
to lease office space for the other 300 
it came to our attention a couple of years ago that there had 
been some changes that would make it more favorable for us to 
reopen negotiations said kaiser 
the church was growing too when wimberly became its pastor in 
1983 he said there had been about 90 people in the congregation 
and most of them were over 65 now about half of the 135 worshipers 
are 45 or younger 
western presbyterian began feeding the homeless and now feeds 
about 200 using a kitchen designed for potluck suppers it threw 
open its doors for noontime meetings of alcoholics anonymous and 
groups grappling with drug problems 
the church was still reluctant to move and the imf asked if 
there were any conditions under which the congregation might 
consider it 
western presbyterian listed some 
they wouldnt leave the neighborhood 
imf would have to rebuild the sanctuary as it was 
they would need a commercial kitchen to feed the homeless 
they wanted air conditioning and underground parking neither 
of which the present church has 
imf would pay the lawyers and the architects 
the job would be done in phases so the congregation would not 
miss a day of worship or the homeless miss a meal 
imf would create an endowment to enable the church to expand 
its mission 
we debated it at great length and finally took a vote and the 
vote was 21 in favor of making the move wiberly said 
the executive board of the imf also approved 
architect david cox said it is hoped that construction can start 
in the spring and be completed in about two years kaiser said imf 
hopes to start work on its expansion at that time 
the fact the imf was willing to take the sanctuary with us i 
think was at the crux of it said wimberly we could say 
when you go down there youre not going to be worshiping in some 
glass palace or something people become very very involved with 
the place where they worship it is a beautiful sanctuary there is 
something very humble in its beauty that kind of matches a lot of 
the people that worship here

though they were planted in a less than ideal 
climate the seeds of a new investment product appear to be taking 
root on wall street 
the securities in question known as longterm stock options 
made their debut oct 5 at the chicago board options exchange and 
the american stock exchange 
since then the number of these options outstanding in the two 
markets has increased steadily surpassing 6000 by late lsst week 
observers describe that as a respectable showing especially 
given the depressed state of enthusiasm right now for just about 
anything associated with stocks 
its very hard to persuade people to enter the stock market 
these days let alone the options market says harrison roth an 
options specialist at the firm of cowen amp co its still a little 
too early to tell but i think this product will be successful 
at the cboe these vehicles are known by the trademarked anagram 
leaps for longterm equity anticipation securities the amex has 
been content so far with the generic name longterm stock options 
whatever you call them they are closely related to the 
shortterm options on individual stocks that have been bought and 
sold on wall street for decades in two basic forms calls which 
give their owners the right to buy a specified stock at a set price 
within a stated time period and puts which carry the right to 
sell the stock in question under similar terms 
conventional puts and calls traded in organized markets 
generally have lives of nine months or less the new longterm 
options by contrast can run for as long as almost two years 
to wouldbe speculators in options that can represent a big 
difference they might for instance feel much more confident 
staking their money on the chances for a market recovery by 
mid1992 than by next spring or summer 
but the extra time comes at a price last thursday for example 
when the stock price of merck amp co stood at 8187 a call option 
to buy 100 shares at 95 between now and january went for 50 
excluding commissions 
leaps at that same price not due to expire until july of 1992 
traded at 68750 apiece reflecting the significantly better 
chance that merck stock will climb above 95 in the next 15 months 
than within 90 days or so 
that example illustrates how important it is in options trading 
to be able to evaluate relative levels of option premiums the 
time value built into their prices over and above their worth if 
they were exercised immediately 
in some ways at least longterm options can be seen as a more 
conservative vehicle than their established shortterm cousins 
roth suggests that investors who cant commit the time and 
energy required for shortterm options trading may have a better 
chance at operating successfully in the longterm arena 
you still have to keep track of your investment he advises 
but you may not need to monitor it every day hourbyhour 
furthermore if strategies employed with longterm options 
require less frequent buying and selling than is common with 
shortterm contracts the burden of commission costs can be 
lightened 
no matter what the scheduled life of a stock option some things 
remain the same a call on a stock that never reaches the exercise 
price can be relied on to approach a value of zero by the time it 
expires 
risks can be even greater for investors who write create 
and sell calls on stock they dont own or engage in other 
unprotected maneuvers 
says roth the obvious comment here has to be look before you 
leap

the opening of the berlin wall did far more than 
allow east germans to dance across broken concrete into the 
dazzling world outside it let the outside world come in 
less than a year later two nations were wiped off the map and 
replaced with one 
breaching the barrier was a desperate act by a dying regime 
trying to placate a people massed in revolt 
although the opening of the wall nov 9 1989 took the 
unromantic form of lifting travel restrictions everyone recognized 
it as the end of the cold wars most famous symbol it was the 
dominant image in a breathtaking year of revolution in the soviet 
bloc 
what no one predicted was the resulting maelstrom of forces that 
led to german unity an inexorable process that forced the 
superpowers to recognize a new world order and reach new levels of 
cooperation 
today the nation that built the berlin wall is a territory 
transformed no longer a communist state no longer a closed 
society no longer a nation 
it is a region whose destiny lies completely in the hands of 
people who live in what used to be another country 
uniting with mighty west germany has given the east germans an 
experienced hand to lead them and a mattress stuffed with money to 
rest on 
but it also has forced the old nation to make eastern europes 
fastest most turbulent most radical transition to a freemarket 
democracy after four decades of sleepy unchanging communism 
poland czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary are 
proceeding much more gently by comparison dipping a toe into the 
cold waters of capitalism as they peer through the dust and smoke 
of their revolutions 
so swiftly has east germany become distinct from its neighbors 
that it is inaccurate and unfair to even compare them said 
heinrich vogel an analyst at the federal institute for eastern 
economic and international studies in cologne 
he said eastern germany is in a distinctly privileged 
situation sharing a language legal system government currency 
and borders with a rich and stable region 
east germany also has thrown its fate to the west however 
while the other former soviet satellites still have autonomy and 
some control of their destiny on the longer less certain road to 
prosperity 
what eastern germany has in common with the other former 
communist states are profound similarities in public mood 
they are all sharing exaggerated expectations to a large 
extent vogel said they have all inherited the structural 
handicaps the mental decay the system of mistrusting each other 
and society 
in eastern germany westerners have seized control swiftly from 
the man in charge of selling its factories to the governor of its 
largest state to clever squatters who have claimed its vacant 
tenements 
leading eastern politicians have western campaign managers and 
aides the east german womens swimming team which dominated the 
world for years has a west german coach 
children who have been drilled their entire classroom lives in 
the correctness of communism are using estern textbooks 
the food in the old nations stores the cars on its streets 
the money in its banks and the flag flown atop its public buildings 
all have changed in the single year from revolution to 
reunifiction 
political extremism overt racism crime and drug abuse have 
crept through the wall or simmered up from the darkest corners of a 
longsuppressed national psyche 
embracing the west has ruined the homegrown economy and its 
overstaffed inefficient enterprises which once were the strongest 
of the soviet bloc but now are literally being killed by the 
competition 
since march about onefourth of the 8 million workers in 
eastern germany have lost their jobs or are working fewer hours at 
lower governmentsubsidized wages 
a recent report by the five leading german economic institutes 
said nearly 4 million could be in the same situation next year and 
that the pace of recovery was much slower than expected 
except for some perky areas of the service industry virtually 
no sector of the eastern economy can survive without western help 
said economist heine flassbeck of berlin one of the reports 
authors 
chancellor helmut kohls government facing national elections 
dec 2 has dismissed the report as too pessimistic 
hans peter stihl president of the german chamber of commerce 
said a new survey showed half of all western german businesses will 
have invested in the east by the end of 1991 
if there is disagreement over the timetable for eastern 
germanys elevation to western standards there is little doubt 
about its inevitability 
on a single day soon after the germanys were joined oct 3 
three unrelated announcements illustrated why east germany was more 
fortunate than its old warsaw pact allies 
mercedesbenz said it would begin building cars at a struggling 
east german truck plant near berlin saving or creating 6000 jobs 
the government increased pensions to help 27 million retired 
people pay higher prices and rents 
another department announced plans to spend 10 billion marks 
65 billion on fixing up 300000 homes 
romania poland and the other former communist states could use 
a day like that but many of citizens have decided not to wait for 
it 
thousands of eastern europeans have poured into eastern germany 
in hopes it will be the new gateway to the west creating a german 
immigration crisis 
soviet soldiers who once died by the millions fighting the 
nazis and now must leave the nation they conquered are deserting 
in hundreds and asking to stay 
even jews subjected to hideous crimes under hitler are 
arriving from the soviet union in search of better lives 
all this in a country millions of people could not wait to leave 
last year where pentup desperation brought down the hardline 
communist leader erich honecker 
the uprising forced his successor egon krenz to bow even more 
to the masses and do the unbelievable change history in a single 
autumn day by opening the berlin wall

they came by the millions pouring through the new 
gaps in the berlin wall rejoicing in the simple ability to move 
freely in their city for the first time in nearly three decades 
when east germany suddenly announced on nov 9 1989 that it was 
opening its borders i witnessed an outpouring of joy that became 
the biggest party berlin has ever seen 
it was nearly 7 pm when the stunning announcement was made at 
a news conference in east berlin 
i jumped into a car and toured several border crossings at the 
wall confused guards on both sides still could not say exactly 
when unhindered passage would be allowed 
as midnight approached thousands of east germans massed on the 
eastern side of the barrier that symbolized the cold war at 
midnight they rushed through crossing points some on foot some 
in sputtering trabant cars 
west berliners greeted them with champagne tapping on the roofs 
of the cars in boisterous welcome 
at checkpoint charlie germans from both sides kissed cried for 
joy and danced relatives embraced for the first time in a 
generation 
i saw east german border guards transformed in minutes from 
dour arrogant guardians of communism into friendly helpers 
smiling and chatting with west berlin police they even stopped 
checking documents 
hundreds of people danced atop the wal at the brandenburg gate 
in one of the most memorable scenes of that incredible thursday 
night 
by 2 am west berlin was one gigantic party thousands of 
people streamed along the glittering kurfuerstendamm outside the 
associated press office 
authorities had closed the street to traffic and it became a sea 
of people ebbing and flowing in the chilly night to marvel at the 
wonders of capitalism 
a giant screen on a department store alternated announcements 
that the wall was open with flashes of welcome welcome to the 
visitors from the east 
hardly anyone slept in berlin bars stayed open through the 
night offering free drinks to east germans 
at 5 am i set out on the 10minute walk from the ap office to 
my hotel and spent nearly an hour wading through the dancing and 
singing crowds strangers hugged me others handed me paper cups 
filled with champagne 
at 8 am i watched the east germans open a large section of 
the wall at bernauer strasse where some of the most spectacular 
escapes and bloody failures had taken place 
that weekend berlin became one months before the official 
reunification of germany

their trabi for the long trip to freedom a year ago he had no idea 
they were helping arrange east germanys funeral 
the leichs are among tens of thousands of east germans whose 
flight through hungary and czechoslovakia helped reunite the 
nation they have a good life in western germany now in the 
bavarian town of hof 
on oct 2 1989 leich his wife christine and their two 
children chugged for prague in their blue trabant to join other 
east germans waiting to go west 
at the border customs officials tore our car apart and asked 
us endless questions like dont the children have to go to 
school and where are you going to stay leich recalled 
they crossed into czechoslovakia and reached prague left the 
car and went by taxi to the west german embassy more than 10000 
east germans waiting for trains to take them west had turned the 
embassy grounds into a squalid refugee camp 
after two nights there the refugees crowded into the unheated 
cars of special trains east germany provided for the last leg of 
their journey to freedom 
in the first part of the trip through southern east germany 
police beat back people who tried to jump aboard as the trains 
passed slowly through stations 
leich 33 saw a young woman with a child trying to board at 
plauen east germany a security officer led the woman away 
people were screaming out the windows but there was nothing 
anyone could do he said 
on oct 5 the leichs train arrived at hof on nov 9 east 
germany opened the berlin wall in a desperate attempt to stop the 
mass flight 
bernhard leich found work as an electrician in hof and christine 
is a saleswoman daniel 8 likes his school and stefanie 5 has 
new friends 
chancellor helmut kohl recommended last month that emigres 
return to eastern germany to help build the united country but 
leich says thats out of the question

democrats expect to improve their hold on the 
nations governorships this year but they face tough battles to 
wrest control of the largest states from the republicans 
ohio gov richard celeste the head of the democratic governors 
association predicts a net gain of one to four governorships for 
his party this year 
republicans who gained eight seats when many of these same 
governors were up four years ago would be content just to hold 
their own this time 
democrats have the upper hand in the nations statehouses going 
into the elections controlling 29 governorships to the gops 21 
but the party that controls the biggest states will be pleased no 
matter the outcome of the rest 
much more important than the raw number of gains or losses is 
which states go which way says political analyst charlie cook 
unlike house or senate seats all governorships are not created 
equal and it is the megastates this year that really count 
the reason is redistricting legislatures will draw new 
congressional district lines next year that may change of face of 
their us house delegations both parties would like to hold the 
veto stamp in states facing big gains or losses in their 
congressional delegations 
republicans control the governorships in four of the biggest 
states that are up this year california texas florida and 
illinois 
californias legislature will figure out how to distribute as 
many as seven new congressional seats next year based on the 
states population gain in preliminary census figures democrats 
control the legislature there and republicans say they need the 
governorship to ensure a fair map 
texas and florida will gain new house seats too while illinois 
stands to lose two seats 
in only one of those states florida is the incumbent seeking 
reelection florida gov bob martinez has come from behind to a 
virtual tie with democratic challenger lawton chiles the former 
senator 
the highstakes california race is considered deadlocked too 
republican sen pete wilson faces democrat dianne feinstein the 
former mayor of san francisco republican gov george deukmejian is 
retiring after two terms 
in texas flamboyant republican clayton williams has held a lead 
over democrat ann richards richards has pulled closer in recent 
polls however and has accused williams campaign of encouraging 
reports she once used drugs 
in illinois republican jim edgar once led in his bid to replace 
retiring gov jim thompson but in a reversal of normal tax 
rhetoric it is the democrat neil hartigan who has trumpeted a 
notax pledge to turn the race into a tossup 
among the democratic governors who control big states 
michigans gov jim blanchard has a substantial lead in his bid for 
a third term new york gov mario cuomo is a sure thing for 
reelection so is pennsylvania gov bob casey the most prominent 
antiabortion democrat 
in other contested states that democrats now control 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis retires reviled just two 
years after leading his party to presidential defeat democrat john 
silber a university president won the nomination in a repudiation 
of dukakis he leads his gop opponent although republican william 
weld is within striking distance 
republican george voinovich the former cleveland mayor leads 
in the ohio governors race where democrat celeste is retiring 
the democratic candidate anthony celebrezze has tried to make his 
support for abortion rights a deciding issue but celebrezze has 
been criticized for his dramatic switch from an abortion opponent 
late last year 
minnesota was a state republicans had hopes of reclaiming from 
democratic gov rudy perpich but republican jon grunseths chances 
plummeted with allegations that he swam nude with teenage girls at 
a party nine years ago and invited some as young as 13 and 14 to 
join him 
gop primary loser arne carlson has entered as a writein 
candidate and grunseth went to the brink of withdrawal before 
deciding to remain in the race republican frustration with the 
turmoil is increased by polls showing a variety of gop candidates 
other than grunseth would defeat perpich in a twoway race 
our base simply is not big enough to cut it in half said 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn who has his own reelection worries 
were going to have to some way repair that situation 
democrats are in danger of losing connecticut where gov 
william oneill is retiring the democratic nominee is running 
third behind former gop sen lowell weicker who is running as an 
independent 
in oregon another state where a democrat is retiring the 
race between republican dave frohnmayer and democrat barbara 
roberts is close 
republican incumbents are in danger in at least four states 
rhode island nebraska kansas and maine 
worst for republicans is rhode island where gov ed diprete is 
far behind democrat bruce sundlun who lost to diprete in the last 
two elections 
nebraska gov kay orr and her kansas neighbor mike hayden both 
have been in trouble for tax increases but both have narrowed the 
gap by which they trailed democratic challengers 
hayden has rebounded as his democratic opponent joan finney 
has struggled to explain her opposition to abortion recent polls 
have shown hayden winning the womens vote 
maines republican gov john mckernan has also made a partial 
recovery in the polls but still faces a tough race with joseph 
brennan a former governor who replaced mckernan in congress four 
years ago 
among other republican incumbents alabamas guy hunt and iowas 
terry branstad both hold leads against strong challengers 
republicans face uphill battles to hang on in oklahoma and new 
mexico where gop incumbents are retiring democrats expect to hang 
on to the arizona seat which they took over when republican gov 
evan mecham was impeached 
in alaska the entry of former gop gov walter hickel as 
thirdparty candidate has confused a tossup race former gop gov 
richard snelling leads in vermont where the democratic incumbent 
is retiring 
democratic incumbents have leads in polls or are rated likely 
winners in colorado hawaii maryland nevada tennessee idaho and 
wyoming republican incumbents are rated favorites in south 
carolina south dakota wisconsin and new hampshire

by the time the current economic slump goes into 
the history books many wall street analysts believe it will be 
recorded as a recession bought with credit 
they see debt problems as by far the most menacing worry facing 
the stock market and the economy overshadowing other issues like 
soaring oil prices and falling consumer confidence 
should widespread forecasts of only a moderate recession ending 
some time next year prove too optimistic these observers say an 
upheaval in the banking and credit system will very likely be the 
culprit 
in the same vein they contend that an eventual recovery in 
economic growth corporate profits and stock prices will depend to 
a great degree on how well the process of cleaning up the credit 
mess goes 
the recession that we think began in the summer started like 
no other in the postwar period said jack lavery director of 
global research at merrill lynch 
on the negative side financial stresses are much more 
pronounced and widespread and policymakers can do little to 
stimulate the economy 
on the plus side the excesses in the real economy which 
usually intensify a downturn are actually mild 
if there is such a thing as a typical recession it unfolds as 
unsold inventories of goods back up in the pipelines of the 
economy that in turn forces manufacturers to cut back 
production 
unemployment heads upward with layoffs in the producing 
distribution and retailing sectors of the economy as the business 
slowdown takes hold 
the whole process begins to reverse however as the surplus 
inventories are worked off 
this time around analysts maintain there is no glaring problem 
with inventories of conventional merchandise instead they say 
the system is clogged by bad debts and assets financed with those 
debts most notably real estate that nobody wants to buy or 
occupy 
the easy credit conditions of the 1980s have led to excesses 
in both the real estate market and in corporate america says 
suresh bhirud chief portfolio strategist at oppenheimer amp co 
the banking systems loan portfolios have suffered significant 
writeoffs as a result of these problems 
the banks ability to make new loans has diminished 
dramatically this is not surprising considering that in many cases 
the balance sheet of the lender may be even weaker than that of the 
borrower 
the bottom line is that even if there is a substantial easing 
by the monetary authorities it would not necessarily lead to a 
turnaround in the economy 
with such matters weighing on stock prices the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials dropped 8465 points to 243614 in the 
past week 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 369 to 16671 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market lost 
301 to 33436 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 232 at 29139 
volume on the big board averaged 14398 million shares a day 
against 18028 million the week before 
in the view of some analysts at least a day of reckoning with 
debt has been a long time coming and its effects may not be easily 
dispelled 
throughout most of the long expansion of the american economy 
after world war ii say economists david a levy and s jay levy in 
chappaqua ny memories of the great depression of the 1930s 
served as a strong influence for prudence 
but eventually the maintain prudence waned consumers 
qualms about incurring debt diminished 
speculators helped to bid up the prices of homes other real 
estate works of art and even household objects deemed to be 
collectibles conspicuous consumption was back 
the waning of the prudence engendered by the depression was 
reflected in the unwise financing of assets whose utility was 
questionable and whose prices were inflated 
the levys conclude the fallout from these excesses will 
linger after the recession

for every worry about rising oil prices theres 
a hope that the persian gulf crisis will be settled and things will 
get quickly back to normal 
those hopes actually eroded some of the war premium on oil 
early this past week but getting back to normal wont be as easy 
as knocking 5 or 10 off a 40 barrel of oil 
case in point airlines 
on tuesday pan am corp and ual corp announced a 400 million 
deal that would give ual parent of united airlines most of pan 
ams valuable london routes within 48 hours another powerful 
player american airlines had emerged to say it wanted to bid on 
the routes 
meanwhile continental airlines was saying it had scrapped a 
plan to seek bankruptcy court protection but was still searching 
for ways to cut costs including such measures as lightening planes 
by removing the ashtrays 
the wrenching changes and desperate cost cutting promised to 
shift the balance of power in the industry dramatically and more 
than temporarily 
the high cost of jet fuel since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 was 
accelerating a darwinian evolution already set in motion by 
increased competition and sluggish demand for air travel the 
experts said 
robert j aaronson president of the air transport association 
of america predicted some constriction and perhaps a total 
restructuring of the industry should jet fuel prices remain at 
125 per gallon or more up from 60 cents before the persian gulf 
crisis 
the industry association predicted that as the strong grew 
stronger and the weak looked for ways to shrink back to 
profitability travelers would find fewer flights and higher fares

not all the trickledown effects of the persian gulf crisis have 
to do with oil prices 
a real estate trade group said september sales of existing homes 
were down 8 percent partly because so many potential homebuyers 
have been shipped to the saudi desert for military duty 
the south where bases have dispatched big contingents led the 
sales decline with a 10 percent drop

after so much haggling few were cheering the latest federal 
budget agreement which promised to cut the deficit by trimming 
spending and raising taxes 
before the first compromise fell apart earlier this month 
expectations ran high that the federal reserve would answer the 
budget agreement with easier credit terms 
the fed could still come through with lower rates but the 
spectacle of a president and congress haplessly fumbling to reach 
agreement over the last few weeks has sapped public confidence 
some experts said 
if that drop in confidence restricts investment and consumer 
spending the shortterm economic benefits of the budget agreement 
could be severely limited 
the new budget plan was a bit less stringent than its illfated 
predecessor but still called for higher income taxes on the rich 
and stiffer excise taxes on gasoline alcohol cigarettes and 
luxury items it also would cut spending on medicare 
the fiscal restraint once viewed as a cureall for the 
economys ills looked more like the first step on a long road to 
recovery

the nations bankers convened in orlando fla in the shadow of 
disney world to kibitz on their mounting financial problems the 
scene was the annual convention of the american bankers 
association a traditional getaway for the men and women of

but even in the magic kingdom there was no escaping the 
deepening recession in the financial industry nor the growing 
skepticism about the safety of banks and savings institutions 
aba president richard a kirk newly enthroned at the

facing the industry comptroller of the currency robert clarke 
known for frankness was more blunt blaming bankers themselves for 
precipitating a crisis of confidence 
he faulted the industry for risky lending in real estate and 
said banks ought to raise more capital to cover potential lending

inc said milken may have violated some company policies and 
misled him while cutting the deals examined at the hearing 
the confrontation between exemployer and employee intrigued 
those who have tracked the longrunning milken saga but featured 
fewer dramatics than your average episode of la law 
josephs testimony while hostile was no more damaging to the 
fallen financier than any of the other volleys discharged during 
the course of the twoweek hearing few could be described as much 
more than glancing blows 
us district judge kimba wood ordered the hearing to weigh the 
governments claims that milken deserved a harsh sentence because 
he committed many more crimes than he admitted in his plea bargain 
the only verdict to be rendered will be the judges sentence 
which cant exceed the maximum 28 years set by the plea agreement

stock prices on wall street may be in a funk 
but the cost of a copy of the paper named after americas 
bestknown financial byway is going to jump 50 percent in december 
dow jones amp co inc said thursday it will raise the newsstand 
price of the wall street journal to 75 cents a copy from 50 cents 
on dec 3 giving it the highest cover price for a leading national 
daily newspaper 
the move comes at a time when newspaper company profits are 
slumping but opinions were mixed on whether the journals move 
would prompt other papers to risk circulation losses by hiking 
prices 
at usa today one of the journals chief competitors larry 
lindquist senior vice president for circulation said the paper 
had no plans to raise its cover price of 50 cents in 1991 
dow jones is also boosting the annual subscription price for the 
journal by 78 percent to 139 from 129 effective jan 2 1991 
it said the price hikes reflect higher transportation and other 
publishing costs and rising newsprint and postage rates 
earlier this month the company announced a 175 percent drop in 
its thirdquarter earnings due in part to a decline in ad revenue 
it later disclosed a costcutting plan that included a freeze on 
capital spending and total salaries postponement of a new 
magazine and a reduction in the number of special reports in the 
journal 
while several specialinterest daily newspapers sell for more 
than 50 cents a copy the american newspaper publishers association 
said the journal will be the first generalinterest daily paper 
with a newstand price of 75 cents 
the newsstand price of the journal has been 50 cents since april 
1984 when it was raised from 40 cents a copy subscription rates 
were last raised two years ago 
the journal has the largest daily circulation of any us 
newspaper averaging nearly 186 million copies in the six months 
ended sept 30 
roger may a spokesman for dow jones said newsstand sales 
account for under 300000 in sales or less than 20 percent of the 
total 
he said newsstand sales fell slightly after the 1984 price hike 
but circulation eventually recovered all lost ground 
we cant predict what the impact of this increase will be but 
the outlook for the long term is that we will gain back whatever we 
lose he said 
everette dennis executive director of the gannett center for 
media studies at columbia university characterized the journal as 
a special case with a relatively affluent audience that could well 
afford to pay the extra quarter for the daily paper 
but others said the trend toward higher prices at the newsstand 
was generally established with a weak advertising market putting a 
drag on newspaper revenues throughout the country more increases 
could be on the way 
joseph lorfano of the newspaper publishers association said the 
average single copy price of newspapers has been rising steadily 
reaching 30 cents per copy on average last year up from 25 cents 
in 1987 
may said 64 newspapers including the journal have cover prices 
of 50 cents a copy up from only four at that figure in 1985 
dow jones also said it was raising the newsstand price of 
barrons national business and financial weekly to 250 a copy 
from 2 effective with the dec 3 issue the annual subscription 
price will rise to 109 from 99 effective with the jan 7 1991 
issue 
barrons last raised it newsstand price in january 1989 and its 
yearly rate in january 1990

the final government witnesses against michael 
milken described a longtime secret securities parking scheme 
with a big drexel burnham lambert inc customer but failed to link 
him decisively to insider trading 
eight days of testimony concluded thursday on charges levied by 
the government to try to persuade a federal judge that the former 
junkbond financier deserves a long prison term 
no further witnesses were expected to testify in the manhattan 
federal court hearing both sides were to present written 
summations to us district judge kimba wood who then would set a 
sentencing date 
milken has pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to 
illegal trading he has agreed to pay 600 million in penalties and 
faces up to 28 years in prison 
on thursday former drexel trader james dahl testified that 
milken ordered him to buy caesars world inc bonds at a time the 
government claims milken had inside information about the company 
he also said milken and the columbia savings amp loan association 
routinely engaged in secret securities parking arrangements 
from before 1983 until 1986 which the government contends was 
illegal but dahl said he knew of no similar arrangements with 
other drexel customers 
dahl further testified about a secret bathroom conversation with 
milken drowned by a running faucet after speculator ivan boeskys 
1986 deal to cooperate with prosecutors the government sought to 
suggest milken may have wanted dahl to destroy evidence 
the government alleges the charges it has raised in the 
presentencing hearing show milken to be a pervasive lawbreaker 
the defense says he is innocent of the additional claims and that 
his admitted crimes were aberrational 
on the caesars claim the only charge of insider trading offered 
of three alleged illegal transactions presented at the hearing 
dahl said milken in early july 1983 told him and other drexel 
salesmen to purchase as much of caesars securities as possible 
milken had attended a meeting with caesars and drexel executives 
on june 29 where the government claims the possibility of drexel 
managing a debt restructuring offer was discussed 
dahl testified that on july 8 he purchased 2 million in caesars 
bonds then sold them to columbia sampl so it appeared as though 
drexel no longer owned them but dahl said columbia was actually 
parking the bonds or holding them secretly for drexel which 
can be illegal 
furthermore dahl testified drexel and columbia had a 
longstanding arrangement in which columbia would secretly hold 
securities for drexel with an agreement to return them later asked 
by prosecutors who initiated these transactions dahl said 
mike 
drexel on july 15 announced it was advising caesars on a debt 
restructuring that sent the bonds soaring in value 
under crossexamination from liman dahl said he did not know 
whether milken was aware drexel had been negotiating to manage the 
caesars debt restructuring 
prescott crocker manager of a large highyield bond fund that 
agreed to sell drexel 12 million in the caesars bonds on july 14 
testified that after the restructuring was announced he accused 
dahl and drexel of insider trading 
crocker said milken denied any advance knowledge of the caesars 
debt restructuring saying the deal was handled by drexels san 
francisco office and that milken offered to make up the gains from 
the bonds in future trades 
dahl said milken called him to drexels beverly hills calif 
highyield bond department on sunday nov 16 1986 two days after 
boeskys decision to cooperate in a probe of wall street 
corruption boesky later became milkens chief accuser 
dahl said milken took him into the mens room turned on a 
faucet washed his hands and said in hushed tones there havent 
been any subpoenas issued whatever you need to do do it 
asked later what milken meant dahl testified i wasnt sure 
what he was saying do whatever you have to do what does that 
mean i didnt know he also said milken never ordered him to 
destroy documents or not cooperate with investigators

the tentative contract agreement between chrysler 
canada ltd and the canadian auto workers union resolves the fifth 
of six labor negotiations between the big three automakers and 
their unions in the united states and canada 
the final unresolved set of talks involve chrysler corp and the 
united auto workers union in the united states but there are 
promising signs 
the uaw union has scheduled a meeting for next thursday of its 
chrysler bargaining council the session could be used to review 
details of a tentative agreement to inform local union leaders on 
progress in talks or to set a strike date 
notices of the meeting of the 200member council of local 
presidents and bargaining committee chairs were mailed thursday 
uaw spokesman bob barbee said 
word of the meeting came as the canadian auto workers union and 
chrysler canada chryslers canadian subsidiary reached a 
tentative agreement on a new contract covering about 10000 
workers the agreement reached thursday afternoon wraps up caw 
bargaining with canadian subsidiaries of each of the big three 
automakers 
in the united states the uaw has ratified new agreements with 
general motors corp and ford motor co the unresolved chrysler 
contract will cover about 63000 us hourly and salaried chrysler 
employees 
the caw and the uaw have pressed the big three and their 
canadian subsidiaries to bargain essentially two contracts one in 
canada and one in the united states 
the new threeyear agreement with chrysler canada meets the 
allencompassing auto pattern set by the caw at ford of canada and 
subsequently met by gm of canada a caw statement said thursday 
the decision by chrysler canada to meet the canadian pattern 
when it is indicating opposition to meeting the us pattern is an 
important turning point in the history of labor relations the 
statement said 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca and other company executives have 
said the uaw pattern agreement is so expensive that chrysler may 
not be able to afford it chrysler has not asked for concessions 
but said it needs special consideration from the union 
the uaw has said there must be a pattern contract among the big 
three automakers in the united states 
aside from lapel pins which say pattern or picket there has 
been little bargaining rhetoric since talks between the uaw and 
chrysler intensified earlier this week 
company and union officials said talks were continuing mostly in 
meetings of subcommittees which focus on specific areas of the 
contract such as health care time off and job security 
the uawgm and uawford agreements call for three years of 
income protection for workers laid off when plants shut down 
because of slumping sales they also provide for a 3 percent base 
wage increase in the first year and 3 percent lumpsum payments in 
the second and third years 
gm attempts to clarify plantshutdown language in a letter 
attached to its contract with the uaw for the first time promising 
to consult with the union before shutting down a plant 
the letter obtained by the detroit free press and published in 
part today said both sides would review options to closing before 
the automaker took action 
the pattern agreements have no changes in health care 
provisions a critical concern of chrysler the company said it 
spent about 684 million on healthcare benefits last year 
in canada where a national healthcare plan is in effect there 
is little concern about medical costs the pattern agreement in 
canada provides for raises of 75 percent in the first year 67 
percent in the second and 48 percent in the third year of the 
agreement

a nationwide congress of coal miners 
put aside divisions today and adopted a plan by radical miners to 
form the soviet unions first independent trade union 
the new independent trade union of miners has a potential 
membership of 2 million miners and could evolve into a potent new 
political and economic force with power over energy supplies 
the miners have been the most unified labor group in organizing 
protests and strikes their walkout in 1989 threatened to leave 
much of the country without fuel 
the 900 delegates meeting in this industrial ukrainian city 
vowed today to push ahead with demands for workers rights and 
better living conditions 
delegates said they were prepared to strike again to enforce 
their demands but not until after the legislature of the russian 
republic now in session in moscow has had time to act on their 
complaints 
the majority is for creating a new union but there is a 
minority that believes in the survival of the old official 
union said konstantin fesenko a miner from donetsk the heart 
of a major coal region 600 miles southwest of moscow 
the governmentsponsored national congress of trade unions voted 
on wednesday in moscow to disband and form a voluntary association 
of unions but the miners said they werent interested in joining 
the old and new at some point may negotiate to come together 
but the current apparatchiks in the old union must go first 
fesenko said 
delegates today voted 52511 with 40 abstentions to accept a 
detailed plan for a new confederation of independent mine unions 
the plan was drawn up by radical miners based in siberias rich 
coal fields who started the nationwide strike in 1989 
a group of 130 radical miners fed up with five days of debate 
held a separate meeting thursday night to create a new union with 
or without their colleagues support 
i was happy last night now im not so sure said vyacheslav 
golikov leader of the kuzbass council of workers committees 
which called the meeting 
he said he was afraid the congress would water down their 
principles for the new union but added i hope it will still be 
a success 
golikov has been dubbed the lech walesa of the soviet union for 
his effort to create a workers opposition movement 
in addition to higher wages the principles would guarantee job 
security give rights to workers to choose their own union leaders 
and define who could belong to the union 
the new wage figure has not been specified but officials have 
said the miners should receive twice the average soviet salary 
under soviet economic reforms now under way controls on wages will 
be lifted 
the plan calls for regular miners congresses and the creation 
of a representative council and an executive body to coordinate the 
new unions actions 
the new union would be a confederation allowing scores of 
smaller unions to maintain their independence within an umbrella 
organization 
when news of the radical miners decision reached the congress 
this morning many delegates angrily denounced congress organizers 
and demanded to join the new union 
after a heated debate the congress sent negotiators to talk 
with the new union they agreed to create a temporary organizing 
committee to prepare the first congress of the independent union 
no date was set 
the 1989 miners strikes began with demands for better working 
and living conditions but quickly escalated to include demands for 
regional economic autonomy for the main mining regions 
the government persuaded the miners to return to work by 
promising to meet most of their demands but most of the promises 
remain unfulfilled an issue that has spurred new strikes 
the miners have also sought regional control so the mines can 
form selfmanaged local and regional associations that can sell 
coal to the highest bidder

a new twodoor coupe will be among a new line of 
cars made at the jointventure assembly plant in illinois owned by 
chrysler corp and mitsubishi motors corp 
the decision announced thursday deepens the relationship between 
the two companies chrysler owns 121 percent of the japanese 
company mitsubishi 
the two companies issued a joint statement thursday announcing 
the new generation of cars to be split evenly between them 
chrysler currently gets about 55 percent of the cars made at the 
plant in normal ill 
neither company would say when the plant would begin making the 
cars or give the details of the new cars a threedoor sports car 
and a fourdoor sedan in addition to the new twodoor coupe said a 
chrysler official speaking on the condition of anonymity 
diamondstar makes the mitsubishi eclipse and mirage the 
plymouth laser and the eagle talon and summit the eclipse laser 
and talon are twodoor sports cars and the mirage and summit are 
fourdoor sedans 
chrysler officials have said the company was talking with 
mitsubishi about building a new vehicle to replace the dodge omni 
and plymouth horizon subcompact cars that chrysler the third 
biggest us automaker axed in february 
however the chrysler official said the new car for the 
diamondstar plant would not be an omnihorizon replacement 
the official also said the new cars will use more domestic parts 
than the current diamondstar cars which contain about 60 percent 
us parts the increase will come from more use of chrysler 
engines and transmissions a joint statement from the two companies 
said 
the two companies each own 50 percent of diamondstar 
the first diamondstar cars the eclipse and laser began 
rolling off the assembly line sept 1 1988 the talon was added 
next and the summit and mirage came later 
in addition to diamondstar chrysler and mitsubishi are linked 
through the dodge and plymouth colt line of small cars made by 
mitsubishi the dodge stealth a new car for the 1991 model year 
also is designed and built by mitsubishi with the exception of the 
outer body panels which chrysler designed

an administration energy expert says consumers 
can expect the price of gasoline to hover between 130 and 162 a 
gallon over the next year provided that no war breaks out in the 
persian gulf 
us energy information administrator calvin kent also told a 
senate panel thursday to expect home heating oil prices to range 
between 113 and 145 per gallon through 1991 roughly equal to 
the high levels heating oil reached in last winters cold snap 
kents forecast came in the opening session of a threeday 
hearing on why retail gasoline and heating oil prices shoot up on 
the slightest rumor of trouble in the mideast but dont seem to 
fall when rumors of peace send crude oil prices tumbling 
kent told the senate governmental affairs committee that an 
improvement in the mideast situation might lower the price of crude 
oil but an immediate response at the gasoline pump shouldnt be 
expected 
prices go up more quickly than they come down kent said 
kents price estimates assume that the persian gulf crisis does 
not dissolve into war that the winter is normal in severity and

these are times when the complex world of high 
finance is stumping even the highly financed 
the securities and exchange commission wants junk bond mutual 
funds which are targeted at individuals rather than big 
insitutional investors to explain that high yield means high risk 
with many junk bond yields passing 20 percent mutual funds that 
invest in the bonds are also touting high returns 
as the market gets pessimistic about the likelihood of junk bond 
investments paying off the price gets beaten down the lower price 
means even higher and more enticing yields 
the sec is afraid bond fund investors are making decisions by 
comparing the high yields to the interest rates offered on 
investments at their local bank money market funds and bond funds 
that invest in higher quality debt 
the average annual yield on highyield funds tracked by lipper 
analytical securities corp has risen from 129 percent last 
september to 154 percent this september 
the significantly higher yields do not reflect the income 
stream investors can expect but rather the risk that their 
investment may lose a substantial portion of its value in a 
financial restructuring or default gene gohlke the secs acting 
director of the division of investment management said in a letter 
to the funds last week 
while the yields have soared the plunging prices made the 
average junk bond fund lose 112 percent in the year that ended 
sept 30 said lipper a mutual fund research firm 
the sec said highyield funds should consider hiring telephone 
operators who can explain the risk to shareholders pressure 
brokers to be forthcoming with investors and exclude yield 
quotations from advertisements or add information explaining the 
risk 
bond funds say theyre thinking about it 
while some funds already have changed their prospectuses to 
detail the high risk inherent to highyield bond investing the sec 
suggestions go beyond these complicated and often hardtoread 
explanatory documents 
the focus is on sales practices rather than adding another 
lengthyddisclosure requirement to the prospectus i think thats 
good to focus on the marketing of funds said stanley griffith 
associate general counsel at bostonbased fidelity investments 
if youre going to put a big yield number up there then youve 
probably got an obligation to go further he said 
griffith said fidelity recently had begun showing the lower 
coupon rate rather than the yield to maturity in advertisements 
for its fidelity high income fund 
at oppenheimer management corp paul suckow director of fixed 
income investing said the firm has changed its prospectus and 
asked brokers to explain highyield risk 
i think today however with prices substantially lower than 
where they were a few years ago the risks are less he said 
people should now be looking at this and saying with the 
prices so much lower the risks are less than existed a couple 
years ago when prices were so much higher suckow said

oil prices moved up about 1 per barrel on the 
futures market this morning as traders kept betting on war in the 
persian gulf 
its definitely just the increased war fears and seeing the 
war premium getting put back inthe market said annlouise 
hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
light sweet crude oil the key grade was up 95 cents to 3520 
per barrel for december delivery contracts on the new york 
mercantile exchange late this morning contracts for delivery in 
later months were all trading higher as crude moved up sharply for 
a third straight trading session 
oil regained all of the ground it lost in mondays record tumble 
of 541 per barrel but trading was erratic and speculators were 
left uncertain on oils future direction 
its a market that has gotten increasingly emotional and is 
very much reacting to the situation in the middle east hittle 
said 
recently big jumps in oil prices both up and down have seem 
to come with greater frequency as the market has appeared to become 
even more volatile analysts say 
there is some sense from previous reports that time is running 
out on the situation said william byers an analyst with bear 
stearns amp co whether thats a correct perception i dont 
know 
byers said many traders believe any attack on iraqi forces might 
occur either just before or just after the us elections now less 
than two weeks away 
traders had been expecting even sharper rises today after the 
london oil futures prices jumped dramatically but before the new 
york market opened a french television report of a conciliatory 
letter from iraqi president saddam hussein to french president 
francois mitterrand had a calming effect 
refined petroleum products were on the rise along with crude 
oil 
unleaded gasoline futures were up 245 cents to 9605 cents per 
gallon on november contracts contracts for delivery in later 
months were all trading higher 
home heating oil was up 223 cents to 9390 cents per gallon for 
november delivery later delivery months were all higher 
natural gas futures showed little change with december delivery 
contracts falling 16 cents to 243 per 1000 cubic feet later 
delivery months were mixed

distribute a newspaper today using nonunion replacement drivers 
who ran a gantlet of protesters throwing rocks and bottles 
police reported at least two minor injuries and at least 11 
arrests including two men held after a delivery truck was 
firebombed 
copies of todays paper reduced to only one edition were 
trucked out of the printing plants about three hours late under 
police escort 
it was not immediately known how many were printed and 
delivered but the news was absent from some midtown manhattan and 
suburban railroad station newsstands during rush hour 
a halfdozen pickets marched outside the news headquarters this 
morning and union leaders stood outside to direct workers to go 
home 
the strike called thursday night at the nations secondlargest 
metropolitan daily newspaper capped a 10month dispute over 
managements efforts to gain more control over moneylosing 
operations 
police in riot gear escorted delivery trucks out of a daily news 
printing plant in kearny nj through hundreds of strikers and 
their supporters hurling bricks stones eggs and bottles vehicle 
windows were covered with protective tape to prevent any shattered 
glass from injuring those inside 
one truck was firebombed in neighboring harrison nj kearny 
police capt anthony gouveia said no injuries were reported two 
men were arrested shortly afterward in kearny on charges of 
possession of three molotov cocktails lt micheal davitt said 
another man was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks at a truck 
at the kearny plant gouveia said 
he was the only one we could catch gouveia said it was 
ugly out there 
delivery trucks also rolled past hundreds of jeering protesters 
outside news plants in the new york city borough of brooklyn and in 
garden city on long island 
strikers broke the windows of a news truck in brooklyn and the 
driver was taken to a hospital for treatment of facial injuries 
said police spokeswoman sgt mary wrensen 
she said other strikers pelted a news truck in manhattan 
causing the driver to lose control and hit two parked cars a 
security guard inside the truck sustained minor injuries in a 
scuffle with two strikers she said 
six people were arrested mostly on charges of disorderly 
conduct outside the lon island plant garden city police lt 
william fitzpatrick said 
two were arrested outside the brooklyn plant where a 
fireworksstyle explosive was ignited beneath a truck police said 
eight unions with about 1800 members went on strike and the 
newspaper guild said its 800 members would honor picket lines 
including one at the main news offices in manhattan 
management crews produced todays edition its lead headline 
concerned a police crackdown on drug dealing near city schools but 
a smaller headline beneath it said unions strike news and had a 
picture of a news delivery truck burned after a dispute thursday 
that triggered the strike 
on thursday a union official was ejected from the brooklyn 
plant while defending an employees right to work while seated the 
newspaper said workers then walked off the job union leaders say 
they were locked out 
sixty drivers with the most seniority then were fired and 
replaced by nonunion workers fires were started and trucks were 
sabotaged

thursdays dispute only 920000 copies of thursdays issue were 
distributed the news has a normal weekday circulation of 118 
million 
the daily news intends full publication and distribution of 
its friday issue the box continued 
the news normal weekday circulation is second only to the los 
angeles times among metropolitan dailies the nationally 
distributed wall street journal and usa today also have larger 
circulations than the news 
contracts for all 10 of the newspapers unions ran out in march 
and negotiations have stalemated 
it is indeed unfortunate that a strike was provoked by these 
unions against the daily news at a time when we were involved in 
the collective bargaining process to resolve our differences 
said john sloan daily news vice president for labor relations 
he said replacement workers from other tribune co papers in 
orlando fla and chicago were being flown to new york 
over the past decade the news has lost about 115 million and 
daily circulation has dropped by about 700000 the papers

million to 70 million annually 
the unions said the paper is trying to break them and called for 
an advertisers boycott 
in a bar near the brooklyn plant workers said they had been 
expecting a showdown with management for weeks 
the daily news thinks they can put out a scab paper and they 
think new yorkers will buy it said a veteran driver who would 
not give his name we can only hope and pray that new yorkers 
dont 
the paper is embroiled in one of the nations fiercest newspaper 
wars analysts have questioned whether the city can support three 
tabloids and the broadsheet new york times 
the other two tabloids planned to increase their press runs

the treasury department on friday sold 1013 
billion in 52week bills at the lowest interest rates in more than 
two years and rescheduled for next tuesday a 12 billion auction of 
2year notes 
both offerings had been postponed because of congressional 
failure to raise the debt limit after it fell from 3195 trillion 
to 312 trillion on oct 20 but president bush signed legislation 
on thursday raising the ceiling to 3195 trillion through saturday 
which permitted fridays auction 
the budget package that congress hopes to pass this weekend 
would raise the limit to 4072 trillion and the treasury said the 
2year note auction is contingent upon enactment before tuesday 
the average discount rate at fridays bill auction was 701 
percent down from 725 percent at the last auction on sept 20 
it was the lowest rate since 52week bills averaged 674 percent 
on may 5 1988 
the bills will carry an equivalent coupon interest rate of 751 
percent with each 10000 in face value selling for 929320 
sales totaled 1013 billion out of bids of 4713 billion

the former owner of a failed dallas savings and 
loan who has been accused in a criminal indictment of diverting 
funds to keep the thrift afloat was released on a personal 
recognizance bond today 
jarrett e woods jr former owner of western savings 
association agreed in federal court today to surrender his 
passport and limit his travel to the continental united states 
woods was accused thursday in the indictment of illegally 
diverting 18 million to pay off delinquent loans as a way of 
postponing the highflying thrifts 1 billion collapse 
prosecutors did not oppose the personal recognizance bond in an 
8minute initial appearance before us magistrate jane jackson 
woods next court appearance is scheduled for nov 1 
woods who was described by the us attorney general as one of 
the industrys biggest bandits in texas had no comment upon 
leaving the hearing 
his attorney shirley lobel said she could not comment because 
of a gag order 
the 37count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in 
dallas charges woods with bank fraud misapplication of bank funds 
making false ledger entries and conspiracy 
we have corralled one of the biggest savings and loan bandits 
in texas attorney general dick thornburgh told reporters 
thursday the freewheeling lifestyle and fraudulent management 
practices that led to westerns collapse helped set the trend for 
our national thrift crisis 
thecharges carry a maximum sentence of 185 years in prison and 
fines totaling at least 82 million or twice the loss proven by 
prosecutors 
westerns failure in 1986 when it was taken over by federal 
regulators cost the taxpayers 1 billion the justice department 
said a civil suit filed earlier this week by the federal deposit 
insurance corp seeks to collect 560 million from woods it 
accuses woods of spending 7 million of depositors money in the 
months before western failed 
the thrift which woods purchased in 1982 with 2 million in 
borrowed money grew from 70 million in assets to 2 billion four 
years later said us attorney marvin collins 
collins said the case can be fairly characterized as an 
example of a real estate developer jarrett woods buying up a 
sleepy little sampl moving it to dallas pumping it full of 
highcost brokered funds and then lending the money out on 
highrisk loans 
the indictment shows the great lengths that people will go to 
deceive regulators collins said 
the indictment charges that woods diverted 16 million from a 
60 million loan for a houston real estate deal to businessman 
james reagin a major borrower who was behind on loan payments to 
western 
most of the money plus 226 million that was diverted from the 
sale of western property was used to help reagin pay off loans so 
that western would not have to write them off as bad debts 
at one point reagin was behind on loans worth 64 million 
collins said 
just the loans to james reagin would have likely caused the 
failure of western savings association collins said 
reagin a houston businessman who faces sentencing in connection 
with the failure of the glen ellyn savings and loan in illinois is 
cooperating with prosecutors in their investigation of woods 
officials said 
woods is not accused of pocketing any of the funds diverted to 
reagin but collins said woods as 100 percent owner of western 
was motivated by a desire to keep regulators from taking over the 
sampl 
the indictment also charges that woods arranged for a western 
subsidiary to pay a 48000 commission to a company that had not 
earned the money the indictment alleges the money was actually 
used to pay off a gambling debt woods owed 
there is nothing you can do basically in the short run to 
address these cases quickly collins said of the departments 
fouryear effort to get woods you must have a long large 
concerted effort

the house passed legislation today to protect 
employees of banking agencies who expose cases of abuse in the 
governments effort to clean up the savings and loan industry 
the proposal by rep frank annunzio dill was part of a money 
laundering bill passed by voice vote in the waning hours of the 
1990 congressional session 
employees of the federal deposit insurance corp the 
nowdefunct federal home loan bank board and other banking agencies 
were not covered by the whistleblower protection act of 1989 the 
annunzio would extend that protection to them retroactive to jan 
1 1987 
sampl regulators currently unprotected by federal whistleblower 
laws are like police officers who cant make any arrests rep 
charles e schumer dny told a hearing thursday the lack of 
protection for thrift regulators who point out cases of abuse harms 
the governments sampl cleanup effort schumer said 
imagine putting a cop on the corner taking away his gun 
badge and nightstick and telling him that hed be fired if he 
tried to make any arrests he said thats about what weve 
done with our sampl regulators 
also on thursday federal regulators approved a plan to sell or 
close about 192 failed savings and loans over the next six months 
the resolution trust corp oversight board approved the plan which 
involves assets valued at 119 billion 
the proposal must be approved through the congressional 
appropriations process 
schumer spoke at a hearing of the house budget committees task 
force on urgent fiscal issues which he chairs two sampl agency 
employees who were fired testified at the hearing 
john m geddes a former employee of the nowdefunct federal 
savings and loan insurance corp was fired in august 1989 he had 
told the agency about serious errors he found in the 
adjustablerate mortgage portfolio of american federal savings amp 
loan of anderson ind 
geddes said errors involving adjustablerate mortgages which he 
discovered at various sampls around the country could mean 8 
billion to 15 billion in liability for the lending industry and 
the government in some cases he said borrowers have been 
overcharged by almost 10000 on loan balances of 25000 
several law firms consulted by geddes had warned the fslic that 
its failure to correct the errors could expose the agency to 
allegations of fraud 
i was not the only employee who was informed not to rock the 
boat geddes said other employees were passed over for 
advancement or given the worst jobs until they could not take it 
any more and resigned 
in june the fdic ordered an investigation into overcharges on 
adjustablerate mortgages 
the other whistleblower lisa r walleri was an examiner for 
the federal home loan bank of seattle she testified that she was 
fired for refusing to sign a report on far west federal bank that 
distorted its financial condition to make it look more healthy than 
it was 
john f downey an official of the office of thrift supervision 
said his agency agreed with ms walleri that the seattle fhlbs 
report on far west was inaccurate he said the ots found various 
deficiencies in the seattle agency including failure to comply 
with policies and procedures and inadequate guidance and 
oversight 
she deserves an apology downey said of ms walleri he 
added that the ots would consider offering her a job 
the whistleblowers protection act shields federal employees who 
disclose governmental wrongdoing against reprisal lawmakers who 
drafted last years sampl bailout legislation say they 
unintentionally neglected to provide such protection for banking 
agency workers

three former northwest airlines pilots 
convicted of flying a passenger plane while intoxicated were 
sentenced to prison today two for a year and the other to 16 
months 
us district judge james rosenbaum also imposed three years 
probation on each telling them gentlemen you are good men who 
have done a bad thing 
the judge said the pilots actions amounted to a breach of faith 
between the traveling public and the pilots 
it is a crime against our sense of security in that sense 
all of us are a victim of this crime he said 
the sentences were within federal guidelines which recommended 
12 to 18 months the maximum would have been 15 years rosenbaum 
left open the possibility that they could remain free pending their 
appeals 
the defendants capt norman lyle prouse 51 of conyers ga 
1st officer robert kirchner 36 of highland ranch colo and 
flight engineer joseph balzer 35 of antioch tenn were 
convicted of flying while intoxicated on a hop from fargo nd to 
minneapolis the morning of march 8 
at the sentencing hearing assistant us attorney elizabeth de 
la vega asked for a substantial sentence while the pilots 
lawyers argued for lenient treatment 
as he announced his decision rosenbaum said he was particularly 
disturbed that all three pilots had been under the influence who 
can comprehend an entire crew alcoholimpaired he asked 
prouse who had the highest bloodalcohol concentration in a 
test given two hours after the flight landed was the one who 
received the 16month sentence the judge told him that his 
acknowledged alcoholism was not a license to kill 
in the tests after the flight was completed prouse had a 
bloodalcohol concentration of 013 percent kirchners was 006 
percent and balzers was 008 percent 
at the trial the pilots had argued that the fact that the 
40minute flight which had 91 passengers was uneventful showed 
that they were not rendered incapable of flying by the alcohol they 
had drunk the night before 
they were the first pilots to be convicted under a 1986 law 
aimed at cracking down on substance abuse in the transportation 
industry 
prouse admitted to drinking more than 15 rum and colas at a 
lounge the night before the flight a waitress testified that 
prouse fell as he left the bar at about 1130 pm and returned to 
get directions to his hotel which was about three blocks away 
balzer and kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer and 
left the bar about an hour before prouse according to testimony 
the plane left at 630 the next morning and the crew members 
were arrested after they arrived at minneapolisst paul 
northwest fired the pilots after the incident for drinking 
within 12 hours of a scheduled flight and the federal aviation 
administration revoked their pilots licenses

former western savings association owner jarrett 
e woods jr accused of illegally diverting 18 million in funds 
from the thrift was released on a personal recognizance bond 
friday pending arraignment next month 
woods is expected to enter a plea to a 37count indictment on 
nov 1 he is charged with illegally diverting thrift funds to pay 
off delinquent loans as a way of postponing the highflying 
thrifts 1 billion collapse 
prosecutors did not oppose his release on personal recognizance 
during an 8minute initial appearance before us magistrate jane 
jackson 
woods had no comment upon leaving the hearing his attorney 
shirley lobel said she could not comment because of a gag order 
issued thursday by us district judge robert maloney 
the indictment returned thursday by a dallas federal grand jury 
charges woods with bank fraud misapplication of bank funds making 
false ledger entries and conspiracy 
westerns failure in 1986 when it was taken over by federal 
regulators cost the taxpayers 1 billion the justice department 
said

fines totaling at least 82 million or twice the loss proven by 
prosecutors

insurance corp seeks to collect 560 million from woods it 
accuses him of spending 7 million of depositors money in the 
months before western failed

aetna life and casualty co on friday announced 
a restructuring plan including layoffs to tighten operations and 
save hundreds of millions of dollars 
the hartfordbased insurance company also announced a 51 percent 
drop in thirdquarter earnings that included a onetime 60 
million charge for severance benefits and other costs associated 
with the reorganization 
analysts said the restructuring may be good medicine not only to 
aetna but the ailing insurance industry which has been suffering 
from soft premiums and poor returns in its real estate and bond 
investments 
aetnas announcement might set the tone for the insurance 
industry in general said denise a petsis an analyst with argus 
research corp the insurance industry is in a down cycle 
theres very little room right now to improve revenue so what 
theyre trying to do is hold the line on costs 
when the insurance industry rebounds i think a lot of these 
companies aetna included will be in a much better position 
petsis said 
aetna one of the nations top five insurance companies said it 
would save up to 95 million a year by reorganizing its three 
domestic insurance divisions into two groups in the process 2600 
jobs will be eliminated through layoffs and attrition 
our goal is to build on the many areas of excellence aetna 
must retain and to solidify our position as a leader in insurance 
related financial services and managed health care said james t 
lynn aetna chairman 
aetnas competitors are also retrenching travelers corp also 
based in hartford recently cut its dividend to save 100 million 
and said it will become choosier about where it sells coverage 
philadelphiabased cigna corp is consolidating its domestic 
property and casualty operations to pull in any loose ends 
the 90s will be the era where focus will count said 
michael frinquelli an insurance analyst with salomon bros 
i dont think we will necessarily wind up a decade from now 
with fewer companies in the business we will end up with same 
number smaller and more focused he said 
aetna said it earned 886 million or 80 cents per share in 
the three months ended sept 30 compared to earnings of 183 
million or 163 per share a year earlier 
revenue slipped 12 percent to 484 billion in the quarter from 
490 billion for the same period last year premiums rose 
slightly to 33 billion from 32 billion last year 
under the reorganization to be put in place march 4 two new 
groups will be created one will include managed health care group 
insurance small business employee benefits markets pension and 
financial services individual annuity and pension and sponsored 
sales 
the other will be made up of commercial markets national 
commercial accounts bond personal auto homeowners and individual 
life insurance 
all our existing businesses remain its just a matter of how 
they will be grouped and how they will be funded said company 
spokesman john c hawkins 
aetna said most of the job eliminations would come from its 
three offices in the hartford area about 17400 of its 45200 
employees work in hartford middletown and windsor conn 
he said it was too early to tell how many of the jobs would be 
lost through layoffs 
the thirdquarter earnings also include net capital losses of 
38 million because of additions to reserves and writedowns 
related to the companys mortgage loan and real estate porfolios 
for the first nine months of 1990 aetna reported net income of 
4722 million or 423 per share down 103 percent from 5258 
million or 467 per share a year earlier 
ninemonth revenue slipped 06 percent to 1443 billion from 
1451 billion in 1989 premiums fell slightly to 966 billion

chevron corp on friday reported a 3 
percent drop in thirdquarter earnings blaming the decline on 
rising oil prices due to tension in the middle east 
the nations largest importer of crude oil reported earnings of 
403 million or 114 a share for the three months ended sept 
30 compared with 417 million or 122 a share for the same 
period last year 
chevron said some of its losses were offset by 80 million in 
special items compared to just 7 million for such items last 
year after adjusting for those items the company said operational 
results declined 21 percent 
ken derr chevrons chairman and chief executive officer 
attributed the decline to turmoil in the middle east after iraq 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
product prices ultimately must reflect raw material costs and 
we would expect the competitive marketplace will have to 
acknowledged this he said 
higher prices of crude oil helped increase total revenues to 
106 billion for the quarter compared with 8 billion in the 
third quarter of last year chevron said 
the rising cost of crude oil also has benefited chevrons 
exploration and production earnings the company said us 
exploration and production income rose from 58 million to 201 
million in the quarter while income from foreign exploration and 
production increased to 197 million from 121 million 
but derr said chevron a net buyer of crude lost money because 
the higher cost of oil has not yet been recovered through higher 
prices for petrleum products 
chevron said it charged an average 26 cents more per gallon for 
those products while they cost the company an average 35 cents 
more per gallon in september than in july iraq invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 
derr said chevron has responded to the crisis by boosting us 
oil and natural gas production and increasing the amount of 
gasoline and other light products extracted from crude 
chevron also started production in australia to offset declines 
in canada nigeria and the united kingdom 
our strategy should certainly encourage conservation but it 
must also stimulate environmentally safe development of our 
resources derr said 
for the first nine months of 1990 chevron reoprted net income 
of 15 billion or 430 a share on revenues of 288 billion 
that compares with 11 billion or 331 a share on revenues of 
239 billion last year

weekend in the middle east adding to their concern was the 
disclosure that united states plans to send up to 100000 more 
troops to the area 
it appears with the situation in the persian gulf very very 
tense people wanted to buy back a few dollars said robert 
hatcher a corporate dealer with barclays bank plc the dollar 
typically is considered the currency of choice in times of global 
turmoil 
but countering the advance was an underlying bearish sentiment 
toward the us currency based on the expectation of lower interest 
rates and a weakening economy the market is anticipating that the 
federal reserve will notch interest rates lower once the 
deficitreducing budget package is in place lower interest rates 
make dollardenominated securities less attractive to investors

us trade representative carla hills said 
friday that resolving a dispute over agricultural subsidies is 
vital for the current round of international trade talks to meet 
its endofyear deadline 
hills said the dispute could scuttle four years of work on a new 
trade agreement for the 105 nations which are parties to the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
several european nations led by germany oppose cuts in 
government subsidies to farmers the united states wants these 
subsidies eliminated or reduced severely to allow agricultural 
products to be traded more freely on world markets us farmers 
would see their exports grow considerable if the subsidies are cut 
hills said 
the gatt negotiations called the uruguay round of talks are 
aimed at reducing international subsidies tariffs and other trade 
barriers 
hills told a gathering sponsored by the european community 
chamber of commerce in the united states that it would be extremely 
unlikely for the talks to be extended beyond their december 
deadline 
we have been at this four years she said the topics have 
not changed

the biggest criminal investigation in wall 
street history couldnt do it a shattered career and humbling 
sixcount guilty plea couldnt do it either 
so why should eight days of testimony on three transactions out 
of countless thousands over 20 years solve the mystery of michael 
milken one of the most enigmatic figures in wall street history 
at a court hearing to help us district judge kimba wood 
determine punishment the government failed to stick the fatal 
dagger in milkens persona but the junkbond pioneer didnt emerge 
as the boy scout his admirers would have him 
the hearing was the first public clash of facts ideas and 
opinions on milken who transformed drexel into a powerhouse 
investment firm now defunct on the back of ious called junk bonds 
that reshaped high finance 
prosecutors who began investigating milken in 1986 didnt 
decisively prove him guilty of the crimes alleged in three 
transactions but they did demonstrate a pattern of impropriety 
based on strong suggestions of illegality 
one thing was clear drexels junk bond offices on wilshire 
boulevard in beverly hills calif was a place of intrigue 
derringdo outlandish pay and sometimes sleazy behavior in the 
tumultuous 1980s 
the witnesses themselves formed a sort of class picture of the 
ideals and attitudes of the decade drexel trader james dahls 23 
million take in 1988 milken made 550 million the previous year 
450000ayear trader peter gardiners jealousy over a 15 
million colleague secret ledgers lying to a grand jury hints to 
destroy evidence and a symphony of water faucets drowning out 
clandestine conversations 
the government made three basic allegations against milken 
stock manipulation in wickes cos insider trading in caesars world 
inc and misappriation and bribery in storer communications inc 
as described the alleged schemes ratcheted up the level of 
cheating by the 44yearold milken beyond his admitted crimes that 
was the governments intent in requesting the special hearing but 
the defense appeared to deflect the main allegations 
prosecutors have certainly shown suggestive testimony that may 
well convince future historians mr milken did everything the 
government has alleged but they havent proven it in court said 
john coffee jr a securities law professor at columbia university 
in terms of a gear shift that shows higher level involvement 
in more culpable crimes such as insider trading i dont think the 
government can be very happy at the way the evidence looks in 
court he said 
milkens lawyers characterized the six felony counts to which he 
pleaded guilty as aberrations in an otherwise exemplary career the 
government said they were the tip of an iceberg of illicit 
behavior the common wisdom after the hearing was that neither 
picture was entirely accurate 
on wickes drexel trader cary maultasch testified he manipulated 
the companys stock with speculator ivan boesky under orders from 
gardiner gardiner blamed milken but couldnt offer any direct 
evidence beyond a shouted price and an inference of bad intent 
on caesars world again the link was hazy at best dahl said 
milken ordered him to buy caesars bonds at a time milken might have 
had inside information about the company but it appeared the 
trades might have been part of a legitimate strategy requested by a 
customer 
the testimony on storer may have been the most damning milken 
appeared to offer fund managers favors in the form of personal 
investments in storer which experts say is illegal but no 
evidence supported the governments theory of bribery 
beyond the specific allegations though a picture emerged of 
less than ethical and possibly illegal activity by milken 
underlings and some outside excutives 
former drexel traders described routine securities parking 
at the junkbond department which has been prosecuted criminally 
in other cases dahl said columbia savings amp loan association 
regularly over four years secretly held bonds for drexel purchased 
back at a set time and price asked who initiated the parking dahl 
said mike 
such behavior seemed second nature i parked securities 
routinely gardiner testified 
infleuncepeddling backscratching and strongarm tactics also 
occurred at drexel testimony showed supporting the popular notion 
of the firms power and arrogance an investment fund manager said 
a drexel executive not milken helped him land a job and then 
demanded control over his work 
perhaps most damaging to milkens character were stories about 
the period following the nov 14 1986 announcement of boeskys 
plea deal with the government that led investigators to milken 
dahl testified milken bent over near a running water faucet in a 
bathroom meeting and said whatever you need to do do it 
drexel trader terren peizer said milken ordered him to give a 
secret ledger to a close milken friend and colleague when peizer 
was searching for documents in response to government subpoenas he 
said milken opened an empty drawer and said if you dont have 
them you cant provide them 
but none of the former milken subordinates who cut deals to 
cooperate in exchange for a noprosecution guarantee one after 
lying repeatedly to a grand jury said milken ordered them to 
destroy evidence lie to investigators or convey inside 
information 
through his skill and power and authority to dole out millions 
milken achieved the loyalty of his minions which eroded under 
government threats of prosecution still on the stand they 
praised his business acumen and integrity in selling deals 
their testimony offered no smoking guns but it may support the 
governments theory that milken was the only one at drexel who 
could control a corrupt organization and was careful to insulate 
himself well the defense maintains that amounts to no more than a 
conspiracy theory judge wood is expected to sentence milken within 
two weeks 
when someone has the visibility and celebrity that michael 
milken has defense attorney arthur liman said during the 
hearing its easy to say that everything that ever happened at 
drexel was his fault

oil zigzagged wildly on the futures market 
friday closing down more than 1 per barrel after a rally based on 
war fears ran out of steam and traders began selling 
theyve taken it all over the place said thomas blakeslee 
an energy analyst with pegasus econometric group inc the market 
is so hungry for news and without the rumors and news its come 
off slightly 
light sweet crude the key grade of oil fell 124 to 3301 
per barrel for december delivery contracts on the new york 
mercantile exchange oil had gone to a high of 3540 per barrel 
before the selloff began 
later delivery months all closed lower after they retreated from 
gains made early in the session 
oil had begun the day by moving up about 1 as speculators once 
again bet war was likely in the persian gulf crude then began 
tumbling on hints of possible diplomatic solutions to the crisis 
traders were responding partly to a news report that iraqi 
president saddam hussein reportedly sent a conciliatory letter to 
french president francois mitterrand although french officials 
said they had no knowledge of such a letter the market was also 
moved by news of soviet diplomatic efforts in the mideast 
prices were also coming off as many traders expressed a 
reluctance to hold too many oil contracts over the weekend fresh 
in their minds was mondays record plummet of 541 per barrel 
oil rebounded strongly with gains of 171 on wednesday and 
317 on thursday for the week crude was down 78 cents for 
nextmonth delivery 
oils big swings seemed to be coming closer together sending 
the market farther in less time than it had been moving in recent 
weeks 
the volatilitys been extremely high said william byers an 
analyst with bear stearns amp co there is some sense that time is 
running out on the situation whether thats a correct perception 
i dont know 
many traders have been thinking any military action against iraq 
is likely to occur shortly before or shortly after the us 
elections less than two weeks away byers said 
blakeslee said the wild swings have been occurring on light 
volume as small players in the market feel the need to rapidly 
make trades on headlines 
the market will move very quickly on their panicking if you 
want to call it that or buying he said someone with deep 
pockets will withstand these moves 
as crude shot up and them tumbled futures contracts for refined 
petroleum products moved in a similar pattern 
wholesale home heating oil closed down 342 cents at 8825 cents 
a gallon for november delivery contracts with most later contract 
months moving lower for the week heating oil dropped 15 cent 
wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 213 cents to 9147 cents per 
gallon on november contracts with most other delivery months 
trading lower for the week gasoline was up 356 cents

retailer rh macy amp co inc is considering the 
sale of a significant equity stake to help reduce debt it was 
disclosed friday 
macy which already has sold small stakes to finance buybacks of 
some of its bonds said it was considering more equity sales and 
was exploring the possibility of selling a more substantial 
equity interest to a buyer who shares our view of macys value and 
future 
the retailer which disclosed its plans in a letter to 
stockholders did not identify any prospective investors 
macy said the sale will allow us to make a major reduction in 
our interest costs 
it was likely the proceeds of the sale would go toward retiring 
some macy highyield junk bonds the risky ious were used to 
finance the retailers 1986 managementled debtfinanced 
takeover known as a leveraged buyout 
the letter accompanied macys 10k filing the annual report 
that companies with publicly held securities are required to issue 
and file with the securities and exchange commission 
in the report macy said it lost nearly 80 million in its 
fourth quarter compared with a loss of 574 million in the same 
period of 1989 
earnings before interest taxes and depreciation the key 
measure of fiscal health for a firm after a leveraged buyout 
totaled 144 million after accounting provisions down from 156 
million a year earlier 
the companys sales which macy said were hurt by the economic 
weakness that plagued other retailers rose to 163 billion from 
159 billion 
macys fourth quarter ended july 28 
for the full year macy said it lost 2153 million compared 
with a loss of 63 million in fiscal 1989 
sales for the year rose to 727 billion from 697 billion the 
previous year 
macys losses were not a surprise as they became public last 
week after a meeting between macy executives and some of the 
companys creditors 
they also had been expected since the company announced earlier 
this year that it had suffered a disastrous christmas 1989 season 
macy and other retailers were forced to take steep markdowns to 
compete with highly indebted campeau corps department stores 
which slashed prices in hopes of bringing in sales and avoiding 
bankruptcy court 
in its letter macy noted several previously announced steps it 
has taken to reduce debt including the sale of credit operations 
to ge capital corp macy said the move would lower its 48 billion 
debt burden by 15 billion 
the company also noted it had reduced inventory by 600 million 
and lowered expenses to compensate for the sluggish retail 
environment 
macy and other retailers are expecting the upcoming christmas 
season to be difficult as consumers have become reluctant to spend 
amid the uncertain economic climate and with the middle east crisis 
unresolved 
we are prepared for the sluggish economy and we are taking 
advantage of market conditions to imrprove the financial structure 
of the company the retailer said in its letter 
besides its flagship macy stores located mainly in the east and 
texas the company owns i magnin and bullocks stores in 
california and the west it also owns specialty stores including 
charter club aeropostale and fantasies by morgan taylor which are 
stocked with macys private label apparel brands

the federal deficit soared to 2204 billion 
the second highest ever in the fiscal year ending sept 30 the 
treasury department reported friday 
it was the 21st straight year in which the government spent more 
than it took in the fiscal 1990 red ink was 437 percent more than 
the 1533 billion imbalance last year 
the bush administration had forecast a 1238 billion deficit in 
its initial forecast last february but by its midyear estimate in 
july the administration had boosted its projection to 2201 
billion 
the treasury announcement came as the administration and 
congress appeared to be nearing completion of a package of tax 
hikes and spending cuts designed to erase 500 billion from the 
deficit in five years including 401 billion in the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
but the administration says government red ink still will total 
2536 billion during the current fiscal year if the 
administration and congress can stick to the budget reduction goal 
ifnot the administration projects a whopping 2937 billion gap 
the fiscal 1991 projection excludes the estimated 1 billion a 
month the government is spending on its military forces in the 
persian gulf although it expects to regain half of that from 
contributions from other nations 
despite inclusion of the persian gulf operations in the last two 
months of the fiscal 1990 budget defense department spending was 
500 million less than the administrations july forecast of 2902 
billion 
brady and darman explained that while operation desert shield 
boosted spending by 12 billion the outlays were offset by 17 
billion in cuts in military construction and other programs 
the deficit had reached 2417 billion in the 11 months ending 
aug 31 surpassing the previous record of 2212 billion set in 
fiscal 1986 
but that was cut because the government spent 25 billion in 
august that it normally would have spent in september to avoid late 
payments due to the labor day weekend thus erasing that amount 
from the final months outlays 
the federal deficit had fallen beneath 200 billion during each 
year following 1986 dropping to 1497 billion in fiscal 1987 
1552 billion in 1988 and 1533 billion in 1989 
it was the 24th deficit in the last 25 years the government has 
not operated in the black since posting a 32 billion surplus in 
fiscal 1969 
revenues amounted to 1029 billion in september pushing 
receipts for the year up 41 percent to 103 trillion but outlays 
totaled 820 billion last month and 125 trillion for the year 
surpassing 1989 spending by 94 percent the deficit is the 
difference between income and outlays 
septembers 208 billion surplus compared with a 61 billion 
deficit during the same month of fiscal 1989 
contributing to the red ink was smaller tax collections than 
anticipated 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady and budget director richard 
g darman said in a statement that individual income taxes totaled 
4669 billion 92 billion less than projected last july at the 
same time corporate taxes totalled 935 billion 47 billion 
less than estimated 
the resolution trust corp the federal agency charged with 
bailing out the savings and loan industry cost the government 88 
billion in september and 465 billion during the year 106 
billion less than forecast in july 
brady and darman said the smaller outlays were due to 
slowerthananticipated resolution of failed thrifts 
the government hopes to regain much of the bailout cost by 
selling real estate loans securities and other assets from failed 
thrifts that would help reduce the deficit in future years 
as usual the biggest spending categories were the military 
social security and other programs of the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 205 billion in september and 2898 
billion for the year down 17 percent from 1989 
social security payments amounted to 759 million for the month 
and 2450 billion for the year a 77 percent increase over 1989 
other hhs payments including medicare and medicaid totaled 
140 billion in august and 1937 billion for 1990 up 124 
percent 
interest on the national debt amounted to 173 billion for the 
month and 2649 billion for the year a 100 percent increase over 
1989 it was the second straight year that interest has exceeded 
social security spending

soybean futures prices tumbled below 6 a bushel friday to a 
2month low on the chicago board of trade in a late selloff ahead 
of what was expected to be the biggest harvest weekend of the year 
grain futures also closed lower 
on other commodity markets oil futures weakened precious 
metals fell and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
soybean futures settled 4 cents to 10 cents lower in chicago 
with the contract for delivery in november at 594 a bushel the 
lowest daily settlement for a nearterm soybean contract since aug 
8 
the market opened lower amid speculation that the soybean 
harvest will move rapidly toward completion this weekend due to 
forecasts for mild dry weather in the midwest 
grain and soybean prices typically fall at harvest time as the 
new supplies come to market 
some analysts said fridays selloff partly reflected 
profittaking by speculators after a run up to prices near 615 a 
bushel earlier this week 
selling by speculative funds snowballed when the price for 
november soybean deliveries slipped below 6 bushel about 45 
minutes before the close said gerald zusel a vice president in 
the graintrading division of edamp f man international futures 
inc 
we had a technical breakdown he said there was big big 
fund selling in there today 
he said the soybean harvest could be finished within a week 
leaving farmers to concentrate on getting in the rest of the corn 
the agriculture department said earlier this week that the 
soybean harvest was 57 percent complete as of last sunday 
analyst david armstrong of agrivisor services inc in 
bloomington ill said soybean harvesting was already nearly over 
in iowa nebraska and south dakota 
its kind of hard to find a reason to be bullish right now 
armstrong said if the weather stays good the corn belt states 
will clearly be in a wrapup or at least a winddown situation by a 
a week from now 
wheat futures settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with 
december at 262 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 2 cents lower 
with december at 227 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents 
lower with december at 120 a bushel 
crude oil and refined products for nearterm delivery fell 
sharply on the new york mercantile exchange giving up some of 
thursdays gains 
the selling reflected preweekend profittaking and a lack of 
significant fresh developments in the persian gulf analysts said 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 32 cents to 168 lower 
with december at 3301 a barrel heating oil was 24 cent to 342 
cents lower with november at 8825 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 213 cents lower to 22 cent higher with november at 
9147 cents a gallon 
the drop in oil prices prompted heavy selling of gold which had 
rallied along with crude oil on thursday a 48point plunge in the 
dow jones industrials average spurred further selling of precious 
metals on perceptions that industrial demand for gold silver and 
platinum would decline in a weakened economy 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 490 to 540 
lower with october at 37090 a troy ounce silver was 154 cents 
to 179 cents lower with october at 405 a troy ounce 
pork futures fell sharply on the chicago mercantile exchange 
amid slack retail demand and unprofitable operating margins for 
packers analysts said cattle futures were little changed 
live cattle settled 25 cent lower to 13 cent higher with 
december at 7787 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower 
to 25 cent higher with november at 8717 cents a pound live hogs 
were 18 cent to 87 cent lower with december at 5295 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 147 cents to 19 cents lower with 
february at 6295 cents a pound

pan am corp could get at least 100 million more 
for the london routes it has agreed to sell to ual corp for 400 
million american airlines inc chairman robert crandall said 
friday as he again tried to thwart the sale 
although our analysis is not yet complete we estimate that 
the route authorities alone are worth in excess of 500 million 
crandall wrote pan am chairman thomas g plaskett in his second 
letter in two days 
we would welcome an opportunity to make an offer to acquire 
those authorities on terms substantially better than uals 
crandall said friday 
new yorkbased pan am received the letter but had no comment 
said spokeswoman elizabeth hlinko a spokesman for chicagobased 
ual also declined to comment 
on thursday crandall sought to start an auction for the london 
routes saying fort worthbased american could top the 400 million 
ual agreed to pay pan am the deal also includes two boeing 747 
jets plus participation in joint marketing and frequent flier 
programs 
plaskett responded that pan am had a binding agreement with 
united 
our board after careful consideration of all of the detailed 
terms of the united proposals determined that it was in the best 
interests of pan am to enter into the legal binding agreement with 
united that was announced on tuesday said plaskett a onetime 
marketing executive at american 
i had understood from our many conversations including our 
most recent one that american would be interested only in buying 
routes and did not wish to enter into a broadscale agreement with 
pan am plaskett said 
but crandall replied friday frankly i do not recall your 
ever broaching the subject of a longterm marketing program in our 
discussions concerning americans interest in acquiring pan am 
route authorities 
pan ams deal with ual came after fruitless efforts by pan am to 
find a merger partner or buyer for the airline which has suffered 
big losses in recent years 
crandalls effort shows the enormous importance american 
attaches to obtaining routes to london the gateway to europe and a 
crucial destination for any global airline

peter kiewit sons inc on friday scrapped 
an agreement to sell continental can europe to ball corp because 
of what the companies called a lack of bank financing that they 
blamed on recent market turmoil 
the tentative sale was announced in july ball said it was 
acquiring 33 european metal packaging plants from continental can 
which would have given it a foothold in one of the worlds most 
rapidly expanding markets 
continental was to have received 625 million in cash and 400 
million in stock giving it a 29 percent stake in ball the 
fifthlargest producer of beer and soft drink cans in the united 
states 
but the plug was pulled on friday the companies said in a joint 
statement on a financial and operating basis both ball and cce 
have been performing at record levels in 1990 unfortunately due 
in major part to the recent turmoil in world financial markets and 
in particular the us banking community ball has not yet arranged 
financing and the certainty of closing the transaction on the 
agreed upon terms and time frame have become compromised the 
statement said 
the scrapped deal comes against a background of growing 
reluctance by commercial banks to make loans as economic growth has 
slowed and a crisis persists in the persian gulf which has driven 
up oil prices and further weakened the us economy 
most of the top commercial banks in the united states have 
reported sharply lower earnings recently because of rising defaults 
on existing loans particularly to third world countries and 
commercial real estate projects 
ball still plans to acquire the remaining interest in its 50 
percentowned ballincon glass packaging corp joint venture in 
that deal also announced in july and due to be completed by the 
end of the year ball will pay 65 million in cash to its joint 
venture partner hollandamerican investment corp 
the continental can purchase was designed to help the company 
enter the fastly growing european market ball is a major can 
supplier to the cola giants and ball chairman richard m ringoen 
said his company hoped to ride their coattails into eastern europe 
cocacola co receives 25 percent of its soft drink cans in 
europe from continental a privately held business of peter kiewit

polaroid corp asked a federal judge friday to 
increase its record 9095 million patent infringement judgment 
against eastman kodak co by 173 million 
kodak meanwhile asked the same us district court judge to 
reduce the award by 48 million 
the motions follow judge a david mazzones oct 12 decision 
that ended a 14year legal battle with what is believed to be the 
largest patent infringement award in history 
mazzone ordered kodak to pay polaroid the 9095 million for 
infringing on polaroid patents for instant cameras and film when 
kodak entered the market in 1976 he also ruled the infringement 
was not willful 
cambridgebased polaroid had sought 12 billion and mazzones 
award was considered a disappointment in the investment community 
in fridays 40page motion polaroid asks the judge to 
reconsider his calculations in four major categories said polaroid 
spokesman sam yanes 
the categories involve calculations of such factors as interest 
rates increased film sales in 1984 and 1985 lost film sales and 
special costs related to manufacturing capabilities yanes said 
kodak spokesman paul allen said his company based its 12page 
motion on clerical errors in the calculation of damages 
royalty and interest 
kodak based in rochester ny originally argued it should pay 
polaroid 177 million equal to about 5 percent of its sales of 
instant cameras and film from 1976 to 1985 
after mazzone issues his decision on the two motions the two 
companies have 30 days to decide whether they will appeal his 
original judgment to the us appellate court in washington dc 
the spokesmen said 
both allen and yanes said their companies were still considering 
an appeal 
brenda lee landry an analyst with morgan stanley amp co in new 
york said fridays motions do not challenge the basic premises 
that mazzone used in rendering his judgment 
in other words theyre not asking him to change his logic or 
principles per say on any points of law landry said 
rendering a decision would involve whose calculations were 
right and whose computer was right she said 
theoretically mazzone could grant both motions which would 
mean that polaroid would receive an additional 125 million landry 
said 
disappointed though polaroid may be in the amount of the award 
if the company appeals the decision it may only do so on legal 
issues not monetary amounts landry said moreover polaroid could 
end up with a lower award she said 
the case dates back to 1972 when polaroid introduced the sx70 
color instant camera and a deal with kodak to make film for the 
camera fell through 
instant photography was invented by polaroid founder edwin land 
in 1947 and first marketed in 1948 polaroid held a monopoly for 
almost 30 years until kodak entered the field in 1976

troubled pan am corp said friday evening it 
wants to delay the payment of 30 million into its pension plan 
the request came in a filing with the internal revenue service 
that would not be made public pan am spokewoman pamela hanlon 
said pan am refused to say how its business might be affected if 
the irs turns down the request 
we have submitted an application to the irs to defer 
aproximately 30 million of pension payments that were due on the 
date of our transfer of our internal german service to lufthansa 
german airlines hanlon said that sale took place today 
the routes from the 150 million sale will be turned over to 
lufthansa on sunday pan am said 
ms hanlon did not know how long pan am hoped to put off the 
pension payment but she said the company will pay immediately if 
it must 
we have the cash to pay it ms hanlon said it is simply 
a determination on our part that by deferring the pension payment 
we would be able to maximize our cash position 
she declined elaboration but said pan ams move was related to 
higher jet fuel costs and a sluggish us economy that have hit the 
airline industry hard 
pan am had already deferred paying 53 million into the pension 
plan last month in an agreement with the pension benefit guaranty 
corp the federal agency that oversees pension fund administration 
by companies 
the 30 million payment that pan am is now seeking to delay is 
part of that previous deferral with the remaining 23 million due 
on feb 28 
the irs filing by pan am comes just four days after the carrier 
said it planned to sell prized routes from five us cities to 
london in a 400 million deal with rival ual corp 
amr corp the corporate parent of american airlines then said 
it wanted a chance to bid on the routes american said friday that 
it believed the london routes were worth more than 500 million 
pan am has said its deal with ual the parent of united 
airlines was more than just a sale of the london routes because 
it also contained a marketing agreement in which the two carriers 
would try to feed each other passengers by coordinating certain 
flights

the first commercial pilots to be convicted 
for flying a jetliner while intoxicated were sentenced to prison 
friday by a judge who reproached them for risking lives and 
breaking the trust of passengers 
who can comprehend an entire crew alcoholimpaired us 
district judge james rosenbaum said it is a crime against our 
sense of security in that sense all of us are a victim of this 
crime 
rosenbaum indicated he reluctantly followed federal sentencing 
guidelines in ordering yearlong prison terms for robert kirchner 
36 of highland ranch colo who was flying the plane and flight 
engineer joseph balzer 35 of antioch tenn the flight captain 
norman lyle prouse 51 of conyers ga was sentenced to 16 
months 
i have grave doubts that the guidelines fit the crime said 
rosenbaum who considered stiffer sentences 
kirchner and balzer were freed pending their appeals prouse 
didnt ask to be freed pending an appeal but the judge gave him 
five days to file a request 
the sentences also bar them from flying planes with passengers 
for the three years of their subsequent probation 
it was the first federal prosecution under a 1986 law making it 
a crime to operate a commercial airplane under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol the law presumes an operator is under the 
influence of alcohol at 10 percent bloodalcohol level 
the law also applies to commercial boats trains and passenger 
buses the maximum penalty is 15 years in prison and a 250000 
fine 
the judge said the three men put job security ahead of their 
passengers lives march 8 when they flew a boeing 727 from fargo 
nd to the twin cities after a night of heavy drinking at a bar 
the plane carrying 91 people flew smoothly and landed safely at 
minneapolisst paul international airport where the pilots were 
arrested 
what difference does it make that you landed the flight 
safely rosenbaum said the danger was there 
prouse admitted to drinking more than 15 rum and cola drinks at 
the bar balzer and kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer 
and left the bar about one hour before prouse 
they flew out the next morning 
in tests about two hours after the plane landed prouse had a 
bloodalcohol level of 13 percent kirchners was 06 percent 
balzers was 08 percent 
did you think about your passengers rosenbaum asked you 
certainly considered the risks to your jobs at northwest airlines 
to your income 
rosenbaum was referring to a warning the pilots ignored before 
the flight took off 
acting on the anonymous tip from a patron at the bar faa 
inspector verle addison met the cockpit crew at their departure 
gate he told the pilots he smelled alcohol and wondered aloud if 
they had violated the faa rule against drinking within eight hours 
of a scheduled flight he said there would be no violation unless 
the plane departed 
while addison was on the telephone to superiors in chicago the 
plane took off 
the defendants expressed relief at the length of their 
sentences 
its less than what i expected prouse said ill do the 
16 months one day at a time i cant walk out until i walk in 
prouse a pilot for 22 years at northwest and a veteran of 160 
combat flights in vietnam told rosenbaum the arrest prompted him 
to seek treatment for alcoholism a disease that killed both his 
parents 
i just want to say im sorry kirchner said in court im 
sorry to the public aviation community friends family wife and 
two sons 
northwest fired the pilots the federal aviation administration 
stripped their licenses 
in april a northwest pilot refused to fly a plane bound for 
atlanta after a passenger accused him of being drunk blood tests 
were negative

a former top drexel burnham lambert inc 
official said in court papers filed friday that michael milken was 
unaware of a 1983 agreement to advise a client central to a 
government charge of insider trading 
john kissick exhead of drexels west coast corporate finance 
department testified for milkens defense in a bid to exonerate 
the former junkbond financier from insider trading in caesars 
world inc bonds 
the government in a presentencing hearing that ended thursday 
offered testimony implying milken knew drexel was advising caesars 
on a debt exchange when he ordered his traders to purchase bonds of 
the casino company 
sentencing of milken on his guilty plea to six tradingrelated 
felony counts is not expected until after next week a clerk for 
us district judge kimba wood said friday 
milken attended a meeting with caesars and drexel executives on 
june 29 1983 at which the government claims milken was a 
leading proponent of a debtforequity restructuring for 
caesars 
former drexel trader james dahl testified at the hearing that 
milken at some point ordered him and other traders to purchase 
caesars bonds from customers but he couldnt when the directive 
was given 
drexel on july 15 announced it was advising caesars on a debt 
restructuring which sent the bonds soaring in value the 
government claims milken ordered the purchases because he had 
inside knowledge of drexels plans to manage the debtforequity 
restructuring 
prosecutors also claim milken purchased 265 million worth of 
caesars bonds on july 1 for a personal account and sold in late 
july at a 553000 profit 
kissick testified the june 29 meeting had no formal agenda and 
several proposals for helping the company were discussed 
i cannot recall who proposed what but i have attended over 
100 meetings like this with michael milken and it is not mr 
milkens style to stress any one option he said 
kissick said no decision was made at the meeting about caesars 
or even whether drexel would be hired to advise the company 
kissick said that caesars on july 1 told him it was interested 
in exchanging debt for equity he said he assigned an executive in 
drexels san francisco office to work with caesars 
to the best of my knowledge michael milken had no involvement 
with our relationship with caesars between june 29 and july 15 
kissick testified 
supporting testimony given thursday kissick said milken was out 
of the country on vacation for much of the period 
milken faces up to 28 years in prison the eightday 
presentencing hearing was on alleged illegal trading beyong the 
six counts he has admitted the government said shows milken 
deserves a lengthy prison term
