the government has ordered that this years 
college graduates must work for one or two years before pursuing 
graduate studies an official report said saturday 
the new rules appeared to be another attempt to prevent a 
recurrence of this springs popular prodemocracy student movement 
that was crushed by troops on june 34 
about 3500 students planned to start masters and doctoral 
degree programs this fall the official china daily newspaper said 
but a state education commission circular said students especially 
those in the social sciences must first gain work experience 
the new order does not affect students who already have work 
experience the paper said 
the government already has cut the number of incoming college 
freshmen nationwide by 30000 to 610000 students in an apparent 
effort to curb student unrest 
the paper quoted an unnamed education commission official as 
saying the new regulation was part of the governments efforts to 
reform university enrollment and job assignment systems 
he said the new order would significantly improve the 
backgrounds of people in the fields of applied and social sciences 
the report said more than half of this years new graduate 
students worked before continuing their studies

iran has tried to buy poisonproducing strains 
of fungus from canada and the netherlands according to the new 
york times 
the disclosure that iran was seeking the toxins renewed concerns 
that the country is trying to develop a weapon from the substances 
western intelligence officials said in sunday editions of the times 
american officials said the efforts could be part of a research 
program to develop a defense against biological weapons but an 
american official speaking about the bush administrations 
decision to urge the canadians and dutch to block the sale said 
there are enough bad vibes that we want to stand in the way of 
it were bending over backwards to be careful 
the iranians were seeking to buy types of fungus found on wheat 
and grass that produce toxins called mycotoxins which can harm 
humans and animals by inhibiting the ability of cells to synthesize 
proteins the newspaper said 
the united states in 1982 asserted that mycotoxins were used in 
a weapon that sprayed yellow rain on the hmong tribespeople in 
laos by communist forces 
iran began trying to buy the fungus last december when a man 
identified in intelligence files only as mr moallem got in touch 
with dr h bruno schiefer director of the toxicology research 
center at the university of saskatchewan 
schiefer thought it unusual because the purchase of such fungus 
is usually from one of many laboratories around the world and not 
from one scientist to another the paper said so schiefer 
contacted the canadian government and he subsequently declined to 
sell them the fungus 
soon after that the iranian research organization for science 
and technology tried to buy 11 types of fungus from the fungus 
cultures in the netherlands the paper said 
the dutch rejected the offer

republican dr bob lanier will meet democrat pete 
geren in a runoff for a congressional replacement for jim wright 
the former house speaker toppled by ethics charges fort wortharea 
voters decided saturday 
lanier host of the nationally syndicated tv health show 60 
second housecall garnered 21978 ballots or 39 percent of the 
vote to 17751 votes or 32 percent for geren a fort worth 
lawyer and former aide to sen lloyd bentsen 
that made a runoff necessary since one candidate had to garner 
more than 50 percent of the vote to win 
democrat jim lane came in third with 12308 votes or 22 
percent the remaining five candidates two democrats two 
republicans and a libertarian trailed far behind the highest 
votegetter of the five was republican laraine bethke who had 
1313 votes or 24 percent 
geren immediately predicted a runoff victory pointing out that 
saturdays combined democratic vote topped the total achieved by 
republican candidates well the democrats won tonight geren 
said at a victory party in west fort worth it took us four 
candidates to do it but when you total it up we got nearly 60 
percent of the vote i call that a victory 
shortly after the results came in wright endorsed geren hes 
a good man i think he will be a good congressman said the 
former congressman who had not endorsed anyone running in the 
special election 
lane said he also would lend his support to geren 
lanier said he wasnt surprised wright had come out for geren 
and said it was a formidable endorsement but lanier predicted 
he too would win the runoff 
under state law candidates from both parties run in a single 
special election with a runoff between the two top votegetters if 
no one gets a majority the law requires the governor to schedule 
the runoff 20 to 30 days after the votes are officially counted 
which usually occurs within a week of the election 
in an emotionally charged referendum in dallas voters approved 
2to1 a proposal to reorganize the city council to equalize voting 
power between whites and minorities the proposal received 41456 
votes to 20823 against 
voters in the dallas suburb of coppell faced suspension of bus 
service at midnight sunday after voting to withdraw from the dallas 
area rapid transit authority the suburbs of carrollton irving 
plano and rowlett decided to keep the service 
at the american legion post where wright and his wife betty 
cast ballots earlier saturday a steady stream of voters turned out 
during an overcast 80degree morning 
turnout had been expected to play a large part in the election 
because few issues divided the candidates and many residents 
remained angry that they had to vote for anyone other than the 
popular wright 
in the congressional race lanier and geren had been the 
frontrunners in a recent opinion poll 
each man had his partys endorsements but lane who stressed a 
prochoice stand on abortion had endorsements from labor groups 
and wrights son wright did not endorse anyone 
also on the ballot were democrats george petrovich jr and bill 
turner republicans bethke and jim hunter and libertarian robert 
buckingham jr 
after the 1988 election the texas congressional delegation had 
20 democrats and nine republicans the democrats had a 34year lock 
on the 12th district under wright 
wright who was revered for his talents at serving constituents 
and bringing federal money and jobs to fort worth resigned his 
house seat june 30 after an ethics investigation turned up 69 
instances of alleged rules violations 
democrats went into the election controlling the house by an 
80seat margin but faced embarrassment if they lost in a district 
where registered democrats predominate 
in special elections earlier this year democrats held a seat in 
alabama and won one in indiana and republicans held a seat in 
wyoming 
in dallas the 1041 proposal called for expanding the city 
council from 11 members to 15 with 10 elected from singlemember 
districts four elected from overlapping super districts and 
the mayor elected citywide currently eight members of council are 
elected from singlemember districts and three including the 
mayor are elected at large 
proponents said the plan would give minorities a greater voice 
in city government opponents said it would dilute minority voting 
power others said the plan wouldnt substantially change the 
ethnic makeup of council districts 
the transit referendum on whether five dallas suburbs would 
withdraw from dallas area rapid transit bus service could affect 
the longrange fate of a 245 billion plan to crisscross the 
metropolitan area with 66 miles of light rail by 2010 the plan 
also called for 18 miles of rail connecting downtown to the 
dallasfort worth international airport and 37 miles of bus and car 
pool lanes for suburban commuters 
opponents said the plan would cost the suburbs a lot more than 
the bus service would be worth

there is progress being made there has been a call for an 
extension of the contract however we understand large numbers of 
workers are walking out of buildings and not abiding by the 
extension 
u s west spokeswoman debbie thomas said what weve heard is 
that theyve stopped the clock and theyre going to continue 
bargaining obviously the assumption is that they must be close or 
else they probably wouldnt continue to bargain 
in the southwestern bell negotiations company spokesman david 
martin said the company gave the union a new proposal about 15 
minutes before the strike deadline which had 41000 union 
employees in five states poised to walk out 
i think were still hopeful we can get a contract martin

health benefits

123 million customers and has nearly 40000 cwa workers collapsed

going through normally on automated equipment but the walkouts 
disrupted repair services operatorassisted calls and inquiries 
to directory assistance those strikes affected 15 states and the 
district of columbia 
rosenthal said the key issues dividing the unions and the phone 
companies were wage increases and management efforts to make 
workers help pay health insurance costs 
various local issues are also being discussed in some cases 
the talks involve baby bell subsidiaries as well as the main 
regional companies 
companies made strike preparations including briefing 
management employees on filling union jobs u s west said it 
planned to pull its advertising from various media outlets monday 
if there is a strike in order to reduce demand for services 
normally we advertise to stimulate business said u s west 
spokeswoman debbie thomas if we get in a strike situation we 
would not want to overload our business offices 
the regional companies that faced saturday strike deadlines were

lightning forced the air force early 
sunday to postpone the launch of a military navigation satellite 
for the fourth time in a week 
as rain fell on the launch pad and lightning crackled nearby 
the countdown on the delta rocket continued down to the 4minute 
mark and was held there as officials hoped for a break in the 
weather 
the launch team had only a 21minute period starting at 211 
am in which to place the navstar satellite into a desired 
11000milehigh orbit when the weather did not clear in time the 
effort was called off 
the official reason for the scrub was lightning within five 
miles of the launch pad 
the launch was rescheduled for no earlier than friday officials 
said the long delay is necessary because of other launch activity 
in the next week 
a schedule conflict with last tuesdays launch of space shuttle 
columbia and thunderstorms resulted in three earlier postponements 
the 65 million navstar satellite is to join a network of 
navigation spacecraft that can tell us and allied military forces 
where they are anywhere in the world on land sea or in the air 
and in any weather 
the satellite is the third of 21 improved navstars that the air 
force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992 the first 
two were launched in february and june

syrian troops reportedly overran a 
christianheld strategic mountaintop town sunday tightening the 
noose around the christian heartland as savage rocket and artillery 
duels raged in beirut 
there was no immediate casualty report from the confrontation in 
the town of souk algharb but police said at least four people 
were killed and 27 wounded in the indiscriminate exchanges across 
the capital sunday 
a police spokesman acknowledged that the count did not include 
many civilians trapped under blazing buildings in christian east 
beirut 
no one can reach them because of the intensity of the 
shelling said the spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
standing regulations 
the new casualties brought the overall toll to 626 killed and 
1660 wounded since march 8 when the latest confrontation erupted 
between army commander gen michel aouns 20000 predominantly 
christian troops and syrias 40000 soldiers and their moslem 
militia allies 
the siege started one week after aoun blockaded illegal ports 
run by moslem militias south of beirut in an effort to recoup 100 
million in customs dues lost annually 
a spokesman for aoun said the mainly christian units controlling 
souk algharb foiled an attempt to capture the town and mounted a 
counterattack engaging syrian palestinian and druse forces in 
fierce closequarter combat 
but an official of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive 
socialist party said the syrian armys 41st brigade led by brig 
gen hashem moallak overran souk algharb and surrounding hilltop 
hamlets sunday 
it was the first major ground thrust reported since the current 
round of fighting erupted in march 
the druse official who refused to be named said druse 
militiamen and palestinian dissidents opposed to palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafat took part in the 
tankled attack on souk algharb 15 miles southeast of beirut 
police said they could not confirm or deny either of the 
conflicting claims but reported heavy fighting in souk algharb 
since september of last year aoun has headed a christian 
government rivaled by a moslem cabinet that is led by salim hoss 
and backed by syria

the sunday times reported that israel believes two 
israeli soldiers held captive by an iranianbacked shiite moslem 
group died shortly after being ambushed in southern lebanon in 1986 
in jerusalem the armys chief spokesman brig gen ephraim 
lapid refused to confirm or deny the report but said israel 
considers its prisoners of war to be alive unless it has 
documentary proof to the contrary 
by proof we do not mean through the british media or other 
media but through the red cross he said 
the weekly quoting unidentified senior sources in the israeli 
government said sunday that intelligence officers interrogating 
sheikh abdul karim obeid have concluded the soldiers died from 
wounds after being ambushed near beit yahoun in february 1986 
israeli commandos captured obeid the reputed leader of 
hezbollah or party of god in southern lebanon in a daring raid 
inside the lebanese border july 28 israeli officials have said 
they were willing to exchange obeid for three captured israeli 
soldiers including the two cited in the times story 
the newspaper also said the parents of the soldiers were 
informed by the military that their sons were dead but both 
families told the israeli daily yediot ahronot that they received 
no such report the family of one of the soldiers yosef fink 
refused to comment when contacted by the associated press 
the newspaper said israel had long been aware that the soldiers 
fink and rahamim alsheik were injured when they were captured feb 
17 1986 but believed that at least one of the soldiers survived 
after questioning obeid the israeli government believes one of 
the soldiers died 15 minutes after the ambush and the other died 
hours later the weekly said security officials said they believed 
last week that neither hezbollah nor iran knew that israel had 
learned its soldiers were dead the weekly reported 
the newspaper said the third israeli missing in lebanon air 
force navigator ron arad whose fighter jet was shot down over sidon 
in oct 16 1986 is believed to be alive but is being held by 
lebanese militia with closer ties to syria than iran 
the weekly quoting security sources in jerusalem said prime 
minister yitzhak shamir has told his cabinet not to publicly 
discuss the matter of the two ambushed soldiers and has tried to 
keep it secret from the united states to offset us pressure to 
free obeid in exchange for western hostages in lebanon 
israeli leaders know that agreeing to such an american request 
would help mend the recent strains in israeliamerican ties but 
they fear that obeids release would prompt criticism at home that 
israel risked the lives of its soldiers for an operation that 
solely benefited america the newspaper said

rescue workers on sunday located 
the wreckage of a plane that crashed six days ago with rep mickey 
leland and 15 other people aboard us officials said no survivors 
were found 
the plane crashed in gambela a town in southwestern ethiopia 30 
miles from the sudanese border and 60 miles from the refugee camp 
where the aircraft was headed said james haley a spokesman for 
the us embassy in addis ababa 
the plane went down in rugged highlands near two dirt airstrips 
the pilot may have been trying to reach because of bad weather near 
the refugee camp 
the crash site was located us helicopters put down they 
have confirmed 13 dead and the presumption is that the other three 
are also dead haley said in a telephone interivew 
in washington the pentagon issued a statement saying us 
helicopters discovered the crash site air force jumpers jumped 
out of a uh60 helicopter and they confirmed there were no 
survivors at the site 
however spokesman mel sudin who read the statement also said 
the jumpers accounted for only 13 people and that it appeared that 
three were missing 
leland a texas democrat who heads the house select committee on 
hunger was accompanied by eight americans they included three 
members of his staff a friend of the congressman three workers 
for the us agency for international development and the wife of 
one of the aid officials 
president bush said in washington barbara and i were truly 
saddened to hear that the discovery of mickey lelands aircraft 
revealed that apparently there were no survivors of this tragic 
accident mickey leland and the other members of his traveling 
party both americans and ethiopians were engaged in a noble cause 
trying to feed the hungry 
i have known admired and worked with mickey leland for many 
years his sense of compassion and desire to help those in need has 
aided millions of people from houston to addis ababa 
the twinengine twin otter vanished aug 7 in bad weather the 
rescue workers did not immediately speculate on the cause of the 
crash 
however gambela and the village of dembidola just to the north 
had been an early focus of the search because there are two rough 
dirt airstrips nearby 
the pilot may have diverted to one of those strips because of 
heavy clouds and low visibility at lelands intended destination 
the ethiopian government said peasants had heard a light plane 
circling one and possibly two other dirt strips 90 miles southeast 
of gambela on monday 
since the plane disappeared an aerial and ground search by us 
and ethiopian personnel had been carried out daily at one point 
weather satellites detected what appeared to be airplane distress 
signals far from the intended flight path but a search of those 
areas turned up nothing 
the seven others on board were all ethiopian they included a 
threemember crew an officer with the foreign ministry an officer 
of ethiopias research and rehabilitation commission another 
official and an employee of aid 
earlier sunday us and ethiopian rescuers had extended their 
search for lelands twin otter airplane into eastern sudan on 
saturday searchers had concentrated their efforts on valleys and 
mountains in a 100000squaremile area about the size of wyoming 
another embassy spokesman john guerra said four us army 
blackhawk helicopters and six other aircraft searched sunday along 
the path the plane was to take to the camp in fugnido 480 miles 
southwest of addis ababa 
ethiopian authorities said it was cloudy in the search area and 
visibility was poor sunday bad weather had dogged the operation 
since it began tuesday 
fugnido is the site of one of four refugee camps in southwestern 
ethiopia run by the un high commissioner for refugees fugnido 
houses more than 300000 sudanese who have fled famine and a civil 
war in their own country 
a c141 hercules aircraft with additional personnel and 
equipment arrived saturday to help in the search 
the reinforcements including 100 more searchers were sent 
mainly to relieve fliers of two hercules already involved in the 
effort they had been flying from dawn to sunset since they arrived 
from west germany on tuesday

space shuttle columbia 
swooped out of orbit and landed safely in the mojave desert on 
sunday at the end of a secret mission in which the astronauts 
released a superspy satellite to photograph military targets around 
the globe 
air force col brewster shaw commander of the fiveman crew 
guided the 97ton winged spaceship to a touchdown on a hard clay 
runway at 637 am pdt after a flight that covered more than 2 
million miles in five days one hour 
a super team and a great machine welcome home columbia 
frank culbertson an astronaut who served as the spacecraft 
communicator at mission control in houston told the crew as the 
spacecraft rolled down the runway after a perfect landing 
after securing systems aboard the spacecraft for nearly an hour 
the astronauts left the vehicle and did a walkaround inspection 
they found a few of the 30000 heat protection tiles missing a 
normal condition 
then they were driven to a nearby facility for physical exams 
and showers 
an hour before landing shaw fired twin braking rockets to drop 
the shuttle out of orbit and start it on a fiery dive through the 
atmosphere and into this desert air base 80 miles north of los 
angeles 
mission control lifted its curtain of silence to report the 
successful firing all parties here report a good deorbit burn 
all systems aboard columbia are clean brian welch the control 
center commentator reported 
sonic booms cracked overhead as columbia descended through a 
clear sky and made its sweeping approach to runway 17 on rogers dry 
lake 
the weather here was ideal with clear skies unlimited 
visibility and mild temperatures 
although as many as half a million people have flocked to the 
desert air base to watch previous shuttles land sundays touchdown 
was closed to the public because of the classified nature of the 
mission 
most news about the flight has been blacked out on pentagon 
orders since an overhauled columbia lifted off from cape canaveral 
last tuesday on its first flight in 3 years 
nasa was allowed to make only periodic statements that 
spacecraft and crew were fine and to disclose the landing day and 
then the time 
sources close to the project said the main goal of the flight 
was the deployment of a sophisticated 10ton spy satellite 
designed to snap highly detailed photographs of military 
installations troop movements and other targets of interest around 
the world 
it would help the united states verify soviet compliance with 
arms treaties just as russian satellites do over the united states 
and europe 
air force secretary donald rice confirmed wednesday that a 
satellite was deployed by the astronauts during their first day in 
orbit but he wouldnt discuss its purpose 
to prepare for the trip back to earth columbia commander shaw 
and pilot richard richards conducted a series of tests saturday to 
make certain the shuttles computers and control jets were ready 
in addition mission specialists david leestma james adamson 
and mark brown stowed several experiments some of those tests were 
believed to be connected with the star wars missile defense 
project while others involved determining how people can serve as 
military observers from space 
columbia the oldest shuttle last flew in january 1986 landing 
10 days before the challenger explosion that killed the crew of 
seven after the accident nasa concentrated on making safety 
modifications to the two newer shuttles discovery and atlantis 
before turning attention to columbia 
discovery and atlantis each has made two space trips since 
flights resumed last september 
columbias return restored the shuttle flight to three vehicles 
at a time when the launch rate is increasing with three more 
flights planned this year and nine in 1990 another orbiter is 
being built as a replacement for challenger and is scheduled for 
its first launch in early 1992

lowflying exercises by national and nato defense forces

the elderly man decked out in his sunday best 
posed proudly in the sunlight of a liquor store parking lot hoping 
the new cabinet secretary would see a family resemblance in that 
dignified profile 
he wrote to samuel r pierce jr the secretary of housing and 
urban development that his mothers maiden name too was pierce 
and she was from arkansas 
pierce wrote back that he was from virginia and he was sure 
they werent kin 
that letter was one of hundreds amassed by pierce during the 
eight years he served at hud during the reagan administration 
normally a housing secretarys government files would be packed 
off to the national archives where they would receive scant 
attention from historians who would find sexier things to write 
about than the tenure of a man who managed to remain in obscurity 
throughout his time in office 
but the 2 billion scandal of influence peddling and outright 
theft that pervaded the department during the pierce years has 
changed all that for a time during the past couple of weeks the 
crowd of reporters wanting to thumb through his files was so big 
the public affairs office at hud was taking reservations 
one theme comes through the 48 boxes of speeches letters 
bureaucratic jargon grip n grin photographs and mindnumbing 
meeting minutes many of pierces pen pals were on the make 
the vast majority wanted a job some money some time they 
tugged at every string they could find a chance meeting at a 
cocktail party a handshake at a graduation ceremony a family 
friend in congress a seat in congress a seat at the cabinet table 
dear sam began the 1981 letter from the late cia director 
william casey trying to boost the fortunes of the son of a 
deceased law partner 
hes had a lot of experience in hud is a gs14 is a proven 
republican has philosophical credentials and is the kind of 
fellow who ought to be brought up from the bureaucracy into policy 
work casey wrote of his friends son 
while the letters were as different as the people who composed 
them one thing all of the writers had in common was the 
probability that they would be horrified at the thought of their 
letters being dug out of the files by squads of chortling reporters 
finding the word confidential across the top of a letter 
discovered in these files now has an effect entirely opposite from 
the one intended instead of keep this to yourself it now 
means xerox me 
one such confidential memorandum was written in 1985 by bernice 
williams who at the time was director of the office of small and 
disadvantaged business utilization 
ms williams had gotten into a spat with deborah gore dean who 
was pierces executive assistant and now is a central figure in the 
investigations of influence peddling pierce himself had said that 
ms dean enjoyed power and was not reluctant about using it to 
flatten people in her path 
while the files do not show what started the tiff the incident 
that brought it to a memowriting fury was when ms dean sent hud 
employees to ms williams office to cart away the furniture 
after leading off with ms deans lack of sophistication and 
immaturity ms williams went on to call her a liar and say i 
am not intimidated by your threats 
it is my hope that attitudinal vindictiveness be put aside in 
the interest of effectively carrying out the secretarys goals and 
objectives ms williams wrote 
a formal reply to ms williams was not found in the files but 
the fact that someone had marked her errors of spelling and grammar 
gives some indication of what the tone must have been 
some of the papers in the files are dripping with irony such as 
the note pierce sent to all hud employees four years ago urging 
them to report any knowledge of waste fraud and mismanagement 
the law provides broad protection from any reprisal being 
taken against you for making such reports and i give you my 
personal assurance that i will not tolerate any such reprisal 
pierce wrote 
on the back of pierces memo was typed a threeparagraph letter 
from john kieren a hud employee from milwaukee who blew the 
whistle on wrongdoing in the department got fired and spent 18 
months in court to get his job back 
my experience to report fraud waste and mismanagement was a 
horror story that i for one do not want to experience again 
kieren wrote 
other letters now viewed with the 2020 vision of hindsight 
might make their authors squirm 
pierce received a pair of thankyou letters from charles dempsey 
and paul adams both of whom have served as the agencys top 
investigators and have been instrumental in exposing fraud and 
waste in pierces department 
ive told you previously how much i appreciated your support 
and backing dempsey wrote in thanking pierce for attending his 
1985 retirement party as the departments inspector general 
in his own note adams who succeeded dempsey wrote that pierce 
made the event an evening neither chuck nor the others who were 
there will soon forget 
some of the paper in the files gives a glimpse of what pierce 
himself was like it seems that rarely did anyone he know 
experience an illness or a death in the family that pierce didnt 
write a thoughtful note in one case he wrote a letter of 
condolence over the passing of muffin apparently a familys 
pet 
he also was mindful of the perks of his office once inquiring 
as to the free use of a restored presidential yacht and demanding 
in his extensive travels that he be accorded treatment befitting a 
member of the presidents cabinet 
in 1987 that trait nearly provoked an international incident at 
dulles airport outside washington when pierces firstclass 
reservations on a flight to paris were loused up 
pierce demanded an aisle seat in the firstclass cabin and an 
airline employee sami asfahani went aboard to find a place for 
the secretary to sit 
in the course of events mr asfahani politely requested 
members of a saudi arabian princes party to rearrange their 
seating so that i could secure the type of aisle seat i had 
requested pierce wrote in a letter to the chairman of the board 
of pan american airlines 
certain members of the princes party overreacted in my 
opinion pierce wrote

a chinese court has ruled against the first 
company from taiwan to sue china rejecting the claim that a 
taiwanese ship captain was intimidated into confessing to 
smuggling a probeijing newspaper said sunday 
the chineselanguage newspaper wen wei po said the zhuhai 
intermediate peoples court on saturday upheld the action of 
chinese customs officials and ordered the captain to pay 5770 in 
court costs 
on march 6 a chinese patrol boat seized the 1963ton taiwanese 
ship kuang ta no 2 near hong kong while it carried 31 crew 
members and 4760 cartons of cigarettes authorities released the 
ship and crew several days later after captain tsai chenghsiung 
signed a confession that he was smuggling cigarettes 
on april 11 the captain filed suit in zhuhai a chinese port 
about 40 miles southwest of hong kong in the suit the kuang hwa 
steam ship co argued that the confession was signed under 
threat tiring interrogation and the acute desire to release the 
ship and crew 
it demanded 43 million in compensation and return of the 
confiscated cigarettes 
in its decision the court rejected the companys argument that 
the confession was extorted and that ship was in international 
waters the paper said 
the chinese had said the ship was in chinese waters and its crew 
planned to sell cigarettes to chinese fishermen a violation of 
chinese customs laws 
both the nationalist government in taipei and the communist 
government in beijing have claimed to be the sole legitimate ruler 
of china since 1949 when communist forces drove the nationalists 
from the chinese mainland 
recently the two countries have relaxed restrictions on 
taiwanese visiting china

behind the lives destroyed in 20 years of violence 
in northern ireland lies another casualty the corruption of civil 
liberties in britain itself 
in its attempts to crush the irish republican army a nation 
that ranks among the worlds older democracies has adopted laws 
which opponents say would look more at home in a dictatorship 
prime minister margaret thatcher defends the practice of 
detaining suspects for a week without charging them or banning 
british radio and television stations from broadcasting interviews 
with ira members as part of the price for fighting terrorism 
to beat off your enemy in a war you have to suspend some of 
your civil liberties for a time she said after last octobers 
imposition of the broadcast ban which also covers members and 
sympathizers of 10 other militant groups 
none of us can be neutral as between the terrorist and the 
lawabiding citizen added mrs thatcher who survived an ira 
hotel bombing in 1984 that killed five people including two senior 
conservative party figures 
her critics however detect a gradual warping of democratic 
freedoms since the troubles flared and britain dispatched 
troops on aug 14 1969 to keep northern irelands protestants and 
catholics apart twenty years later the troops remain 
the financial times of london in an editorial in december 
commented on a lengthening list of recent government decisions 
each of which has given greater weight to reasons of state than to 
the civic rights of the individual most but not all arise from 
the troubles in northern ireland 
however the most controversial legislation the prevention of 
terrorism act is a legacy of a labor government enacted in 1978 
after 21 civilians were killed by an ira bomb in an english pub 
the act which applies throughout what is known formally as the 
united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland includes 
police powers to detain suspects for up to a week without charge 
in the decade of rule by mrs thatchers conservative 
government northern irelands death toll climbed past 2700 and 
britain has been cited 21 times the most by any country for 
violating the european convention on human rights 
her government imposed the broadcast ban on paramilitary groups 
and limited or proposed limiting the right of a suspect to remain 
silent 
since last fall courts in northern ireland have been able to 
interpret an accuseds silence after arrest as an indication in 
some circumstances of guilt those circumstances are 
failing to mention during interrogation any fact offered in 
defense at trial 
refusing to be sworn or answer questions at trial 
failing to explain any possessions or marks on the defendants 
clothing or person at the time of arrest 
failing to give an account for being at a particular place at 
the time of arrest 
the courts themselves which are convened without juries which 
might be intimidated or split along sectarian lines are also an 
extraordinary step taken in 1973 to combat terrorism 
last month a government advisory panel proposed limiting the 
right of silence for ordinary criminals in england and wales 
regulations under the antiterrorist act have been used to 
compel photographers and television stations to hand over material 
to help police investigations 
tv networks complained their crews were put in added danger 
after being compelled last year to hand over unscreened footage of 
an ira funeral march in which two british soldiers were murdered by 
a mob 
wed been pushed another step down a road with an uncertain 
ending commented roger bolton an executive with londons thames 
television station after giving police tape of an interview with a 
suspected terrorist 
britains runins with the european court of human rights are 
partly due to the fact that this country has no written bill of 
rights or constitution and thus issues are automatically 
transferred to the court in strasbourg france instead of being 
filtered through domestic courts 
last november britain refused to implement a ruling by the 
19judge court that the antiterrorism acts detention powers 
violate the european human rights convention and should be repealed 
the case was brought by four northern ireland men who were held 
for between 4 days and a week in 1984 and then released 
britain invoked an article of the convention that says the 
ruling need not be accepted in time of war or public emergency 
threatening the life of the nation

soviet authorities have set relatively easy 
targets for collective farms in an experiment designed to increase 
grain production by paying for excess crops in convertible 
currency a newspaper said sunday 
the newspaper labor said farms will be paid in dollars and other 
world currencies for any highquality grain they produce above 
their average for 198185 the entire soviet union produced an 
average of 180 million metric tons of grain during that period far 
less than the 210211 million metric tons produced in the record 
years of 1986 and 1987 
soviet authorities hope to stimulate domestic grain production 
enough to reduce purchases of grain on the world market 
farms will be allowed to spend their hard currency as they wish 
to obtain western combines foodprocessing equipment and other 
items the newspaper said it was not clear if the farms could 
choose to buy consumer goods 
for peas and oil crops the standard will be more difficult the 
average production of 198688 which were fairly good years 
the twoyear experiment will apply to collective and state 
farms the newspaper said authorities are still debating whether 
to allow farmers on the new leasing program to join 
american economist marshall goldman commenting on the program 
when it was proposed in june said it could undercut the attempt to 
convert farms to individual leaseholds 
he predicted that collective farms seeking to break previous 
records to obtain foreign currency will be unwilling to allow 
individual farmers to break out on their own and lease part of the 
farms land

a new school is being named after 
david the bubble boy the youngster unable to fight disease who 
died at the age of 12 after spending most of his life in a series 
of bubblelike sterile isolators 
davids parents were joined friday by relatives and officials of 
the conroe independent school district during groundbreaking 
ceremonies for david elementary in this community north of houston 
he inspired all of us said his mother carol ann i want 
students to be inspired by his experiences as well 
david who died 5 years ago lived all but the last two weeks 
of his life in sealed sterile surroundings the news media 
throughout that time and since have upheld an agreement not to 
disclose his familys last name 
school district superintendent richard griffin said schools are 
rarely named after students but david deserved it because his life 
typified the courage so important to the american character 
davids life will be remembered in a selection of material in a 
reading room of the schools library griffin said he said the 
school also will have an outdoor education center because district 
officials felt that would please david 
david attended elementary school through the fifth grade in the 
woodlands and developed a wonderful interest in education his 
mother said 
he also had a keen interest in the outdoors and dreamed of 
running through the grass barefooted she said 
its fitting that the school would be here in the forest 
she said 
davids isolation was needed to keep out germs because he was 
born with a condition known as severe combined immunodeficiency 
disease about 30 to 50 children are born with this disorder in the 
united states each year and they have little or no natural 
resistance to infections 
doctors tried to construct his immune system by giving him 
healthy bone marrow the source of diseasefighting blood cells 
donated by his sister the transplanted cells did not survive but 
they apparently infected him with a common virus which caused 
runaway cancer of his white blood cells and he died feb 22 1984 
it was the first conclusive evidence of cancer developing in a 
human after infection by a virus said dr william t shearer 
davids physician at texas childrens hospital in houston

despite the selfcongratulatory back slapping 
surrounding enactment of landmark savings and loan legislation last 
week many experts say the government failed to address one of the 
root causes of the bailout the deposit insurance system itself 
president bush signed the bill at 159 billion the largest 
financial rescue in the nations history in a rose garden ceremony 
attended wednesday by smiling cabinet secretaries and leaders of 
congress 
itll safeguard and stabilize americas financial system and 
put in place permanent reforms so these problems will never happen 
again he said before handing out souvenir pens to legislators 
who helped pass the law 
but a growing group of conservative and some 
notsoconservative thinkers believe bush cant really make that 
promise until policymakers tackle the politically explosive issue 
of deposit insurance reform 
white house economic advisers just before president reagan left 
office tried to raise the issue suggesting that deposit insurance 
ought to be curbed but even that vague recommendation raised 
a firestorm of criticism in congress 
rather than mire emergency sampl legislation in endless debate 
the bush administration decided to postpone the question by 
ordering the treasury department to study the issue and report its 
findings in 18 months 
academic analysts however say the debate should not have been 
postponed they argue that it is deposit insurance that not only 
put each taxpayer on the hook for 1000 over 30 years but 
encouraged sampls to run up the losses in the first place 
in a phenomenon economists call moral hazard thrifts that 
had lost their owners investment had every incentive to gamble 
with federally insured deposits 
if outlandish loans to sperm banks and windmill farms paid off 
sampl owners recovered earlier losses if the investments soured as 
they usually did the insurance fund had to pay 
the perverse incentives of federal deposit insurance allowed 
the drunk drivers of the sampl world to operate without paying any 
more for insurance than their sober brothers said bert ely a 
financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
he advocates privatizing the system by allowing banks to form 
syndicates to crossguarantee one another banks with risky 
portfolios would pay higher deposit insurance fees instead of the 
flat rate all banks pay to the government no matter how well run 
elys plan is just one of many floating around some like his 
would do away with the federal system established in 1934 as the 
cure to the wave of bank failures that swept the nation in the 
early years of the depression others would tinker with but not 
abolish the system in an attempt to inject more depositor 
discipline 
john s reed chairman of citicorp the nations largest bank 
advocates reducing the 100000 per account insurance limit and 
subjecting deposits over that to a 10 percent to 15 percent 
haircut in the event of failure 
that system similar to great britains would in effect 
impose a deductible 
just as motorists who have to pay the first 200 damage from an 
auto accident in theory drive more carefully than fullyinsured car 
owners depositors who could lose some of their money will pay more 
attention to where they open accounts 
other reform proposals such as one offered by william m issac 
former chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp would limit 
depositors to one insured account in an attempt to get at the 
practice of brokering deposits that is splitting large sums into 
100000 pieces and parceling them out to different institutions so 
the entire amount is insured 
all of the proposals likely will be examined by the treasury 
department in its study after that in early 1991 the issue 
returns to congress 
but few are expecting congress to approve anything but 
incremental changes at most 
i suspect it will not promote anything radical said l 
william seidman chairman of the fdic which under last weeks 
legislation now insures sampl deposits as well as bank accounts 
we have just invented a whole new logo for banks and sampls 
saying the governments full faith and credit is behind those 
deposits i think any attempt to change that will be very 
difficult said seidman whose agency released its own study 
early this year concluding that the benefits of deposit insurance 
outweigh the drawbacks 
those who oppose tinkering with deposit insurance make three 
arguments that the system has worked preventing bank runs for the 
past five decades that doing away with the system would force 
banks to lend only to big organizations drying up credit to small 
businesses and that curbing deposit insurance would help big bank 
holding companies at the expense of small community institutions 
one premise of advocates of insurance reform is that a bank run 
a contained bank run is not something to fear more than the 
failure of any other kind of business rather the threat of a run 
acts to encourage sound banking 
the depression so traumatized us that we dont even want to 
think about a bank failure said george g kaufman a professor 
at loyola university in chicago an individual bank run is really 
not bad at all except for the individual bank if a bank thinks 
there is a possibility of a run theyre going to behave a lot 
differently than if they dont 
the flaw in that argument according to robert litan of the 
brookings institution a liberal oriented think tank in washington 
is that regulators can never be sure a bank run wont spread even 
the healthiest banks dont have enough cash to pay off all 
depositors all at once and just a hint of trouble can spark a run 
in theory theres nothing wrong with letting one bank fail 
litan said but any policymaker faced with that choice generally 
doesnt want to go down in the history books as running an 
experiment that allowed the system to go down 
moreover according to seidman for depositor discipline to 
work depositors must be able to easily and quickly determine their 
banks condition 
i dont think we can depend upon depositors to know on a daily 
basis the condition of their banks we at the fdic have great 
problems doing that even with thousands of bank supervisors he 
said

up a grimy staircase through a dim 
hallway and into a fourthfloor apartment the beatles are playing 
and kolya vasin is preaching to a new generation the beatles gospel 
he accepted a quartercentury ago 
from long ago and far away the beatles have had a grip on 
soviet youth many of whom have lost faith in government and been 
denied free access to religion 
in your country rock n roll is just music 19yearold 
dima vasiliev a budding guitarist told an american reporter 
here its our soul our heart if there werent rock and roll 
id be a young pioneer or komsomol member he said referring to 
communist party youth groups 
the beatles and what they did had a special effect on 
russia said vasin 43 who describes himself as the fab fours 
biggest soviet fan and a beatleologist 
with his long black beard he could be mistaken for a russian 
orthodox priest but for the paul mccartney tshirt he wears 
here in a spiritual hunger its indescribable its a 
substitute for religion he said 
memorabilia is everywhere in vasins single grubby room his 
part of an apartment shared with two other families 
it is a shrine museum dining room living room and bedroom all 
in one shelves from ceiling to floor are filled with beatles books 
and buttons walls are lined with a hard days night and 
yellow submarine posters and portraits of john paul george 
and ringo 
like an eternal flame a lamp atop the bookshelf continuously 
throws orange light onto a photograph of john lennon who was 
murdered in 1980 a small sign in front reads in english bless 
you 
vasins proudest possession is a red white and blue soccer 
jersey he says lennon wore he said he got it through a friend of 
singer joan baez 
about a dozen teenagers are sitting around a table as beatles 
music blares from a tape recorder 
whats the name of that song vasin demands of one 
the boy shrugs his shoulders 
ill have to call your mother about that tomorrow vasin 
says jokingly 
vasiliev calls vasin his spiritual father who taught us that 
theres more than what school and parents taught us 
the teenagers come by regularly to sing dance and talk music 
vasin takes his beatlemania seriously hes been at it for 25 
years since a friend played him a tape recorded off british 
broadcasting corp radio 
something happened he recalled the words used were the 
best it was a high like god sacred a love hit me which i didnt 
have before only love for my mother 
vasin a painter made himself an expert on beatles trivia 
he collected more than 15000 beatles photos all of their 
albums bootlegged recordings and every scrap of paper about them 
he could find 
as i saw her standing there help and norwegian 
wood resounded he showed a reporter two beatles 
encyclopedias he painstakingly compiled including newspaper 
clippings photographs and poetry by or about the beatles 
two articles serve as reminders that beatles music and the 
lifestyle they represented once were officially frowned on 
these bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive 
passions the satirical magazine krokodil wrote in 1964 in the 
same year the head of the soviet composers union titled his 
condemnation of the beatles in literary gazette from the life of 
bees and dung bugs 
beatles records were banned but vasin and other soviet beatles 
fans found other sources foreign radio broadcasts and smuggled 
albums still just listening wasnt enough 
by 1966 he recalled people you would meet on the street 
talked not about their illnesses or studies the subject was the 
beatles they were also the main subject of telephone calls 
the groups music spawned dozens of copycat groups in the soviet 
union and gave birth to original soviet rock such as the group 
aquarium which recently signed a us recording contract and whose 
lead singer boris grebenshchikov credits the beatles with 
changing his life 
fans held beatles festivals swapped tapes and photos bought 
their albums for exhorbitant prices on the black market and some 
sported their familiar haircuts and dressed like them in jackets 
with round collars and no lapels vasin says some were arrested for 
hooliganism and antisocial behavior 
one teenager at vasins apartment said police fined his father 
for playing beatles music too loudly 
the first positive press report about the group appeared in 
1968 and vasin recalls in a soviet rock history book titled back 
in the ussr that he was so happy he ran around leningrad with 
the article in his hand shouting weve won 
more than two decades after they rocketed to the top of western 
music charts the beatles began to receive official recognition 
here 
the state record company melodia in 1986 issued a taste of 
honey and a hard days night some singles had been released 
earlier without mentioning the groups name because melodia didnt 
legally obtain permission to distribute them 
soviet beatlemania has not gone unnoticed by the people who made 
the music 
in november melodia released back in the ussr a 
collecton of old rock n roll songs mccartney recorded exclusively 
for soviet fans he also paid tribute to them in january in a 
phonein show on the bbcs russian service he said he would like 
to perform in the soviet union and that he admired soviet fans for 
following the beatles despite official harassment 
it didnt put us off russians we love you madly he said

add one more issue to the list of conundrums 
congress will have to unravel when it returns from its summer 
recess next month whether the tallest mountain in north america 
should be renamed 
its a perennial duel between an ohio congressman protecting the 
honor of william mckinley the 25th us president after whom the 
peak is named and an alaska senator defending his states right to 
name its own land features 
the motives of sen ted stevens ralaska are easy to discern 
his longrange goal is to see if the mountain can be renamed 
with alaskans wishes says connie godwin his spokeswoman 
it takes only a quick look at the background of rep ralph 
regula rohio to explain why he cares about the name of the 
20320foot mountain in central alaska a continent away from the 
people he represents 
mckinley is from my district regula says 
mckinley assassinated in 1901 was not only from regulas 
district but once held regulas seat in congress and is buried in 
the district regula is even a graduate of the william mckinley 
school of law 
mckinley the mountain is in denali national park which was 
renamed in 1980 from mckinley national park denali is an indian 
word for the great one and many alaskans would like to see the 
mountain bear the same name 
its owned by 230 million americans regula said last week 
alaska gets millions of dollars in taxes and taxpayers from the 
entire country have a right to decide what happens there 
a provision forbidding the government to rename the mountain was 
buried in the fine print of the annual interior department spending 
bill that the house passed july 12 when the senate approved its 
version of the legislation two weeks later the mt mckinley 
language was removed 
its a legislative dance that has been going on for years and 
regula has always prevailed 
ted goes along with a oneyear prohibition but not with 
statutorily naming it mt mckinley says regula 
like most geographic features mt mckinley was not given its 
name by law rather its name is officially recognized by the board 
of geographic names a division of the interior department 
it was named mt mckinley in 1896 when mckinley was ohio 
governor and the republican presidential candidate against democrat 
william jennings bryan 
in 1975 the alaska state legislature passed a resolution 
requesting that the park and the mountain be renamed to denali 
congressional hearings were held two years later in a compromise 
the park was renamed in 1980 but the mountain retained its name 
negotiators from the two chambers probably will meet next month 
to work out a compromise bill

sen bill bradley dipped into the money pools 
of new york and hollywood for more than 2 million in campaign 
funds during the first seven months of the year even though there 
is no gop challenger in sight for his 1990 reelection bid 
the effort vaulted the new jersey democrat into second place 
among 1990 senate incumbents for dollars raised this year behind 
rudy boschwitz rminn and left him with more than 34 million 
actress mary tyler moore author neil simon and amadeus 
star tom hulce have written checks to the new jersey democrats 
reelection campaign 
so have warner communications chairman steven ross mtv founder 
robert w pittman and viacom international president and ceo frank 
j biondi jr 
bradleys biggest money source from jan 1 to june 30 was a 
1000ahead new york city fundraiser april 10 that netted 11 
million the most ever for a bradley event 
how do observers explain the nation appeal of bradley 
hes got sort of a magical nature about him that sort of 
transcends politics said charlie cook who publishes the cook 
political report 
his fundraising prowess is extraordinary said tom mann 
director of governmental studies at the brookings institution 
hes one of the partys celebrities a rising star 
despite the contributions and republican gov thomas keans 
recent assertion that bradley is unbeatable the campaign is taking 
nothing for granted as it looks for an additional 6 million 
lets remember there is a governors race in new jersey 
said nick donatiello bradleys campaign manager in explaining the 
lack of gop candidates stepping forward so far 
this is going to be an expensive senate race predicted 
donatiello we would like to have 9 million to spend on the 
campaign 
in 1984 bradley spent 51 million to hold onto his seat 
compared with 956000 spent by republican mary mochary 
although bradley has been mentioned for years as presidential 
material donatiello put aside questions that bradley might be 
filling his coffers in anticipation of a 1992 white house bid 
theres always the speculation he said we fully expect 
to spend all the money we raise for the 1990 campaign on the 90 
campaign 
in order to run in new jersey you have to buy five senate 
races worth of media time for new jersey connecticut 
pennsylvania delaware and the most expensive media market of all 
new york he said 
cook agreed 
its fairly prudent for a senator to run a decent amount of 
tv secondly think about what percentage of the us population is 
within those media markets hes going to get a piece of the 
country in terms of 1992 cook said 
mann said bradley has opted to be safe and at the same time 
leave his political options open 
politicians always run scared assume the worst and prepare 
for it said mann therefore you raise money if youre able to 
as a way of discouraging whatever potential opposition may surface 
and being ready to wage a serious campaign if you need to 
looking at bradleys ability to raise 43 million toward 1990 
mann said all of it fits in well with a potential run for the 
presidency in 1992 or 1996 in any case it seems very sensible even 
if he hasnt decided if hes going to do that

leaders of little woolstock iowa say 
theyre not about to allow a concert in the town park on the 
anniversary of the woodstock rock festival because theyre worried 
about drugs and undesirables 
but the radio station sponsoring the event said the show will go 
on whether the city likes it or not on private land if need be 
and besides how many undesirables are going to show up at supper 
time on a week night even if there are free hot dogs 
the city council in the northcentral iowa town of 230 people 
voted 41 friday to prohibit radio station krit in fort dodge 
about 20 miles from woolstock from holding a twohour concert at 
the park tuesday night to observe the 20th anniversary of woodstock 
in 1969 a long list of leading rock groups attracted more than 
500000 people to a dairy farm in the catskills of new york state 
actually about 45 miles from woodstock 
krit officials said they were inspired to hold the concert 
because woolstock is just a letter away from woodstock but despite 
that similarity they said the town really doesnt have to fear it 
will be overrun 
woolstock officials said they didnt want to take a chance 
were not an antisocial town said councilman norval story 
who voted with the majority we like to have these gatherings 
but we were kind of concerned about the element that might come in 
the drug problem is bad enough as it is 
story and woolstock mayor kenneth spellmeyer said the event 
could have been sponsored at the park if krit had given the town a 
little time to plan instead they said town officials learned of 
the event in newspaper accounts last week 
i think theyre blowing it up a little said krit news 
director amy alberts 
look its from 6 to 8 pm no alcohol will be allowed and 
its in a fairly remote area on a tuesday night so youre not 
going to have that many people she said 
instead of jimi hendrix or crosby stills nash and young the 
musical talent is scott dohrmann of barnum and kevin lind of fort 
dodge both guitarists 
theyre the most wholesome guys in the whole world ms 
alberts said sure there will be music from the 60s and a sound 
system but there wont even be any drums 
and there cant be all that many people if anybody has to 
work the next day they certainly arent going to drive too far 
its tuesday night after all however there will be the 
attraction of free hot dogs and soft drinks courtesy of krit 
dorhmann does not have a telephone listing and no one answered 
the telephone at linds residence 
as for the failure to notify town officials in advance ms 
alberts said the radio station didnt know it needed to ask for 
permission besides she said the town didnt have to do anything 
its up to krit to do all the planning it was our event if a 
family were planning a reunion in the woolstock city park its the 
family that puts it together she said 
ms alberts said the radio station is determined to hold the 
event regardless of whether it has the blessing of the woolstock 
council 
this is going to happen no matter what she said before 
the council met an area farmer called us and said he suspected 
they would vote it down he said we could use some of his land 
and we got a call from a person in woolstock who said he had a 
big lot where we could hold it 
she said radio officials will visit the proposed sites and make 
a decision on where to hold the show by monday morning

deep cuts in state spending will mean larger 
classes closed schools fewer teachers and fewer sports programs 
for the 1 million students returning to massachusetts public 
schools and colleges next month educators say 
at the states 29 public colleges and universities students 
will feel the effects of a 393 million cut in higher education 
funding ordered by gov michael s dukakis the 1800 public 
schools will have to shoulder their share of a 210 million 
reduction in state aid to cities and towns 
educators use words like disaster tragedy and 
devastation to describe the impact 
the governor who touted his states booming economy during his 
unsuccessful presidential campaign last last year only to be 
blindsided by a surge in red ink this year expressed deep regret 
in announcing the cuts last month but he said he had little choice 
but to carve 491 million out of the states 198990 budget 
the cuts and the withholding of funds were needed to bring the 
budget to 122 billion in keeping with a balancedbudget 
provision in the massachusetts constitution 
schools in communities small and large are feeling the pinch 
for example 
brockton is considering a plan to charge highschool atheletes 
to take part in sports programs 
the small central massachusetts community of belchertown may 
begin making students pay to ride the school buses 
springfield will have to lay off at least 300 and possibly as 
many as 800 teachers out of a faculty of 2000 because of a severe 
budget crisis in that city all but a few athletic programs have 
been cut including soccer ice hockey and swimming according to 
assistant superintendent ann southworth 
some 8000 college students most of whom would attended 
community colleges designed to serve the poorest sector of the 
community will be turned away 
it is a cruel blow to schools state education commissioner 
harold raynolds jr said last week there wont be a single 
school across the commonwealth that is intact as it was last 
spring 
higher education chancellor franklyn jenifer said that despite a 
77 percent tuition increase and steep hikes in student fees the 
budget crisis has halted a push to advance the states public 
college and university system into the nations top rank 
we will at best be doing worse than we were last year and 
last year was a bad year jenifer said weve taken the 
position that one maintains quality at all costs access to 
mediocrity is no access at all 
higher education budget cuts will translate into 1900 canceled 
course sections for the 120000 fulltime students jenifers staff 
has calculated some 1200 parttime faculty and staff positions 
are being cut and 8000 student slots most in community colleges 
were eliminated for the fall term 
no one will be turned away from public elementary and secondary 
schools but because of faculty and staff cuts some of the 824000 
public school students will be in bigger classes than before 
staff and faculty reductions at public schools across the state 
are expected to reach 8000 according to the massachusetts 
teachers association 
in boston a parents group and the boston teachers union have 
gone to court to block a plan to close six public schools and 
consolidate three others 
two years from now people are going to be saying how come 
our kids cant compete said rosanne bacon president of the 
massachusetts teachers union were unwilling to spend our money 
on our kids this is not the way they do things in japan

barred from the chesapeake bay by congress and 
hounded by environmentalists in north carolina the navy now is 
trying to outflank its opponents as it eyes the gulf of mexico to 
test whether ship electronics can withstand a nuclear blast in 
space 
weve started a very active public information and 
availability program on the gulf coast said capt we mahew 
manager of the electromagnetic pulse radiation environment 
simulator for ships empress ii program 
there was too much misinformation about what the program was 
when it was proposed for the chesapeake bay and we were never 
able to counter that information he said the guy who got 
there first and told the story first was the only who was 
believed 
empress ii consists of a bargemounted truncated cone of 
antennas 128 feet high and 200 feet in diameter that surround a 
pulser which can simulate the electromagnetic field that would be 
generated by a nuclear blast in space 
the system generates an electromagnetic pulse emp that lasts 
just 10 billionths of a second but measures 50000 volts per meter 
at 100 meters from the barge in all directions the emp is fired at 
passing ships to test the effectiveness of measures designed to 
protect electronics systems from the emp that would be generated by 
a nuclear blast in space 
while the navy insists that the emp generated by empress ii 
poses no risk to the environment and that exclusion zones around 
the barge will protect the electronic systems of nearby planes and 
boats it has had a difficult time thus far making its case 
they just have not accurately assessed the impact of this on 
human health and what makes this particularly sad is that most of 
the people being exposed are people in the service said andrew 
kimbrell an attorney for the foundation on economic trends 
what were seeing here is similar to the army allowing those 
soldiers to be exposed to the first nuclear blasts after world war 
ii and we know the high incidence of cancer that resulted there 
he said 
the foundation a washingtonbased watchdog group on emerging 
technologies has filed suit in us district court seeking to halt 
empress ii tests off the coast of north carolina until the navy 
adequately assesses the impact of the tests on human health and 
animal life and on the electronic circuitry of nearby airplanes and 
boats 
the navy began operating the empress ii off north carolina in 
the summer of 1988 after congress enacted legislation prohibiting 
it from operating in the chesapeake bay until the navy demonstrated 
that the tests could be conducted no where else with less 
environmental impact 
after the lawsuit was filed the navy chose a new site off north 
carolina and conducted an environmental assessment that concluded 
the empress ii tests would have no significant environmental impact 
at the new site as soon as the 30day period for public comment on 
that assessment ended last month the navy resumed the empress ii 
tests at the new site 
in the meantime letters went out july 26 announcing that the 
navy planned to begin the environmental assessment that could lead 
to a new test site for empress ii about 20 miles off the 
alabamamississippi coast in the gulf of mexico 
mahew said the navy needs the gulf site because weather 
conditions limit use of the north carolina site to the summer 
months originally winter testing was to have been conducted in 
the chesapeake bay he said the navy is planning 60 days of empress 
ii tests in the gulf annually between october and april 
long before plans for the gulf site were announced however 
mahew said navy personnel were meeting with state and local 
officials and environmental groups in alabama mississippi and 
louisiana in order to get ahead of the opposition 
were laying it all out he said in four years of naval and 
independent research on the effects of emp he argues weve 
never been able to demonstrate any harm to human health weve 
never been able to demonstrate any harm to marine biota 
despite those claims and despite its best public relations 
efforts the navy appears to be facing a long legal battle before 
it can pursue its plan for yearround empress ii tests in the 
atlantic and the gulf 
im not an expert in the politics of the region kimbrell 
said when asked to assess the prospects of the navy winning the 
public acceptance for empress ii in alabama and mississippi that 
eluded it in virginia and maryland 
however they wont have any better legal atmosphere because 
theyre still going to have to comply with what is a federal law 
the national environmental policy act he said

friends and colleagues some in tears streamed 
into the downtown houston office of rep mickey leland on sunday 
morning as news spread that wreckage of the texas congressmans 
plane was discovered in ethiopia 
us officials said there were no survivors 
this is a very difficult time for houston we have lost one of 
our most important leaders and ive lost a very good friend 
said rep mike andrews his voice breaking 
andrews like leland a houston democrat was among the first to 
arrive at the office after word came that supporters hopes that 
leland and his entourage had somehow survived since monday had 
proven futile 
i know our prayers and thoughts are with his family his wife 
their young son and soontobe new baby andrews said mickey 
leland was a very special person i will miss him very much 
lelands wife alison was in seclusion sunday morning at their 
houston home and planned to make a statement later in the day a 
spokesman said 
meanwhile leland staff members were closeted in his 
eighthfloor offices at a downtown houston skyscraper people could 
be seen hugging and crying in the office volunteers delivered 
coffee and soft drinks to aides who had kept a vigil at the office 
its very somber very sad they are still in shock said 
kippy caraway who was helping lelands staff

was in the office off and on all night and was there when the call 
came in that the wreckage had been found 
we got a call from our washington office around 6 dutton 
said his voice wavering as you can well imagine its pretty 
somber up there a lot of people are calling in and expressing 
their sentiments 
paul joseph a family friend and consultant for foodlifts to

sacrifice as a humanitarian only good can come from him 
weve lost a real leader and real leaders in our political 
world are few and far between said bill ramsey a democratic 
party consultant and friend who had been frequently at lelands 
office in the past week

rep mickey leland never freed of his torment 
over a dying girl in ethiopia years ago was drawn again and again 
to the place he called the end of the earth 
george thomas mickey leland a sixterm houston democrat and 
chairman of the house select committee on hunger was on his fifth 
visit to refugee camps near the sudan border when the plane 
carrying his party crashed 
the wreckage was found sunday six days after the plane vanished 
after taking off in bad weather from addis ababa the ethiopian 
capital and heading for the fugnido refugee camp 480 miles 
southwest 
although there were no immediate positive identifications of the 
bodies found by paramedics dropped from a helicopter rescuers said 
no one could have survived the fiery crash 
president bush quickly expressed condolences to the 44yearold 
congressmans wife as well as to the families and friends of those 
who died with him on what the president called a noble 
cause 
it was in 1985 when leland recalled standing in a refugee camp 
10 months earlier and asking a relief official about a little girl 
who looked to be about 70 or 80 years old a skeleton of a 
person with a thin layer of brown skin draped on her who had just 
a faint breath of life in her 
while i was talking to him she died i can see her face right 
now every day i see her face leland said at the time 
twice chairman of the congressional black caucus leland 
evolved by his own account from a firebrand black activist 
to an activist on behalf of humanity everywhere whether it is in 
ethiopia south africa chile in any part of the world where 
people are desperate and hungry for the freedoms and rights they 
deserve as human beings 
his deeds reflected the breadth of that concern just as he 
pressed for famine relief in africa he fought as relentlessly to 
feed the homeless in the united states he went to vietnam to 
retrieve three children for their families in america last 
october he went to cuba where he helped negotiate the release of 
three political prisoners and their families 
in a bid to bridge festering hostility between black and jewish 
communities he supervised for 10 years a program under which poor 
black kids from houston were sent to israel for six weeks to learn 
about the jewish culture and heritage 
a roman catholic leland once bicycled through israel and often 
cited the talmud the jewish commentary on the old testament if 
you save one life you save the whole world was his favorite 
passage 
hes someone who cared and made a difference a militant 
man who found he could change the system more from the inside than 
the outside said rep gary l ackerman dny who served with 
leland on the hunger committee and thrice joined him on trips to 
ethiopia 
after offering that assessment of his friend ackerman went to 
ethiopia to join the search he was aboard the air force helicopter 
that found the wreckage 
when leland moved from the texas legislature to congress in 
1979 replacing the retired rep barbara jordan he almost 
immediately began pushing for a special committee on world hunger 
even after he recited the horrors he witnessed in a 1983 trip to 
ethiopia he was opposed by people who argued yet another select 
committee was a waste of money and by those who viewed it as an 
infringement of their own turf foreign relations agriculture and 
appropriations 
leland wouldnt back off instead he rallied all the volunteer 
organizations concerned with hunger and enlisted the help of 
celebrities like valerie harper john denver and cliff robertson 
house speaker thomas p oneill jr dmass lent his prestige 
leland invited members of the established committees to join his 
unofficial caucus on hunger finally in the spring of 1984 he got 
his committee and the momentum that resulted in 800 million for 
famine relief the following fiscal year he personally convinced 
president reagan to divert a ship loaded with food to ethiopia 
as a member of the energy and commerce subcommittee on 
telecommunications he repeatedly tangled with the television 
networks over black representation on and off camera in their 
shows a year before diahann carrol and billy dee williams appeared 
on dynasty he needled abc executives about why the show didnt 
have any black characters 
leland said he learned his values from his mother a teacher who 
had put herself through school working as a shortorder cook as a 
pharmacy student at texas southern university he joined a 
volunteer group which operated free health clinics he was drawn 
too to the black panther party which also operated free clinics 
and gave breakfasts to needy black children 
his political influences ranged from stokely carmichael to 
malcolm x to tanzanian president julius nyerere and he eventually 
formed his own black community action team known as the black 
cats and helped establish three health clinics in houston texas 
conservatives assailed him a radical an image not helped during 
his days in the state legislature by his seveninch afro a leather 
shoulder bag and his dashikis long since replaced by threepiece 
business suits 
i never considered myself to be a radical because i fought for 
the rights of human beings he said in 1972 in his first race 
for public office he was elected to the texas house where he 
championed health issues included a genericdrug law over the 
stiff lobbying of the pharmaceutical lobby 
when he ran for congress in 1978 he had no republican 
opposition and defeated a socialist workers party candidate with 
more than 96 percent of the vote he won reelection five times 
with similar ease despite a 1988 primary challenge from elizabeth 
spates who charged that leland had lost touch with constituents 
while seeking national exposure as spokesman for the hungry and 
homeless 
theres people ive not touched in a long time he 
acknowledged i have been on the road quite a bit 
but he earned respect even from staunch conservatives like 
illinois rep henry j hyde the ranking republican on the house 
select committee on intelligence who recently wrote in the houston 
chronicle that lelands personal diplomacy with ethiopian and 
sudanese officials opened up lifesustaining corridors in the 
border region between the two countries a peaceful relief 
supply route 
leland who also served on the committee on post office and 
civil service often thrust himself into the position of mediator 
in matters of international or interracial consequence 
he was closer to cuban president fidel castro than any other 
member of congress while i disagree with his fundamental 
ideology i respect him for his intellect leland said castro 
returned that sentiment and leland was often tapped to open 
avenues of communication between the united states and cuba 
in april the union of american hebrew congregations paid 
special tribute to his work in uniting blacks and jews 
in the 1984 democratic presidential primary leland supported 
former vice president walter mondale over the rev jesse jackson 
angering many of his black colleagues in the process 
but jackson chose leland as one of the top four fundraisers in 
his 1988 presidential campaign and praised the consistent streak 
of humanity in mickey leland during an election year trip to 
houston 
leland often had been mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate 
in houston despite his political roots he maintained a close 
relationship with the citys business establishment and he and his 
wife alison and their son jarret shared a fashionable home in 
an upscale neighborhood 
the americans for democratic action called him a liberal 
hero early this year and leland relished the label despite the 
bashing that many fellow democrats took over the l word in last 
years presidential campaign 
some of use are not afraid to be called liberal and 
progressive and to continue to fight for our place in the sun 
he said eventually well get there

christian fighters on sunday fought off a 
syrian assault on a major christian stronghold near beirut and 
fighting in the capital killed at least 19 people and trapped 
scores more in burning buildings 
the attack on the souk elgharb garrison in the mountains 
overlooking beirut was the first time the syrians and their allies 
have tried to push into the christian heartland since march 8 when 
the latest round of violence began in the civil war 
this is a sterling victory the christian army commander 
gen michel aoun said on voice of lebanon radio the syrian 
enemy and its surrogates have been dealt a crushing defeat 
as aoun claimed victory druse leader walid jumblatt canceled a 
news conference at which he had been expected to announce the 
capture of souk elgharb 
police confirmed the christians repulsed the syrianled attack 
about 2100 syrian troops druse militiamen and radical 
palestinian guerrillas backed by tanks and armored personnel 
carriers attacked the onetime resort which controls a network of 
roads twisting through the mountains of central lebanon 
a christian army communique claimed 150 syrians were killed in 
five hours of fighting but a senior army source said 10 syrians 
20 druse and 20 palestinians were confirmed killed 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity refused to give 
army casualties but said there were plenty 
he said another 12 syrians were killed in fighting along 
beiruts green line which divides the city into christian and 
moslem sectors there was no word from the syrians who rarely 
announce their losses 
the fall of souk elgharb would have been a major setback for 
the christians its loss would leave the christian suburbs of 
baabda and yarze where the bulk of christian forces and armor are 
deployed vulnerable to attack 
aoun lives in a bunker under the shellblasted presidential 
palace in baabda his senior aides are based in the defense 
ministry compound in yarze 
aoun warned that with the attack on souk elgharb the syrians 
were expected to escalate their barbaric bombardment of the 
310squaremile christian enclave north of beirut 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said at least 19 people were killed and 80 wounded in 
beirut a virtual ghost town since the bulk of its 15 million 
residents began fleeing the fighting 
where are our arab brethren screamed an announcer over the 
christian voice of lebanon radio 
beirut is being wiped off the face of earth as if by an 
earthquake our wounded are bleeding to death in the streets and in 
basements she said her voice choking with emotion 
its world war iii here cab drvier bashir harakeh said in a 
telephone call from a shelter in moslem bourj elbarajneh 
the casualty count sunday did not include dozens of civilians 
buried in shellwrecked apartment blocks or trapped in basements of 
burning buildings 
even if firefighters could get past the rubble to reach the 
buildings they could not put out the flames because the citys 
water pumping system was destroyed three weeks ago 
many people lay bleeding in the streets because rescue teams 
could not reach them 
since the duels began march 8 641 people have been killed and 
1713 wounded that does not include casualties from the souk 
elgharb battle or the syrian deaths reported along the green line 
the duels began after aoun blockaded illegal militiarun ports 
which reportedly were costing the government 1 million a year in 
lost customs dues 
the syrians retaliated by shelling the christian enclave 
police said about 400 syrian guns and multibarrelled rocket 
launchers began blasting the christian heartland at dusk saturday 
in one of the most intense bombardments since march 
the barrage continued through sunday 
the syrians used sovietdesigned bm21 rocket launchers which 
can fire 40 projectiles a minute as well as 180mm and 240mm 
mortars 
aouns gunners hit back with an estimated 25000 rounds of 130mm 
mortar and 155mm howitzer fire against syrian artillery positions 
along west beiruts beaches police said 
they also blasted syrian supply routes through the bekaa valley 
in east lebanon 
three shells hit the turkish embassy in baabda causing damage 
but no casualties french ambassador rene alas residence in yarze 
was damaged police said 
the hotel dieu hospital in east beirut and west beiruts barbir 
hospital were hit but patients and staff had taken shelter in 
underground bunkers 
the international committee of the red cross appealed for a 
ceasefire claiming the number of casualties was increasing hour 
by hour 
the united states france and the arab league have appealed for 
a ceasefire france dispatched envoys to arab capitals including 
damascus syria seeking diplomatic action 
the syrians have 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate aoun maintains they betrayed that 
mandate when they sided the moslems in the war 
syria refuses to negotiate with aoun who has vowed to drive the 
syrians out of lebanon

with the government distracted 
by a damaging leadership struggle antiapartheid activists said 
sunday the next phases of their nationwide defiance campaign wil 
include challenges to segregation of beaches and schools 
the defiance campaign launched aug 2 when blacks and indians 
peacefully sought treatment at segregated white hospitals has been 
condemned by the national party government as an attempt to provoke 
confrontation and violence 
since friday however top government officials have been 
preoccupied by a dispute between president pw botha and education 
minister fw de klerk who heads the national party and is 
expected to succeed botha after the sept 6 parliamentary elections 
botha 73 brought the longrunning rift into the open when he 
announced friday he had not been consulted about de klerks planned 
meeting on aug 28 with zambian president kenneth kaunda a 
prominent critic of south africas racial policies 
de klerk conferred with his cabinet colleagues on saturday and 
reportedly obtained full backing from them heading into a formal 
cabinet meeting with botha on monday 
political writers said de klerk was likely to demand that botha 
stop interfering in government affairs pending his retirement next 
month botha could accept the ultimatum quit immediately or try 
to fire de klerk and other ministers newspapers suggested 
in any case foreign minister pik botha has said he and de klerk 
will keep their appointment with kaunda 
the sunday star of johannesburg described botha as an unguided 
missile trying to inflict maximum damage before the september 
elections and warned in an editorial that his childish rage 
could jeopardize important diplomatic initiatives 
city press the countrys largestselling newspaper for blacks 
headlined its lead editorial sunday in the name of god pw 
botha please go 
groups affiliated with the mass democratic movement a coalition 
organizing the protests said they planned to defy beach 
segregation laws in the port city of durban and demand integration 
of whitesonly schools in racially mixed innercity 
neighborhoods 
organizers were quoted by the city press and other papers as 
saying they did not want to reveal too many details at this stage 
but they said a mass rally was planned for next sunday at one of 
the remaining whitesonly beaches in durban 
plans also were announced for a meeting thursday in johannesburg 
to launch a campaign called all schools for all people to 
protest segregation of government schools the sunday star said 
blacks living in central johannesburg will be encouraged to take 
their children to underutilized white schools near their homes 
several innercity neighborhoods have became racially mixed in 
recent years as the government eased enforcement of residential 
segregation laws but black children in these areas must travel 
long distances to outlying black townships if they wish to attend 
public schools 
in another development 11 white policemen were scheduled to 
appear in court monday to face armed robbery charges after they 
allegedly robbed black entrepreneurs in several townships near 
johannesburg 
police have released only a few details about the case and said 
that senstive investigations were continuing following the 
arrests last week 
local press reports said the suspects all in their 20s had 
targeted the owners of licensed and unlicensed taverns in the 
townships and had stolen at least 40000 over a fourmonth period 
the constables reportedly told their victims they were members of 
the white wolves a name which has surfaced in recent months in 
connection with acts of terror by white rightwing extremists 
police officials have insisted there is no evidence the white 
wolves actually exists

the nicaraguan government and the contras 
disagree on a key issue of the new central american peace proposal 
with a rebel spokesman saying sunday the combatants would return to 
their homeland carrying their guns 
our men are going to go into nicaragua armed adolfo calero 
a leader of the nicaraguan resistance said sunday on abcs this 
week with david brinkley 
alejandro bendana a nicaraguan foreign ministry official and 
also a guest on the show said they dont need guns at this 
point 
the presidents of nicaragua el salvador honduras costa rica 
and guatemala signed an agreement aug 7 calling for the 
demobilization and disbanding of the contra rebels by early 
december the contras backed by the united states since 1981 have 
been fighting to oust the leftist sandinista government in 
nicaragua 
the plan does not mention the mechanics for disarming the 
rebels it calls for an international commission of support and 
verification to aid the contras in resettling in their homeland or 
a third country the honduran government which hosts the majority 
of more than 10000 combatants has said the rebels must leave 
their base camps near the nicaraguan border 
calero cited his distrust for the sandinista government and a 
march 1988 bilateral agreement for saying the rebels who return to 
nicaragua should carry their weapons largely supplied by the 
united states the 1988 accord which never was put into place 
because of disagreements would have allowed the contra combatants 
to hold on to their arms in special zones set up inside nicaragua 
we have to realize the sandinistas have lied deceived broken 
promises all along calero said 
bendana said the contras can come back in there is an 
amnesty in place the point is they dont need guns at this 
point 
asked about bendanas assurances calero smiled saying its 
a lie and he called for the demobilization of the sandinista 
army which stands at about 80000strong and is the largest in 
central america 
contra commanders who are living in miami condominiums really 
dont command that much respect from contra foot soldiers 
bendana said 
why should any standing legal government want to demobilize 
its force to protect itself he said when pushed on the 
demobilization question once the war is over we want to go back 
to normalcy 
calero said the agreement by the central american presidents was 
a disappointment 
we feel that weve been let down by the united states and by 
the central american presidents who should know better he said 
adding the united states could have lobbied harder they could 
have shown more support so that our forces would remain in place 
until after the elections as the only guarantee for free elections 
in nicaragua 
the nicaraguan government has scheduled general elections for 
february 
bendana said his government would use every political legal 
and moral means at our disposal to try to persuade these people to 
come in within the civic within the legal arena 
lets slug it out on the radio stations and the newspapers 
openly in political rallies by way of political platforms put 
before the nicaraguan people so the nicaraguan people and not the 
united states and not at the point of a gun can decide what kind 
of government they want on february 25th under international 
observation the nicaraguan official added 
some 50000 nicaraguans many of them civilians have been 
killed in the fighting in the rural northern mountains and central 
plains

the armys chief spokesman said sunday he 
refuses to accept that two israeli soldiers taken captive in 
lebanon were killed despite a british news report that they have 
been dead more than three years 
my consideration is that they are alive and we must do our 
utmost to bring them home brig gen ephraim lapid told a news 
conference 
he refused to confirm or deny the report in the sunday times of 
london that israeli investigators who questioned a kidnapped moslem 
shiite clergyman have concluded the two israeli soldiers are dead 
we consider our prisoners of war as living until positive 
evidence proves the contrary lapid said 
israeli officials have offered to trade the cleric and hundreds 
of other moslem shiite prisoners held by israel for the two israeli 
infantrymen an israeli airman and the 16 western hostages in 
lebanon 
lebanese shiite leaders have called for israel to first release 
its prisoners and let palestinian deportees return to the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
lapids news conference was called after the london newspaper 
report gained widespread attention in the israeli media 
the british weekly quoted unidentified security sources in 
jerusalem as saying prime minister yitzhak shamir has tried to keep 
the two deaths a secret from the united states to avoid pressure to 
free the cleric in exchange only for western hostages 
israeli commandos on july 28 abducted the radical shiite cleric 
sheik abdul karim obeid israel says he is a leader of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah militia which is believed to be an 
umbrella for groups holding western hostages

sources as saying obeids interrogators believe the infantrymen 
yousef fink and rahamim alsheik died of wounds within hours after 
their car was ambushed in south lebanon in february 1986 
the london weekly said the israeli airman ron arad who was 
shot down in october 1986 is believed to be alive and held by a 
lebanese militia with closer ties to syria than iran 
the newspaper said israeli military officials had told the 
parents of fink and alsheik that their sons were dead the israeli 
daily yediot ahronot quoted both families as denying the report 
there are 16 western hostages in lebanon including eight 
americans the longest held is terry a anderson chief middle east

solidarity leader lech walesa said sunday 
he plans to meet communist prime minister gen czeslaw kiszczak in 
the near future and a solidarity official said walesa might 
himself be willing to head polands next government 
in comments relayed by an aide in the baltic port of gdansk 
walesa said i do not want to nor should i be prime minister i 
have my own candidates 
but senator jaroslaw kaczynski walesas envoy in talks with two 
minor parties on formation of a solidarityled coalition 
government said sunday of walesa it is true he is considering 
becoming prime minister 
the opposition newspaper gazeta wyborcza had raised the 
possibility of walesas becoming prime minister last week and 
another solidarity lawmaker senator aleksander paszynski said it 
was raised in talks with the other parties 
walesa left his home in gdansk sunday afternoon for warsaw 
where on monday he was expected to take part in coalition talks 
with political leaders of the other parties in parliament 
replying to the appeal of newly elected prime minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak who announced saturday he wanted to meet walesa 
as soon as possible walesa said he too wants such a meeting 
i will meet with gen kiszczak in the nearest future we 
cannot avoid difficult topics walesa said according to the aide 
kiszczak was elected prime minister aug 2 but his efforts to 
form a government ran into trouble four days later when walesa 
announced he would oppose any government formed by the longtime 
interior minister 
solidarity senator kaczynski said walesa authorized him to 
conduct talks with the democratic party and the peasants party two 
small parties that hold the balance of power in the parliament 
because solidarity and the communists each have less than 50 
percent of the seats 
the talks that began thursday continued through the weekend at 
an undisclosed site kaczynski said speaking by telephone from his 
home in warsaw 
they are conducted amid different difficulties with good will 
on all three sides he said the democrats and the peasants were 
leaning toward the idea of a coalition with solidarity he said 
but that there was no way to say where those talks would lead 
peasant party deputies have said voters reacted badly to the 
choice of kiszczak as prime minister the election of gen wojciech 
jaruzelski to the new post of president and the selection of former 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski as the new head of the 
communist party 
the reshuffle at the top leaves the impression among voters that 
nothing has changed despite solidaritys victory at the polls in 
june when unionbacked candidates swept all 161 seats open to the 
opposition in the 460member sejm and 99 of 100 seats in the newly 
created senate 
if one recognizes that these elections were really won by the 
opposition then it should be ready to take over the government 
said solidarity member paszynski in a telephone interview 
walesa was a logical candidate for prime minister even 
though he is not an expert on the economy he said 
the political stalemate at the top echelons of power and growing 
frustration over steep price hikes aug 1 and soaring inflation has 
frustrated poles prompting a number of work stoppages in protest 
over economic chaos 
solidarity says the new government must have public support in 
order to be able to rule backing that a communistled coalition 
will be unable to achieve 
communist leaders have repeatedly urged solidarity to join a 
socalled grand coalition in which the opposition would be 
offered several ministries but solidarity has declined saying 
that option would change nothing 
but the prospect of a noncommunist led government appears to 
have disconcerted polands main warsaw pact ally 
a soviet foreign ministry official in moscow on friday 
criticized attempts to use the formation of the polish government 
for destabilizing the sitution in the country according to the 
tass news agency

30 miles east of indianapolis last week in their tractordrawn 
conestogastyle wagon chosen to symbolize their search fo a better

drug users rather than failed government 
policies are to blame for the spread of drugs throughout society 
drug policy director william j bennett said sunday 
he also defended the reagan administrations efforts to combat 
drugs including former first lady nancy reagans just say no 
campaign 
bennett by law must forward a new national strategy for fighting 
drugs to congress by sept 5 it is expected to call for a major 
boost in federal spending and emphasize both tougher penalties for 
individual drug use and mandatory treatment for addicts 
bennett was asked on cbs face the nation if his approach 
marks a reversal from the reagan administration policy which cut 
funds for treatment and emphasized drug interdiction and arrests of 
kingpins 
the 21 billion spent fighting drugs during the reagan 
administration wasnt wasted and it wasnt all wrong 
said bennett there were some real successes during the reagan 
era 
i dont think anyone can deny that drugs are pervasive 
throughout much of america said bennett but recent statistics 
indicate that casual drug use is down 
although some people like to criticize the educational efforts 
and the first ladys efforts they obviously have had some 
effect said bennett who as reagans education secretary 
published a booklet on how to keep drugs out of schools 
we are shifting strategy but lets remember we have not had 
the opportunity before to have a comprehensive look said bennett 
the government may not have been as effective or as 
smart as it should have been but its the people who are 
taking drugs that are causing these tragedies not the 
government he said 
asked if he would recommend raising taxes for the drug fight 
bennett replied dont think we need taxes 
but he insisted the money will be there we will put our 
cards on the table we will suggest what we want to do and we will 
propose spending more money then we will see what the congress 
wants to do 
it means making some difficult choices he said 
bennett citing reports of bootleg sales of methadone by addicts 
to buy crack said drug treatment programs need much more 
accountability 
without it bennett warned at some point the american people 
will say the heck with it 
the more ive seen of treatment the more impressed i am by 
the need for efforts in prevention its terrible to get into this 
business its very hard to get out of it he said 
he scoffed at the notion that research can find a way to end 
peoples cravings for drugs 
were not going to uncover anything in a laboratory that 
we can put in a pill and give it to somebody and theyre not going 
to want drugs anymore said the onetime philosophy professor 
and despite five months of conscientious study of the 
issues bennett said he has found no magic bullet 
his recommendations wont be like batman coming through the 
transom saying here it is and its over bennett said

depression can hamper a womans mothering 
abilities by hindering her relationship with her infant according 
to a study aimed at keeping such infants from developing their own 
problems 
researchers found depressed mothers to be less attentive to 
their children and less emotionally engaged with them than 
nondepressed mothers said study coauthor donna gelfand 
one depressed mother even failed to notice that her baby had 
fallen off her own lap said gelfand head of the psychology 
department at the university of utah 
she spoke in an interview before presenting her work sunday at 
the annual meeting of the american psychological association the 
study was done with douglas teti of the university of marylands 
baltimore county campus 
the depressed mothers did not have simply occasional periods of 
low spirits that everyone feels instead they had longlasting 
depression that had persisted for an average of a year when they 
entered the study 
previous studies have found that infants of such chronically 
depressed mothers are at risk for problems such as excessive crying 
and other poor control over emotional behavior gelfand said in 
later childhood they may have trouble getting along with peers and 
teachers and lag in school achievement she said 
it is not clear whether such problems stem from the mothers 
depression earlier in the childs life or her depression at the 
time the problems manifested themselves or a combination of both 
she said 
the study included 37 depressed mothers and 37 nondepressed 
mothers the two groups were matched for socioeconomic and marital 
status and age of the child the infants were three months to 12 
months old at the beginning of the study which has gone on about a 
year so far 
mothers were studied in their homes by observers who had not 
been told which women were depressed a precaution to avoid biasing 
their appraisals the mothers were observed while they fed their 
babies played with them and filled out a questionnaire 
in all three situations depressed women tended to be less 
sensitive to their infants needs than the nondepressed mothers 
and they failed to pick up cues from their children as well as the 
other mothers did gelfand said 
they were also less emotionally engaged with their children and 
less attentive she said 
depressed mothers were also more likely to perceive their 
children more negatively than the nondepressed mothers viewed 
their own children for example they rated their children as less 
intellectually capable and less rewarding gelfand said 
in addition they see themselves as inadequate mothers in 
such tasks as feeding bathing dressing and teaching gelfand said 
the depressed mothers just view parenthood as extremely 
demanding almost more demanding than they can bear she said 
researchers have started to look at the children as they reach 
ages 1 and older and found the offspring of depressed mothers to 
be less responsive to the mother less interested in her and less 
emotionally attached they also seemed to be generally less happy 
gelfand said 
researchers are testing a program to prevent infants problems 
that can result from a mothers depression the program includes 
weekly visits by a nurse to stimulate the mothers interest in her 
baby later to counter a tendency to become housebound depressed 
mothers are encouraged to become active outside the home 
too few women have completed the program yet to provide a good 
estimate of its effectiveness gelfand said 
lynn rehm professor of psychology at the university of houston 
said the studys findings on the effects of a mothers depression 
generally agree with previous research

west germany will close its embassy in 
budapest on monday because the staffs ability to assist hundreds 
of east german refugees seeking exit visas to the west is totally 
exhausted 
refugees have been holed up nearly two weeks at the budapest 
embassy as well as in west germanys missions in east berlin and 
prague 
foreign ministry spokesman claus wunderlich who made the 
announcement sunday refused to say how many east germans were at 
the budapest embassy 
news reports last week estimated 300 were in the embassy and 
said more were arriving each day many traveled to budapest and 
were caught trying to escape to austria after budapest removed 
barriers along its western border 
the reception capacity for east german asylum seekers at the 
representation in budapest is totally exhausted the ministry 
said in a statement delivered to news agencies the embassy must 
therefore be closed for the time being beginning monday aug 14 
the embassy will be closed to the public and the refugees 
already there will be asked to leave and informed again that only 
east germany can grant them exit visas officials at the ministry 
said 
bonn closed its east berlin mission on tuesday after 131 east 
germans sought refuge there and officials have said it will not be 
reopened until normal diplomatic operations can be resumed 
eberhard grashoff spokesman for the mission said 10 of the 
east germans voluntarily left the facility sunday but that the 
others were still camped on the protected mission grounds 
the west german mission in prague where about 20 east germans 
are thought to have taken refuge will remain open for the time 
being 
east berlins communist leadership has said it will not punish 
those who sought refuge in west germany and bonn authorities have 
told the east germans they need permission from their government to 
leave for the west 
the refugee situation in budapest developed this summer after 
hungary dismantled the barriers on its border with austria at 
least 1500 east germans are estimated to have escaped to the west 
through hungary since may 
most of those at the west german embassy in budapest are east 
germans who were allowed to travel to hungary then attempted to 
escape to austria and were caught by hungarian border guards 
the hungarians have in some cases noted the failed escape 
attempt in the passports of the east germans out of fear that they 
would be punished back home the east germans have sought west 
germanys protection 
east germans can obtain permission to travel to neighboring 
hungary a warsaw pact ally with relative ease but applicants for 
emigration visas often must wait years for an answer 
a hamburgbased newspaper the world on sunday said the west 
german intelligence service has determined that 15 million east 
germans want to emigrate to the west or nearly 10 percent of the 
16 million population 
west germany expects about 100000 east germans to make their 
way to west germany by the end of the year through legal 
emigration and escapes 
the recent increase in escape attempts is believed to be 
grounded in an increasing sense of hopelessness among east germans 
neighboring hungary and poland have followed the soviet unions 
lead and adopted marketoriented economic reforms and broadened 
personal freedoms but east german leader erich honecker has shown 
no inclination to do so 
in a commentary on the eve of sundays 28th anniversary of the 
berlin walls construction the communist party newspaper neues 
deutschland accused the west of trying to economically plunder 
and destabilize east germany

chinas decision to force students who planned to 
start graduate school to work first appears an effort to combat 
youthful idealism with exposure to the reallife complexities of 
chinas political social and economic problems 
the announcement saturday was reminiscent of the cultural 
revolution of the 196676 when virtually all chinese college 
students were sent to work on farms to learn workingclass 
attitudes 
the new order issued by the state education commission and 
announced in the china daily said only that the goal of the 
program was to increase the percentage of graduate students with 
practical work experience it said the order was aimed at 
especially those in the social sciences 
the social sciences are perceived as the most dangerous field of 
study because they expose students to alternate political and 
economic theories 
some fields like sociology were banned altogether for many 
years under communist rule 
the government order that students work for one or two years 
first did not say what kind of jobs they would be given or exactly 
how many would be affected 
it said students with prior work experience about half of the 
originally planned incoming graduate class of 35000 would be 
exempt 
last week education authorities denied western reports that all 
college graduates assigned to government jobs will be required to 
spend a year working at the grassroots in small cities or rural 
areas 
a spokesman for the state education commission contacted by 
telephone said a 6yearold order had indeed required students 
assigned to jobs in provincial government and higher levels to do 
so however he said few students were actually sent to such 
assignments 
the government already has cut the number of incoming college 
freshmen nationwide by 30000 to 610000 students in an apparent 
effort to curb student unrest 
many college students who graduated in june already have begun 
their governmentassigned jobs including those assigned to 
provincial governments or the central government 
chinas education system has a history of combining study with 
assigned work for the purpose of political indoctrination even 
after the cultural revolution middle school and college students 
have often been required to spend several weeks each summer in 
social service

searchers on sunday found the 
wreckage of rep mickey lelands plane scattered on a rugged 
mountainside in southwestern ethiopia six days after it 
disappeared all 16 people aboard were believed dead 
the plane crashed near the town of gambela about 100 miles 
northwest of a refugee camp where it was bound us embassy 
officials said leland dtexas was on tour in his capacity as 
chairman of the house select committee on hunger 
james haley chief spokesman for the embassy in addis ababa 
said 12 bodies were initially found at the site 300 miles southwest 
of the capital an earlier report said 13 bodies had been found 
haley said all others aboard were believed dead 
haley said the wreckage was found in terrain so rugged that 
medical teams had to be lowered initially from helicopters he said 
helicopters were able to set down no closer than a half mile away 
in washington the pentagon said in a statement that us air 
force searchers confirmed there were no survivors at the site 
pentagon spokesman navy capt stan bloyer said the plane had 
basically disintegrated he said the condition of the wreckage 
had made the body count difficult 
he quoted reports from the scene that said the plane which lay 
in a ravine had burned after the crash 
it was pretty awesome unsurvivable said the pilot of a 
us air force c130 plane that flew over the site a steep slope 
4300 feet up a 5500foot mountain he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
searchers had no immediate report of what caused the crash 
officials did not explicitly say when the aircraft went down but 
it was believed to have crashed aug 7 on the same day it left the 
capital for the refugee camp 
president bush expressed sadness over the deaths mickey 
leland and the other members of his traveling party both americans 
and ethiopians were engaged in a noble cause trying to feed the 
hungry he said in a statement from the white house 
lelands party consisted of eight other americans including two 
leland staff members one aide to rep ronald v dellums 
dcalifornia a friend of the congressman three officers of the 
us agency for international development and the wife of one of 
the aid officials the other seven aboard were all ethiopian a 
us embassy employee three government officials and a crew of 
three 
the chartered twin otter plane disappeared en route to the 
fugnido refugee camp near the sudanese border one of four in 
southwestern ethiopia run by the un high commissioner for 
refugees fugnido is home to more than 300000 sudanese who have 
fled famine and civil war in their own country 
gambela and the village of dembidola just to the north had been 
an early focus of the search because there are two dirt airstrips 
in the area 
officials believe the pilot of the twinengine plane might have 
diverted to one of those strips because of heavy clouds and low 
visibility at lelands destination 
the ethiopian government said peasants heard a light plane 
circling near dirt strips about 90 miles southeast of gambela on 
aug 7 
in houston friends and colleagues of leland streamed into his 
downtown office as news spread that the wreckage had been 
discovered 
rep mike andrews also a houston democrat said with a breaking 
voice this is a very difficult time for houston we have lost 
one of our most important leaders and ive lost a very good 
friend 
leland arrived in ethiopia early on aug 7 and boarded the twin 
otter with his party several hours later bad weather delayed 
takeoff for two hours and officials said conditions were marginal 
for flying when they finally set off from addis ababas bole 
airport 
by the time it was learned that they had not reached their 
destination it was getting dark bad weather made it impossible to 
mount a search until tuesday 
the wreckage was first sighted by the crew of a us mh60 
blackhawk helicopter carrying rep gary ackerman dny one of 
two colleagues of leland who came to ethiopia to take part in the 
search officials said 
haley said other american and ethiopian helicopters and at least 
one soviet chopper were sent to the scene 
he said the helicopter crews and medical evacuation personnel 
would spend the night in gambela a town about 50 miles from the 
sudanese border and recovery of the bodies would begin monday 
the search effort grew steadily through the week more than 10 
us air force planes including a highaltitude u2 reconnaisance 
craft were eventually committed to the effort 
the ethiopian air force and civil aviation authority added an 
equal number of aircraft despite cool relations that have existed 
between the united states and the marxist government of this east 
african nation since 1974 
robert houdek the us charge daffaires in addis ababa said 
ethiopias help in the search was bound to help improve relations

west germans vandalized the berlin wall an 
official called for its removal and an east german tried to escape 
to the west on sunday the 28th anniversary of the day construction 
began on the infamous barrier 
security forces also dispersed about 50 east germans who tried 
to demonstrate in east berlin in front of the west german mission 
which was closed last week after a crowd of east germans arrived 
seeking refuge 
witnesses said the demonstrators tried to lay flowers at the 
mission gates in an apparent act of solidarity with their 
countrymen holed up inside demanding exit visas to the west no 
protesters were arrested 
dorothee wilms the west german minister for intergerman 
affairs criticized east germanys effort to build up and perfect 
the inhumane barriers between east and west her deputy chief 
ottfried hennig predicted the wall would be taken down by the end 
of the century 
an unidentified assailant hurled a firebomb at the wall near the 
brandenburg gate early sunday west german police said the bomb 
exploded when it crashed against the wall but it burned out 
without causing serious damage 
the east german state news agency adn said several masked 
assailants from west berlin damaged border barriers in the southern 
sector of east berlin 
adn which did not describe the damage said a diplomatic 
protest would be lodged with west berlin authorities 
witnesses at the checkpoint charlie border crossing between east 
and west berlin reported sunday that at least one man attempted to 
flee across the heavily guarded crossing just before noon he was 
arrested by east german border guards before reaching western 
territory the witnesses said

monitors east european refugee affairs estimates that at least 
40000 east germans have escaped across the borders with west 
germany since the wall was erected 
prior to 1961 hundreds of thousands of east germans fled to the 
west draining the communist state of many of its top scientists 
artists and intellectuals the number of escapes surged over the 
last few months after hungary began dismantling its border barriers 
with austria 
east germans can usually obtain permission to travel to hungary 
a neighboring communist ally and an estimated 1500 of them have 
illegally crossed from there into austria this summer 
several hundred east germans have recently sought refuge at west 
german embassies which has prompted bonn to close its embassy in 
budapest and its mission in east berlin

sudans new military leaders on sunday 
announced an economic reform program that includes a 20 percent cut 
in government spending and possible decreases in government 
subsidies of consumer goods 
col salah din mohamed karrar a member of the 15member council 
in charge of the economy said in an interview with the sudan news 
agency that he was optimistic sudan would be able to reach a loan 
agreement with the international monetary fund soon 
improving sudans faltering economy which is burdened by a 13 
billion foreign debt and an exhausting civil war in the south has 
been one of the main targets of the new regime which took power in 
a military coup june 30 
karrar said the finance ministry had ordered government units to 
cut spending by 20 percent but he did not specify how much money 
that would save 
one of the juntas first acts was to cut the cabinet from 30 to 
22 ministers 
karrar also said that government subsidies to some of the main 
consumer goods would be reconsidered but he did not say which 
commodities would be affected 
the ousted elected government of sadek elmahdi had budgeted 
183 million for subsidies this fiscal year 
karrar said he was optimistic sudan would reach agreement with 
the imf next month without affecting the welfare of sudanese 
people he gave no details 
in february 1986 the imf declared sudan ineligible for further 
loans for defaulting on debt payments us economic assistance was 
halted in january because the khartoum government was late in 
paying off loans

medical examiners in philadelphia are trying 
to determine whether 10 infants died over the last three years as a 
result of inhaling secondhand crack smoke from adults the 10 all 
had chemical evidence of cocaine in their blood 
the coroner haresh g mirchandani came up with the theory 
after the april 6 death of a 10monthold girl named tasha testing 
showed there was cocaine in the her blood some of which had gotten 
there the night before her death 
mirchandani said the baby died after apparently inhaling smoke 
from crack a highly addictive form of cocaine generated by her 
mother and other adults in the house 
the deaths of tasha and nine other babies might show according 
to the medical examiners theory that children are highly 
susceptible to serious illness and death from breathing in crack 
smoke when the drug is smoked by adults around them 
mirchandani stressed last week that more research was needed 
before his theory could be proven 
mirchandanis study involved the cases of six girls and four 
boys ranging in age from 28 days to 10 months who died in the 
city in the last three years 
each infant had either cocaine or its chemical residue in their 
blood tissue or organs the study found 
several babies had parents siblings or baby sitters who used 
crack several slept in small poorly ventilated rooms in crowded 
row houses in some instances police or residents said they saw 
lingering clouds of crack smoke or discarded crack vials in the 
homes according to the investigation 
mirchandani said the investigation started the day after tashas 
death he refused to provide the full names or addresses of the 
infants or their relatives 
an autopsy performed on tashas body revealed small amounts of 
active cocaine as well as the drugs residue mirchandani 
determined that the presence of the active cocaine which is 
usually broken down by the body in two hours showed the baby had 
been exposed to it shortly before she died only a few hours 
before death mirchandani said 
the residue indicated exposure to the drug of a longterm 
nature he said 
mirchandani visited the babys 22yearold mother may 1 
she admitted being a crack addict he said she said she 
used cocaine before and during the pregnancy 
mirchandani said the mother was not breastfeeding the child 
she had not put the drug in the childs food or milk and there was 
no sign the child could have found the drug lying around and eaten 
it 
recent studies of the dangers of the passive inhalation of 
cigarette smoke led mirchandani to the possibility that the same 
was true of the passive inhalation of crack smoke he said even 
though the mother said she didnt smoke around the baby the 
childs room was not wellventilated and other adults addicted to 
the drug smoked it in the house 
similar cases in philadelphia and new york city supported the 
doctors theory he said 
cocaine can be toxic at any dose and is proven to be 
dangerous and deadly in even small doses even in adults he 
said i would expect a much heightened toxicity for infants its 
common sense something that is toxic for adults would be even 
more toxic for an infant

the green river task force is a month or more 
away from completing a study of thousands of documents videotapes 
and other possessions of a former law student called a suspect in 
the killings of 40 young women 
theres more of it here than even i thought there was capt 
bob evans commander of the king county police task force said of 
the material seized from william jay stevens ii 38 
asked if police had found anything to connect stevens with any 
of the green river victims evans replied not yet 
stevens denies he is the killer people should know the fact 
that i have never hurt anyone in my life he said in a statement 
released earlier through his attorney 
stevens has not been charged with any violent crimes including 
the green river killings a series of slayings from 1982 to 1984 
mostly of prostitutes in seattle and portland ore the case takes 
its name from the stream south of seattle river where the bodies of 
the first victims were found 
police have blamed the deaths of 40 young women and the 
disappearance of eight others on the serial killer 
stevens is in the king county jail serving a oneyear sentence 
for a 1979 burglary and additional time for escape 
hes due to be released sept 25 but evans said he doubts the 
12member task force will be finished by then with analyzing the 
thousands of items in 55 boxes and bags taken in a july 12 search 
of the home of stevens parents and a rental house stevens used as 
a student in spokane 
police would have no hold on stevens after sept 25 evans said 
were still going through the paperwork and expect to be doing 
that for another month or so evans said 
theres been nothing so far to diminish our interest or to 
indicate we should feel any more strongly about him 
stevens walked away from a workrelease program in seattle in 
1981 and wasnt apprehended until january of this year when it 
was learned he was living at his parents home in spokane and 
attending gonzaga university law school 
among the possessions seized by the task force were police 
badges and paraphernalia 
investigators have suspected the green river killer could be a 
police officer or someone posing as one 
 
in an affidavit filed to support a search warrant in the case 
some people who knew stevens said he liked pornography frequented 
prostitutes and carried photographs of mutilated women 
among items seized in the search were 1800 videotapes a sample 
of the videotapes show they ranged from tv shows to hardcore 
pornography evans said 
he said he will have the task force look at all the tapes only 
if i have to i dont want to but if necessary i will do that 
besides the tapes the material includes massive amounts of 
paperwork much of it receipts and personal documents evans said 
detectives have followed up much of their reading with interviews 
but he had no estimate of the number conducted 
evans said investigators are seeking both possible links to the 
killings and alibis for stevens 
were working very very hard to prove that hes someone not 
of interest to us he said 
detectives are looking at people other than stevens but evans 
declined to say whom 
there always have been other people we have been checking out 
and there will be until there are no leads to follow

a virginia consulting firm collected huge fees 
through a department of housing and urban development program 
including 15 million for one project according to a published 
report 
and that project was approved by a senior official in march on 
his last workday at the agency after he waived numerous hud 
regulations the sun reported sunday 
the consulting fees appear to be the largest yet uncovered in 
programs operated by the troubled federal housing agency which has 
been rocked by disclosures of favoritism and irregularities in many 
programs 
the sun reported that land development financing led by curtis 
j mimna and his associate terry t mooney stood to gain up to 
49 million in consulting fees on projects under the title x land 
development program until hud secretary jack f kemp announced that 
he was halting the program in late june 
under title x a developer acquires land builds roads and 
installs utilities on parcels of land that are then sold to 
builders who construct houses and apartments if a project fails 
and about half of all title x projects have according to hud 
officials hud pays the mortgage lender the balance due on the 
loan 
kemp said he would end the program because it was costly to 
taxpayers and had not helped provide adequate housing for the poor 
the largest title x loan ever approved by hud for 782 
million was granted march 3 to mcnair farms a proposed 
development in fairfax county va mimnas ldf received a 15 
million consulting fee for obtaining the hudbacked mortgage the 
newspaper reported 
the loan was approved by james c nistler deputy assistant 
secretary of hud for singlefamily housing on his last day at the 
agency hud documents indicate that nistler intervened personally 
in the processing of the application issuing a series of 
directives to expedite the project and waive regular hud procedures 
mimnas brother michael said his brother left the washington 
area several months ago and that he did not know how to reach him 
the documents reveal numerous apparent deviations from normal 
hud procedures in the handling of mcnair farms 
normally independent cost figures computed by hud staff are 
used to determine how much a mortgage should be but in the case of 
mcnair farms the developers own cost figures were used 
the mortgage amount approved was 2 million more than the costs 
a full environmental impact statement was not done despite 
environmental concerns about wetlands and flood plains on the 
property 
some of the mortgage proceeds were permitted to be used to pay 
off debts on land that was not covered by the title x loan 
detailed working drawings and specifications normally required 
before approval were not submitted 
according to the documents the project was approved after 
numerous meetings involving nistler mimna and tricia canzeri 
whose husband joe was briefly a special assistant to president 
reagan canzeri also was a top adviser to vice president dan 
quayles campaign and organized an inaugural gala for president 
bush 
james l clouser executive vice president of merrill lynch msb 
a new yorkbased lending affiliate of the national brokerage firm 
that provided the mortgage on mcnair said mimna told him several 
months ago that he had made mrs canzeri a partner in his 
consulting firm while seeking approval of the mcnair project

the bush administration will consider raising 
taxes next year unless congress agrees to cut medicare and other 
domestic programs budget chief richard g darman said sunday 
the office of management and budget director said he will 
recommend that bush seek fiscal 1991 cuts in the growth of 
medicare agriculture veterans and other entitlement programs but 
not social security 
darman on nbcs meet the press repeated bushs resolve not 
to raise taxes but said 
when the congress comes back in september if they dont fully 
implement the bipartisan budget agreement we will have to have a 
sequester and it will drive us toward having to face the tax issue 
the following year which we shouldnt do 
he said the administration and the legislative branch must find 
savings of 25 billion to 30 billion to avoid an automatic 
acrosstheboard cut under the grammrudmanhollings deficit 
reduction law 
he complained that medicare payments for doctors fees have 
risen at about 15 percent a year that cant go on forever its 
going to consume the whole budget so we have to restrain the 
growth there 
there are going to be some wealthy doctors presumably who 
arent quite so wealthy in the future he predicted 
i think it will be necessary to recommend additional 
structural reforms in the entitlement programs not social 
security but in the other entitlement programs said darman he 
singled out medicare agricultural programs veterans programs 
and other such entitlement programs 
darman said he did not regard the military budget as ripe for 
cuts he said it has fallen in real terms by 12 percent over the 
last five budgets 
he defended the halfbilliondollar b2 stealth bomber which he 
acknowledged is a big pricey item 
nothing is more important than avoiding nuclear war he said 
so if its an effective deterrent its well worth the 
investment darman said 
darman recently decried americans tendency to spend now and 
saddle later generations with the bills 
i am sure there is more than enough blame to go around 
although i would not like to have any attached to the present 
administration or the prior administration with which i was 
associated said the former reagan aide 
he also defended bushs call for a manned mission to mars in the 
next century that will cost more than 400 billion in todays 
dollars over the next three decades 
its a rather long time we dont have to spend it all 
tomorrow said the budget chief 
the key is that we start the planning so that we dont miss 
this opportunity to expand human horizons he said if we 
pennypinch everywhere at the risk of sacrificing some of the most 
exciting possibilities for humans in the future thats not being 
responsible either

workers repairing the flooddamaged 
aqueduct that supplies millions of southern californians with water 
got a break in the weather sunday but expected to be on the job 
two more weeks 
some 30 workers using bulldozers and other heavy equipment 
labored under sunny skies to scoop tons of mud rocks and other 
storm debris out of the los angeles aqueduct in inyo county about 
180 miles north of los angeles 
theyre continuing right along today making good progress 
said los angeles department of water and power spokeswoman dorothy 
jensen 
a twomile stretch of the aqueduct was buried when a flash flood 
hurled tons of debris down upon it tuesday then a storm thursday 
buckled a 1000foot stretch of the aqueducts concrete lining 
the aqueduct carries water from streams in the eastern sierra 
nevada range to los angeles and other southern california 
communities 
two 30person teams were each working 12hour shifts and 
repairs were expected to take two weeks the spokeswoman said 
the city which gets 75 percent of its water from the aqueduct 
wasnt expected to experience shortages in the meantime but water 
officials urged residents to voluntarily conserve 
a series of intense widely scattered storms deluged parts of 
san diego imperial san bernardino riverside mono and inyo 
counties throughout most of last week before moving into nevada 
until the aqueduct is fixed the water department will provide 
los angeles with water by drawing supplies from reservoirs south of 
the broken part of the aqueduct and making extra purchases from the 
southern california metropolitan water district 
ms jensen said the damage was the worst since similar storms 
ravaged the aqueduct in 1968

soviet youth poured into moscow to hear american 
heavy metal heroes sunday but 10000 security men and rockers with 
just say nyet buttons kept the concert from getting too 
intoxicating 
if the police werent here there would be drugs and drinking 
and making love said anna rvinskaya an 18yearold moscow 
mother dressed in the metal bracelets and tight short bluejean 
skirt favored by her motorcycle gang 
but what can you do with police everywhere she shrugged 
and they were everywhere among the 100000 people gathered for 
the second day of earshattering heavy metal sounds from the likes 
of bon jovi scorpions and ozzy osbourne it was moscows biggest 
festival of foreign rock music which for years was condemned as an 
infectious item of western decadence 
moscow militia in blue riot police in black kgb agents in dark 
civilian clothes and young toughs in uniform track suits and 
tshirts lined the stage and aisles throughout the packed lenin 
stadium in moscows luzhniki district 
soviet impresario stas namin said he and the foreign organizers 
of the concert had requested the overwhelming security he said 
soviet authorities have never allowed so many young people to 
gather in one place and they didnt know what to expect 
authorities might be suffer extra anxiety since the crowd came 
dressed in chains and skintight leather 
motley crue incited the crowd to scream obscenities in english 
which soviet government television broadcast nationwide in its 
coverage of fragments of the concert and some fans shed their 
clothes for a brief streak across the stands 
but mountains of vodka bottles piled up outside the stadium and 
suggestions of more outrageous behavior remained onstage 
it was an appropriate action for a concert billed as an 
antidrug and antialcohol event many rockers wore buttons 
emblazoned just say nyet 
the audience poured into moscow from all over the soviet union 
oleg galkin of astrakhan said he hitchhiked for 48 hours to reach 
the festival and he doesnt even like heavy metal 
i would rather have heard led zeppelin dire straits or pink 
floyd he said 
hundreds of youths who could not afford the scalpers price of 
up to 112 a ticket milled around outside the stadium but no 
matter the music could be heard a halfmile away 
motorcycle gangs rarely seen on the streets of moscow showed 
off tattoos brass knuckles and flags of the american confederacy 
they were joined by frumpy grandmothers and officials in 
business suits sitting stiffly in a stadium full of singing 
screaming and dancing fans 
other rockers in the twoday festival broadcast in the united 
states on pay television sunday were cinderella and skid row from 
the west and nuance and brigada s from the soviet union

a wilderness survival program for troubled 
teens is fighting for its own life after running afoul of state 
officials and a teenage girl who claims she was kidnapped and 
abused by the programs operators 
challenger foundation ii is designed to quell rebellious 
behavior and build confidence in teenagers by forcing them to 
confront their problems in the setting of the rugged southern utah 
desert 
during their first three days in the desert for example they 
may eat only wild plants that they pick or animals and insects that 
they catch 
the state attorney generals office says such a program amounts 
to therapy which challenger ii lacks a license to provide 
in addition a judge has ruled that challenger operators 
violated the civil rights of 17yearold elizabeth zasso of mt 
kisco ny by abducting her from a dentists office and forcing 
her into the program at her fathers request 
ms zasso is suing the program and its operators for 230 
million and a big award could put the school out of business 
challenger is threatened with further legal action from the 
state attorney general unless the operators can demonstrate that 
participating teens are provided adequate food water and clothing 
as well as such necessities as toilet paper and sleeping bags 
program founder stephen cartisano a former air force special 
forces sergeant billed in ads as a reallife rambo has filed a 
countersuit charging the state with harassment 
several state officials say they will decide this week whether 
challenger must obtain a license as a therapeutic care provider to 
continue operation currently the programs counselors dont have 
the training required for such a license 
cartisano who was in southern utah over the weekend did not 
return telephone calls to his office in provo 
ms zassos attorneys didnt respond to a telephone request for 
comment 
the companys ads promise that for 12500 per teen challenger 
stops selfdestructive behavior and places parents back in 
control its detractors say the 63day survival program is cruel 
and dangerous 
in the first stage of the program the teens drink stream water 
they must purify with chemicals and substitute sagebrush for toilet 
paper 
during the two latter stages the participants diet included 
oatmeal lentils cheese meat raisins and other foods provided by 
challenger 
during stage three each 12member group is given two wooden 
handcarts which they pull across about 130 miles of desert 
emulating mormon handcart pioneers who settled utah in the 19th 
century 
a graduate of the program krista palmer 15 of provo said it 
helps youths overcome social and behavioral problems by building 
confidence and self esteem 
it wasnt my idea of a picnic it was a hard program said 
ms palmer it helped me realize my potential to see what i 
could do physically emotionally and spiritually 
she said that before her mother ordered her into the program 
last may she was shy and lacked confidence now she said she 
feels confident talking with strangers and peers and shes 
confident that she can boost her grades beyond her current 
caverage 
she also believes she is better able to resist the temptation of 
drug abuse 
before the experience my selfesteem was low enough i didnt 
think i was worth enough to say no i was headed for the drugs and 
alcohol 
in her lawsuit ms zasso said she was working as a dental 
assistant in mt kisco on june 15 when challenger employees lured 
her into a dark hallway subdued her and hustled her to a nearby 
airport for a flight to southern utah 
ms zasso had left home to live with her boyfriends family and 
had refused to return home 
she said she was subjected to a strip search and then forced to 
walk as much as 18 miles at a time without food and clean water 
the suit also alleges that she was denied medical treatment for a 
concussion 
she remained in the program for 42 days until 3rd district judge 
dennis frederick who is considering the suit found her rights had 
been violated and ordered her release 
zasso praised the program in a videotaped interview conducted by 
challenger employees in the desert but she later testified that 
she feared she would be forced repeat the program if she didnt 
tell the counselors what they wanted to hear

a republican physician was the highest votegetter 
in a special election to replace jim wright in congress but the 
democrat who will face him in a runoff predicted victory in the 
heavily democratic 12th district 
dr bob lanier garnered 21978 ballots or 39 percent of the 
vote in saturdays special election but democrat pete geren was 
elated about his 32 percent showing 17751 votes in the 
district that encompasses most of fort worth 
geren received a ringing endorsement from wright who had 
expressed no favorite in the primary 
i want to ask all of you to redouble your efforts because 
heres a man i want to be my successor the popular wright told 
supporters at a fort worth party for geren he is steeped in the 
traditions of our state and country 
democrat jim lane finished third in the race with 22 percent of 
the vote the only other candidate to garner more than 3 percent 
well the democrats won tonight geren an attorney told 
cheering supporters late saturday it took us four candidates to 
do it but when you total it up we got nearly 60 percent of the 
vote i call that a victory 
wright resigned the seat june 30 after an ethics investigation 
uncovered 69 instances of alleged house violations 
in other election results a dallas government redistricting 
plan that supporters said would foster minority representation 
passed by a 2to1 margin and dallas area rapid transit officials 
won a significant battle when voters in four of five dallas suburbs 
decided to retain the agency 
because no one in the eightcandidate race to replace wright 
received a majority of the votes a runoff is necessary gov bill 
clements will set a date after election results are certified 
lanier host of a nationally syndicated tv health show 60 
second housecall pointed to his success in a district 
traditionally dominated by democrats and wright in particular 
wright first won election in 1955 and was reelected 17 times in 
the next 34 years often with token or no opposition he received 
88 writein votes in saturdays special election 
however ronald reagan and george bush carried the district in 
the last three presidential elections 
remember now its halftime lanier told supporters saturday 
night take a breather go to church come back on monday and 
lets get after it 
in an emotionally charged referendum dallas voters 
overwhelmingly approved a proposal to reorganize the city council 
ostensibly to equalize voting power between whites and minorities 
the proposal received 41456 votes to 20823 against 
however an analysis by the dallas morning news of voting 
patterns in saturdays election showed that more than 85 percent of 
those who voted in the citys predominantly minority districts 
opposed the plan the plan passed citywide because of overwhelming 
support from white voters 
the socalled 1041 plan calls for the addition of two 
single districts and four quadrant representatives leaving the 
mayor as the only atlarge member of the city council 
opponents who had their own plan argued that adding seats 
would dilute minority strength 
a lawsuit challenging the current 83 plan is scheduled to be 
heard sept 5 by us district judge jerry buchmeyer who also is 
reviewing the 1041 plan 
the five suburban elections were crucial to about onefifth of 
the dallas transit agencys sales tax income and to the fate of a 
regional transportation system 
voters in carrollton rowlett irving and plano decided by 
margins of 59 percent or more to stay in dart coppell rejected 
dart by a 20vote margin but officials there said a recount is 
likely 
in june dart approved a 245 billion plan to crisscross the 
metropolitan area with 66 miles of light rail by 2010 the plan 
also called for 18 miles of rail connecting downtown to the 
dallasfort worth international airport and 37 miles of bus and car 
pool lanes for suburban commuters

some japaneseamericans are trying to 
change the name of rhode islands victory day holiday because they 
say the popular name vj day for victory in japan is 
racist 
the holiday monday is still celebrated only in rhode island 
where by tradition it creates a long weekend when virtually 
everything shuts down and people head to the beach 
this year the japan society of rhode island has hired lawyers 
to try to change the name 
unfortunately the name victory day has caused persistent use 
of the appellation vj day by the public by the press 
businesses state offices said one of the lawyers jennifer wood 
wood declined to say how the group might pursue a lawsuit but 
said she has asked attorney general james e oneils office to 
press for a name change or a way to force people to use the 
holidays official name 
thomas connell spokesman for oneil said the attorney general 
cannot require the citizens of the state to call the holiday by a 
particular name 
its not the holiday itself thats bothering me its the 
name said hiromi mineo lima 44 a rhode island resident for 16 
years i feel a bit of discrimination against the japanese race 
rhode island veterans groups are adamant that the name should 
remain unchanged 
leave that holiday alone said lionel poissant state 
service officer for the rhode island veterans of foreign wars 
its too bad they didnt think of that when they attacked us 
japan surrendered on aug 15 1945 germanys surrender the old 
ve day for victory in europe came may 7 1945 
attorney wood said the holidays nickname discriminates on the 
basis of race against japaneseamericans and impugns the 
character of japaneseamericans in the united states many of whose 
families have been here for generations or many of whom fought in 
world war ii 
mindful of the popularity of the long weekend politicians have 
never seriously discussed repealing the holiday established in 
1948 
there have been attempts in the general assembly to change its 
name to peace day or remembrance day but all have been 
sunk by the powerful veterans lobby 
the legislature did pass a resolution in 1987 reaffirming the 
victory day name after concerns were raised that the holiday 
would make it more difficult for rhode island to attract japanese 
business 
they started the war we won the war said rene bobola 
president of the central falls veterans council we insulted 
them they insulted us by attacking

conscience of congress about the starving in africa

down crying trying to appeal to other congresspeople to be 
sensitive to the fact that people in ethiopia were clutching to 
his ankles and dying before his eyes with worms and flies 
devouring their bodies 
and with that sense of passion and moral imperative he kept 
going back again and again and again jackson said 
dellums said the those aboard the aircraft including a staff 
member joyce francine williams gave their lives nobly in an 
effort to advocate on behalf of people much less fortunate than 
themselves

soviet authorities dealing with a strike in 
estonia face new work stoppages in the republics of azerbaijan and 
georgia over nationalist issues union leaders said sunday 
the communist party newspaper pravda said sunday that as many as 
40000 russianspeaking workers in estonia were striking to protest 
what they feel are discriminatory laws recently passed on 
preserving the estonian language and limiting the voting rights of 
immigrants pravda sided with their demands 
the peoples front of azerbaijan called a general strike monday 
in nonstrategic industries to demand local communist party 
officials move to a more democratic structure said activist aidin 
amirbekov in a telephone interview 
in georgia proindependence activists had called for a general 
strike to begin tuesday there were conflicting reports on whether 
it would proceed 
the ethnic russian strikers in estonia won support from a key 
source sunday under the headline and what about civil rights 
pravda charged that the new estonian election law which sets tough 
residency requirements violates the soviet constitutional equal 
rights provision 
as is known the constitution has not yet been abandoned 
pravda said 
the article criticized the estonian lawmakers who have led the 
call for human rights guarantees for restricting the voting rights 
of nonestonians 
the new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the 
same district for two years or anywhere in estonia for five years 
candidates must live in the same place for five years or in 
estonia for 10 years 
a new language law requires most workers to learn estonian many 
russian workers have not even after decades of living in estonia 
and natives complain that many police and ambulance personnel 
cannot understand their language 
a moscow activist said workers in the azerbaijan capital of baku 
demonstrated for a second night sunday but amirbekov speaking 
from the town denied that report 
amirbekov said workers at manufacturing plants are being asked 
to strike monday to support demands that local leaders find 
political solutions instead of military ones to the republics 
ethnic violence which has caused dozens of deaths he said workers 
in strategic industries such as bakus extensive oil complex were 
asked to stay on the job 
some activists in baku are demanding removal of soviet troops 
from the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh and an end to 
curfews in the republic but amirbekov said authorities believe 
relations are too tense to consider that step 
azerbaijan which traditionally is shiite moslem has been 
embroiled in a dispute with neighboring armenia whose population 
is mainly christian over control of the nagornokarabakh region 
nagornokarabakh is part of azerbaijan but its population is 
predominantly armenian and armenia wants to annex it 
in estonia work has at least partially halted at 26 enterprises 
in the capital of tallinn and at 13 factories in kohtlajarve the 
labor newspaper trud said sunday train workers were on strike and 
the state airline aeroflot carried only emergency supplies and 
passengers trud said 
the russians most of who work in heavy industrial plants also 
object to a new national decision to give estonia and the two other 
baltic republics free rein over its economy in asserting their 
rights ethnic estonians have angered immigrant workers from russia 
and elsewhere 
the workers are demanding that factories with a mainly 
russianspeaking labor force remain the property of the national 
government rather than be handed over to estonia 
artur kapityem at the russians strike headquarters in tallinn 
said by telephone that leaders were in moscow to meet with kremlin 
leaders since they have refused to negotiate with estonian 
officials 
we no longer trust the republics leadership tass quoted m 
lysenko of the strike committee as saying 
kapityem denied pravdas report that criminal charges had been 
filed against labor leaders under an emergency estonian decree 
banning the strike 
ethnic estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the 
population russians make up about a third of the 16 million 
people

the oldest space shuttle 
glided to a perfect landing in the mojave desert on sunday 
completing a secret mission to deploy a spy satellite and 
reportedly conduct star wars experiments 
a super team and a great machine welcome home columbia 
frank culbertson an astronaut from mission control in houston 
said as the fiveman crew landed shortly after sunrise ending a 
fiveday one hour and 56minute journey of more than 2 million 
miles 
columbia though dirty sustained little damage to the tiles 
that protect it from the heat of the fiery reentry and no tiles 
appeared to be missing said ed jenner shuttle support manager for 
the air force at edwards 
it was the first mission in 3 years for columbia which 
inaugurated shuttle flights in 1981 columbias last flight ended 
10 days before the january 1986 challenger disaster that killed its 
crew of seven 
it was an apparently perfect landing observed nancy lovato 
a spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space administration 
welcome home space cowboy friends and relatives yelled at 
pilot richard richards shortly before he and the other astronauts 
departed aboard two gulfstream jets bound for johnson space center 
in houston 
richards told a crowd of about 100 spectators that columbias 
mission represented a reaffirmation that human beings belong in 
space we can do wonderful things there we can excite our kids and 
make our planet a better place to live 
the astronauts and their wives arrived in houston around 4 pm 
cdt they were greeted by their families and about 300 cheering 
friends and coworkers 
it was a real privilege to participate in the restoration of 
columbia to flight status the shuttles commander air force 
col brewster shaw told the crowd at ellington field it was a 
privilege to accomplish what we accomplished on this flight for the 
united states of america 
it wasnt nice it was fantastic added richards a navy 
commander and one of three space rookies on the flight 
after a 15minute ceremony the astronauts shook hands and 
hugged many of the wellwishers before climbing into vans and 
heading home with their families 
the landing ended the 30th mission of the shuttle program 
columbia for a years a hangar queen that was stripped of parts 
to keep other shuttles flying had undergone more than 250 
modifications called for after the challenger disaster 
the other crew members were navy cmdr david leestma army lt 
col james adamson and air force col mark brown 
the shuttles sonic booms startled slumbering los angeles as it 
hurtled across california minutes later shaw guided the 97ton 
orbiter to a 637 am pdt landing on a hard clay runway the 
aircraft trailing a plume of dust 
a news blackout was imposed on the mission by the air force but 
air force secretary donald rice said wednesday that a satellite was 
deployed by the astronauts during their first day in orbit on 
tuesday 
rice maintained the official silence about the satellites 
purpose but it is widely believed to be a 10ton spy satellite 
designed to take detailed photographs of military targets over a 
wide area of the globe including most of the soviet union it 
would help the united states verify soviet compliance with arms 
agreements 
the shuttle crew also reportedly monitored military sites on 
earth and was believed to have conducted experiments related to the 
star wars missile defense program 
the shuttle landed in perfect weather with unrestricted 
visibility the few people gathered to watch on rogers dry lake 
also were treated to a view of the perseid meteor shower which 
sprinkled the sky with shooting stars 
the air force base 80 miles north of los angeles has been host 
to as many as half a million people for shuttle landings but was 
closed to the public sunday because of the pentagons demand for 
secrecy 
the news media were allowed to watch and record the landing from 
about two miles 
the department of defense said secrecy was needed to limit an 
adversarys ability to determine the mission of a given dod shuttle 
flight

a fundamentalist moslem preacher charged 
with antigovernment activities has been released from jail but he 
said sunday he was under virtual house arrest 
omar abdelrahman who is blind was acquitted twice of charges 
connected to the assassination of president anwar sadat in october 
1981 he and 48 other defendants now are being tried on charges of 
illegal possession of weapons attempting to kill a police officer 
and assault 
the charges are punishable by death 
on thursday a state security court trying the 49 ordered the 
release of 25 prisoners including abdelrahman it ordered one 
defendant who is charged with bombing a theater in the southern 
town of fayoum to remain in detention the 23 others accused in 
the case had not been jailed 
abdelrahman contacted by telephone at his home in fayoum 
said im in good health he has high blood pressure and 
diabetes 
there are security forces around my house he said they 
have stopped me from going out to pray at the mosque they are not 
letting me out at all and are arresting my visitors 
maj gen wagih issa of the interior ministry denied 
abdelrahmans claims and said he is free to move whoever wants 
to visit him may do so freely 
the ministry which is in charge of internal security 
reportedly had invoked emergency regulations to extend the 
detention of the 25 who were released under the court order 
abdelrahman returned to his home friday night 
the emergency law has been in force since sadats assassination 
it gives police broad powers of search and arrest without charge 
and bans unauthorized demonstrations and strikes 
abdelrahman a former theology professor at assiut university 
south of fayoum heads a fundamentalist moslem group that demands 
the immediate and full full implementation of the islamic law or 
sharia 
the government claims 90 percent of the existing law conforms to 
sharia 
abdelrahman was accused of inspiring the gunmen who killed 
sadat and was acquitted he also was found innocent in a later 
trial of 300 moslem fundamentalists charged with an attempted coup 
after sadats assassination 
in both cases the prosecution said abdelrahman was the 
spiritual leader of an underground group called jihad that was 
dedicated to the overthrow of the government he was released in 
1985 following the second acquittal 
the current charges against him and 48 others involve an 
antigovernment demonstration on april 7 that the prosecution 
claims abdelrahman led 
police rounded up about 2500 moslem fundamentalists for 
questioning after the demonstration

us

in jerusalem an israeli government official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said he saw nothing new in abu sharifs

a senior aide to us attorney general dick 
thornburgh owned rite aid corp stock when he participated in the 
1986 appointment of an executive of the drugstore chain to the 
state pharmacy board the philadelphia inquirer reported sunday 
the aide murray g dickman also was a guest of rite aid 
chairman alex grass and his two sons both company executives on a 
january 1983 trip by corporate jet from harrisburg to new orleans 
to watch penn state play in the sugar bowl according to the 
newspaper 
at the time dickman was secretary of administration under 
thengov thornburgh dickman is now assistant to the attorney 
general 
rite aid the nations largest retail pharmacy chain and its 
president martin l grass have been indicted in cleveland on 
state bribery charges 
grass who is accused of delivering a 33000 bribe and other 
benefits to a member of the ohio board of pharmacy is to be 
arraigned tuesday 
dickman said he was infuriated by implications in the inquirers 
story about his time in state government 
i did nothing improper according to the laws dickman said 
in an interview saturday night with the associated press i am 
truly offended 
dickman owned 400 of 40 million shares in rite aid us justice 
department spokesman david runkel said based on the stocks 1986 
price range on the new york stock exchange his interest was worth 
between 9700 and 14200 
thats not a very big stake in the company runkel said 
runkel who also served in thornburghs gubernatorial 
administration added that under pennsylvania law dickman did 
nothing improper 
as secretary of administration dickman was the key aide on 
appointments to state boards he approved a recommendation that 
thornburgh name rite aid executive frederick h wendte to a seat on 
the board of pharmacy the inquirer said the governor went along 
with the recommendation on june 4 1986 
dickman said saturday that he was aware of the appointment but 
to insinuate that he had an effect on the decision was 
preposterous 
he said he sold the stock in 1986 most likely toward the end of 
the year 
dickman left thornburghs cabinet on nov 15 1986 to accept a 
100000ayear job as a senior vice president of the 
harrisburgbased company thornburghs second term as governor 
ended in january 1987 
thornburgh accepted a seat on the rite aid board of directors in 
april 1987 and served until he became attorney general in august 
1988 dickman left his rite aid job in november 1987 and joined 
thornburgh in the justice department last august 
he was not required to list the rite aid stock on disclosures 
filed publicly with the state ethics commission and did not do so 
he disclosed it within thornburghs administration on the more 
detailed reports required by the governor code of conduct 
dickman called the 1983 sugar bowl trip a social call from 
his friend roger grass then a rite aid vice president 
the trip was not disclosed although thornburghs code of conduct 
barred officials from accepting gifts or entertainment 
dickman said he cleared the trip with the governors office of 
general counsel 
it doesnt appear that the legal advice was sound runkel 
quoted thornburgh as having said friday

thousands of people marched 
through roman catholic neighborhoods of west belfast on sunday and 
cheered for the violent campaign of the irish republican army 
i want to praise the real freedom fighters in this country 
i want to praise the men and women of the irish republican army 
gerry adams president of the iras political wing told thousands 
of cheering supporters who stood in a pouring rain 
the provinces new chief police constable hugh annesley showed 
up at the march and adams pointed him out to the crowd joking that 
he was the man wearing five flak jackets 
welcome to west belfast adams roared 
the march of the republican forces those who seek a united 
ireland was a much more overtly political march than a big 
protestant parade in londonderry saturday that commemorated the 
300th anniversary of a defeat of the catholic king james ii 
some marchers in belfast carried placards with the names of 
those killed on the their side in 20 years of the troubles and 
fife and drum bands chanted ira 
though much of the republican emphasis last week was on the 
anniversary of the british governments longdiscarded policy of 
imprisoning terrorist suspects without trial sundays speeches 
focused on mondays 20th anniversary of british troops in the 
province 
the army was sent into londonderry on aug 14 1969 following 
fierce battles between police and roman catholics 
the british army came in 1969 not because we were being 
attacked but because for the first time since the beginning of 
this state this misbegotton tuppence hapenny bastardized state 
we were fighting back said bernadette devlin mcaliskey a fiery 
leader in the catholic civil rights marches of the 1960s 
the reasons they are still here 20 years after is because we 
are still fighting back she said 
in a speech in which she compared the throngs of reporters and 
photographers to some kind of diseased butterflies that seem to 
thrive on other peoples problems she said little had been 
gained in 20 years 
the principle of one man one vote had been secured but 
real political power had been taken away she said 
catholics were twice as likely as protestants to be unemployed 
20 years ago but now she said they are 2 times more likely to be 
without work 
everything we got out of them we squeezed out of them mrs 
mcaliskey said yet it was nothing because every time we gained 
something they clawed it back have we come 20 years for 
nothing no something has changed and ill tell you what has 
changed we have changed 
the thousands who marched up the falls road to andersontown on 
sunday represent only a minority within northern irelands roman 
catholic community in election after election sinn fein has 
pulled about half as many votes as the social democratic and labor 
party which is committed to peaceful change 
the social democrats have taken no part in the marches this 
weekend 
security was strict along the parade route and march organizers 
complained that the crowd was constrained too closely by armored 
land rovers 
there were no incidents during or after the parade said a 
spokesman for the royal ulster constabulary a british police force 
a dozen people were arrested early sunday in londonderry after 
20 gasoline bombs were thrown at officers the constabulary said 
no one was injured 
more than 2700 people have died in 20 years of violence in 
northern ireland which is divided between catholics who generally 
favor a united ireland and protestants who support continued 
british rule 
twothirds of the dead were civilians

arson caused a fire blamed for the deaths of 
three people in a rooming house that had no fire escape and a 
substandard sprinkler system investigators said sunday 
about 10 people representing local state and federal 
investigative agencies most of whom had previously said they 
suspected arson met for two hours to discuss tuesdays fire at the 
ben crest plaza rooming house 
the group reached a final conclusion that it was arson 
involving the use of an accelerant said howard whitehead 
assistant district attorney for essex county an accelerant is a 
substance such as gasoline used to accelerate a fire he said it 
would take a week or more before the accelerant was identified 
after the fire struck tenants clad only in their night clothes 
had to leap from windows to escape the flames some swung down on 
ropes the management had provided as fire escapes more than 19 
tenants and rescuers were hurt 
before the fire the city had filed a criminal complaint against 
the buildings owner leo allard for failing to install a 
sprinkler system covering each room as required by a 2yearold 
ordinance 
whitehead said authorities had no suspects or possible motive in 
mind there are two angles to this motive and opportunity who 
was around at the time he said 
whitehead declined to provide further details such as where the 
fire might have begun saying he didnt want to influence anyone 
who would be questioned some 50 or 60 people including the 
rooming house tenants were interviewed already 
authorities were still hunting for two rooming house residents 
seen around the time of the fire who havent been seen since 
although they are assumed to have escaped safely he said 
whitehead said a search dog trained to locate human remains 
failed to find any trace of the missing men inside the burnedout 
building 
in the meantime the rooming house actually two joined 
buildings one five stories the other four stories was being 
torn down floor by floor 
the demolition could yield more clues whitehead said 
attending sundays meeting were representatives of the state 
fire marshal the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
state police lynn fire and police officials whitehead and lynn

a 16yearold palestinian died sunday of wounds 
suffered in a clash with soldiers and troops dispersed bands of 
masked youths attacking gaza strip workers applying for entry 
permits to israel 
arab hospital officials said 11 palestinians were shot and 
wounded sunday in clashes with israeli soldiers in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
the death raised to 536 the number of arabs killed in the 
20monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied territories 
thirtyeight israelis have been slain in the violence 
also sunday one of israels leading religious figures said that 
under jewish law the concept of preserving jewish lives took 
precedence over all other commandments including settling the 
biblical land of israel 
but rabbi ovadia yosef of the ultraorthodox shas political party 
did not make the anticipated religious ruling on returning 
territories to preserve jewish lives 
he said relinquishing territories at this time is not realistic 
because there is no arab partner for peace 
jewish settlers living in the occupied west bank claim there is

for more than a year platoon leader falk turba 
patrolled the border between east and west germany his automatic 
rifle at the ready to stop anyone attempting to flee to the west 
in july he slipped away from his comrades tossed his rifle 
aside and scrambled over the barbedwire and concrete barriers to 
west germany 
i just couldnt take it anymore turba said in an interview 
in west berlin on sunday the 28th anniversary of the building of 
the berlin wall 
turba 20 spoke of the daily life of communist east germanys 
elite border troopers young men selected by communist party and 
military officials because of their loyality to the state 
turba who grew up in dresden said border guards were told in 
april that a shoottokill order against civilians trying to flee 
east germany had been lifted 
but he said most of his comrades had quietly ignored the order 
during their border service 
only about 10 percent of the hardcore gungho troops would 
shoot at an unarmed civilian attempting to flee turba said 
theyre the macho types who like strutting around with their 
machine guns looking tough 
but he said it was a great risk for the border guards to allow 
someone to escape 
if you let someone escape you go to prison he said its 
also very risky because you patrol in pairs and you never know 
what the other guy is thinking or what he would do 
but i hoped and many others did as well that i would never 
have to arrest someone 
he said electronic listening devices and alarm systems attack 
dogs and rows of barbedwire usually slowed wouldbe escapees long 
enough that border troops could arrest them 
many of those caught were given long prison terms 
according to west german statistics 191 people have been killed 
trying to escape since the berlin wall was erected in 1961 and the 
border between the two germanies was sealed by barriers 
but about 218000 people managed to escape including 2614 
border troops according to the statistics 
turba said he decided to flee because he had little hope of 
political and economic changes in his country 
unlike hungary and poland where reform communists have 
succeeded in expanding freedoms east german leader erich honecker 
maintains a hardline policy 
turba said a growing number of border guards are openly 
questioning the nations border policy which east german officials 
contend is necessary to protect socialism from western 
plunderers 
you sit in your freezing bunker or guard tower and begin to 
ask yourself what this border is for and what you are doing 
turba said you reach a point where you realize its senseless and 
brutal 
he said morale among border units is slumping because the 
increasing number of escape attempts brings additional pressure 
from their officers 
frustration and disillusionment lead many troopers to break 
regulations according to turba 
some people bring books to read in the towers others rig 
their field radios to tune into western broadcasts the political 
officer once took off to go hunting he said 
on july 12 turba told his comrades he had problems with his 
motorcycle and he needed to take it for a test drive he roared 
over a hill coasted to the border barriers and bounded to freedom 
there are a lot of weak points along the border and we know 
them best he said

commitment to helping others so it is with profound sadness that i 
convey to his family and to his colleagues and to his staff the 
regrets that all americans feel the president said 
bush also thanked everybody that involved themselves in this 
almost unprecedented search and certainly the government of 
ethiopia who could not im told have been more cooperative 
asked if the ethiopians had requested assistance to determine 
how the crash occurred bush replied not that i know of but 
they certainly will get any cooperation on that from us just as we 
did have fully cooperated on the search 
he added it has been unprecedented and the result is terrible 
but i must commend the courageous men and women in the armed 
services that joined in this search it was really a very difficult 
search and they did it well against bad weather a lot of things

a continental airlines 727 was forced to abort its 
takeoff in denver on sunday when its tail engine disintegrated 
scattering pieces of metal and rotor blades on the runway 
the pilot of flight 1249 to portland ore reported a 
flameout at 133 pm and was forced to return to the gate said 
richard boulware spokesman at stapleton international airport he 
said there were no injuries reported among the 128 passengers and 
seven crew members 
a preliminary look at the boeing 727s no 2 engine which is 
mounted in the tail of the plane showed an apparent failure in the 
turbine section said continental spokesman ned walker in houston 
he said an initial examination of the engine showed no external 
damage but inside apparently some blades in the turbine section 
were missing it appears it was completely contained within the 
turbine section 
airport workers discovered a substantial number of rotor 
blades and scrap metal on the runway boulware said 
it is very unusual to have an engine do that on a 727 i cant 
remember the last time it happened if it actually ever happened 
before said tom cole a spokesman for boeing in seattle he said 
the engine was manufactured by pratt amp whitney 
shortly after the captain initiated his takeoff roll an 
indicator came on in the cockpit showing one of the engines was not 
at full power said walker the pilot followed procedure by 
returning to the gate walker said 
we were getting ready to taxi off said passenger steve 
bremmer 39 of portland he the pilot kept going and going 
the nose lifted up just a bit but it was mushy the pilot set it 
down he put the engines in full reverse 
walker said the airline believes a portion of the engine 
disintegrated but did not explode since the debris did not 
penetrate other portions of the aircraft 
the pilot told passengers that an engine fan blade broke and 
that the pieces were sucked into the engine causing it to blow 
apart said passenger carl miller 34 of portland 
earlier boulware said indications were that the engine had 
exploded 
walker said 727s which have all three engines mounted near the 
rear of the plane are designed to take off with just two engines 
the no 2 engine has come under scrutiny recently in dc10 
aircraft which are larger than 727s but walker said there is no 
comparison whatsoever to the dc10 question 
the failure of a no 2 engine is believed to have been involved 
in a crash and two other incidents including the crash of united 
flight 232 in sioux city iowa last month 
in that accident in which 111 people died the tail engine 
exploded severing all three of the planes hydraulic flight 
control systems 
last week a northwest dc10 made an emergency landing in denver 
after its no 2 tail engine apparently started disintegrating in 
flight nicking the hydraulic lines but not severing them 
on friday a third dc10 bound for denver aborted takeoff in 
boston because of a stalled compressor in the tailmounted engine 
officials said 
cole the boeing spokesman said there are 1764 727s flying 
and it is the most used plane in the world 
the passengers of flight 1249 were put on another flight to 
portland on sunday afternoon walker said federal authorities have 
been notified of the incident he said

southcentral brazil on sunday released their three hostages 
including two television reporters and made a getaway in a plane 
provided by authorities police said 
police said four traded their captives for an aircraft and pilot 
to end a threeday standoff with police on a highway near the town 
of presidente prudente 635 miles southwest of rio de janieiro 
they were armed with hand grenades submachine guns pistols and 
shotguns 
police said the hostages were unharmed 
i lived for four days with a pistol at my head but not for one 
minute did i believe i would die said monica calassa one of the 
hostages a person who trades her life for that of another cant 
die like that 
it was not clear where the plane was headed the fugitives two 
married couples earlier had indicated they wanted to be flown to 
paraguay 
brazilian media identified the fugitives leader as rui ribeiro 
de campos and said he owns a farm in paraguay 
the plane departed late this afternoon but is flying at a very 
low altitude and we are not able to pick them up on the radar 
policeman nivaldo de pirondi said by telephone from presidente 
prudente 
the pilot was aniceto de oliveira gomes a rancher and mayor of 
the rural town of pantalina in central goias state pirondi said 
he voluntered to fly the hostages to a destination of their choice 
pirondi said 
police said a sixth man apparently a friend of gomes had 
accompanied the pilot on the flight 
the planes departure ended a threeday standoff between more 
than 100 police and the fugitives who had led police on a 500mile 
chase through three states since wednesday 
on wednesday the fugitives were paid a 42000 ransom and given 
an armored car and driver in exchange for a 9yearold boy thay had 
kidnapped on aug 3 three local newswomen offered to take the 
place of the young boy and the kidnappers later released the one 
of the reporters 
however goias state authorities on wednesday failed to provide 
a plane for their escape and the kidnappers began their flight 
the kidnappers stopped only for gasoline and food from a 
roadside cafeteria to eat one kidnapper stepped from the car 
holding a pistol to a newswomans head 
several previous attempts to negotiate the hostages release had 
failed

a man tried to swim handcuffed across part 
of lake erie on sunday in a symbolic fund raiser for chinas 
beleaguered prodemocracy movement but had to stop short of his 
goal when a support boat sank 
we werent doing bad were just disappointed we didnt 
finish said maynard magilla schaus who with three chinese 
students was trying to swim 10 miles from crystal beach ontario 
to the erie basin marina here they were forced to stop about eight 
miles into the 10mile swim 
two swimmers from the erie pa area had better luck than the 
38yearold buffalo actor and writer bob north 35 and harvey 
snell 38 came ashore in north east pa on sunday morning after 
a 26 to 30mile swim that began the previous evening at long 
point canada 
it was the first time anyone had completed a swim across the 
lake since 1975 
the outboard boat that sank during schaus shorter swim was one 
of two support boats and carried a styrofoam replica of the 
goddess of democracy statue that chinese students erected in 
beijings tienanmen square before the june military crackdown 
the boat began taking on water about two miles from buffalo and 
sank within two minutes schaus said the swimmers had been in the 
water for about seven hours when it was called off at 330 pm 
a passing boater and the erie county sheriffs marine patrol 
helped the swimmers and the people in the boat that sank schaus 
said he said the marine patrol gave him a ticket for having an 
unregistered rowboat the boat that didnt sink 
schaus said he didnt know why the other boat sank but 
speculated that a large wave or a loose drainage plug may have been 
the cause 
schaus has made the swim twice before for other charities but 
sunday was the first time he did it handcuffed which he said was a 
metaphor for the loss of freedom in china to swim he used a 
modified dog paddle 
xianglong zhang one of the students at the state university of 
new york at buffalo who swam with schaus said he was more 
disappointed for schaus than in his own failure to finish the swim 
without this accident he would have been successful in 
reaching here said zhang 
schaus said he made the effort to demonstrate that there are 
americans who care about standing up for freedom people who 
believe in the tenets this country was founded on 
the swim was sponsored by the chinese students club at the 
university to help victims of the crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement and provide information on the movement 
the sponsors were unable to say how much money was pledged
