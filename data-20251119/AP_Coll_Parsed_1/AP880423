she returned from exile said friday that guatemala is lagging 
behind other central american nations in seeking peace with rebels 
rigoberta menchu and another activist were arrested monday then 
released after being held for seven hours she returned to exile in 
rome on friday 
despite her arrest ms menchu said she moved freely during her 
stay here despite periodic death threats that she called normal 
and of not much importance 
she said she and three other members of the leftist united 
representation of guatemalan had discussed with roman catholic 
archbishop prespero penados del barrio whether exiles can safely 
return to guatemala we had great success she said at the 
airport before departing for rome but gave no details 
travel plans of the the other exiles rolando castillo montalvo 
frank la rue and marta de torres were not known 
ms menchu and castillo montalvo were arrested and charged with 
crimes against the internal security of the nation but a judge 
subsequently dismissed the charges for lack of evidence 
speaking with reporters at the airport ms menchu said 
guatemala is far from meeting provisions of a central american 
peace plan signed aug 7 by the presidents of nicaragua el 
salvador guatemala honduras and costa rica 
i believe that this process still is just beginning to begin 
in guatemala because in other countries of the central 
american region there have been more concrete things there have 
been more realistic things than there have been in our country

swedish radio said friday it had 
obtained documents supporting allegations that a family of indian 
financiers received 137 million in connection with a swedish arms 
sale to india 
it said the documents included telex messages between the 
swedish firm ab bofors and two swiss banks in geneva in 1986 
dealing with accounts under the control of londonbased members of 
the hinduja family 
in new delhi the newspaper hindu also reported the allegations 
g p hinduja one of four brothers active in the family 
operations called the information a complete fabrication in a 
statement to the hindu bofors spokesman per mossberg was quoted as 
denying the allegations 
the telex messages indicated the account holder was promised a 
10 percent commission on a 14 billion indian contract for 155mm 
howitzers made by bofors swedens largest arms manufacturer the 
swedish radio said 
it described the hindujas as being close to prime minister rajiv 
gandhi and his congress party 
the broadcast said money from bofors passed through accounts 
held by the hinduja family at the british bank of the middle east 
and the continental illinois bank in geneva it claimed the 
deposits were transferred to sangam ltd in london a company 
swedish radio said was owned by the hinduja family 
gandhis government was facing allegations of corruption when it 
negotiated the deal with bofors in 1986 and made the condition that 
no middlemen be used a swedish investigation last june found that 
bofors paid up to 40 million to individuals but the company 
legally blocked access to further information

adopted its final report friday but the united news of india said 
investigators had drawn a blank

marines who landed on an 
iranian oil platform after it was battered by us warships found 
weapons that may have been used against american helicopters the 
commander of the attack said 
capt james b perkins iii who heads destroyer squadron 9 said 
the attack on the sassan oil platform bore out us claims that the 
persian gulf facility was being used for military purposes 
we believe that sassan was a communications and surveillence 
station said perkins we found weapons ammunition and 
communications gear 
sassan one of two iranian oil rigs attacked by us forces on 
monday was destroyed in an operation that began with a twoship 
naval bombardment followed by a helicopter assault it ended with 
an assault by marine corps demolition specialists who blew up the 
remaining facilities 
weve gotten pretty beat up for our combined operations in the 
past but i thought this was just about perfect perkins said 
during an interview on the bridge of this san diegobased warship 
perkins declined to speculate on how the iranians used sassan 
other than for surveillance of shipping but an officer aboard this 
destroyer said the weapons recovered were types associated with 
irans armed speedboat operations in the gulf 
after the shelling the marines who assaulted the platform found 
23mm guns primarily antiaircraft weapons 
officers said it was most likely one of those weapons fired on 
two helicopters from the guided missile frigate simpson on march 5 
although the helicopters were not hit the incident was cited by 
us officials as one of the reasons for operation praying mantis 
another reason was the mining of the frigate samuel b roberts on 
april 14 
the 4500ton mccormick a guidedmissile destroyer brought into 
the gulf from its battle group station in the arabian sea and the 
7818ton destroyer merrill fired 133 5inch shells at the platform 
perkins said that at sassan the destruction was complete it 
was pretty beat up by the naval gunfire and the demolition charges 
made one hell of an explosion 
it was obscured in smoke and flame its certainly 
uninhabitable at this point 
perkins unit gave the iranians at sassan a fiveminute warning 
that they were about to be attacked 
about 29 workers on the platform quickly boarded two tugboats 
that were tied up under the living quarters platform at sassan and 
got out of the way 
some iranians who had stayed behind fired at the mccormick and 
the merrill with one of three sovietmade 23mm guns placed on the 
threetiered southernmost deck 
although the twinbarrelled weapon has a range of four miles 
the rounds fell short of the ships which were about two miles from 
the platform 
perkins said one of the tugboats radioed for permission to 
return to the platform and pick up another group of about 38 still 
aboard the request was granted and a 45minute evacuation took 
place while the ships held their fire 
radio traffic indicated only two iranian casualties at sassan 
one dead and one wounded but us officers said there may have 
been more

president reagan is moving to fill one justice 
department slot and attorney general edwin meese iii is appointing 
temporary replacements for up to a dozen others in an attempt to 
end the turmoil caused by the march 29 protest resignations of two 
key meese aides 
reagan on friday moved quickly to ease meeses personnel 
problems by nominating francis keating to fill the associate 
attorney generals slot the departments empty no 3 post 
reagan also said meese should stay in office and the justice 
department is running just fine although two top meese aides 
who quit told reagan on wednesday a deep malaise had 
infected the department and one of them said meese should be 
indicted 
keating would replace stephen trott who left the department a 
week ago to become a federal judge his was not one of the protest 
resignations but the vacancy has been affected by the concern with 
meeses leadership 
keating an assistant treasury secretary may come in to the 
justice department on an acting basis late next week until he can 
be confirmed by the senate 
the nos 2 and 3 offices at the justice department are virtually 
vacant from the top down and the department plans to shore them up 
by naming perhaps nearly a dozen people in all department 
spokesman patrick korten said the posts probably will be filled on 
monday 
korten added meese absolutely has no intention of stepping 
down 
an independent counsel has been examining meeses assistance to 
scandalplagued wedtech corp and a proposed 1 billion iraqi oil 
pipeline project at the behest of longtime friend e robert 
wallach also under investigation are meeses meetings with 
regional bell telephone company executives at a time when he owned 
14000 in baby bell stock and wallachs role in securing a 
40000ayear job for meeses wife 
since the protest resignations of deputy attorney general arnold 
burns and assistant attorney general william weld meese has twice 
unsuccessfully tried to fill burns post 
philadelphia lawyer arlin adams rejected meeses overtures and 
at least five current or former us attorneys who have been 
sounded out about welds job have said they werent interested st 
louis attorney john shepherd withdrew from consideration for burns 
post wednesday after adverse publicity about an alleged affair with 
his law firms bookkeeper and other matters 
weld was unequivocal at the white house meeting in telling 
the president that if it were up to him he would seek an 
indictment of meese said an administration source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the former criminal division chief then proceeded to lay out 
an oral indictment of meese to the president said the source 
focusing on meeses relationship with wallach 
wallach is under indictment in the wedtech scandal 
the administration source said burns told the president that 
meese had violated the standards of ethical conduct for executive 
branch employees spelled out in a 1965 executive order 
burns according to the source said that in other similar 
instances of possible impropriety justice department lawyers would 
be placed on administrative leave disciplined or dismissed 
the president was very attentive said the source adding 
that it was clear he was hearing for the first time that not 
everything is well in denmark 
the ethical standards say employees should avoid any action 
which could create the appearance of using public office for 
private gain giving preferential treatment to any organization or 
person or making a government decision outside official channels 
vice president george bush baker and white house counsel ab 
culvahouse also attended the meeting 
meese was summoned to a 40minute meeting with reagan 
immediately afterward 
according to korten the president told meese at the end of 
their meeting that he was satisfied and supportive of the 
attorney general 
burns left his post officially on friday 3 weeks after 
resigning to protest meeses continued tenure as attorney general 
independent counsel james c mckay who has been conducting a 
criminal investigation of meese since last may 11 is expected to 
issue a report of meeses activites if he doesnt seek an 
indictment of the attorney general 
it is likely the justice departments office of professional 
responsibility will then examine ethical questions raised as a 
result of mckays probe and will recommend to reagan whether meese 
should be disciplined or fired

a mammogram of nancy reagans right breast 
shows no sign of cancer the white house says 
while the first lady went to bethesda naval hospital to have her 
sixmonth checkup following removal of her cancerous left breast 
president reagan had dental xrays done there 
the first couple flew by helicopter friday to the suburban 
maryland military facility from the white house remained there for 
less than a halfhour then went to camp david for the weekend 
the president and first lady completed their routine 
radiological procedures white house physician dr john hutton 
said 
the president had a series of routine dental xrays in the 
dental clinic while mrs reagan had her first postoperative 
mammogram he said the mammogram was negative no immediate 
treatment of any kind is required as a result of todays procedures 
on the president and first lady 
the white house had said earlier that the examinations were not 
prompted by any current physicial problems of either of the reagans 
the reagans did not answer reporters questions when they left 
the white house or on arrival or departure from the hospital 
reagan however made an aok thumbandforefinger sign 
indicating things went well 
the last time the 77yearold president visited the hospital was 
in january when he underwent his semiannual checkup for colon 
cancer he has had regular checkups every january and june since he 
underwent surgery for an intestinal malignancy in july 1985 
elaine crispen mrs reagans press secretary said its wise 
and routine to check the other breast after surgery of the kind 
the first lady had six months ago 
she said the first lady has had periodic examinations since her 
operation oct 17 1987 but this was her first xray of the right 
breast 
mrs crispen said the couple wanted to have the results of mrs 
reagans exam promptly so they could send her off for a 
comfortable worryfree weekend 
mrs reagan 66 had her breast removed after doctors discovered 
a quarterinch cancerous lesion she chose to undergo a modified 
radical mastectomy which involves the removal of the entire breast 
and some lymph nodes 
mrs crispen said that not only was it time for the first ladys 
sixmonth checkup but the president could use the time to get 
his dental xrays taken rather than usually doing it at the white 
house 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan usually has a 
cleaning and checkup every three months at the white house but 
that the president planned to have a panoramic xray done this 
time in order to get a fullview picture of his mouth 
the white house has xray machines that take pictures of parts 
of the mouth but does not have the larger machine that pans the 
entire mouth area he said 
panoramic radiographs or xrays that provide an overall view of 
the teeth and jaws are used to diagnose problems ranging from 
cavities to tumors

a host of current and former top government 
officials are listed as prosecution witnesses for the irancontra 
conspiracy trial of marine lt col oliver l north and three 
codefendants 
secretary of state george p shultz and two top deputies and 
attorney edwin meese iii and two of his top aides are among the 
list of 105 witnesses submitted in a court filing friday by 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
the list includes national security officials knowledgeable 
about the covert sale of us arms to iran private operatives who 
ran the secret supply network that armed the nicaraguan rebels 
contra leaders and wealthy donors who contributed to their cause 
no date has been set for the trial of north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and two arms dealers retired 
air force maj gen richard v secord and albert hakim 
they are accused of conspiring to divert profits illegally from 
the usiran arms sales to help the contras during a ban on direct 
american military aid to the rebels 
walsh filed the witness list in advance of mondays hearing 
called by us district judge gerhard a gesell to determine if 
prosecutors impermissibly relied on evidence derived from the 
compelled congressional testimony of north hakim and poindexter 
most of the witnesses were known to walsh before hakim received 
congressional immunity on april 20 1987 
the list includes deputy cia director robert gates former white 
house chief of staff donald regan former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane and assistant attorneys general william bradford 
reynolds and charles cooper 
meese cooper and reynolds would be expected to testify about 
the november 1986 investigation they conducted that uncovered the 
diversion of armssale profits 
the defense meanwhile indicated that it will call reynolds as 
a witness during the hearing on the immunity question the defense 
wants to show that statements he made to the grand jury were 
influenced by the defendants compelled congressional testimony 
according to court papers 
late friday gesell issued an order blocking a defense attempt 
to subpoena nine members of walshs staff to testify at the hearing 
seven of the prospective trial witnesses are referred to only by 
number because of national security concerns walsh said their 
identities were given privately to the court and the defense 
other top officials on the list include assistant secretary of 
state elliott abrams state department legal adviser abraham sofaer 
and former cia general counsel stanley sporkin now a federal judge 
here 
mcfarlane who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of 
withholding information from congress about covert aid to the 
contras is one of several former national security council 
officials on the list which includes norths former secretary fawn 
hall 
contra leaders adolfo calero and luis alfonse robelo are listed 
along with retired army maj gen john singlaub who helped raise 
private money for the antisandinista cause 
donors ellen garwood william oboyle and c thomas claggett 
jr are listed along with william haskell who owned land in 
central america where an airstrip was built for resupply operations 
also on the list were two conservative fundraisers carl r 
spitz channell and richard miller channell and miller pleaded 
guilty last year to conspiring illegally to use a taxexempt 
foundation to help raise contra money 
the defense indicated it also wanted to call secord and former 
national security council aide kenneth degraffenreid as witnesses 
at next weeks hearing 
walshs office moved to disqualify the defense from calling any 
witnesses on the ground that the lawyers did not meet thursdays 
deadline for notifying the prosecution of the grand jury witness 
they intended to produce at the hearing 
the prosecutor also argued that degraffenreid and secord werent 
grand jury witnesses and therefore couldnt testify at next weeks 
hearing 
the defense apparently wants to put secord on the witness stand 
to show that testimony he gave to congress without immunity was 
based on information he received from hakim who gave closeddoor 
testimony to the congressional committees before the public 
hearings began last spring

the maker of a popular antiacne medication 
that can cause birth defects says it will try once again to devise 
a way to keep women from taking the prescription drug if they are 
pregnant or likely to become pregnant 
the food and drug administration said friday it has convened an 
advisory panel next tuesday to consider reports that more pregnant 
women than previously believed are taking the drug accutane despite 
strict warnings that it is likely to cause birth defects 
short of an outright ban the agency has no way to guarantee the 
drug will not be used by women who are pregnant or become pregnant 
while taking it and there was no indication whether the fda was 
actively considering ordering it off the market 
the new jerseybased maker roche laboratories issued a 
statement late friday saying it will propose a new series of 
safeguards at the tuesday meeting 
it said it will propose tighter restrictions on use of the drug 
in women of childbearing potential and offer to provide 
innovative blisterpackaging to ensure that female patients 
receive the pregnancy warning with every prescription 
the statement did not detail what type of restrictions the 
company will propose for the drug in the united states the drug is 
marketed in 40 countries worldwide 
the warnings accompanying the drug since its introduction in the 
united states in 1982 are explicit dont take the drug if you are 
pregnant and dont get pregnant while you are taking it 
fda spokesman don mclearn said friday the agencys dermatologic 
drugs advisory committee has been asked to review use of accutrane 
because were concerned that a drug is not being used as the 
labeling indicates 
the drug has all sorts of warnings that people who are 
pregnant should not be using it and that the drug is only for a 
very severe form of acne said mclearn its clear that its 
being used for a larger group than that 
dr robert stern a dermatologist from beth israel hospital in 
boston and a member of the advisory panel emphasized that concern 
about the drug does not involve any new scientific discoveries but 
rather new indications that some people are ignoring longstanding 
warnings of those effects 
he said in a telephone interview friday that the newly raised 
concern flows from a study of michigan medicaid figures that 
suggests the frequency of people getting pregnant while on accutane 
may be much higher than anybody thought it was 
however stern said he has substantial questions about the 
accuracy of the projected pregnancy rate since it was based on a 
very specialized population namely people who are already on aid 
to families with dependent children because of prior unintended 
pregnancies 
the question he said is not whether there is a problem but 
how great the problem is for the estimated 1 million people a 
majority of them men who benefit from the drug 
the michigan statistical projection says accutane may have 
caused more than 1000 babies to be born with birth defects in the 
past six years 
the fda has received reports of 62 birth defects associated with 
the drug from the time it came on the market in 1982 but 
scientists believe that may understate the problem simply because 
many side effects from any drug often are unrecognized and 
underreported 
accutane is specifically intended for treatment of severe cystic 
acne a type that often causes severe disfiguring and deep pitting 
scars and sometimes can be treated only with accutane 
since the drug was approved in 1982 the fda and roche a 
division of hoffmannla roche inc have strengthened the warning 
label made repeated mailings of special letters to doctors and 
pharmacists emphasizing the risks and discussed the risks twice in 
the fda drug bulletin that is sent to more than 1 million health 
professionals 
they also have distributed red warning stickers to pharmacists 
to be placed on each prescription bottle

a tiny sample has been cut from the shroud 
of turin for radiocarbondating that may determine whether the 
cloth existed at the time of christs death on the cross the 
vatican announced 
the linen which appears to bear the image of a crucified man 
is venerated by some as christs burial cloth 
the operation eagerly awaited by scientists was carried out 
thursday in turin under the supervision of cardinal anastasio 
ballestrero the roman catholic archbishop of turin italy with 
the collaboration of dr michael tite of the british museum the 
vatican said 
the british museum has agreed to guarantee the scientific 
validity of the carbondating which is to be done independently on 
nuclear atomcounters at oxford the university of arizona and the 
swiss federal institute of technology at the university of zurich 
the vatican which owns the shroud had resisted carbondating 
on grounds it would damage the cloth which is 14 feet 3 inches 
long and 3 feet 7 inches wide but the development in the 1970s of 
an atomcounter known as an accelerator mass spectrometer made it 
possible to date objects with much smaller samples 
the shroud whose history is welldocumented from the mid14th 
century has been kept in the turin cathedral since 1578 
a piece of cloth measuring just 1 centimeter by 7 centimeters 
fourtenths of an inch by 28 inches was cut from the shroud 
then cut further into three samples for the laboratories fridays 
vatican announcement said 
the size of the individual samples was not given but tite has 
previously said each laboratory would receive a 03squareinch 
sample of the shroud 
the vatican said the area of cutting was chosen to guarantee 
that the sample belongs to the principal body of the shroud and 
that the cut would cause the least damage possible to the cloth 
it said the entire operation was videotaped and photographed 
each laboratory will also receive two dummy cloth samples one 
carbondated and the other dated historically but not 
scientifically to see if they get consistent results for all three 
samples the labs are not being told which sample is from the 
shroud the vatican said 
tite has said the triple carbondating should reveal the 
shrouds age within a 200year range the results are expected to 
be announced by summer 
the tests will not prove that the image on the cloth is 
christs but would indicate whether the shroud existed when christ 
was crucified 
the shroud bears a faint yellowish image of both the front and 
back of a mans body stains scientifically identified as blood 
can be seen around the wrists 
believers contend the image was left by a supernatural burst of 
energy accompanying christs resurrection while skeptics claim it 
was painted during the middle ages

nearly 2500 photographs from the robert f 
kennedy assassination file were destroyed because they were 
unneeded duplicates that took up filing space a police spokesman 
says 
commander bill booth responding to questions about the 
destruction disclosed earlier this week said friday the 
explanation came from a retired police officer who was very 
involved in the case 
he declined to give the officers name saying he has been 
retired for some time and is disinclined to get involved 
but he said the man has an independent recollection of 
events relating to the pictures 
in the aftermath of kennedys assassination at the ambassador 
hotel on june 5 1968 he said police took photographs of every 
possible angle of the crime scene 
what happened is there were many hundreds of photographs 
taken thousands of photographs booth said and many copies of 
each photograph were copied for us and for each agency involved 
what were destroyed were superfluous duplicates that amounted 
to a lot of redundancy he said there was no need to keep 
them filing space was a consideration 
the police departments voluminous file on the kennedy 
assassination was released for the first time tuesday and 
california archivist john burns noted a certificate showing that 
2410 photographs were burned by police two months after kennedys 
death 
police earlier had conceded they destroyed ceiling panels and 
part of a door jamb from the kitchen of the ambassador that became 
central to investigation of whether a second gun might have been 
fired at the new york senator 
sirhan sirhan a jordanian immigrant was convicted of murdering 
kennedy and is serving a life term at soledad prison he has said 
he was the lone assassin but insists he has no memory of the actual 
shooting he blames alcohol for his amnesia 
in another development the woman who told police in 1968 that 
she saw a girl in a polkadot dress run from the assassination 
scene declared she had been badgered into recanting her original 
story 
the newly released police files showed that sandra serrano 
withdrew her statement two weeks after the killing saying the 
whole thing was a lie 
but the woman now sandra serranosewell told a radio reporter 
thursday that she was a victim of police harassment 
she had reported seeing a girl in a polka dot dress running from 
the ambassador hotel shouting we shot him we shot him when 
she asked who was shot she said the woman replied senator 
kennedy 
but her retraction of the story led police to cancel a search 
for such a girl the files showed 
in an interview with kuop radio in stockton ms serranosewell 
said there was a lot of badgering that was going on i was just 
20 years old and i became unglued i said what they wanted me 
to say 
asked on friday about the womans statements booth said our 
conclusion was she did not tell the truth when she gave all that 
information the files have to speak for themselves

deaf actress marlee matlin says shes unhappy 
with the way the new york times treated her decision to speak 
without using sign language on the academy awards program 
the times article on april 13 said some people viewed her 
appearance earlier this month as a blow not only to deaf people 
but also to the goal of total communication 
i do not sign and speak simultaneously and when i chose to 
sign alone with an offcamera voice or to speak alone as i did 
on the oscar ceremony telecast i could have potentially ignored 
two major segments of the deaf community those who use speech and 
do not sign and those who sign and do not use speech she wrote 
in a letter to the newspaper published friday 
fortunately the telecast was closed captioned and 
everyone regardless of communication preference had access so 
whats the big fuss the star of children of a lesser god 
closed her letter with a complimentary ps but thank you for 
the nice picture

a reporter and a photographer from a 
florida newspaper were detained for about two hours friday after 
the coast guard said their rented boat entered a restricted area 
near a submarine shipyard 
the reporter denied that the small boat had entered the 
restricted waters which extend 100 feet into the thames river from 
the electric boat shipyard where submarines including 
nuclearpowered tridents are built 
the boat rented by photographer stanley badz and reporter 
michael romaner of the jacksonville timesunion was stopped and 
boarded after it was spotted within the restricted area said coast 
guard lt cmdr james rutkovsky 
also aboard the 18to20foot vessel was kenneth zelvin a 
groton businessman who rents boats rutkovsky said 
we didnt know what we had we didnt know if we had 
terrorists criminals or what said rutkovsky 
rutkovsky said officials were concerned because the trident 
submarine pennsylvania was being prepared for a launch saturday 
the three men denied being in the restricted zone but were 
taken to coast guard headquarters while their stories and 
identities were checked rutkovsky said the procedure took about 
two hours and in the end no charges were filed he said 
we werent anywhere near 100 feet we werent even within 200 
feet romaner said you cant even get a trident into the 
camera lens from that close 
a navy intelligence officer was called in and confiscated the 
photographers film rutkovsky said if no sensitive portions of the 
shipyard were found on the film it would be returned to the 
newspaper 
the newsmen objected to the confiscation and the newspapers 
executive editor fred hartmann tried to stop the confiscation in 
a telephone call to the coast guard romaner said

the concrete and steel rubble from lambiance 
plaza has long been cleared away but the impact of the decades 
most devastating construction accident still is being felt in 
congress 
lawmakers have been pushing for changes in constructionsafety 
laws since the partially built bridgeport conn apartment complex 
collapsed one year ago today leaving 28 workers dead 
proposals have ranged from tinkering with the accident reporting 
requirements and stiffening criminal penalties in fatal 
construction accidents to creating a separate construction agency 
outside the oftencriticized occupational safety and health 
administration 
obviously the price is too high in all the lives lost to ever 
think of it as having a silver lining said rep bruce a 
morrison dconn but given that all of that cant be changed i 
do think it can be used to remind people in congress and remind 
people in osha of problems in the construction industry 
rep christopher shays rconn who was a state representative 
when lambiance collapsed has devoted much of his time to the 
accident since coming to congress to replace the late rep stewart 
b mckinney but the freshman congressman is frustrated at the 
slowmoving gears of congress 
like most victims of crimes you have the victims of 
lambiance who are seeing a fairly unresponsive government or at 
least a government that has responded slowly shays said in an 
interview this week 
morrison said he is drafting legislation to increase criminal 
penalties for contractors convicted in fatal construction 
accidents the current maximum penalty is six months in prison and 
a 10000 fine for willful violation of osha standards 
at the request of lawmakers osha is reviewing whether to change 
its reporting standards under current regulations only accidents 
with a death or at least five injuries have to be reported 
osha critics point to an accident in stamford conn shortly 
before the lambiance collapse that involved the same contractor 
and the same type of problem that investigators say triggered the 
bridgeport accident but the stamford accident went unreported 
because only one worker was injured 
morrison who labeled the current reporting requirements 
absurd believes knowledge of the stamford accident could have 
prevented lambiance 
osha spokesman terry mikelson said the reporting requirement is 
still under review 
the agency also is reviewing its regulations on the liftslab 
construction method used by lambiance builders that was implicated 
in the collapse 
sen lowell p weicker jr rconn is pushing a measure that 
would put the lambiance fines in a special trust fund for the 
victims families weicker fears the heavy fines will drive the 
contractors into bankruptcy making them unable to pay damages that 
could be awarded in pending civil suits 
some lawmakers are embracing the idea of making a separate 
construction division within osha while the aflcio wants to 
create a separate construction agency congressional supporters 
said however that they do not expect action this year 
jim lapping director of safety and health for the aflcio 
building and construction trades department said he does not hold 
out hope for significant changes because of lambiance 
in 78 we had the willow island cooling tower accident in 
west virginia and we had 51 people killed there and nothing came 
out of that lapping said 
such criticism of osha was reignited by the bridgeport collapse 
with charges that the agency has too few inspectors and relies too 
heavily on industry selfregulation 
but osha officials defend their policing policies 
if congress in its vision when it imagined what osha would be 
like wanted an inspector on every job site 24 hours a day it 
would have said so said spokesman mikelson it made employers 
accountable for safety and health knowing full well the government 
wouldnt have inspectors at every site in the country 
mikelson also said osha has made changes in recent years 
including imposing heavier fines such as those at lambiance and 
severely penalizing project contractors when they fail to properly 
oversee subcontractors 
the bottom line is when employers show a strong commitment to 
safety and health workers sustain far fewer injures he said

michael dukakis and jesse jackson are battling gently for the 
democratic presidential nomination trading goodnatured jibes 
about a running mate and saving their potshots for republican vice 
president george bush 
going into the final weekend before pennsylvanias primary 
tuesday the two surviving democratic hopefuls found little to 
disagree about in their first headtohead debate friday night in 
philadelphia 
any combination on this stage against george bush will 
beat the republicans in november said civil rights leader 
jackson 
the two remaining and i guess that makes us the leading 
candidates for the democratic nomination are the son of immigrants 
from massachusetts and a black man who grew up poor in south 
carolina the massachusetts governor told the hourlong debate in 
philadelphia i think that says everything there is to say about 
his country 
bush his nomination victory well in hand spent friday fishing 
in florida 
both democrats headed back out across pennsylvania today 
looking for votes in the tuesday balloting with 178 delegates at 
stake a second debate was scheduled tonight in pittsburgh 
the good humor of the debate sponsored by the pennsylvania 
democratic party stood in sharp contrast to the harsh racial and 
religious overtones of the new york primary only a week ago 
jackson insisted it is a close race for the democratic 
nomination but dukakis is firmly in the frontrunners spot with a 
widening lead in the national delegate battle and a substantial 
edge in the polls for the pennsylvania primary 
who will fill the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket occupied 
much of the debate it has also dominated the democratic campaign 
since dukakis won his big new york victory to become the oddson 
favorite to win the presidential nomination at the party convention 
in atlanta in july 
its a bit premature to be giving out coronation roses for the 
governor and taps for me jackson said when asked if he would 
accept the no 2 spot were now moving into the last lap of a 
significant race and im a longdistance runner i look forward to 
it 
dukakis who has denied even thinking about a running mate then 
turned to jackson and asked softly 
are you interested 
after the audiences laughter subsided jackson smiled and 
replied you got it mike 
dukakis had a curt response to a question of whether he believed 
polls showing jackson as the vice presidential nominee would cost 
democrats the white house in the fall elections no 
jackson drew his share of laughter as well in response to a 
question about how the democrats could win the south in the general 
election 
mike dukakis on my ticket will win the south the 
preacherturnedpolitician said 
the only harsh words of the day were directed at republicans 
first of all the drug program of the reagan administration is 
to have the first lady to say just say no the president to just 
cut the budget and mr bush to just say and do nothing jackson 
said during the debate 
earlier dukakis said bush fails to understand what it takes to 
build an economic future and to create good jobs 
i dont see how we are going to bring good jobs and good wages 
back to the industrial midwest unless we work together dukakis 
said in toledo if the vice president doesnt understand that 
then he shouldnt be running for president 
both men told reporters after the debate that keeping the focus 
on winning in the fall was the correct course 
the only differences between the two in the debate were not 
major ones 
dukakis praised plantclosing legislation saying he had used a 
state law like the one now before congress to save thousands of 
jobs in massachusetts 
jackson said reinvesting in the nation is more important 
he also pressed dukakis seriously on south africa suggesting 
that dukakiss strong stand against terrorism should be applied to 
that nation and its statesponsored terrorism 
i would be very tough on south africa the massachusetts 
governor replied

senate leaders say they wont be pushed into 
approving the ussoviet arms control treaty to meet a white house 
deadline of ratifying the historic pact before president reagans 
trip to moscow in late may 
the senate still needs to nail down answers to questions about 
whether the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty bans 
futuristic weapons as well as existing missiles senate majority 
leader robert byrd dwva said friday 
assurances by the white house and a top soviet official that 
both superpowers agree the treaty does ban future types of weapons 
arent enough said byrd and sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee 
we need to make sure be absolutely clear said nunn 
speaking of the issue of how the pact affects weapons such as 
lasers or particle beam weapons 
byrd told his colleagues i did not set the date of the 
summit i had nothing to do with it this senate is no presidents 
rubber stamp and this senator is no presidents man 
reagan had said thursday that he hopes the pact is approved in 
time for him to take a ratification notice to moscow for his may 
29june 2 meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
reagan asked whether failure to ratify the pact would affect 
the summit said i think it would be very upsetting and it would 
put a strain on the summit 
when the senate finally does vote ratification is likely said 
byrd ratification requires 67 votes and byrd and republican 
leaders have said they believe 90 of the 100 senators will support 
the pact 
nunn said the futuristic weapons issues could be settled by an 
amendment to the pact 
the administration has urged ratification without any amendments 
and will likely portray nunns proposal as a killer amendment 
he said but i dont see this as a killer amendment 
a socalled killer amendment is one attached to a treaty that 
could make it unacceptable to the parties that negotiated the 
agreement and thus kill the treaty 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said the questions should be answered but 
noted there is an advantage to having this ratified before the 
summit begins 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee also said he supports speedy ratification so that we 
can keep this momentum toward arms control 
the treaty would ban nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 
3400 miles

the agriculture department secretly created a 
special drought task force seven weeks ago to keep track of dry 
weather that threatened much of the west 
officials announced friday that the task force was set up by 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng on march 1 and had been 
meeting weekly in his office no mention of the nature of the 
meeting was evident in his published daily schedules or in those of 
senior aides 
but the dry weather has since prompted many reports of drought 
around the country since then and there have been repeated 
references to it in the news media in those affected areas said 
dave lane usda director of information so it was decided to go 
public about usdas task force 
lane defended the secrecy saying it was more of a review of 
the situation than anything else if we had put out some big 
announcement we might have looked like we were trying to pat 
ourselves on the back 
lyng appointed deputy secretary peter c myers as chairman of 
the panel others include heads of usda agencies mostly closely 
associated with farm programs credit and other resources that 
might be needed 
in his statement announcing the task force lyng said that usda 
is stepping up contact with state agriculture departments in the 
affected areas so those can provide us with a constant flow of 
information regarding the moisture situation and preparations for 
relief 
the pacific northwest and other western states which suffered 
through drought last year appear to be the prime regions for 
another drought spell in 1988 with several states reporting 
february and march being the driest on record he said 
conditions likely to cause problems for agricultural producers 
were said to prevail in parts of california nevada oregon 
montana idaho wyoming washington utah and north dakota 
some other states are having extremely dry weather in smaller 
areas raising concerns that forest fires could be severe this year 
lyng said that several of the usda agency administrators report 
that their state and county offices in the dry areas have been 
received numerous inquiries about various federal drought 
assistance programs 
in a related report on the outlook for western water supplies 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said that in march for the second month in a row 
precipitation was well below normal in the west he said parts of 
california and nevada reported the driest february and march 
combination on record 
but some areas improved last month including the pacific 
northwest the western gulf of alaska the northern cascade range 
the coloradowyoming border and most parts of idaho 
idaho reported its first month of aboveaverage precipitation 
in over a year scaling said we are encouraged by that

an investigator who almost became the first 
fbi agent inducted into an organized crime family says he was 
pulled out of the mob by his fbi superiors after being ordered to 
kill a gangster from a rival group 
the fbi felt and so did i that this was a good time for 
getting out because everybody was being killed joseph d 
pistone told senators explaining that he was given the hit 
assignment during a mob civil war 
pistone also told members of the senate permanent subcommittee 
on investigations theres a surprising similarity between the 
structure of organized crime families and terrorist groups 
he said a strict needtoknow policy is enforced and fellow 
mobsters often avoid telling each other their last names 
pistone who spent six years working undercover with the mob 
said he was scheduled to become a made member of new yorks 
bonanno family in december 1981 the fbi abruptly ended his 
operation a halfyear after two bonanno factions began a civil war 
he said 
fbi spokeswoman kathy bradford said that to this day no agent 
has ever become a formal made member of the mob rather than an 
associate 
pistone testified from behind a screen because he has been 
relocated and changed his appearance but he has told his story 
before in court testimony and in a book on his six years posing as 
a smalltime but successful jewel thief and burglar donnie brasco 
pistones testimony in trials resulted in more than 200 
indictments and more than 100 convictions of organized crime 
members 
explaining the workings of mob families pistone said there 
is a surprising similarity which marks the innerworkings of the 
mafia and contemporary terrorist organizations 
the families are broken down into small separate cells 
commonly called crews 
in all likelihood a member of one crew may not even know who 
are the members of another crew in his own family 
he said gambling is probably the most important source of 
income for traditional organized crime families gambling 
supports other mob activities such as drug buys payoffs lawyers 
fees and investments into legitimate businesses he said

industries trying to capitalize on 
superconducting technology will get help from three federal 
research facilities under a program announced by the energy 
department 
the argonne national laboratory in illinois los alamos national 
laboratory in new mexico and oak ridge national laboratory in 
tennessee were designated on friday as special pilot centers 
energy secretary john s herrington said 
the centers he said will collaborate with industry on 
applications of the technology gleaned from basic energy research 
president reagan last year outlined a program last year under 
which government and industry will work together to find commercial 
uses for hightemperature superconductors which can conduct 
electricity without energy loss 
superconductors have great potential in such areas as 
electrical generation storage and transmission computers 
communications medical diagnostics and transportation the 
energy department said however the newly discovered materials 
will require extensive research and development 
all three laboratories have been active in superconductivity 
research and have the facilities and expertise needed to make the 
technology marketable herrington said

the head of the coast guard says severe 
cutbacks in air and sea drug patrols by the financially strapped 
agency could be leading to an increase in drug trafficking along 
us coasts 
the smugglers when they ship dont send us an invoice 
said adm paul a yost jr but we do have intelligence that 
indicates the awareness by the smugglers that the coast guard has 
cut back its patrols by ship and by air 
i can only surmise that that influences their shipping 
schedules and that there is some intention of taking advantage 
of that he said 
the coast guard faced with a 100 million budget shortfall 
earlier this year permanently shut down dozens of stations 
resulting in 40 million in savings 
to cover the remaining 60 million yost ordered a 55 percent 
acrosstheboard reduction of sea and air missions for drug 
interdiction and routine searchandrescue patrols the cutbacks 
have been in effect for about three months 
fiftyfive percent of my ships are sitting alongside the dock 
and planes are on the runways the commandant said in interviews 
this week with the associated press 
i think thats a travesty he said i really think the 
american people having paid money for the ships and aircraft and 
paying the salary of the young men and women who theyve 
trained to do these jobs to have them sitting on the runway and 
tied up at the dock that ought to make the taxpayer angry 
last month president reagan urged congress to transfer 60 
million in other transportation department funds such as amtrak 
mass transit and highway projects to the coast guard to bring the 
patrols back up to last years levels but congress has yet to act 
yost said he believes he is caught in the middle of two 
political realities on capitol hill and that he is coming out on 
the short end 
what i see there is every member of congress hates drugs and 
supports and loves the coast guard particularly members of our 
appropriations subcommittees yost said but they are forced to 
choose between drug interdiction and mass transit projects in 
their districts 
i would guess very few of those members are saying take my 
money he said 
yost said he sympathized with the chairmen of the transportation 
funding panels sen frank lautenberg dnj and rep bill 
lehman dfla 
theyre both strong supporters of the coast guard and yet 
they have a very difficult time taking money from their grant 
programs to properly fund the coast guard he said 
a lehman aide said the house subcommittee may take up the coast 
guards funding request this week

rep melvin price an illinois democrat 
elected in the waning days of world war ii who rose to second in 
house seniority was remembered at his death as a loyal servant to 
his constituents and a strong advocate for the nations military 
price 83 died friday of cancer at malcolm grove hospital at 
andrews air force base he was serving his 22nd term in congress a 
tenure surpassed only by 24term rep jamie whitten dmass 
price who had announced two years ago this would be his last 
term in the house for 10 years chaired the chambers armed 
services committee he was ousted from that post in january 1985 by 
younger democrats seeking a more vigorous watchdog on the reagan 
administrations military policies 
during his tenure as head of the committee price had presided 
over the drive to beef up the nations arms stockpile with the mx 
missile the b1 bomber a nuclear aircraft carrier and a vast 
array of other hardware 
a proposed amendment to the pentagon budget bill pending in the 
house would name a new trident missilefiring submarine for price 
he considered himself a staunch supporter of administration 
requests for military spending regardless of which party was in 
power acknowledging the committee under his aegis was somewhat of 
a rubber stamp for the pentagon 
in many ways it is price once said id rather be 
criticized for being for something than have to alibi when we need 
it and we dont have it 
rep les aspin dwis who replaced price as chairman of armed 
services called him a fair evenhanded thoughtful member with 
a quiet grace that will be missed around congress 
price had suffered in recent years from arthritis and diabetes 
and learned in the last month that he had pancreatic cancer said 
administrative assistant mike mansfield he went to the hospital 
early friday complaining of pain and died in the early evening 
price who had been a sports writer in the 1920s grew up along 
the banks of the mississippi river in east st louis he came to 
congress as an aide at the start of the new deal and won election 
while serving as an enlisted man in the army 
he took office in 1945 as the red army was closing in on adolph 
hitlers bunker 
illinois two democratic senators said prices impact on his 
state and on the nations military would continue 
mel price was a man of the people who kept a common touch 
after reaching great heights he moved from being an army corporal 
to contributing in a major way to the nations defense said sen 
paul simon 
sen alan dixon said price had absolutely no peer in service 
to his constituency he was my mentor and close personal friend my 
deepest sympathies are with his wife today 
illinois gov james r thompson a republican said mel price 
dedicated his life to serving the people of southwestern illinois 
and he became one of the most powerful people in congress 
the people of his district will miss representative price but 
the evidence of his dedication is clearly visible throughout the 
towns and villages of that area thompson said 
price himself a victim of ouster from the armed services panel 
by younger lawmakers first was selected to chair the panel in 1974 
when junior lawmakers rebelled against rep f edward herbert 
dla whom they considered too autocratic 
he continued to serve as chairman of the panels research and 
development subcommittee even after his ouster from the committees 
top position but in his later years suffered from severe arthritis

new rules regulating the hoof pads used on 
tennessee walking horses and other show horses take effect monday 
in an effort to prevent the use of cruel methods to give the 
animals a distinctive gait 
the agriculture department regulations will be phased in 
gradually to prevent trauma to show horses many of which currently 
have pads that are four inches high said james w glosser acting 
administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service 
to remove fourinch pads abruptly could cause stress on a 
horses feet and limbs he said 
from april 25 through july 31 pads may be no more than three 
inches high from aug 1 through oct 31 two inches and 
effective nov 1 no more than onehalf inch high covering the sole 
of the foot 
at that time however an additional halfinchhigh rim pad 
will be allowed between the full pad and the shoe all pads must be 
made of leather or other similar soft pliable material 
glosser said the new rules prohibit chains or rollers that weigh 
more than six ounces including the weight of the fastener weights 
on the hoof other than the specified pads are also prohibited 
except for horseshoes weighing up to 16 ounces 
the horse protection act was passed in 1970 to eliminate the 
practice of soring to produce special gaits in horses 
soring is the use of cruel methods devices or chemical 
substances on a horses legs or feet that can reasonably be 
expected to cause a horse to experience pain when walking the 
agency said in its statement soring is done primarily to alter a 
horses gait in the show ring 
the new interim rules apply to all breeds of horses at shows or 
sales the agency said 
agency officials will continue to monitor horse shows and work 
with the industry to prevent soring he said 
if we find sored horses we will take action against the 
responsible parties regardless of the devices used glosser said 
on march 21 a us district court here in a lawsuit brought 
against usda by the american horse protection association 
invalidated certain sections of the departments horse protection 
regulations 
in the court order and a clarifying order issued april 13 the 
court directed usda to initiate rulemaking to eliminate devices 
that could reasonably be expected to cause soring the agency said 
the court specifically referred to pads and chains used on the 
front feet and legs of horses to alter their gaits

college students in 10 states and three 
countries are linking up by computer to simulate global bargaining 
for peace but theyre finding makebelieve hostilities are often 
as touchy as in real life 
in the first few days of the exercise this semester iran 
rejected iraqs offer to end their war as treachery and the 
soviet union dispatched a flurry of communiques calling the united 
states offensive 
the 700 students are playing diplomat as part of the 
international communication and negotiation simulations program 
based at the university of maryland 
were not doing an adequate job in american education of 
teaching how to live and function in an interdependent world 
said jonathan wilkenfeld a government and politics professor at 
the college who codirects the program its only been in recent 
years that we have discovered a need to become more of a part of 
issues that other countries find important 
one scenario envisioned by the students who work six months in 
the future proved all too real 
we assassinated egyptian president anwar sadat about three 
months before it really happened said wilkenfeld who encourages 
students to seek solutions through peaceful negotiation we felt 
badly about that 
icons began in 1981 with a grant from the us education 
department in its early days the program involved three or four 
universities this semester 15 universities are participating 
through computer links from the university of maryland to 
tennessee new jersey north carolina california pennsylvania 
utah vermont wyoming and wisconsin 
the computer also links american students to others in france 
argentina and japan messages during the fiveweek simulation often 
are sent in foreign languages and must be translated with care so 
sensitive correspondence is not misunderstood with students living 
in various time zones setting up computer conferences often 
becomes a logistical nightmare 
the simulations are based on a scenario of world events written 
before the game begins each semester the scenario takes whats 
happening in the world and projects it six to eight months ahead 
bass said that way students are not tempted to read newspapers 
and magazines looking for negotiating tips and strategies she said 
in the first few days of this semesters simulation the 
soviets played by students at brigham young university in provo 
utah sent out more than 100 messages said doreen bass simulation 
director and a member of the university of marylands research 
faculty 
a lot of it was cold war rhetoric and the united states 
students at maryland sent a response saying it was not pleased 
with what it called propaganda bass said 
two days later the soviets rebutted 
the soviet leadership and people were deeply wounded and 
pained by the offensive and insensitive communique received from 
the united states this week the brigham young team wrote we 
are all concerned and troubled to find that the cold war still 
rages in the hearts of american leaders 
meanwhile the iranian team played by a different group of 
maryland students was busy composing a reply to the iraqi teams 
offer to terminate its involvement in the iraniraq war 
iraq sent out a message saying they were unilaterally 
withdrawing from the war returning all iranian pows returning all 
borders to original prewar positions said adam pinchuck a 
member of the iranian team we flatly rejected it and said it was 
filled with duplicity and treachery and horrific lies

a japanese man linked by authorities to the 
terrorist red army has been indicted for carrying pipe bombs on the 
new jersey turnpike officials said 
yu kikumura 35 was charged with three counts of interstate 
transport of explosive devices three counts of possessing 
unregistered explosive devices and three counts of possession of 
explosives by an illegal alien us attorney samuel a alito jr 
said friday 
kikumura identified by the japanese foreign ministry as a 
suspected member of the terrorist red army group also was charged 
with one count each of having an illegal passport a fraudulent 
visa and the passport of another person alito said 
the charges together carry a prison term of up to 90 years 
police in milan italy said thursday that kikumura spent a few 
days in a city hotel in february prior to an april 14 car bombing 
allegedly staged by the red army the blast killed an american 
servicewoman and four italians outside a uso club in naples 
fbi experts haved traveled to italy to try to determine whether 
kikumura was linked to those involved in the bombing 
he was arrested april 12 at a service area on the turnpike in 
ridgefield after a state trooper found the sophisticated homemade 
bombs and falsified papers authorities said 
officials said kikumura used a passport stolen from a japanese 
hospital worker to obtain a us entry visa from the us embassy 
in paris on feb 29 he entered the country on march 8 authorities 
said 
ronald kuby who along with noted radical defense attorney 
william kunstler is defending kikumura said he found the number of 
charges incredible 
youve taken a straightforward single offense multiplied it 
pyramided it until you face a century in jail kuby said 
comparing it to a person arrested for distributing drugs and facing 
a separate count for each unit of the drug sold 
he is being indicted for what the government thinks he is 
rather than what he has done kuby said 
kikumura is being held without bail in the metropolitan 
correctional center in new york without bail 
alito said he is to be arraigned next friday in newark before 
us district judge alfred j lechner jr

jesse jackson said following his first 
oneonone debate with michael dukakis the presidential campaign 
has begun a new phase in which differences between the two 
democrats will be more clearly spelled out 
pressed by reporters about differences between the two remaining 
democratic contenders jackson said friday nigt dukakis has not 
been forthcoming in detailing how he would translate his 
massachusetts miracle into solutions to aid the nations 
economy 
as massachusetts governor dukakis takes much of the credit for 
his states 29 percent unemployment rate its plantclosings 
notice law and americas first universal healthinsurance law 
but jackson speaking at the university of pennsylvania four 
days before the states primary said dukakis so far has made out 
no budget 
there must be some budget in order to establish priorities in 
order to establish the plan jackson said 
you simply cannot afford a decent job for everybody at good 
wages and you cannot afford houses for everybody in this country 
unless you are going to make some judgments about shifting 
priorities jackson said im willing to debate ways to pay for 
the dream 
jackson said he has called for a plan to freeze the military 
budget over the next five years and that i have put forth a 
comprehensive plan to fight the war on drugs the governor has 
not 
still jackson said he was wary of fracturing the party and 
said he hoped there could be distinction without division 
jackson spoke to reporters after a goodnatured hourlong 
debate with dukakis their first such confrontation since tennessee 
sen albert gore jr dropped out of the race after the new york 
primary on tuesday 
another debate was planned for tonight in pittsburgh where 
jacksons support is shakier than in philadelphia in philadelphia 
jackson has the support of the mayor and numerous other local 
elected officials 
later friday night jackson told a rocking congregation at the 
calvin presbyterian church in west philadelphia that the debate 
begins a new phase of the campaign in which a less crowded 
field will enable voters to become more familiar with individual 
candidates 
he was flanked at the podium by his mother helen mayor w 
wilson goode councilman lucien blackwell state rep david 
richardson of philadelphia and actress margot kidder a supporter 
who has joined jackson previously on the campaign trail 
earlier jackson addressed students at nearby west chester state 
university and announced a plan and a budget for a national 
childcare program with a 53 billion price tag 
the plan calls for an increase in childcare assistance for 
families with low and moderate incomes and a strategy to use public

the roman catholic church is calling 
on the united states to lift economic sanctions imposed in an 
attempt to oust gen manuel antonio noriega it says panama has 
suffered enough 
we cannot continue like this the church hierarchy lamented 
in an eightpage pastoral letter made public friday 
the letter says the economic crisis brought on by the sanctions 
has meant misery and desperation for thousands of panamanians 
and sparked an exodus that is beginning to have worrisome 
dimensions 
the letter signed by archbishop marcos g mcgrath and the 
nations 10 bishops also expressed concern about rising crime and 
worry that the nation is being turned into a sinister battle 
camp 
noriega panamas de facto leader and head of its 15000strong 
defense forces was indicted in florida on federal drug trafficking 
charges in february the sanctions imposed since froze panamanian 
assets in the united states and barred payments to the 
noriegacontrolled administration by us citizens and 
organizations 
combined with closures of the banks and a twoweek strike in 
march the measures have brought panamas economy to a virtual 
standstill 
in its letter the church says the sanctions have dealt a blow 
to all panamanians but especially to the poorest 
it said the measures exceed any strategy of political pressure 
and constitute by themselves a threat to the life of our people 
they are therefore morally unjust because of that we demand 
that they be suspended immediately in the same way we reject all 
forms of military intervention 
the church described as the gravest part of the situation 
the lack of dialogue between the government and noriegas 
opponents it urged both sides to negotiate and end to the crisis 
and said it was willing to mediate the dispute 
the church agreed at the end of march to mediate talks between 
the two sides but suspended the effort a week later 
financial analysts meanwhile said the government was looking 
for an international organization to step in and help it process a 
backlog of checks accumulated during the bank shutdown 
the government has been frustrated in its efforts to arrange a 
clearinghouse operation with a private european or a latin 
american bank 
a financial analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the government was turning to an international organization because 
it would be beyond the scope of any in the united states 
it was not clear which international organization would have the 
capability to act as a bank and process the thousands of 
accumulated checks 
banks closed the first week of march after customers began a run 
on some local institutions the run was touched off when president 
eric arturo delvalle was deposed feb 26 after he tried to fire 
noriega

there had been reports yegor k ligachev was 
demoted as the kremlins no 2 man for defiance in resisting soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for reform 
but friday the two chatted amiably during a ceremony at the 
kremlins palace of congresses the display of unity was witnessed 
by thousands inside the building and millions of television viewers 
ligachevs fate and relationship with gorbachev have been 
subjects of gossip and debate in official and intellectual circles 
since a newspaper published a letter to the editor a month ago 
defending dictator josef stalin 
ligachev 67 is known to promote more restrained reform than 
gorbachevs plan for a restructuring soviet society so there was 
speculation he was behind the letter in sovietskaya rossiya 
it appeared in the name of a leningrad teacher and was 
interpreted as a sign conservative opposition to gorbachev was 
gaining strength 
pravda later excoriated the prostalin letter the communist 
party daily made clear that the glasnost policy of more 
openness does not authorize opposition to perestroika 
gorbachevs word for his reform program 
in moscow the newspaper exchange was seen as an allegory for 
the struggle between gorbachev and ligachev 
some sources report that gorbachev called a special meeting of 
the politburo to reprimand ligachev for opposing his reforms and 
that his responsibility for ideology and party personnel were given 
to alexander n yakovlev a politburo member who is a staunch 
gorbachev ally 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze held a news conference 
friday night and told reporters there were no serious disagreements 
in the leadership 
sometimes we differ but this is only an indication of the fact 
that our society is undergoing a process of democratization he 
said there is no sign of any conflict situation 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev was asked about the 
rumors earlier in the day and said there has been no change in 
the distribution of duties among party leaders 
perfiliev appeared unsure of ligachevs status however and 
said he thought the no 2 man was on a short vacation 
when the politburo filed into the kremlin hall friday to mark 
the 118th anniversary of vladimir lenins birth ligachev had the 
position accorded the chief ideologist and secondranking leader 
after gorbachev president andrei a gromyko and premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov 
several shots on television showed ligachev and gorbachev in 
animated conversation while nonvoting politburo member georgy p 
razumovsky spoke for nearly an hour about perestroikas merits 
gorbachev and supporters of his reforms have acknowledged 
resistance at the highest levels but have not named their opponents 
ligachev was elevated to the politburo after gorbachev now 57 
became communist party chief in march 1985 
his speeches have shown him to be more conservative than 
gorbachev he is reported to feel glasnost has gone too far in 
denouncing most economic and social policies of the past 
ligachev was made a full politburo member in april 1985 at the 
first central committee meeting under gorbachev without having 
served the customary term as a nonvoting member

the reagan administration will ask congress to 
transfer administration of the federal family planning program from 
the department of health and human services to the states 
assistant hhs secretary robert windom said friday the shift 
would enable states to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring 
services to more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens 
family planning needs 
in testimony to the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
health windom said a federal ban on use of funds for 
abortionrelated services and priority on serving lowincome 
families would be retained 
windom said that by running their own programs states could not 
only improve services but could also avoid burdensome

president reagan signed a bill designed to 
police mislabeled drugs but said he will seek repeal of a 
provision requiring states to follow federal standards in licensing 
wholesale drug distributors 
i support the expressed goal of this legislation which is to 
reduce potential public health risks that may result from the 
distribution of mislabeled subpotent counterfeit or adulterated 
prescriptions drugs the president said friday 
but he said the portion requiring federal standards to be 
adhered to in licensing drug wholesalers represents a substantial 
intrusion into traditional state responsibilities and 
prerogatives 
he said he asked the department of justice to submit legislation 
to the congress repealing that portion of the bill

the womens softball game between the university 
of massachusetts and boston college lasted only an inning before 
the contest was suspended because of unsafe playing conditions 
it wasnt lightning or high wind that sent the players back to 
the locker room just a case of flying hammers 
it seems some of the hammer throwers competing in the boston 
college relays adjacent to the softball diamond were a bit off 
target 
before play began thursday base umpires told the coaches that 
they would keep an eye out for errant hammers said massachusetts 
coach elaine sortino 
they told us to advise our outfielders that when they yelled 
heads up the outfielders were to start running towards home 
plate she said friday 
however when three 16pound weights plunked into the outfield 
without a yip and between innings a fourth landed right where 
a fielder would be standing sortino said she decided my 
players arent going out there 
the officials tried to persuade us to play an inning and then 
let the hammer throwers take some throws and then play another 
inning but there were skads of them it was freezing cold already 
late and it would have gone on forever said sortino whose 
protest prompted the umpires to suspend the game 
some 25 men and 25 women hammer throwers with three throws 
each competed said reid oslin assistant athletic director at 
boston college 
we never had anything like this happen before oslin said 
we host one major track meet a year and we will never again 
schedule a softball game at the same time

that opinion didnt last long after bivens 30 finished his 
training and they were put on the same detail 
once we started working together he realized i was all right 
we got to be real good friends mrs bivens said 
she earned my respect said bivens ive worked on chicago 
expressway details state fairs and shes one of the best 
policemen ive ever worked with

not just their good side he added when you see them hot and 
sweaty directing traffic or handling a fatality you get a true 
picture of them

any situation that arises 
naturally theres concern if you love someone but really she 
does a good job bivens said

former archbishop of canterbury lord ramsey a 
kindly craggy christian and brilliant debater who traveled the 
world in his passion to unite its divided churches died early 
today the church of england said he was 83 
ramsey was president of the world council of churches from 1961 
to 1968 
the church press office said in a statement that he died at st 
johns home a residence for elderly people in oxford after being 
ill for several weeks with bronchial pneumonia 
his wife lady ramsey was at his side when he died peacefully 
at about 2 am 9 pm edt friday 
as archbishop of canterbury from 1961 to 1974 he was spiritual 
head of the church of england and leader of the worlds 70 million 
anglicans including the 3 million us episcopalians 
ramsey took a liberal stand on a wide variety of political and 
social issues of his day 
he condemned the us bombing of north vietnam during the 
vietnam war called for britain to discard its nuclear weapons 
unilaterally and campaigned for relaxation of the laws restricting 
homosexuality divorce and abortion 
ramsey demanded the abolition of the death penalty was an 
outspoken opponent of south africas apartheid policy of racial 
separation and opposed restrictions on the admission of asian 
immigrants into britain 
at his enthronement as archbishop of canterbury ramsey 
described his objectives as the unity of christians 
the church of england was at the time in process of a long 
decline with dwindling church attendance and a diminishing role in 
the everyday lives of ordinary britons 
but ramsey pushed the church toward christian reunion which he 
predicted might come about before the end of this century and made 
it aware of the world beyond england 
his passion to reunite the christian churches the 
nonconformist the anglican the eastern orthodox and the roman 
catholic divided over the centuries took him to more countries 
than any other archbishop of canterbury before him 
ramsey was bitterly disappointed when the general synod of the 
church of england in 1972 rejected union with the methodists 
his air of craggy christian kindness as one newspaper described 
it inspired trust and confidence among those who met him 
michael ramsey was born on nov 14 1904 the son of a lecturer 
in mathematics at cambridge university his paternal grandfather 
was a congregationalist minister and his maternal grandfather was 
an anglican clergyman

1974 and took the title of lord ramsey of canterbury 
he was succeeded by donald coggan who retired from the post in 
1980 the current archbishop of canterbury is robert runcie 
a funeral service for ramsey will be held in historic canterbury 
cathedral in southeast england and a memorial service is also 
planned at londons westminster abbey the statement said no dates

increasing racial tensions on campus 
in recent years can be partly blamed on the selfcentered 
ethics of students in the 1980s educators and students were told 
at a conference 
not only have colleges failed to teach students about ethics 
but the reagan administration has undermined gains in civil rights 
contributing to a rise in racism sexism and homophobia on 
campuses some educators said 
theres been a reversal in students from the 1960s said 
kenneth b clark a psychologist and professor emeritus at the city 
university of new york who has researched the effects of 
segregation on children they are more selfcentered and less 
socially conscious 
the conference at rutgers university was attended friday by more 
than 250 teachers administrators and students from about 30 new 
jersey colleges sponsored by the state department of higher 
education and the national conference of christians and jews its 
intent was to alert college leaders to the problems of intolerance 
and suggest possible solutions 
but the educators said recent student protests over minority 
concerns at a number of colleges nationwide were encouraging 
in part its a good thing in the sense that it reflects a 
determination by minority kids not to take this treatment said 
meyer weinberg professor of education at the university of 
massachusetts at amherst where students occupied an administration 
building in february to protest campus racism 
those who attended the conference were treated to their own bit 
of protest when a group of student demonstrators took the stage 
even though the states chancellor of higher education t edward 
hollander refused them permission to speak 
hollander said later he was delighted to see them insist on 
speaking out 
ive waited 10 years for students to show that kind of 
interest he said 
hollander said organizers asked colleges to send students and 
officials to the conference who hold the power to make campuses 
aware of the states effort to curb intolerance 
the protesters spoke up after the keynote speech by mayor henry 
cisneros of san antonio they criticized the pace of reform and 
said conference organizers failed to invite student and community 
activists 
we feel this is just a pr event to appease the community and 
falsely give the sense that the colleges are resolving racist 
relationships said salaam ismail coordinator of the union of 
african organizations of students which represents colleges 
statewide 
the protesters had kind words for cisneros mayor since 1981 
who urged administrators to preach against intolerance and ensure 
that graduates are able to contribute to a diverse society 
he said changing demographics rising immigration from central 
america competition from asian countries and a stagnant economy 
require that americans work together in a spirit of cooperation 
cisneros said students should gain an education in reality 
by volunteering for community service and that universities should 
strive to develop minority leaders 
earlier friday in williamstown mass about 30 minority 
students took over a deans office at williams college 
a spokesman for the protesters said that black hispanic asian 
and polynesian students occupied jenness house to protest what they 
say is the administrations unwillingness to address minority 
concerns at the prestigious liberal arts college 
also friday a group of minority students and university of 
vermont officials reached agreement to end the students fourday 
occupation of the college presidents office the agreement calls 
for the university to increase the number of minority faculty 
members and students

a state district judge has ruled that walker 
railey a former prominent methodist minister maliciously and 
brutally tried to strangle his wife in an attack that left her in 
a coma 
judge john whittington issued the judgment friday in a civil 
lawsuit filed by peggy raileys mother billie jo nicolai 
whittington quoting from the lawsuit also ruled railey 
established a false alibi to cover his actions 
the default judgment was announced a year and a day after mrs 
railey 39 was found lying unconscious on her garage floor she 
has been comatose since the attack 
although he was served twice with the suit railey 40 never 
responded in court to the allegation that he attacked his wife 
though he has denied it out of court 
if you bring allegations against the defendant and you give 
the defendant notice of the allegations and an opportunity to come 
in and respond to those allegations and he refuses to do that the 
court can hold the defendant liable and hold those allegations as 
true said bill arnold mrs nicolais attorney 
arnold said a jury trial should determine this summer the 
damages railey will be ordered to pay arnold said he will seek 
actual damages for mrs raileys past and future medical bills and 
punitive damages for the pain and suffering of mrs railey and her 
family 
railey the former senior minister at dallas first united 
methodist church has said he was doing research on the southern 
methodist university campus the night his wife was attacked 
after a suicide attempt following the attack railey refused to 
talk with police and refused to answer questions before a grand 
jury investigating the attack 
railey surrendered his ministerial credentials and moved to san 
francisco where he rented an apartment with lucy papillon a 
psychologist who told a grand jury she had been seeing railey 
before the attack and that they had discussed marriage 
the raileys two children are living with family friends in 
dallas 
in his findings of fact whittington wrote that on or 
about april 21 1987 the defendant walker l railey intentionally 
knowingly maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife 
peggy railey to death 
the court further finds the defendant then left mrs railey 
for dead left his two young children ryan age 5 and megan age 
2 alone in the house without supervision and drove to the 
fondren library at southern methodist university in an attempt to 
conceal his actions and to establish a false alibi for his 
wherabouts at the time of the assault the judge wrote 
my clients are very pleased said arnold who plans to 
subpoena railey for the trial and seek a warrant for his arrest 
raileys attorney doug mulder was not in his office or at home 
when phoned for comment and did return messages 
the civil judgment has no bearing on a criminal investigation 
that officials say is stalled because of insufficient evidence 
railey has not been charged with any crime but his attorney 
identified him as the chief suspect in the case 
investigators say they believe railey is now in the los angeles 
area

fires set around the world to clear forests 
and agricultural fields may cause longterm damage to the 
environment including depletion of the earths ozone layer nasa 
researchers say 
such biomass burning once was considered insignificant as a 
global hazard said dr joel levine a senior research scientist at 
the national aeronautics and space administrations langley 
research center 
concern about ozone depletion has focused on products of 
industrialized nations such as chlorofluorocarbons released from 
aerosol sprays refrigeration equipment and in the manufacture of 
foam plastic containers 
but levine said third world countries where outdoor burning is 
common also may be contributing heavily to ozone depletion and the 
creation of the socalled greenhouse effect in which certain gases 
in the atmosphere are believed to be raising temperatures on earth 
the conclusion of this work is that on the global scale the 
burning of forests and the burning of agricultural fields is a 
very very significant source of the most environmentally 
significant gases he told the richmond timesdispatch these 
include nitrous oxide nitric oxide carbon dioxide methane and 
carbon monoxide 
this could have important implications for ozone depletion 
since nitrogen oxides are believed responsible for about 70 percent 
of the ozone destroyed in the stratosphere levine said 
by comparison chlorofluorocarbons and other manmade chlorine 
gases account for less than 10 percent of the ozone destruction he 
said 
a nasa team headed by levine and atmospheric scientist wesley 
cofer iii is studying the extent and the content of fires to 
determine their possible effects on the environment 
the national academy of sciences has estimated that 25 percent 
of the earths land surface is burned each year a far greater mass 
than thought a decade or so ago 
levine said satellite photos obtained from the department of 
defense show that 5 percent may be a conservative estimate the 
nighttime photos taken during the early and mid1970s and 
recently declassified reveal clusters of lights across sparsely 
populated territory such as central africa 
these lights represent fires levine believes by reviewing 
hundreds of such photos this summer levine said the team hopes to 
more closely determine the extent of burning 
the researchers have studied individual fires in california 
florida canada and elsewhere to determine the composition of smoke 
and gauge the effect fires have on soil researchers found that 
emissions of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from the soil increased 
tenfold after the fires 
the soil emissions are released by microbes tiny organisms that 
find a feast of nutrients in the ash from the fires said 
microbiologist penelope boston 
ozone protects the earth from the suns harmful ultraviolet 
rays scientists say ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth could 
increase 5 percent to 20 percent by the early 21st century 
potential hazards include increases in skin cancer rates and damage 
to eyes 
biomass burning may have a similar effect in producing 
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide 
levine said 
greenhouse gases trap infrared heat in the earths atmosphere 
leading to global warming that could melt ice at the north and 
south poles and lead to flooding of lowlying coastal areas

the ptl television ministry says a 
decision by the internal revenue service to revoke its taxexempt 
status wont bring an immediate drop in donations to the 
financially troubled organization 
however ptl officials who are trying to reorganize the 
ministry in us bankruptcy court here have said the taxexempt 
status is essential to ptls survival because it depends on 
taxdeductible contributions to operate 
the announcement friday by the irs office in atlanta follows a 
federal appeals court ruling wednesday dissolving a preliminary 
injunction that had prevented the irs from revoking the taxexempt 
status 
we felt the organization has not operated within the 
guidelines in its original charter said les witmer a 
spokesman for the irs regional office 
david clark ptls courtappointed trustee was not immediately 
available for comment ptl spokeswoman linda ivey said but ms 
ivey said the ministry did not expect any immediate impact on 
donations 
the bulk of our support comes from people who are able to give 
no more than 15 and 20 a month and theyre not losing a tax 
deduction at least not right away she said 
ptl already has applied for a new taxexempt charter and hopes 
to be without the status of a nonprofit corporation only for a 
brief time assistant us trustee joseph buzhardt whose office 
is administering the reorganization said after the irs ruling 
friday 
the irs claims ptl owes more than 55 million in taxes from june 
1983 to june 1987 the month ptl filed for protection from 
creditors because of 72 million in debt not counting the irs 
claim 
the revocation is based on the irs examination of ptls records 
in bankruptcy court witmer said ptl had excessive unrelated 
business income or income which was not really in keeping with the 
taxexempt purpose he said 
an irs report in december concluded that ptl founders jim and 
tammy faye bakker and their aides profited excessively from 
donations to the ministry in addition the irs held that much of 
ptls heritage usa theme park operations in fort mill were 
commercial rather than ministerial 
the bakkers received 107 million in their last seven years 
with the ministry 94 million of which was excessive and 
unreasonable the irs report said 
bakker resigned march 19 1987 when a story was about to break 
that he had had sex with former church secretary jessica hahn in 
1980 and that the ministry had paid her 265000 in hush money 
a call to the bakkers home in palm springs calif was 
answered by a recording a request for comment was not returned 
an irs statement said the agency can no longer assure 
taxpayers of the deductibility of contributions to ptl however 
it said past contributions are fully deductible 
on wednesday the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond 
va affirmed a lower court ruling that the bankruptcy court did 
not have the authority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing 
the irs from revoking the ministrys taxexempt status 
clark said the ministry may appeal if so contributions by 
individuals would still be deductible up to 1000 until the appeal 
is decided the irs said 
the government appealed the ptl reorganization plan approved 
dec 29 by the bankruptcy court in columbia and still opposes it 
the plan which anticipated ptl would remain tax exempt divides 
the ministry into nonprofit and forprofit corporations

acquitted by reason of insanity after her lawyers argued she 
suffered from severe postpartum depression michelle remington 29

kill herself 
depaola said his client had been on an emotional roller 
coaster since 1984 among her problems were an accidental

three elementary school students who were 
following their fathers profession of street preaching were 
suspended for disruptive behavior after they allegedly shouted at 
other students and called teachers whoremongers 
duffy strode 10 was suspended for five days while pepper 
strode 7 and matthew strode 5 were suspended for three days 
i have pled with this man school superintendent david 
ricketts said of the childrens father david strode weve given 
them every opportunity to comply with the rules this is the fourth 
or fifth violation 
i know it looks crazy to suspend the kindergartner but the 
preaching is not the issue ricketts said 
strode said the children are not disruptive that they are 
just preaching scripture 
eastfield elementary principal jim gorst said the words may be 
scriptural but refererences to his teachers as whoremongers had 
created some stress the scripture the children are using is 
hebrews 134 which says marriage is honorable in all and the 
bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge 
the students who were suspended thursday returned to their 
preaching just outside the school gates twice friday but the 
appearance of an officer from the mcdowell county sheriffs 
department requested by gorst ended the preaching 
gorst said it was the first time in his seven years as principal 
he had suspended a kindergartner 
gorst said the two boys and their sister were suspended for 
disruptive behavior and refusing to come into the school building 
between 730 am and 8 am thursday 
the children he said were screaming they were just 
screaming at people 
david stroke said he had contacted an attorney 
they may be within their rights strode said of school 
officials suspension of the chidren if they are well just 
have to take it 
school board attorney penn dameron who had witnessed earlier 
preaching by the children said he found it disruptive 
the children who are being yelled at were clearly disturbed 
dameron said eastfield has a policy against disruptive behavior 
and if children are being upset we have to treat it as disruptive 
behavior

mick jagger halfsang halfspoke some 
of the rolling stones greatest hits from the witness stand as he 
tried to prove he didnt steal a song from a reggae musician 
jagger swayed to the beat and came close to singing friday as he 
recited for a judge jury and fans who packed the courtroom 
jumpin jack flash its a gas gas gas 
jagger was trying to show how he uses repetition in his lyrics 
as part of his defense against a charge by patrick alley who is 
suing for copyright infringement claiming jaggers 1985 solo hit 
just another night was copied from his 1979 song of the same 
name 
the choruses in both songs use the phrase just another night 
repeatedly 
jagger has denied he stole the song which he said he didnt 
hear until the suit was filed in 1986 
he has testified for two days playing tapes of the song as it 
was written and arranged in 1983 and 1984 to try to show the 
independent development of the piece 
in fridays session he quoted lyrics from brown sugar 
miss you and lets spend the night together 
jagger testified that repetition is common in popular music 
tapes were played of at least six different versions of the 
tune recorded in various places with various people in 1984 the 
version that was released was recorded in may 1984 in nassau the 
bahamas with a drummer named sly dunbar 
alley claims dunbar played for his recording in 1979 dunbar has 
testified that he didnt remember whether he played for alley or 
not 
jagger testified that the title and lyrics to the song went 
through a metamorphosis starting with another night and 
just another something else while he was messing around to 
develop the music 
he couldnt remember when he finished the lyrics or title 
jagger admitting playing reggae music with the late reggae 
musician peter tosh but said he didnt tend to listen to radio 
stations that played that kind of music 
he said he acknowledged works of other artists and paid them 
royalties 
alleys lawyers have said jaggers version netted as much as 6 
million 
the chorus of alleys song goes can i spend another just 
another night just another night just another night with you 
jaggers lines are give me just another night just another 
night with you give me just another kiss just before the dawn 
breaks through 
after his testimony expected to continue monday jagger signed 
autographs and told reporters he thought the case was going well

president daniel ortega accused the 
united states of concealing arms in shipments of nonlethal aid to 
rebels and said the white house is encouraging the military 
hardliners in the contra leadership 
at a news conference friday ortega also urged the united states 
to resume negotiations on national security matters of mutual 
concern suggesting the first meeting be held may 15 in mexico 
the nicaraguan leader said he was taking up president reagan on 
a promise of talks reagan made in november when he told the 
organization of american states that secretary of state george p 
shultz was prepared to meet with nicaraguan officials once 
serious negotiations on a nicaraguan ceasefire were under way 
we have met with the contras there is a ceasefire there is 
an agreement and the time has come for the us government to show 
consistency by meeting with nicaragua to discuss matters of 
national security ortega said 
he suggested the meetings begin may 15 at the mexican west coast 
resort of manzanillo where the two nations held talks that ended 
unsucessfully in january 1985 
ortega said the leftist sandinista governments ambassador to 
washington carlos tunnerman would deliver a formal proposal in a 
few days 
ortega accused the united states of encouraging military 
hardliners in the contra leadership by deciding to give the rebels 
nonlethal aid in violation of the preliminary peace accord his 
government signed with the contras march 23 
he also claimed the united states was concealing weapons and 
ammunition in shipments of humanitarian aid to rebels in honduran 
camps 
the preliminary accord allows humanitarian aid to be distributed 
through neutral international organizations but only after the 
rebels have settled in seven ceasefire zones inside nicaragua 
during the first half of may 
ortega said that nonlethal aid most of it food was already 
being flown from toncontin airport in tegucigalpa the honduran 
capital to camps controlled by contra commanders who oppose the 
ceasefire 
an official of the us agency for international development 
which is handling the shipments said thursday that the first 
truckloads of food arrived at rebel camps inside honduras this week 
he said they were sent from tegucigalpa after being inspected by 
independent observers to make sure they did not contain arms 
the march 23 preliminary peace accord signed in the southern 
border town of sapoa established a 60day ceasefire than began 
april 1 and during which both sides are charged with seeking to 
negotiate a lasting peace in the 6yearold conflict that has cost 
more than 26000 lives

amateur astronomers say bright lights atop a 
new highrise office building are preventing them from seeing stars 
and planets 
members of the amateur astronomy association of pittsburgh say 
the light shooting upward from the 31story fifth avenue place 
amounts to light pollution 
astronomers also claim the lights cause a haze that interferes 
with their gazing miles from downtown 
its a nuisance said tom reiland president of the 
250member group if you are an amateur who is hunting for comets 
a light like that could reduce your possibilities of being able 
to discover them 
andy gildersleeve project manager of the building said workers 
were experimenting with the lighting he said the lights intensity 
likely would diminish after experimentation 
but he said it was likely the building would remain the 
brightest in the city

arizonas attorney general has launched a 
formal investigation into whether former gov evan mecham broke the 
law when he urged supporters to have a lapse of memory about 
their support for him if they become potential jurors at his 
criminal trial 
attorney general bob corbin said friday he decided to launch the 
probe after first looking into whether mechams statements 
assuming they are true could be a violation of criminal 
statutes 
mecham acknowledged thursday he made the remark monday during an 
invitationonly republican meeting but said he was only joking 
told friday that corbin had decided on a formal investigation 
mecham said i have no objection to his investigating anything he 
wants and declined further comment 
corbin said the investigation will be to determine whether 
mecham violated one of several laws including the solicitation 
law which prohibits asking somebody to commit or help commit a 
crime 
corbin said he did not think the investigation would result in a 
delay of mechams may 19 trial on six felony charges of fraud 
perjury and filing false documents for failing to report a 350000 
loan to his 1986 campaign mechams brother and 1986 campaign 
treasurer willard mecham faces three similar counts 
on thursday mecham told the associated press in a telephone 
interview somebody asked if we could get a fair trial i said 
no unless we could get some people who were friendly that might 
have a lapse of memory when they were questioned about whether 
they could be impartial 
i said it tongueincheek in fact everybody laughed about 
it mecham said im not going to quit talking just because 
weve got a bunch of people without a sense of humor 
mecham was removed from office april 4 upon his conviction by 
the arizona senate on impeachment charges that he attempted to 
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat and that he 
misused a protocol fund by loaning 80000 from it to his car 
dealership

moslem guerrillas claimed today that 
they captured a strategic sovietafghan garrison after a fourmonth 
siege 
the peshawar headquarters of the sevenparty mujahedeen alliance 
said barikot in afghanistans northeast kunar province fell 
friday the alliance said the capture will boost their supply flow 
over the pakistanafghanistan border 
spokesmen said the base and village were heavily fortified and 
served as the headquarters of communist afghanistans 55th army 
brigade 
the rebels led by commander rahmatullah of the hezbiislami 
khalis faction reported that helicopters airlifted five infantry 
and commando battalions before the insurgents overran the compound 
around 1 pm 
soviet and afghan aircraft indiscriminately bombed and shelled 
the barikot area during the first stage of the attack destroying 
dozens of houses guerrillas said 
the rebels said 17 of their fighters died and 16 were wounded 
but they had no casualty figures for sovietafghan troops 
barikot lies just inside the afghan border with northern 
pakistan 
there was no immediate confirmation of the report but if 
accurate it would be a major victory for the anticommunist 
guerrillas and would open a new direct supply route from pakistan 
of us saudi and chinese weapons 
pakistan is a staging area for the afghan resistance although 
islamabad has pledged in an april 14 soviet troop withdrawal accord 
to stop serving as an arms conduit when the agreement goes into 
effect on may 15 
under the agreement the soviets agreed to withdraw its 
estimated 115000 troops over a ninemonth period beginning may 
15 the soviets intervened in december 1979

eritrean rebels shelled ethiopias 
biggest port and the countrys only oil refinery killing five 
people and wounding 15 the ethiopian news agency said in an 
unprecedented report on the civil war 
western diplomats said they believed the refinery was not 
damaged but were unsure about the port of assab which controls 
more than 75 percent of this east african nations imports and 
exports including emergency food relief for 7 million drought 
victims 
it sounds like the attack was nipped in the bud said one 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity diplomats said it was 
believed to be the first rebel attack on the port 
the staterun news agency reported friday that the ethiopian 
navy blew up the boat from which rebels launched a night attack 
tuesday from the hilly island of senabor off assab 530 miles 
northeast of addis ababa the capital 
assab and massawa ethiopias only other major port are in the 
eritrea province 
the agency said the boat capsized with an unspecified number of 
rebels on board it gave no further details of the attackers fate 
the agency also did not say if the refinery or port were damaged 
nor did it indicate what type of weapons were used by the eritrean 
peoples liberation front rebels 
the refinery is a source of vital fuel for surface air and 
marine transport and for industrial development in general the 
agency said the attempt of the bandits to destroy the refinery 
clearly demonstrates their reckless aim of engaging in suicidal 
missions 
the news agency also disclosed in the first official report of 
the attack that rebels of the tigrean peoples liberation front 
recently destroyed a microwave relay station connecting the 
eritrean capital asmara to the rest of the country 
the report of the assab attack is the first of its kind since 
president mengistu haile mariam ended years of official silence 
march 30 about the two insurgencies in the northernmost neighboring 
provinces of eritrea and tigre 
in his first admission that his government is at war mengistu 
announced an offensive against the rebels who have captured 
several towns in major victories this year 
there has been no official comment on an eritrean rebel claim 
that its guerrillas on friday shot down a mig21 fighter jet and 
captured the pilot 
voice of the broad masses of eritrea the clandestine rebel 
radio said the plane was downed during fighting northeast of 
asmara in which it claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and 
216 wounded in a battle thursday 
there were no foreign relief workers in assab this week because 
the government last week expelled about 60 western relief workers 
from eritrea and tigre citing personnel risks in the wartorn 
area 
the expulsions have jeopardized a massive westernfunded 
emergency relief operation to help an estimated 32 million people 
threatened with starvation in eritrea and tigre the provinces 
worst hit by drought 
this week the government allowed four un workers into asmara 
to supervise relief food distribution 
western diplomats and relief officials have criticized the 
expulsions and say they fear the government wants to remove foreign 
witnesses from the region as it prepares for allout war 
they have accused the government and rebels all of whom are 
marxist of jeopardizing the lives of drought victims in pursuit of 
military victory 
secessionist eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in 
africas oldest civil war rebels in tigre took up arms 14 years 
ago demanding a bigger say in the governing of their province

photographic evidence of jimmy swaggarts 
sins will be presented in court now that evangelist marvin gormans 
90 million lawsuit against swaggart has been revived gormans 
lawyer says 
this case is about an attack made on rev gorman i think you 
have to look at the credibility of the attacker to determine the 
credibility of the attack said gormans lawyer hunter lundy 
louisianas 4th circuit court of appeals on friday ordered a 
lower court to hear gormans case against swaggart rejecting 
arguments that it was purely a church matter that didnt belong in 
the courts 
the court said church doctrine requiring that charges against 
gorman be published within the assemblies of god denomination did 
not protect members who spread the accusations outside the church 
swaggarts lawyer phil whittman said he would appeal to the 
state supreme court 
gormans lawsuit filed over a year ago claims swaggart falsely 
accused him of adulterous affairs in an effort to bring down 
gormans television ministry gorman resigned from the assemblies 
of god following the scandal he admitted to a single adulterous 
encounter in 1979 but said swaggarts other accusations of 
adultery were lies 
various sources have reported that earlier this year gorman 
sent assemblies of god leaders photographs of swaggart outside a 
suburban new orleans motel with a prostitute a woman who later 
claimed to be that prostitute said swaggart paid her to pose in the 
nude 
lundy while not saying what the photographs show said he will 
definitely use them along with other evidence gathered by private 
detectives 
it now appears that we will get our day in court and all the 
facts will be presented to a jury of our peers and i know we will 
be exonerated from the lies published about me my family and my 
ministry gorman said 
on feb 21 swaggart confessed before his baton rouge 
congregation to an unspecified sins and stepped down from the 
pulpit he said he would submit to the churchs decree 
but he left the pentecostal denomination after the executive and 
general presbyteries ordered a oneyear suspension from the pulpit 
rather than the threemonth one recommended by the louisiana 
district council he said he was not rebelling but his ministry 
and bible college could not afford for him to be out of the pulpit 
that long 
gorman said he had confronted swaggart with his evidence in 
october and given him four months to make himself clean with the 
church before presenting the evidence against him

a fragile pedalplane skimmed across a 
74mile stretch of the aegean sea from crete to this greek island 
today to break the world record for humanpowered flight despite a 
crashlanding 
the pinkandsilver daedalus 88 piloted by greek national 
cycling champion kanellos kanellopoulos dropped into the surf just 
off the black sands of perissa beach on the southeast face of this 
volcanic island also known as thira 
i was expecting the takeoff to be horrible but it went off 
great especially with the tailwind the most turbulent area was 
here at the end said kanellopoulos still wet after his landing 
a strong headwind about 30 feet from the beach forced the 
72pound plane to crashland 
he tried to pull up on the joystick to elevate the plane to 
turn parallel to the beach to deal with headwind and then a gust 
hit the hovering plane said glenn tremml the former world 
record holder 
tremml who witnessed the landing said the sudden movement 
broke the tail boom and then the wings folded and he gently 
floated down he dove out and swam to the beach with a huge smile 
on his face 
kanellopoulos 30 was not injured said charles ball spokesman 
for the massasschusetts institute of technology in cambridge 
mass which sponsored the project 
greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue 
craft had escorted the plane as it cruised 15 feet above the aegean 
the 36member mit team had waited three weeks on windy crete for 
a suitable day to attempt the flight 
daedalus flew the distance from cretes heraklion military 
airfield in 3 hours 54 minutes faster than anticipated and 
landed at 11 am 4 am edt project organizers had estimated a 
flight time of at least five hours at a speed of around 14 miles an 
hour 
officials at heraklion airport attributed the quicker flight to 
a 3 to 4knot tailwind 
daedalus 88 broke two records 
first it shattered the mark for straightline humanpowered 
flight set in 1979 when bryan allen pedaled the gossamer albatross 
225 miles across the english channel 
then it broke the world record for humanpowered flight set by 
a daedalus 88 prototype light eagle which flew 372 miles around 
edwards air base in california in january 1987 
kanellopoulos smiled at reporters as he waited for the allclear 
to take off in crete 
the flight belongs to mit and greece we together are going to 
realize and keep the myth and of course this is the best way to 
visit santorini he said as he was being sealed into the 
ultralight plane 
essential requirements for the flight were a calm sea southerly 
winds of less than 3 knots temperatures under 70 degrees and 
visibility to the horizon according to steve k bussolari an mit 
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations 
the flight also was intended to emulate the 3500yearold myth 
of daedalus said to have flapped his way across the aegean from 
crete on wings of feathers and wax daedalus landed safely but his 
son icarus flew too close to the sun the wax of his wings melted 
and he plummeted to the sea and drowned 
had the plane not made it two similar backup planes would have 
been assembled for another record flight attempt before midmay 
when the weather turns too hot for humanpowered flying 
three other athletepilots had been taking turns standing by for 
48 hours each in readiness for a possible record flight 
they are francis scioscia 27 of scranton pa and greg zack 
26 of wilmington nc and tremml a 27yearold new haven conn 
medical student

an agreement short of adoption has been 
struck in the case of a navajo baby that will lead to permanent 
guardianship by a nonindian san jose calif couple and 
visitation rights by the mother 
in the end all parties agreed it was baby allyssa who won 
the agreement struck friday among navajo officials patricia 
keetso and rick and cheryl pitts of san jose calif granted the 
couple temporary custody of the 9monthold navajo daughter of ms 
keetso pending tribal court proceedings to give them permanent 
guardianship 
under it ms keetso will retain her parental and visitation 
rights and the tribes concern that allyssa be given an 
identification with her navajo heritage and culture will be 
assured said anslem roanhorse director of the navajo division of 
social welfare 
tribal authorities also gave it their approval after 4 hours 
of negotiations involving navajo tribal childrens judge manuel 
watchman lawyers a legal advocate for the child tribal social 
welfare officials and others 
i feel wonderful pitts told reporters saying the effort 
that had begun as an adoption proceeding in california 
definitely was worth going through 
the anguish and pain and confusion felt im sure by the 
pittses the natural mother the family members have hopefully come 
to an end said roanhorse perhaps now the healing process can 
begin 
roanhorse said the case set a precedent in upholding the rights 
of extended family members 
pitts expressed satisfaction with the compromise which he said 
was nothing more than our original intentions 
mrs pitts said i think things could have been done in a 
different way if somebody had just listened to us but added that 
she was not bitter and was happy to be going home with our 
daughter 
attorney michael c nelson who represented the pitts couple and 
ms keetso said permanent guardianship means the pittses 
relationship with allyssa keetsos biological mother would not have 
to end as it would under adoption 
however nelson said once the permanent guardianship is 
granted ms keetso would not be able to come back and claim 
custody of the child guardianship proceedings will begin within 
the next four months he added 
the agreement grants liberal visitation rights to the biological 
mother and other members of the babys extended indian family 
the pittses both 33 were in the process of adopting allyssa 
with the approval of ms keetso when the navajo tribal courts 
intervened federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction over the 
adoption of indian children by nonindians in certain instances 
nelson said the couple wanted to adopt allyssa and give her 
mother visitation rights but tribal officials say adoption would 
sever the childs link with the tribe navajo law places strong 
emphasis on extended family 
under a guardianship parental rights would remain with the 
biological mother even though the pittses would raise the child 
the couple would be legally considered the parents if they adopt 
the child 
ms keetso 21 was pregnant and single when she contacted the 
pittses through a newspaper ad she lived with the san jose 
calif couple for two months before and one month after allyssa 
was born and said she wanted the couple to adopt her daughter 
the childs maternal grandmother susie keetso also has said 
she wants the child to be turned over to the san jose couple 
tribal officials have said they intervened after mrs keetso 
expressed strong interest in having the child raised at the 
reservation but earlier this week mrs keetso said she had been 
threatened with jail if she did not allow the tribe to intervene in 
the case

fidel castro praised nuns the pope and showed 
he definitely is reaching toward the church as he met for four 
hours with cardinal john j oconnor the church leader says 
oconnor the first roman catholic cardinal to visit cuba since 
castro gained power in 1959 also said castro indicated he would 
release up to 350 political prisoners if the united states were to 
give them visas 
castro asked for the church to see if it could play a role in 
smoothing the way for arrangements and oconnor said he told him 
we would be happy to do this 
and the cuban leader also indicated he wants to restore normal 
diplomatic relations with the united states oconnor said at a 
news conference at laguardia airport after he returned friday from 
his fourday trip 
officially oconnor went to cuba as a guest of the catholic 
church to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the rev 
felix varela who served in new york city from 1823 to 1853 
when oconnor asked castro if he could clear the way for 
americans to visit sick relatives in cuba castro said that would 
be no problem at all the cardinal said 
at one point oconnor said he asked castro for four more visas 
for mother teresas missionary sisters of charity 
the instant i proposed it he expressed great delight and 
granted the visas at that moment he then went into great praise 
of the nuns in cuba ive never heard nuns praised so highly he 
said 
castro also went into great praise of the pope and said hes 
certainly the world leader in terms of peace and in terms of 
constantly speaking about the poor oconnor said 
i dont think theres any question that for whatever motive 
hes beginning to feel the needs of the church oconnor said of 
the cuban president 
although castro was friendly oconnor said he was thinking 
all the time about whether the political figure was trying to 
exploit him 
at first during their talks castro gave me an extensive 
tirade against the united states he told me he has long since 
learned to do without the united states oconnor said 
but he said he later got the feeling that he castro would be 
delighted to reestablish a normal relationship with the united 
states 
oconnor said he expected that normal relations would include a 
resumption of trade and discussions at a diplomatic level as well 
as within a very short period of time the free flow of people 
going back and forth 
and the possibility of greater openness toward the church also 
seemed a prospect in the soviet union which is considering 
allowing oconnor to celebrate a christmas mass in moscow to be 
broadcast to a national audience he said 
the new york prelate first mentioned the proposal thursday at a 
news conference in havana 
the cardinal said he would prefer such a mass on new years day 
so he could continue the tradition of celebrating midnight 
christmas mass at st patricks cathedral 
a televised mass in the soviet union would be another move 
toward building a bridge oconnor said the bridge has to be 
built it may be a year it may take a century

its butts out for about 80 percent of all domestic flights 
today but airlines and experts have some healthy advice for 
inveterate smokers climbing the cabin walls take deep breaths 
chew gun and snap a rubber band 
the federal ban on smoking on domestic flights of less than two 
hours went into effect at 1201 am edt today 
ill just have to smoke like a fiend until i get on said 
linda navarro of fullerton calif as she prepared to board a 
flight at los angeles international airport 
the regulation carries more than a wrist slap for violators a 
fine of up to 1000 for smoking and 2000 for tampering with 
aircraft lavatory smoke alarms 
those who disobey a flight attendants order to put out a 
cigarette could land in jail airlines say they may ask police to 
meet the plane at its next destination or even divert the aircraft 
in cases involving unruly smokers 
the majority of us absolutely support the new law usair 
flight attendant suzanne haughton told the los angeles times i 
dont look forward to the conflicts that will come with it though 
there are going to be problems there are passengers who rip your 
head off on a 28minute flight if they cant smoke 
im thrilled im so happy i just cant breathe anymore on 
these flights united airlines flight attendant terry cale said 
in san francisco im afraid to go to the doctor to have my lungs 
examined for fear of what theyll find 
not everyone was as thrilled flying is already stressful 
enough and now theyre going to make it worse if they wont let me 
smoke up there said lother straschnitzki of sonoma calif 
waiting for his flight to be called at san francisco international 
airport its going to bother me a lot 
i survived said tom brand of fort lauderdale fla who lit 
up the minute he stepped off his delta flight from fort lauderdale 
to atlanta 
but the hopelessly hooked neednt despair the airlines plan to 
offer substitutes for cigarettes including hard candy and a 
chewing gum designed to lessen withdrawal symptoms 
dr don r powell executive director of the american institute 
for preventive medicine advises putting a rubber band around the 
wrist of your smoking hand and snapping it whenever a nicotine urge 
strikes 
our employees have been briefed said paula musto a 
spokeswoman for eastern airlines the flight attendants as the 
frontline people will have to deal with it more than anybody 
under the new rules airlines are required to announce before 
takeoff that smoking is prohibited and to keep no smoking 
lights illuminated 
even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes 
beyond two hours smoking will be prohibited if the schedule lists 
it as lasting two hours or less according to the federal aviation 
administration 
american airlines is providing cinnamon hard candies to smokers 
suggested by the american heart association and the american lung 
association as a cigarette substitute continental airlines is 
distributing more than 430000 pieces of a gum called ban 
smoke formulated to temporarily control the urge 
northwest airlines whose antismoking policy goes beyond the 
federal requirement by banning smoking on nearly all domestic 
flights is handing out candies and mints as well as brochures 
from united airlines here are some suggestions from medical 
director dr gary kohn 
if you usually smoke while sipping coffee soft drinks or 
alcohol during flights try switching to fruit juices water or 
milk 
strike up a conversation with a fellow passenger instead of 
striking a match write letters or a business memo 
practice deep breathing 
read a book or a magazine 
the american institute for preventive medicine based in 
southfield mich has also developed a kit called flying 
smokeless that contains a cassette tape of behavior modification 
techniques and a smokeless emergency pack containing gum mints 
and toothpicks it sells for 1145

mikhail s gorbachev accused president reagan of 
wrongly claiming superpower relations had warmed thanks to us 
pressure on the soviets and suggested reagan stop sermonizing the 
official tass news agency reported today 
the agency said gorbachev told secretary of state george p 
shultz friday that despite recently improved superpower relations 
sermons are again being delivered to us and we are being 
instructed on how we should behave ourselves 
everything that has been achieved in sovietamerican relations 
is being ascribed to the policy of strength and putting pressure 
on the soviets the soviet leader told shultz according to the 
agency 
gorbachev was apparently referring to a foreign policy speech 
given by reagan thursday in springfield mass 
in it the president said the united states and soviet union 
cannot have a normal relationship unless moscow changes its 
ways and stops intervening in nations such as afghanistan 
after his meeting with gorbachev shultz told reporters the 
going is hard in trying to conclude a treaty for sharply reducing 
longrange nuclear weapons that reagan and gorbachev could sign at 
their may 29june 2 summit in moscow 
today shultz took a side trip in the ukraine to visit the sites 
of a stalled us consulate and a world war ii german atrocity 
we have to say to ourselves always never again shultz said 
in a tribute to the 30000 jews and 70000 ukrainians who were 
herded into a ravine at babi yar and machinegunned by the nazis 
the consulate in kiev the thirdlargest city in the soviet 
union was supposed to have opened by now but construction has 
been halted and there is no target date for completion 
us officials cite security concerns a tighter budget and 
congressional opposition also the soviets would have a reciprocal 
right to open a consulate in new york which troubles some members 
of congress and some state department officials 
in talks thursday and friday with soviet leaders shultz sought 
to make headway on arms control problems and regional disputes in 
a joint statement friday the us and soviet teams said 
negotiators would deal with the disputed issues on a priority 
basis 
they reaffirmed their strong commitment to make an intensive 
effort to complete the treaty and said the summit should mark 
another important step in the process of building a more stable and 
constructive relationship 
shultz was also scheduled today to visit tbilisi stop in 
brussels to brief the north atlantic treaty organization monday 
then fly home he is to hold another session with foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze before the summit 
a strategic arms reduction treaty would crown reagans fourth 
and probably final meeting with gorbachev as president 
at a news conference shevardnadze said he could not promise an 
arms treaty before reagans visit and he criticized any attempt to 
rush negotiations he suggested that without a treaty gorbachev 
and reagan could still sign a document stating progress toward an 
accord 
while us arms negotiators offered a new proposal in a dispute 
over airlaunched cruise missiles the treaty to sharply reduce 
us and soviet strategic nuclear weapons was still stymied in a 
dispute over star wars 
the us proposal would count as nuclear weapons all cruise 
missiles carried by fighter planes even though some may be 
conventionally armed both sides would have the right to develop 
airlaunched cruises that were not nuclear and the weapons would 
not be covered by the treaty 
the idea is to bypass a dispute over verifying which of the 
cruise missiles carry nuclear arms 
the soviets agreed to study the proposal a senior us official 
said at a briefing for reporters under rules of anonymity 
another major stumbling block in completing the treaty is 
finding ways to monitor us and soviet weapons to make sure 
cutbacks are not circumvented 
on the regional front the soviets again refused to heed 
shultzs appeal for the united nations to declare an arms embargo 
against iran 
since the soviets have veto power on the un security council 
this means the united states is unable to move for un sanctions 
against iran the idea is to try to force compliance with a 
ceasefire ordered by the council last july in the iraniraq war 
shultz also could not persuade the soviet union to restore 
diplomatic relations with israel after a 21year break or to pledge 
to increase jewish emigration another us official said

an internecine battle between two unions 
representing most of the nations operating railroad personnel is 
flaring just as both are sitting down with the industry to open a 
new round of contract talks 
fred hardin president of the 88000member united 
transportation union said in an interview he is launching an 
effort to take over the brotherhood of locomotive engineers with 
or without its consent 
larry mcfather president of the 28000member ble accused 
hardin of engaging in an outright raiding campaign against our 
union and vowed an appropriate response that might include 
abandoning the utu to its own devices at the bargaining table 
the locomotive engineers whose members are the highest paid 
among unionized rail workers last week voted to affiliate with the 
aflcio breaking a 125year tradition of staying aloof from such 
alliances 
the ble has gone into a cave of protection said hardin who 
pulled his own union out of the aflcio two years ago when the 
labor federation was preparing sanctions against it for trying to 
snare 2000 amtrak workers away from other unions 
the aflcios constitution prohibits its affiliated unions from 
seeking to acquire the members of any other union allied with the 
federation 
hardin said he had approached mcfather and his two predecessors 
about absorbing the engineers into his union through what he called 
an honorable affiliation that would allow it to exercise 
autonomy 
we cant continue with 15 separate unions in an industry that 
is merging and reorganizing every day and which has declined from a 
million workers to just 300000 hardin said 
in as much as he mcfather seems determined to remain a 
separate union we have no alternative but to give the working 
engineers through a representation election the right to effect a 
merger he said 
industry negotiators have vowed to reduce the carriers 
unionized labor force by 25 percent or 60000 to 75000 workers 
over the next three years largely by reducing the size of train 
crews who except for locomotive engineers mostly belong to the 
utu 
to accomplish that with as little labor unrest as possible one 
carrier csx rail transport the nations largest is offering 
severance payments of 50000 to 75000 for each departing worker 
and in the first example of socalled gain sharing with rail 
unions csx also is offering to split 5050 with the remaining 
workers the 475 million it will save from the job cuts 
the layoffs would be accomplished by changing the current work 
rules between the unions and the railroads which now require two 
brakemen a conductor and an engineer on every train 
most rail labor leaders are hoping that whatever agreement is 
struck with csx will set the pattern for the rest of the industry 
while other unions are reluctantly yielding to the employment 
reductions in exchange for a share of the savings the utu has been 
the most resistant to the idea largely because its members would 
lose the most jobs 
the utu is not about to make any agreement with csx that would 
eliminate 9000 utu positions out of 10000 altogether and then 
divide the money among all the remaining employees he said we 
dont mind dividing the apple but we want it divided evenly 
mcfather called hardin a desperate union president motivated 
by his own perception that the utu membership will decline over the 
next few years as two and threeman crews become predominant 
in many cases we have been standing side by side with the utu 
and not agreeing with the carriers on the crew issues mcfather 
said if mr hardin is going to raid our union we may be more 
receptive to negotiating agreements 
ironically both officials agreed their dispute is only going to 
hurt their bargaining position with the railroads 
hardin said the railroads are sure to capitalize on any 
friction and discord among the unions 
this is not the time to be fighting this kind of war 
mcfather said anytime the carriers can keep our organizations 
pitted against each other they always come out better off

initially was approved by two votes lost out in a recount but 
proponents said they would go to court to have a judge review the 
ballots

farmers smashed and burned an american car torched 
boxes of us oranges and set fire to a us flag in a rally 
saturday protesting us demands that japan end its restrictions on 
imported beef and oranges 
the violence came as us negotiators ended a week of meetings 
on trade with no new agreements a us trade representative 
saturday left for the united states after failing to persuade japan 
to drop import quotas on citrus and beef 
the two sides remain very far apart said michael b smith 
deputy representative my own opinion is that we moved further 
apart he told a news conference at the american embassy before 
his departure 
about 300 farmers chanted down with us demands while a man 
jumped onto an american car and smashed its windows with a large 
hammer 
the farmers wearing head bands saying protect japanese 
agriculture in the rain then piled boxes of us oranges on the 
car and set it on fire along with a large american flag 
three members of japans parliament including former vice 
minister of agriculture seishiro eto attended the rally in the 
town of kokonone in kyushu in western japan 
scenes of the demonstration were shown on evening television 
news broadcasts 
kyodo news service said the farmers destroying the us car were 
following the example of us congressmen who smashed a tape 
recorder made by japans toshiba corp in july last year 
the congressmen were protesting sales of hightechnology milling 
machines to the soviet union by a toshiba subsidiary 
smith said the two sides differ on three important issues japan 
wants a transition period before it fully opens its market it 
wants to negotiate the level of foreign access during the 
transition and after the market is open japan wants new or 
additional border measures such as tariffs to protect its 
markets 
smith said washington would agree to a transition period as long 
as japan reciprocates by significantly increasing foreign access to 
its markets 
agriculture forestry and fisheries minister takashi sato will 
leave for washington this week to continue the talks he said 
japanese newspapers said saturday the government has decided to 
liberalize japans beef imports in three years and orange imports 
in five years to help defuse trade friction with the united states 
its main ally and trading partner 
in exchange japan would impose a surcharge on american beef and 
allow imports to increase by about 15 percent a year according to 
the mainichi daily news 
an increase in surcharges on oranges is prohibited under 
international trade rules established by the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
but smith said import surcharges are out of the question he 
declined to say which points the two sides agreed on saying the 
whole package must be negotiated and todays numbers are 
yesterdays history 
the two sides have been negotiating since tuesday trying to 
reach agreement on a new package after the previous beef and 
oranges agreement expired april 1 
in another set of consultations japan asked the united states 
to lift the penalty tariffs it imposed on japanese color 
televisions calculators computers and power drills over alleged 
japanese violations of an agreement on sales of computer chips but 
the united states refused saying the sanctions will be lifted 
once the arrangement is functioning as intended 
the two sides also held discussions on structural changes in 
japans economy and japanese demands that the united states reduce 
its budget deficit and do more to stimulate its own economy 
the biggest topic of the week turned out to be an item that was 
not on the agenda a 312107 vote by the us house of 
representatives approving a comprehensive trade bill that 
retaliates against toshiba corp 
the move punishes toshiba for a subsidiarys sale of sensitive 
high technology equipment to the soviet union and gives the us 
trade representative more power in dealing with complaints of 
unfair trade practices by foreign countries 
a us trade official said the timing of the vote was 
coincidental and was not designed to send a special message to the 
japanese during the week of talks 
international trade and industry minister hajime tamura 
protested the measure and called on president reagan to veto the 
bill 
i suspect that the us house of representatives was guilty of 
racial discrimination and antijapanese sentiment in passing the 
trade bill japanese newspapers quoted him as saying 
allen wallis visiting us undersecretary of state for economic 
affairs said friday he assured japan that reagan would veto the 
bill in its present form the house can override the veto with a 
twothirds vote 
last year japan bought about 28 billion in us exports second 
only to canada and the united states bought 38 percent of japans 
exports making it japans biggest trading partner wallis said

michael s dukakis the likely democratic nominee 
says he considers republican george bush extremely vulnerable 
in a host of international matters and while a relative novice in 
foreign affairs i also have some rather strongly held views 
with a rare edge in his voice dukakis ran quickly through his 
brief against bush mentioning armsforhostages support for 
former philippine dictator ferdinand marcos a failed and illegal 
policy in central america and seven precious years doing 
virtually nothing about the middle east 
what good is experience if thats what it produces dukakis 
asked trying out a line for the general election that would bind 
bush to the policies of president reagan 
in an interview with the associated press dukakis spoke at 
length about his foreign policy views and declared himself eager to 
go after bush on foreign and military affairs 
i think the vice president is extremely vulnerable on foreign 
policy its going to be an issue believe me im going to take 
that issue to him and the republican party dukakis said talking 
through a hasty lunch last thursday in his statehouse office 
dukakis was asked pointblank whether he could imagine himself 
unleashing a nuclear warhead 
i dont think it will be necessary he said but if the 
policy of nuclear deterrence means what it says then that has to 
be a possibility otherwise nuclear deterrence doesnt mean 
anything 
in his view soviet leader mikhail gorbachev recognizes the 
soviet union is facing grave internal problems especially in its 
sagging economy 
in the past three years alone dukakis said the soviet union 
has been buffeted by the chernobyl nuclear disaster and a pending 
withdrawal from afghanistan while at the same time expressing a 
willingness to reduce nuclear arms and conventional forces 
all of this is very new very different i think principally 
because gorbachev recognizes that theyre falling farther and 
farther behind in an economic sense the soviet economic system is 
failing and theyre got to open up that system or theyre going 
to become a second or thirdrate economic power dukakis said 
while some americans might welcome a weakened soviet state 
dukakis does not 
i think an insecure failing soviet union is not in our 
national interest im not saying that a militarily powerful 
adventurous soviet union is in our interest but continued 
political instability in the soviet union failure to grapple with 
serious problems i dont think thats in the best interest of 
world peace and world stability he said 
in a stillhypothetical general election bush might be expected 
to try to tag dukakis as a traditional democratic dove in the cast 
of george mcgovern but while dukakis on nicaragua may sound like 
mcgovern on vietnam dukakis talks tough about drawing a line 
around north and south america 
look were not going to tolerate a soviet satellite in this 
hemisphere and its important to define those terms im 
talking about a country that is a base for soviet military power 
and is engaging in systematic subversion of its neighbors were 
not going to tolerate that 
in foreign policy terms dukakis as a thirdterm governor of 
massachusetts has a political problem and a political opportunity 
he lacks depth of personal experience especially compared to bush 
a former ambassador cia director and now vice president 
the same inexperience was true of reagan and former president 
carter both of whom came to the presidency by way of the 
statehouse rather than congress 
yet at the same time the massachusetts governor does not have to 
defend a record not of his own making and he has a relatively 
clean slate on which to write his own doctrines and he doesnt 
lack for selfconfidence while he is being urged to select a vice 
president with foreignpolicy expertise dukakis says his secretary 
of state will handle those chores 
in the interview dukakis who speaks spanish greek and french 
but has not traveled extensively acknowledged that he has 
learning to do 
of course you never stop learning in politics he said 
you work at this all the time but i also have some rather 
strongly held views on the subject of american foreign policy and 
i think if youre going to run for the presidency youve got a 
responsibility to express those views and to do so with as much 
information and knowledge as you can possibly pull together 
as for his own views dukakis is most emphatic on two points 
ending the shooting in central america and turning the ussoviet 
relationship into a peaceful blend of rivalry and cooperation 
theres no question that managing that relationship is going 
to be probably the single most important foreign policy 
responsibility the president has dukakis said 
the next president of the united states will probably have the 
best opportunity in our lifetimes to make real progress in not only 
building that relationship but on arms control and arms reduction 
on reducing and eliminating regional conflict on making the 
competition peaceful and not military between the two superpowers

more than 200 soviet trucks and 
armored vehicles lumbered out of the capital at dawn saturday for 
lowgar province where moslem guerrillas have stepped up attacks as 
moscow prepares its troops to withdraw 
many ground convoys and transport planes have been leaving kabul 
in recent days to resupply soviet positions and the vulnerable 
afghan army according to residents and western diplomats 
the soviets agreed april 14 in geneva to withdraw their 
estimated 115000 troops from afghanistan more than eight years 
after moscow intervened to prop up the marxist government the 
withdrawal is to begin may 15 
but the agreement is far from a peace accord guerrilla 
activities including bombings in kabul itself have increased 
since february with the approach of spring and the melting of snow 
in the northern hindu kush and other mountain ranges 
an alliance of seven moslem guerrilla groups whose headquarters 
are across the afghanpakistani frontier rejected the geneva 
accord because it does not guarantee a cutoff of soviet aid to 
president najibs afghan government 
the united states according to officials in washington will 
not halt its arms supplies to the guerrillas until the soviets stop 
supplying najibs troops 
meanwhile the soviets are are preparing for an escalation of 
guerrilla attacks in areas that will be the last to be vacated 
according to foreign analysts 
afghanistans rugged geography has made it a nightmare for 
foreign armies since alexander the greats shortlived conquest in 
the fourth century 
soviet watchposts on the road around kabul show signs of recent 
fortification there is fresh concrete and stonework around soviet 
sentry posts bunkers are newly draped with camouflage netting 
western diplomats said 
kabul hub of soviet operations is expected to be one of the 
last two cities the soviets leave before the final withdrawal 
deadline of feb 15 1989 
the other is mazaresharif 40 miles south of the soviet border 
on a dusty plain along the oxus river 
during a tightly supervised sevenandahalf hour visit arranged 
by the afghan government on friday several signs of soviet 
presence were visible there soviet army fuel trucks were parked 
near 20 afghan air force mig21 fighter planes at the airport a 
dozen soviet soldiers went about their work and storefronts showed 
the cyrillic lettering used by the soviets 
according to western diplomats and afghan officials all 
speaking on condition of anonymity the soviet pullout will 
probably start at their most exposed positions these include bases 
near the pakistani border 
meanwhile the soviets have plenty to worry about according to 
a report compiled by western diplomats 22 bombs exploded in kabul 
in march compared with 10 in february they included magnetic 
bombs with timing devices that can be attached to vehicles one 
diplomat said 
other guerrilla activities in recent weeks included curtailing 
movement on roads linking kabul with other major cities according 
to the diplomat and residents 
the diplomat said the guerrillas cut the road to ghazni 75 
miles southwest of kabul on april 14 a reporter who flew over the 
road a week later saw only a dozen vehicles on a normally 
welltraveled section of the road 
lowgar province which abuts the kabulghazni road is very 
insecure one western source said 
indeed the soviet convoy that headed there saturday showed 
signs of apprehension 
it included eight t62 tanks at least a dozen armored personnel 
carriers a score or more of trucks loaded with coal and about 10 
trucks carrying communications gear 
many trucks had metal plates that covered the lower half of the 
windshield on the drivers side and left only a bricksized opening 
on the passengers side 
the drivers many of whom appeared to be teenagers wore 
helmets and flak jackets 
some trucks were mounted with antiaircraft guns the guerrillas 
do not have aircraft so the guns would presumably be used to 
attack their mountain positions

overwhelming dissatisfaction with the welfare 
system is pushing congress toward major revisions in a program that 
started 53 years ago before working women teenage mothers and 
child poverty were commonplace 
the overhaul bills passed last year by the house and last week 
by the senate finance committee acknowledge as the senate bill 
puts it the vastly changed family arrangements of the 
intervening half century since the start of the aid to families 
with dependent children program 
both bills stress family responsibility and community obligation 
parental responsibility to support children and the communitys 
obligation to make that feasible through expanded education and 
training opportunities and to varying degrees both bills would 
improve benefits for families who absolutely must rely on 
government assistance 
preliminary estimates by the congressional budget office put the 
fiveyear cost of the house bill at 71 billion and the senate 
bill at 28 billion whatever emerges from congress will be more 
extensive than the 913 million plan backed by the reagan 
administration and is likely to draw a veto 
nevertheless liberals and conservatives remain convinced that 
the system must be changed and many of them are in agreement on how 
to do it the senate bill is cosponsored by a majority of the 
senate and while the house bill was passed without gop backing 
some republicans indicated they could accept the senate approach 
following is a comparison of major provisions in the two bills 
the senate bill may be amended on the floor and the final product 
likely will combine features of the senate and house bills

the arab hijackers who held a kuwait 
airways jet for 16 days and killed two of its passengers have been 
traced to the stronghold of proiranian extremists in lebanon 
diplomatic sources said saturday 
arab and western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the hijackers were believed to have made their getaway in an 
algerian air force plane via the syrian capital of damascus before 
dawn wednesday 
the sources said the leader of the hijackers was believed to be 
izzedine hassan a shiite hardliner known to have been involved in 
the 1985 twa hijacking in which an american was killed 
various diplomatic security and counterterrorist agencies are 
trying to keep track of the gang one diplomat said the men 
are believed to have gone underground with hezbollah in a largely 
shiite part of west beirut where their trail is easily lost 
hezbollah or party of god is a proiranian shiite radical 
movement that holds western hostages in lebanon terry anderson 
the chief middle east correspondent for the associated press is 
among their captives 
on saturday the hijacked boeing 747 was still being examined at 
algiers airport by algerian security men and aviation specialists 
a kuwaiti crew was standing by to fly it home as soon as the 
algerians give the goahead 
the united states britain and other western governments have 
paid tribute to the algerians for negotiating the release of the 
last 31 hostages without further violence but they have criticized 
algeria for allowing the hijackers to escape unpunished 
flight 422 carrying 112 passengers was hijacked april 5 on a 
flight from bangkok thailand to kuwait it landed first in 
mashhad iran where 57 passengers were released then it went to 
larnaca cyprus where 13 captives were freed and two others were 
killed the plane flew to algiers and upon touching down one 
hostage was released for medical reasons 
on wednesday after lengthy negotiations with algerian 
authorities the remaining hostages were freed 
algerias staterun media rejected criticism as arrogant and 
hypocritical interference in the nations internal affairs and 
asked why the west did not display similar concern over state 
terrorism carried out by israel and south africa 
the sources said algerian negotiators worked out a meticulous 
and elaborate deal with the hijackers during the six days the plane 
was held at algiers houari boumedienne airport 
one diplomat who received a continuous algerian progress report 
while the negotiations were going on said the secret talks were 
concerned more with assuring the hijackers unimpeded getaway than 
with the fate of the hostages 
while the plane was still on the ground in cyprus the 
algerians received a promise that the hostages would not be harmed 
on algerian soil the source said 
the algerian negotiators thereupon allowed the plane to take 
off for algiers and then took the hijackers at their word events 
proved them right 
whether the algerians were right to observe their part of the 
bargain and help the hijackers escape after the hostages were freed 
is essentially a philosophical question over the validity of 
bargaining under duress another diplomat said 
while we are appreciative of the algerian efforts to avoid 
further bloodshed we do not see eyetoeye with them on this other 
aspect of the problem 
algeria has repeatedly played the role of honest broker in 
negotiating the release of hijack and kidnap victims including the 
american hostages from the us embassy in tehran in 1981 and the 
twa passengers in 1985 
algerian officials said algeria would forfeit its ability to 
play such a role in the future if it was seen to doublecross one of 
the parties to a compromise 
the diplomats said they believed the hijackers may have been 
taken to damascus on wednesday in a special plane carrying a 
highranking algerian official mohamed cherif messadia to the 
syrian capital for talks with president hafez assad 
messadia is generally regarded as the number two man in the 
algerian government after president chadli bendjedid his presence 
may have given the hijackers some assurance their aircraft would 
not be intercepted enroute

in 1963 liberace was hospitalized in 
pittsburgh with a nearfatal illness and his doctors told him to 
put his affairs in order he did giving away most of his 
possessions and spending thousands of dollars on gifts for friends 
after weeks in intensive care the flashy entertainer recovered 
and found himself rebuilding his life physically and financially 
never again he vowed would he give away his wealth at the whim 
of someone or something out of his control 
but now a year after his death liberaces millions are the 
subject of controversy again and a bitter court battle he would 
have detested is being waged to determine who will head the 
foundation he set up to help aspiring young artists 
liberaces sister angie his manager of 36 years and three 
other associates have filed suit against los angeles attorney joel 
strote charging he got liberace to sign a new will 13 days before 
he died at his palm springs calif home the will named strote as 
executor of the estate and head of a trust to funnel money to the 
liberace foundation for the performing arts 
the 100 pages of deathbed documents gave strote full control of 
an estate valued at 20 million 
strote said liberace called him to his malibu calif home 
three weeks before he died on feb 5 1987 asking that the will be 
drawn and that longtime manager seymour heller be removed from any 
position of control 
the suit contends strote took advantage of liberace who was 
dying of an illness brought on by complications from aids it asks 
that strote be removed as executor and head of the trust 
the case has gone to trial and strote spent several hours on 
the witness stand in state district court last week with a return 
scheduled monday he testified that his actions have been in the 
best interests of liberaces estate and foundation and that his 
activities as a lawyer and executor of the estate are dictated by 
law 
he declined thursday to comment on the legal battle 
during a break in the trial heller bemoaned strotes actions 
since taking over as executor he said strote had taken priceless 
heirlooms that belonged in a liberace museum and sold them at 
auction in los angeles earlier this month the auction netted an 
estimated 2 million for the foundation 
he even sold the mans drivers license heller said 
disgustedly can you imagine that he sold some of the gifts my 
wife and i gave to lee they had our names engraved on them 
the other plaintiffs are dorothy mcmahon housekeeper at 
liberaces palm springs home gladys luckie housekeeper in las 
vegas and cary james a longtime companion of liberace 
the attorney for the five plaintiffs harold gewerter charged 
in opening statements that strote had talked to liberace about a 
new will jan 15 1987 then had 100 pages of legal documents drawn 
up and returned a week later for liberaces signature 
liberace was in such a mental state on the 22nd that he 
couldnt understand or read independently gewerter said if 
pee wee herman had walked into his room and said he wanted to be 
executor he liberace would have said yes he strote goes 
into that room owning nothing and comes out with a bag of goodies 
gewerter charged that strote had taken hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from the estate 
liberaces determination to control who would benefit from his 
estate stemmed from his hospitalization in pittsburgh on nov 22 
1963 when he suffered uremic poisoning after inhaling carbon 
tectrachloride fumes from a fluid he was using to clean a costume 
he was hospitalized in intensive care for weeks 
the doctors told me to put my house in order he recalled 
in later interviews its a funny way to tell a man to get ready 
to die 
he was given last rites and told he had about 750000 in the 
bank after taking care of charities and individuals he had included 
in his will 
he then went on a deathbed buying binge a beverly hills home 
for his sister furs and jewelry for his mother a boat for one of 
his 28 staff members cars motorcycles etc 
if you think a drunken sailor spends money carelessly you 
should get a load of a rich piano player when he thinks hes 
dying liberace wrote

eritrean rebels shelled ethiopias 
biggest port and its only oil refinery diplomats and the official 
news agency said five people were reported killed and 15 wounded 
in an unprecedented report on the civil war in the north the 
ethiopian news agency reported friday that the rebels launched 
attack on the port of assab at midnight tuesday from a boat at 
nearby senabor island 
bandits who are bent on creating havoc to lives and property 
fired shells at the town the news agency reported 
a team from the ethiopian navy immediately took action and 
blew up the boat in which the rebels had infiltrated the area the 
boat was reported to have capsized with the rebels in it said 
the agency 
western diplomats said it was believed to be the first rebel 
attack on the port 530 miles northeast of addis ababa the capital 
of the marxist government assab and massawa ethiopias only other 
port of significance are both in eritrea where the secessionist 
eritrean peoples liberation front has been fighting for 27 years 
in africas oldest civil war the rebels also are marxist 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
believed assab refinery was not damaged but were unsure about the 
port which controls up to 80 percent of this east african nations 
imports and exports including emergency food for 7 million drought 
victims 
the official news agency did not say whether the port or 
refinery were damaged it also did not report how many rebels were 
involved in the attack nor did it indicate what type of weapons 
they used 
the agency also disclosed for the first time that rebels of the 
tigrean peoples liberation front recently destroyed one of the 
microwave relay stations connecting the eritrean capital asmara 
to the rest of the country 
tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago demanding a bigger say 
in governing their province 
the news agency made no reference to a claim by the eritrean 
peoples liberation front that it shot down a mig21 fighter jet 
friday and captured the pilot identified as capt tilahun begarso 
voice of the broad masses of eritrea the clandestine rebel 
radio said the plane was hit during ongoing fighting northeast of 
asmara it claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and 216 
wounded in a battle there thursday 
the assab attack report is the first of its kind since president 
mengistu haile mariam ended years of official silence march 30 
about insurgencies in the northernmost neighboring provinces of 
eritrea and tigre 
in his first admission that his government is at war mengistu 
announced an imminent offensive against the rebels who have 
captured several towns in major victories this year 
no foreign relief agencies have been based in assab since the 
government on april 6 expelled about 60 western relief workers from

panamas militarydominated government has 
engaged in a widespread pattern of human rights abuses including 
the beating and jailing of protestors and mistreatment of 
prisoners according to a report by a human rights group released 
saturday 
the report prepared by americas watch a private new 
yorkbased group said panamanian authorities have mixed political 
prisoners with violent criminals in substandard conditions engaged 
in vandalism and silenced opposition news media 
discussing antigovernment demonstrations the report said 
hundreds of people appear to have been arrested solely for the 
nonviolent expression of their political beliefs 
the study said the abuses have been particularly severe since 
panamas political crisis erupted last june it described the 
reagan administrations policy toward the alleged repression in 
panama as uneven and often contradictory 
the report was written by jose zalaquett a consultant to 
americas watch after a mission to panama last september but some 
of the alleged abuses described in the report occurred in recent 
weeks 
last wednesday the panamanian government lifted a state of 
urgency that was imposed after an abortive coup attempt a month 
ago 
the crackdown permitted the government to suspend a wide range 
of civil liberties including freedom of speech and assembly and 
the right to private property 
while the report said that some of the more flagrant abuses 
could be eliminated by the departure of panamas military chief 
manuel antonio noriega others will be eliminated only through the 
decisive action of a new government 
such a government among other steps should guarantee that 
future elections are free and fair and take steps to ensure that 
the military does not interfere with the political process the 
report said 
it added that american policy toward panama seems to have been 
dictated by constantly changing calculations about what best 
ensures stability in panama 
for years the report said the reagan administration chose 
not to criticize the regimes controlled by noriega even as the 
general consolidated his power and corruption reached new depths 
noriega who has headed panamas defense forces since 1983 is 
under federal indictment on drug smuggling charges 
the report said that even though the state department knew the 
1984 presidential elections in panama were rigged by the military 
secretary of state george p shultz gave his blessing to the 
process by attending the inauguration of the new president 
shultz has denied that any such information was available at the 
time of the election 
the report said the administration in panama and other 
countries pursued an inconsistent human rights policy 
concern for human rights violations and for a lack of 
democratic practices is too often voiced at the 11th hour when the 
administration faces a volatile situation with potential national 
security implications it said

bill mcfarland believes his rising medical claims 
for a diabetic condition cost him his job along with his company 
health insurance but today he has hope in a new state law that he 
thinks will save myself and my family from potential financial 
ruin 
massachusetts universal health care act was signed into law 
last week by gov michael s dukakis a democratic presidential 
contender who has touted it as an example for the rest of the 
country the firstinthenation measure promises to make 
affordable health insurance available to all residents rich or 
poor working or unemployed by 1992 
mcfarland 53 knows something about health insurance the job 
he lost was as a chief fraud investigator for a major massachusetts 
insurance company his employer of 13 years 
while other factors may have been involved in his termination 
mcfarland is convinced that the claims he filed for six 1000 
diabetesrelated eye operations played a major role 
and since he began working as a selfemployed financial 
consultant mcfarland has found himself effectively in a catch22 
situation in trying to get health insurance because his diabetes 
is considered a noncoverable preexisting condition 
my efforts have indicated to me i couldnt even get a policy 
that would cover diabetes irrespective of the dollars of premium i 
were able to pay he said in other words i can get coverage 
except for the coverage that i need 
enter the massachusetts universal health care plan under which 
by 1992 or possibly sooner the state will broker pooled insurance 
for small businesses and individuals which participants can buy 
into on a sliding fee schedule based on their income 
the details of what these plans will offer will be decided later 
by the new state agency that will manage the system but catherine 
dunham dukakis health policy adviser said preexisting 
conditions will definitely be covered 
this is really landmark legislation mcfarland said its 
recognizing in my judgment that health care is a right rather 
than a privilege 
dukakis says the fouryear phasein will cost the state 6452 
million minus about 225 million in projected medicaid 
costcutting but some estimates have run as high as 12 billion 
the law would extend coverage to about 600000 massachusetts 
residents under age 65 currently without health insurance or 
roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth 
this would be done in stages and through a variety of 
approaches from extending medicaid benefits for disabled adults 
and children to state brokered pooled insurance for small 
businesses and individuals 
by 1992 all employers with more than five fulltime employees 
must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment 
surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured 
jeannette capone 52 lives in athol with her healthy 
14yearold daughter and her 68yearold husband who has chronic 
emphysema and hasnt been able to work for a dozen years 
when her family was younger and she had five children living at 
home capone briefly went on welfare but she hated the 
condescension she felt from neighbors and welfare workers so she 
found work in parttime jobs that would allow her to continue 
caring for her homebound husband 
today capone does light cleaning for a company that recently 
began offering health insurance to fulltime employees but capone 
isnt covered because she only works about 20 hours a week 
capone gets free indigent medical care for herself and her 
daughter through her local hospitals emergency room 
her husbands major medical expenses are covered by medicare 
but she still has to pay for the seven medications he has to take 
costing 40 to 45 a week 
what breaks me up is that i can apply for welfare i can apply 
for medicaid and all her medical expenses will be paid she said 
but to be eligible she would have to quit her job 
i want to work i want to help and do things on my own she 
said 
the state this year will allow disabled adults like her husband 
to buy into the medicaid program according to their ability to pay 
and in 1992 most employers will be required to offer health 
insurance to employees working at least 20 hours per week

president reagan warned today that continuing 
iranian terrorist and military attacks against neutral parties 
will be very costly to iran and its people 
reagan added comments on iran to his weekly radio speech which 
dealt mostly with trade policy as officials disclosed that his 
administration will expand the us role in the persian gulf by 
allowing american warships to aid neutral merchant ships under 
attack 
we are very pleased with the role that the european allies are 
playing in a cooperative effort to counter the iranian mining 
threat and to help protect freedom of navigation the president 
said in his speech from camp david 
such cooperative efforts supported by our gulf arab friends 
offer the best means of deterring iran and enhancing gulf 
security reagan said 
working together he said we can put new life into un 
security council efforts to end the increasingly bloody inhumane 
iraniraq war and remove the root cause of tensions in the gulf 
our role in this war is neutral and we do not seek to confront 
iran the president said however its leaders must understand 
that continued military and terrorist attacks against 
nonbelligerents and refusal to negotiate an end to the war will be 
very costly to iran and its people 
the plan for a more active role in the gulf is a direct result 
of the mining of a us frigate and mondays extensive fighting 
between iranian and us forces administration officials said 
friday 
the administration is seeking support from congressional leaders 
and allied governments for the new policy under which navy 
warships would no longer ignore iranian attacks on merchant ships 
that werent flying the american flag 
if a us warship observed an iranian attack and was close 
enough to intervene it would have the authority to do so said the 
officials who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified 
its a random targetofopportunity approach designed to 
throw the iranians off guard said one source 
the us has since last summer guarded americanflagged kuwaiti 
tankers which had come under special fire from iran in the gulf 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee confirmed the new policy had been discussed friday with 
congressional leaders he said the policy would enable us navy 
vessels to defend themselves fully and to take appropriate action 
to deal with specific circumstances 
although aspin refused to discuss specifics another capitol 
hill source who was briefed on the matter said this will give a 
lot of authority to local commanders and a lot of leeway to do as 
they see fit 
the new policy assumes iraq at war with iran for 7 years will 
not attack neutral merchant ships operating between neutral ports 
it thus is intended to apply specifically in cases of neutral 
merchant ships under iranian attack 
our purpose is not to get into a war with iran said an 
official our purpose is to secure safe passage for neutral 
shipping moving back and forth between neutral ports 
the sources stressed the policy change did not entail an 
extension of the us military umbrella to foreignflag ships in 
regular convoys even under the new policy only ships flying the 
american flag will be entitled to doortodoor protection in 
convoys 
also rejected in formulating the new policy were suggestions 
that navy warships start protecting americanowned ships that fly a 
foreign flag of convenience the sources said 
because of those decisions the pentagon hopes it can avoid the 
assignment of additional ships to the gulf to implement the new 
policy the officials said 
the new policy will extend in certain cases however to 
westernoperated oil rigs in the gulf the sources said 
the officials citing the need to keep iran guessing 
refused to say when the administration intended to implement the 
new policy one source said it could happen soon maybe next 
week but refused to elaborate 
another official suggested the timing could still be affected by 
ongoing consultations with congressional leaders and with us 
allies such as britain and france that have their own warships in 
the region 
aspin said specifics about the policy are classified 
there is a decision in the sense that we know where we want to 
go now said one official but were still consulting with some 
people and its not in our interest to offer details to iran 
the change which defense secretary frank c carlucci and top 
aides began outlining on capitol hill on friday is a result of the 
mining of the us frigate samuel b roberts april 14 and last 
mondays extensive fighting between iranian and us forces the 
officials said 
us forces sank or crippled six iranian vessels that challenged 
them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in retaliation for 
the mining of the roberts 
top defense officials argued to the white house the united 
states had to do more to deter iran from sowing additional mine 
fields in the gulf said the sources the pentagon further argued 
that irans response to the us strike on monday was so utterly 
intemperate just lashing out that something had to be done one 
official said 
at one point monday iranian gunboats began firing on oil rigs 
and western ships in an oil field that had not been the scene of 
earlier fighting 
according to the sources the upcoming changes will not affect 
the socalled rules of engagement the guidelines given navy 
commanders spelling out the conditions under which they may shoot 
for example the need for radio challenges and the range between 
forces

george is a gander in love but the 
object of his affection is indifferent to his attentions and might 
not even notice if she stepped on him 
george a canada goose is hung up on a black cow named gracie 
in an odd couple courtship rivaling that of jessica the cow and 
her moose 
farmer al jones first noticed the peculiar relationship during 
the goose mating season last year 
there at the first last spring i just figured old george had 
been out in the spring sun too long i couldnt help but notice how 
he would follow the cow everywhere she went jones said he 
even started sleeping with her 
jones said he was the only one who noticed and didnt tell 
anyone else 
george eventually came to his senses but when he started up 
again earlier this spring jones told his wife and daughter about 
the birds bizarre love life 
they thought it was a joke but jones told them to look for 
themselves 
he just follows her around like thats his mate said jones 
daughter sarah 20 
george wants nothing to do with the rest of the large flock of 
geese on the farm and doesnt show an interest in any other cow but 
gracie jones said 
and i would notice how old george would try to flirt and carry 
on with gracie he said why he would get right up in her face 
and make the strangest rackets youve ever heard like he was 
trying to get the cow to come fly away with him 
ms jones said she doesnt think george would try to hurt anyone 
who interfered although the bird did charge a newspaper reporter 
who tried to get close enough to snap a photograph 
when it started over this spring he seemed bolder and more 
romantic than last year jones said 
george has been a member of the flock at jones farm for about 
five years ms jones said she thinks he was hatched there but 
its hard to tell because the flock is large and gets mixed up with 
migrating geese making pit stops 
gracie meanwhile doesnt take an active part in the 
relationship 
george calls all the shots and does all the flirting jones 
said gracie just goes along to see what will happen next 
gracies attitude mirrors that of jessica a hereford cow in 
shrewsbury vt who was courted for 76 days from in the fall and 
winter of 198687 by a lovesick bull moose

major efforts to restore tropical forests 
could bring an important slowdown in the expected greenhouse 
effect warming of the earth according to a study of forest needs 
growing trees absorb carbon dioxide the principal gas 
responsible for the warming and break the gas down to incorporate 
carbon in their woody tissues a growing forest also adds carbon to 
the soil 
it does provide an important lag time while we do 
important things in other areas like reorient national energy 
policies said lori heise a researcher at the worldwatch 
institute and one of the authors of the study released saturday 
the institute is a washingtonbased environmental research 
organization it has frequently advocated increased conservation 
and use of renewable resources to replace fossil fuels 
carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere in the burning of 
all fossil fuels it warms the earth by trapping heat that normally 
would be radiated out to space 
most scientists believe the earth is warming with potentially 
large changes in rainfall patterns energy demand cropgrowing 
areas and a rising sea level to threaten lowlying areas 
about 40 percent of the earths land area or 128 billion 
acres is covered with forest of which about 73 billion acres was 
tropical forest in 1980 the worldwatch study estimates that about 
32 million acres an area the size of connecticut or northern 
ireland is lost every year 
in their study of current tropical forest issues heise and 
coauthor sandra postel estimated that tropical countries need to 
restore about 250 million acres of forest to repair damage to soils 
and streams 140 million acres to supply fuelwood and 25 million 
acres for timbering 
counting overlap and wood used for fuel in the near term they 
estimated that about 300 million acres of new tropical forest could 
extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while the trees mature 
which could be 30 or 40 years from planting 
this would cover an area a bit smaller than arizona california 
nevada and oregon 
in an admitted backoftheenvelope calculation postel and 
heise estimated that the growing trees could remove 860 million 
tons of carbon from the atmosphere each year until the trees 
matured this would be about 47 percent of the total carbon 
currently being released by forest destruction 
irving mintzer a researcher for the world resources institute 
who has studied the greenhouse effect said the estimates of his 
counterpart organization are not trivial amounting to about 15 
percent of carbon released by all fossil fuel combustion but we 
should not be seduced into thinking reforestation can solve the 
warming problem he said 
slowing the destruction of tropical forests has the additional 
benefit of reducing emissions of methane another greenhouse gas 
mintzer said 
the world bank the world resources institute and united nations 
agencies launched an effort in late 1985 to invest 8 billion 
counting government and private investments in reforestation over 
the next five years 
the worldwatch study said the success of the effort would depend 
on efforts individual countries make and those in turn would 
depend on mobilizing international private organizations and 
foundations and local private groups 
indeed what is needed in the coming decade is an effort 
somewhat akin to the agricultural green revolution of the sixties 
a dedication to developing genetically improved tree species and to 
extending widely the technical and financial resources for 
reforestation said the worldwatch paper 
to plant the forests they call for by the year 2000 would mean 
planting 17 billion trees per year a massive undertaking the 
researchers said

michael g french no longer faces a 
firstdegree rape charge but the founder of a support program for 
spouse abusers says he still faces the trial of restoring his 
reputation 
there always will be people out there scratching their heads 
saying he got off only because there was not enough proof 
french said after the grand traverse county prosecutors office 
dropped the charge last week the accusation itself will remain a 
stain as long as im around 
french 43 was arrested in november 1986 and charged with 
firstdegree criminal sexual conduct after allegedly assaulting a 
39yearold traverse city woman the previous month 
assistant prosecutor arnie white said he dropped the charge 
because the woman refused to cooperate with prosecutors she 
refused to comply with a court order requesting medical and 
psychological records told her attorney she would not testify and 
finally indicated she wanted to drop the whole thing white 
said 
richard zerafa the womans attorney said she was not opposed 
to dropping the charge but said she wasnt willing to disclose 
personal information 
french said the accusation not only cost him thousands of 
dollars in lawyers fees but also cost him an estimated 50000 in 
revenue for the time out support program he started in september 
1985 two years after he pleaded guilty to assaulting an 
exgirlfriend 
referrals from local courts and community groups stopped after 
he was charged french said 
its been pretty scary i was laboring under the 
misconception that a man was innocent until proven guilty and i 
found in a lot of ways it isnt true he said

secretary of state george p shultz 
acknowledged saturday he had many differences in his talks with 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev but he tried to minimize 
the disagreements 
gorbachev speaking with shultz had made a scathing attack on 
the sermons he said president reagan and other us officials 
had delivered about soviet behavior 
the soviet news agency tass in a dispatch distributed friday 
after shultz ended two days of talks in moscow quoted gorbachev as 
telling shultz that ussoviet relations are in need of a 
drastic restructuring 
gorbachev complained that everything that has been achieved in 
sovietamerican relations is being ascribed to the policy of 
strength and putting pressure on the soviets 
he accused us officials of constantly barraging their soviet 
counterparts with demands terms and grievances about human 
rights in the soviet union we are not going to reeducate the 
united states and do not recognize it has any right to reeducate 
us gorbachev told shultz 
the soviet leader was most distressed with a speech in 
springfield mass on thursday in which reagan complained about 
soviet aggression worldwide reagan said that until it ended the 
world cannot know true peace 
shultz on a sightseeing tour of kiev the capital of the 
ukraine said the superpowers have had lots of difficulties as 
well as lots of accomplishments 
there have been some very tough parts to every meeting on both 
sides shultz said he has things to say i have things to say 
and there are always some informative parts and there are positive 
parts 
later flying from kiev to tbilisi the capital of the soviet 
republic of georgia shultz and other us officials sought again 
to convince reporters that gorbachevs statement did not represent 
new strains with the united states 
as if to underscore that the dialogue will continue charles e 
redman the state department spokesman announced that shultz would 
meet with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in geneva 
may 1112 to continue preparations for reagans summit with 
gorbachev in moscow may 29june 2 
shultz called the tass account and stories based on it 
overblown and he defended reagans tough rhetoric 
i think perhaps there is an overreaction to the springfield 
speech shultz said 
the president has always taken the view that i agree with 
that we have to state our views realistically all the time and we 
have to act in terms of the things we think need to be done 
shultz said he would keep stressing a need to improve human 
rights conditions in the soviet union 
little progress was reported on the focus of shultzs talks in 
moscow negotiating a treaty to cut in half the superpowers 
arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons 
shultz visited kiev and tbilisi for sightseeing before heading 
sunday for brussels to brief the north atlantic treaty organization 
on his moscow talks 
in kiev the ukrainian capital he visited the site of a world 
war ii german atrocity 
we have to say to ourselves always never again shultz 
declared in tribute to the 30000 jews and 70000 other ukrainians 
the german invaders herded into a ravine at babi yar and 
machinegunned in september 1941 
stressing the heavy jewish toll shultz said this was among 
the first places where we saw the holocaust and the slaughter of 
jews 
his visit fell on the jewish sabbath shultz laid a wreath at a 
monument the soviets erected in 1976 and observed a minute of 
silence 
the american envoy also visited an unfinished us consulate in 
kiev the third largest city in the soviet union construction of 
the mission has been halted and no date has been set for completion 
american officials cite security concerns a tighter budget and 
congressional opposition but shultz favors opening the consulate 
for the wider knowledge it would bring of the soviet union 
our plan if we move ahead is to have what we call an 
unclassified post staffed by five or six americans he said 
the idea is not to have any sensitive material in the consulate 
and thereby not make it a target for soviet eavesdropping

about 100 rescue workers combed the wreckage 
of a grain elevator complex today for two of three men missing 
after an explosion leveled the facility while boats dragged a 
river alongside the granary for a third man authorities said 
fridays explosion killed two other workers at the adm growmark 
complex and authorities said there was only a very small 
chance the three missing men were alive 
three others were injured in the fiery blasts 
by morning workers using bulldozers and cranes had cleared the 
site of about 50 percent of the twisted metal chunks of concrete 
and piles of corn and soybeans left strewn over the site by the 
explosion said an official at the disaster command post who would 
not identify himself 
dogs were used to sniff through the grain piles but had found no 
sign of the missing men workers remained cautiously hopeful today 
that they might still be alive the official said 
it would be very small but yes of course there is hope he 
said 
authorities believe the two blasts which leveled grain silos 
and an office building may have been sparked by ignited grain dust 
as many as six boats dragged the des plaines river for the body 
of the third missing man who was believed to have been thrown off 
a barge by the force of the explosions and four divers searched 
downstream friday authorities said 
boats continued the search today but winds and choppy water 
kept divers out of the water authorities said 
a gnarled life jacket was found in the river but there was no 
sign of the missing man romeoville fire department capt john 
ramos said 
the fiery blasts likened by witnesses to results of dynamite or 
a tornado ripped through the adm growmark complex along the river 
about 40 miles southwest of chicago late friday morning officials 
said 
authorities identified the dead as dale brent slatton 28 of 
newark ill and mark d stewart 20 of anchor both worked at the 
elevator stewart part time while he studied agriculture at joliet 
junior college 
joliet police sgt david saxon identified the missing as michael 
dupris 23 of bourbonnais daniel mclaughlin 18 of manhattan 
ill and don zack 30 of joliet 
the explosions shattered windows in homes east of the elevator 
complex and sprayed grain and rubble burying a tractortrailer rig 
i thought it sounded like a tornado or something said bob 
butterfield 64 a wilmington farmer who witnessed the blast i 
started running but i was knocked down 
he said he was rolling on the ground when he saw the four 
100foot concrete silos falling 
it was falling straight down like it had disintegrated he 
said its gone totaled level complete just like dynamite 
authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first 
explosion which apparently ruptured a natural gas main about 11 
am and touched off a second blast moments later said joliet fire 
chief george plese 
fairly heavy levels of dust almost like a dense fog would 
have had to accumulate to set off such a powerful blast said ralph 
regan a safety manager with the us department of agriculture 
joliet fire batallion chief richard colbert said the dust can be 
highly volatile like petroleum 
david munchalfen a security guard at the facility said there 
had been four silos at the site and only a sheetmetal covered 
grain dryer remained standing one of the silos each of which 
could hold about 100000 bushels crushed the adjacent onestory 
office building 
bill contos 26 of joliet a boat pilot working near the 
elevator site said the second blast was just like a big ball of 
flame the whole length of the elevator 
two people were taken to st joseph medical center one of them

not yet six months old guidelines designed to 
produce uniformity in sentencing federal convicts are prompting 
widespread dissatisfaction among the judges who have to impose the 
prison terms 
judges are complaining about being turned into accountants 
barred from using their judicial experience discretion and 
intuition 
my general reaction is that theyre unwieldy and 
timeconsuming said us district judge thomas ballantine jr of 
louisville ky he suggested the goal of the new rules to make the 
punishment fit the crime will not always be met 
i question whether a fellow who goes into a bank intending to 
get 50000 and comes away with 500 is any less culpable than the 
fellow who got the whole 50000 he said 
the national association of criminal lawyers last month endorsed 
a challenge to the guidelines filed by a woman who must receive a 
6year sentence in florida for cocaine smuggling although she has 
no previous record 
there have also been other court challenges to the sentencing 
guidelines with varying results according to nacl officials 
the guidelines are cold and implacable and as immutable as a 
computer said james ideman a federal trial judge in los angeles 
who was one of 20 judges who met last week in pasadena to discuss 
their concerns over the guidelines 
but other judges among several interviewed by the associated 
press said there is enough leeway to suit the aims of justice 
we could still go above or below the guidelines by citing the 
special circumstances of certain cases said judge howard munson 
of syracuse ny id like to see how it works first 
judge thomas a wiseman jr of nashville tenn said his 
colleagues are virtually unanimous in believing the guidelines 
will need a major overhaul 
wiseman vice president of the federal judges association said 
one problem is limits placed on use of probation 
wiseman said probation works for the overwhelming majority of 
inmates who receive it as an alternative to doing time 
citing his own judicial district in tennessee as an example 
wiseman said only 7 percent of those convicted criminals given 
probation since 1981 are accused of committing new crimes or 
violating their probation 
this tells me that supervised probation makes social good 
sense because over 93 percent of these people are rehabilitated 
he said 
the probation system could yield savings nationwide for 
taxpayers of 2 billion a year wiseman said but he added that the 
system is threatened by the new sentencing guidelines 
the guidelines adopted under a federal law and applying to 
people convicted of crimes after nov 1 are expected to increase 
the prison population by 10 percent in the next decade 
federal prisons now hold more than 42000 inmates a 75 percent 
jump since 1980 
the guidelines increase prison terms for robbery fraud 
forgery drug violations and a host of other crimes 
and for the first time federal judges are required to impose 
prison terms for many whitecollar criminals for example 
corporate executives convicted of antitrust offenses such as 
pricefixing must serve prison terms only 28 percent of those 
convicted of antitrust crimes were being sent to prison previously 
federal appeals court judge william wilkins who headed the 
commission that drew up the guidelines said a main objective is to 
convince the public the criminal justice system is fair 
theres a feeling in america that the whitecollar criminal is 
able to steal with a pencil and get away with it while the 
18yearold kid who steals with a gun goes to prison for a long 
time he says theres something unfair and inequitable about 
that system were going to change it 
but critics contend the new rules try to impose mathematical 
precision on cases that demand individual attention 
there are 43 different categories for all federal crimes and 
the length of a prison term is determined by the type of crime and 
the defendants prior criminal record 
minimum and maximum penalties at each level do not vary more 
than 25 percent and judges are barred from deviating unless the 
case involves factors not considered by the commission that drafted 
the guidelines 
these guidelines have turned us almost into accountants 
said a judge in new jersey who requested anonymity i want to 
look a guy in the eye and say i believe in you ive looked hard 
at your case and i think you can make it 
the guidelines also face a constitutional attack by federal 
public defender groups who say congress improperly delegated 
legislative duties to a judicial body the commission that drew up 
the guidelines 
it is likely to take several years for that lawsuit to reach the 
supreme court for final resolution

the white marble headstone on vladimir 
mikhalevs grave is a reminder in this bastion of world war ii 
valor that he died in afghanistan but there is no monument to 
those who fought the war the soviets didnt win 
the soviet unions 115000 troops are to begin the longawaited 
march home this spring and the nation must deal with the problem 
of how to remember those who served and those who died in 
afghanistan 
the human losses suffered since soviet soldiers entered 
afghanistan in december 1979 and the emotional wounds were 
unmentionable topics in 1981 when mikhalev 23 was buried in 
chizhukovskoye cemetery among the heroes of world war ii 
the troops were sent in to defeat a revolt by anticommunists 
and leave behind an afghan army capable of standing on its own 
neither goal was fulfilled war weariness has set in and soviets 
are now anxious for withdrawal 
the afghan war has left many returning soldiers deeply disturbed 
by their tour of duty in that asian land drug addiction a 
predilection for violence apathy disease crippling wounds and 
broken marriages also are byproducts of the afghan war 
significantly the veterans are called the afghans by many 
soviets a clear sign say many returning soldiers that they are 
branded as outcasts 
in few other cities is the contrast between the social status of 
afghan veterans and those who struggled against the nazis more 
apparent than in minsk a hero city virtually destroyed in 
world war ii and rebuilt as a monument to soviet suffering and 
perseverance 
every major intersection and park has a war memorial or statue 
depicting a local hero here and in other cities veterans of what 
is known as the great patriotic war proudly wear their medals and 
campaign ribbons 
but not a single memorial has been erected in the soviet union 
to the soldiers killed in the 8yearold soviet military 
intervention in afghanistan 
the sole reminders are the stern young faces and bronze busts of 
young men staring from graveyards around the country few 
tombstones say the youths were killed in afghanistan but all who 
pass by know the meaning of the inscription he died while 
fulfilling his internationalist duty 
at chizhukovskoye cemetery the plaque on vladislav ivanovskys 
headstone is engraved with rare directness perished in 
afghanistan 
an estimated 10000 soviets died in the war that was 
unmentionable until soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs drive for 
glasnost or openness made it acceptable conversation 
the casualty estimates by western sources pale in comparison 
with the 20 million soviets killed during world war ii but grief 
is no easier for survivors of afghanistan victims and veterans 
from both conflicts acknowledge the problem goes deeper than 
numbers 
its been 40 years since world war ii sergei kuznetsov told 
an american reporter at a recent meeting of afghan vets in moscow 
we are sometimes an uncomfortable reminder to those accustomed to 
peace 
soviets cling to the euphemisms used to label their activity in 
afghanistan denying it was a war contending they never sought 
victory and always lowering their voices when the subject comes up 
it cannot be said that we went there to win we went there to 
help explained alexander maslov a metal worker in minsk who 
alongside his twin brother mikhail served two years in kabul the 
leadership of afghanistan asked us to help 
a tone of defensiveness permeates his discussion of the war 
there is no reason to consider this a mistake the 24yearold 
veteran said referring to the kremlins decision to send in 
troops if it were necessary we would do it again 
the maslov twins contend afghanistan veterans receive priority 
for housing and jobs yet each lives with his wife and child in a 
single room of a city dormitory 
staterun media have come a long way in the past few years in 
acknowledging that soviet soldiers were involved in combat and that 
there was resistance at home from fearful mothers of draftage 
boys to advisers at the top levels of power 
the soviets experience in afghanistan is similar to us 
soldiers service in vietnam but the vietnam war was brought home 
to americans daily through media coverage that focused as much on 
individual suffering as on the political issues involved 
in contrast soviet media have carefully sanitized reports to 
cast the conflict as a situation around afghanistan brought 
about by imperialist interference 
spurred on by glasnost about 2000 afghanistan veterans groups 
have sprung up around the country to talk to school children about 
their service to help widows and mothers and to talk over 
experiences they say outsiders dont understand 
in moscow sergei kuznetsovs group which gathers on occasional 
saturdays has found a medium in song for issues most of the men 
find difficult to openly discuss 
the mournful ballads about buddies killed in battle and the 
frustration of fighting a distant and little understood war have 
been collected and issued by the young guard recording company 
one song reflects veterans disillusionment and a glimmer of 
the belief that soviet involvement in a foreign civil war was 
pointless in part it says 
they fight for the prophet mohammed 
while we defend only our soviet truck 
the return a short documentary making its way into soviet 
theaters for the first time shows wounded soldiers and blown up 
tanks and talks with troubled veterans and a bereaved mother 
im a terrible enemy of this war says a tearful klavdia 
ilyin with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in the 
background i dont see why our children are there 
newspapers have announced fundraising campaigns to erect 
monuments to the soldierinternationalists and articles in the 
national dailies have decried the secondclass treatment of afghan 
veterans by those who dont want to be reminded of the war 
most people think our boys have been down there planting 
flowers and building roads observed one world war ii veteran in 
moscow how can they earn the respect they deserve when so few 
know what they have done

said saturday hes not sure jesse jackson is even interested in the 
no 2 spot on the democratic ticket adding that he and jesse 
jackson have one overriding goal a democratic victory in 
november 
the massachusetts governor continued to take shots at the reagan 
administration on a variety of issues testing themes for the fall 
campaign now that he has moved into a commanding position in the 
democratic nomination fight 
foreign policy and attorney general edwin meeses problems at 
the justice department were his targets for saturday 
im not here to beat up on the current administration they 
have have enough problems and the justice department especially 
these days if there is a justice department dukakis told about 
300 people at the old bethlehem steel headquarters in the lehigh 
valley 
dukakis campaigned hard across pennsylvania in preparation for 
tuesdays primary he also made a quick trip to gary ind in 
advance of that states may 3 balloting 
dukakis and jackson faced each other in a second debate in as 
many days in pittsburgh saturday night 
at the bethlehem event dukakis was asked about jacksons 
interest in the vice presidential nomination 
that is not what he said i asked him if he were interested 
but he didnt tell me dukakis said of an exchange they had in 
the friday night debate in philadelphia 
as you could see last night jesse and i have a very good 
relationship we respect each other dukakis said we happen to 
be very positive people we both understand that there is one 
overriding goal in this campaign and that is to win in november 
dukakis has a big lead in the polls in pennsylvania which has a 
beauty contest primary and separate elections for national 
convention delegates 
every single primary is important please dont pay any 
attention to the polls he told the union members we need a 
big turnout everybody has to vote and you have to vote not only 
for me but for my delegates 
dukakis began his day standing in front of the freighter 
tradewind at dockside in north philadelphia talking of 
federallocal partnerships when music suddenly blared 
what have we got here a symphony behind me said the 
massachusetts governor turning toward the ship 
then he noticed the greek flag being waved from the ships 
bridge 
were going to have a brief pause while we all appreciate 
this which he said sounded like a greek battle hymn from the 
revolution fo 1821 this is too much 
the greekamerican politician is a far more relaxed campaigner 
now that he has opened a big lead over jackson he mixes pleas for 
a big turnout tuesday with themes that he would use as the partys 
nominee in the fall 
were going to take back the presidency for the democratic 
party and for the country in november its out there to be won 
the people of this countryare ready for a change you know and i 
know we hear it every day dukakis told about 100 people at a 
machinists union hall his second stop saturday morning they 
want an attorney general we can be proud of not an atorney general

dukakis recalls his upset in the 1978 democratic primary when 
he as the incumbent lost to a lesserknow conservative candidate 
after leading by 50 points in the polls 
we were all looking at our statistics and we werent 
remembering that its out on the ballfield where you have to win 
that game he said 
as he has in recent days since his major new york vicory last 
tuesday dukakis have emphasized the tone he wants to set in the 
campaign a theme those who appear with him have adopted 
hes going to take the high road all the way to atlanta and 
all the way to the white house said rep bob borski dpa 
introducing dukakis at the union hall 
in particuarly dukakis rejects any suggestion of criticism of 
jackson 
its important that we run a strong and positive campaign 
dukakis said i dont think the american people are interested in 
what i think of jesse jackson or what he thinks of me they want to 
know what kind of leadership were going to provide for this 
country they want to know whether i have the strenght the values 
the experience and and the ability to lead this country 
he has also been working on how to include his cousin olympia 
who won an oscar for best supporting actress two weeks ago in his 
stump speech 
this has been an incredible two weeks for the dukakis 
familywho else but my cousin would hold up that oscar in front 
of a billion and half of people and say okay michael lets go

the reagan administration is studying the 
chinese reaction to the us attacks on iranian targets in the 
persian gulf to see if beijing has reversed its willingness to go 
along with an arms embargo against iran us officials said 
saturday 
winston lord the us ambassador in beijing informed chinese 
authorities about the us decision to retaliate against iran for a 
mine explosion that damaged an american warship and discussed the 
issue with chinese authorities said the us officials speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the united states has been pushing other security council 
members to enact an arms embargo against iran for refusing to 
accept a call by un secretary general javier perez de cuellar for 
a truce in the 7yearold iraniraq war 
while lobbying for the embargo the united states has been 
seeking continuous reassurances from china that it will not 
exercise its veto power if the rest of the un security council 
approves the ban 
chinese foreign minister wu xueqian said during a visit to 
washington last month that his government thought the ban was a 
poor idea but would not block it 
in their latest comments the chinese repeated their view that 
an arms embargo would be a mistake and expressed concern that the 
clashes in the gulf are creating an improper atmosphere for perez 
de cuellars mediation efforts the officials said 
the chinese did not say point blank they would veto an arms 
embargo one official said nevertheless he said some us 
government experts believe the chinese comments may represent a 
step away from their earlier vow of passivity 
chinas concern about an iranian arms embargo is more than 
diplomatic its arms industry has sold billions of dollars of 
weapons to both sides in the iraniraq war notably silkworm 
antiship missiles that have been fired at vessels in the persian 
gulf 
the officials noted that chinas view on the arms embargo 
remains a moot point because the soviet union another member of 
the security council has refused to go along at all the latest 
refusal came on friday during secretary of state george p shultz 
talks with soviet leaders in moscow 
you could argue its not totally clear what the chinese will 
do one official said but at this point it doesnt seem to 
make much difference because the soviets are still clearly opposed 
to the resolution

here is the text of president reagans 
weekly radio address as delivered saturday from his camp david 
retreat 
my fellow americans theres a memorable bit of dialogue between 
claude raines and humphrey bogart in the movie casablanca 
raines playing the vichy french police inspector asked bogart why 
he came to casablanca and bogart says it was for the waters 
but this is the desert replies raines there are no 
waters here and bogart unflappable as ever responds i was 
misinformed 
well when it comes to the issue of trade the american people 
have been misinformed we seem to hear every night on the evening 
news that the trade deficit is looming over our economy 
threatening at any moment to plunge us back into a second great 
depression 
well im sorry to disappoint these doomcriers but the economy 
is strong and getting stronger what you dont hear so often in the 
news is that the trade deficit has turned around exports are at 
record levels factories are expanding and more americans have 
jobs than ever before in our history 
whether its cars steel or high technology the label made 
in the usa is seen more and more around the world this good 
news doesnt get reported too much because the rising price of 
imports makes it seem like were importing more the truth is when 
you account for price changes the trade deficit has decreased and 
is now 20 percent smaller than it was during the third quarter of 
1986 
the fearmongers had their high day or their hey day i should 
say last october when the stock market fell 508 points in one day 
of trading many blamed the merchandise trade deficit and predicted 
a dire future for the us economy depression recession 
catastrophe and calamity was all we heard 
well i said at the time the us economy was in great shape 
and in fact in the six months since black monday weve seen 
unemployment drop from 59 percent to 55 percent the lowest since 
1974 weve had six more months of real growth in the longest 
peacetime expansion in us history and that growth has been 
impressive 48 percent during the last quarter of 1987 some 
catastrophe 
not simply content with predicting disaster some in congress 
have put together legislation that would damage our ability to 
compete with our trading partners everyone talks about wanting a 
level playing field but what congress would be doing is putting 
american workers and industries on the field with one hand tied 
behind their backs 
they call this a trade bill but theres a lot in it that has 
nothing to do with trade yes i want a trade bill and weve been 
working with congress in good faith to produce a bill that would 
open markets and improve americas competitiveness but we must 
guard against enacting legislation that would reverse the gains of 
the past five years 
the draft legislation does contain a number of important 
measures it enhances our negotiating authority in the ongoing 
international trade talks repeals the windfall profits tax and 
creates a retraining program for workers who have been laid off we 
strongly support these measures but it also contains provisions 
that are unacceptable 
ive made it very clear to congress i will veto this bill and 
im confident that my veto will be sustained then ill work 
vigorously to secure responsible trade legislation and urge the 
congressional leadership to schedule prompt action on the new bill 
as long as im president were going to keep traveling the road 
were on one of free and fair trade record sustained growth job 
creation rising incomes and technological leadership into the 21st 
century 
now id like to turn for a moment to events this past week in 
the persian gulf the actions that our forces took in the gulf were 
a measured response to irans resumption of minelaying and 
continued aggression against nonbelligerents we have completed 
these selfdefense actions and consider this incident closed i am 
extremely proud of the courage and resourcefulness of our military 
personnel in the persian gulf their performance under very 
difficult circumstances has been superb 
were also very pleased with the role the european allies are 
playing in a cooperative effort to counter the iranian mining 
threat and to help protect freedom of navigation such cooperative 
effort supported by our gulf arab friends offer the best means of 
deterring iran and enhancing gulf security 
working together we can also put new life into the un 
security councils efforts to end the increasingly bloody inhumane 
iraniraq war and remove the root cause of tensions in the gulf 
our role in this war is neutral and we do not seek to confront 
iran however its leaders must understand that continued military 
and terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal to 
negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to iran and its 
people 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

here is the text of the democratic partys 
weekly radio address as delivered saturday by senate majority 
leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
this is senator byrd i have good news congress is one step 
closer to passing the longawaited trade bill last thursday the 
house of representatives did its part the trade bill passed 
overwhelmingly 
now it is our turn in the senate next week we are going to 
send the trade bill to the president for his signature 
the trade deficit has got to come down americas standard of 
living is being threatened there are more of us working but fewer 
of us owning homes in most families it takes two people working 
to keep the american dream in sight and everyone is looking over 
their shoulders worried about the next crash on wall street 
year by year we have slipped further into debt the trade 
deficit like the budget deficit is in triple digits the trade 
deficit is up again that means fewer jobs for americans 
with this trade bill america will be telling the world watch 
out youve got competition we will be telling the world that 
america expects fair competition if you get access to our 
markets we get access to yours 
the trade bill is a positive step for america it is a good 
bill this bill creates programs for retraining workers and gives 
the president new tools to open up markets to american products it 
is not protectionist 
the trade bill is comprehensive it covers everything from 
exchange rates to better education for our children the trade bill 
establishes a strong new export policy at the same time it 
protects american inventions from piracy by foreign firms in 
addition this trade bill prevents foreign investors from 
dominating industries vital to our national security 
this trade bill is a reasonable response to a trade policy that 
hs gone awry it opens up new markets invests in people and ideas 
and creates new opportunities for american industries and workers 
to work together to make america competitive again 
we are at the 11th hour when it comes to dealing with our 
nations trade deficit this is no time to dillydally america has 
got to get moving again the trade bill gets us moving in the right 
direction 
but all this is at risk if the president vetoes the trade bill 
despite months of working with the president the congress is still 
unsure of his support the president is still waving his veto pen 
in the air 
the president is upset that the trade bill includes one small 
section to protect workers from suddenly being laid off without 
notice thats the issue the plantclosing legislation that you 
have been hearing about 
our bill says if your factory is going to close and you are 
going to lose your job you have a right to know 60 days in 
advance that is simple justice simple decency right now many 
workers get only a week or two or a day or two of warning that 
their jobs are about to disappear about a third of all american 
workers get no notice at all 
the administration does not like this provision i think the 
administration is dead wrong what they are saying is this it is 
ok to give golden parachutes to the big guys but it is not ok to 
give the little guy a warning that he is about to lose his job 
is that fair of course not 
i have seen the impact of factories suddenly closing in my own 
state of west virginia men and women who have loyally worked for 
years for a company suddenly are handed pink slips without warning 
go stand on the unemployment line all your hard work does not 
count thats the message 
the choice is simple if the president stands up for america he 
will sign the trade bill there will be no veto it will be a great 
day if the president vetoes the trade bill he will be sending 
another message the big boys with the golden parachutes count more 
than the little guy 
mr president at the 11th hour dont turn back the clock we 
need new policies not old politics mr president put away your 
veto pen and sign the trade bill when it comes to your desk

bill expected to be sent to his desk in the coming week 
senate democratic leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
however urged the president to sign the bill because it is no 
time to dillydally on the trade issue 
reagan and byrd exchanged views in the presidents weekly radio 
address delivered from camp david and the weekly democratic 
response to the presidential talk 
some in congress have put together legislation that would 
damage our ability to compete with our trading partners the

byrd told his radio audience we are at the 11th hour when it 
comes to dealing with our nations trade deficit this is no time 
to dillydally 
the majority leader took aim at reagans opposition to a 
provision in the bill that would require businesses with more than 
100 employees to give 60 days notice before closing a plant or 
instituting mass layoffs reagan says this provision supported by 
organized labor would damage the competitive position of american 
business and cause the loss of american jobs

decency 
right now many workers get only a week or two or a day or two 
of warning that their jobs are about to disappear he said

it takes a twothirds majority of both houses to pass a bill 
into law over a veto by the president the house passed the measure 
312107 on thursday a vote in the senate is expected in midweek 
the bill would strengthen laws against foreign unfair trade 
practices expand protection for workers who lose their jobs 
because of imports give the president authority to negotiate a new 
global trade agreement and punish the toshiba corp and a norwegian 
company for selling sensitive technology to the soviets

a pickup truck packed with tnt exploded 
in a crowded vegetable market in this northern port city saturday 
killing 54 and wounding 125 in lebanons bloodiest such bombing in 
nearly three years 
tripolis eight hospitals and clinics were filled to capacity 
with victims of the 845 am 245 am edt blast in the 
lowincome tabbaneh district the explosion knocked down several 
buildings gutted shops and set fire to dozens of cars 
police said the black mercedes pickup was loaded with vegetables 
and rigged with an estimated 330 pounds of tnt it went off as the 
area filled with midmorning shoppers on the seventh day of islams 
holy month of ramadan when moslems fast during daylight hours 
tongues of fire shot up into the air and i felt the earth 
shaking under me i fainted said ibtissam khodor a moslem 
housewife who was shopping when the truck exploded she spoke from 
her bed at nini hospital 
nineyearold ahmed touni wept as medical attendants pulled a 
white sheet over the body of his 29yearold mother at the islamic 
hospital 
my mother died i have no mom he cried 
no group claimed responsibility for the bombing in lebanons 
secondlargest city and police said they have no clues about who 
the bombers are or their motive 
earlier car bombings have been blamed on the civil war between 
syrianbacked moslems and israelibacked christians as well as 
other feuds involving palestinians syrians and israelis 
tripoli is 50 miles north of beirut and has a predominantly 
sunni moslem population of 850000 
saturdays explosion was the first major car bombing in lebanon 
this year acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni condemned it 
as a barbaric atrocity 
all hands must team up to stop these executioners from 
committing further such crimes he said 
a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to regulations said that several pedestrians and 
vendors were torn to pieces 
he said syrian troops in charge of tripolis security cordoned 
off the scene of the blast as ambulances with wailing sirens rushed 
victims to hospitals 
radio stations broadcast hospital appeals for urgent blood 
donations police said hospital morgues were packed with corpses 
many of them burned or mutilated beyond identification 
the car bomb was parked near a wall of a cemetery at the 
entrance to tabbanehs vegetable market several shops were gutted 
and dozens of cars parked nearby were reduced to smoldering piles 
of twisted metal 
many buildings collapsed and civil defense teams dug through the 
rubble in search of trapped victims firemen doused the scene with 
water to extinguish fires touched off by the blast glass shards 
littered a 150yard radius 
police said this was the worst car bombing since an 
explosiveladen vehicle exploded outside an ice cream parlor in 
tripoli on june 29 1985 killing 60 and wounding 100 
five people have been killed and 15 wounded in four relatively

president reagan warned irans leaders 
saturday that continued attacks on neutral countries and refusal to 
negotiate an end to the persian gulf war will be very costly to 
iran and its people 
the president in his weekly radio address delivered from camp 
david md said we do not seek to confront iran 
but he said irans leaders must understand that continued 
military and terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal 
to negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to iran and its 
people 
reagans tough comments came a day after administration 
officials let it be known that under a new policy the united 
states will allow american warships to assist neutral vessels under 
attack in the gulf 
the united states while remaining officially neutral in the 
7yearold iraniraq war has guarded americanflagged kuwaiti 
tankers from attack since last summer 
but the escort policy was expanded to allow us warships to aid 
neutral merchant ships under attack after the us frigate roberts 
struck a mine in the gulf on april 14 under the old rules which 
permitted retaliation only for attacks on americanflagged ships 
us forces retaliated last monday sinking or crippling six 
iranian vessels that challenged them after the americans destroyed 
two offshore platforms 
the actions that our forces took in the gulf were a measured 
response to irans resumption of mine laying and continued 
aggression against nonbelligerents the president said 
we have completed these selfdefense actions and consider this 
incident closed 
in a statement on the gulf saturday rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee said that the 
united states must face the issue of whether an intelligence 
failure was involved in the iranian minelaying incident 
irans minelayers have clearly found a large hole in our 
procedures a hole large enough to drive at least two minefields 
through he said we have to assume for planning purposes 
that more minefields have already been laid and we also have to 
assume that more minefields will now be laid 
aspin had said earlier that he suspected the mines were not laid 
on orders from the tehran government but by revolutionary 
malcontents regardless of who in iran ordered the minelaying we 
are back to a state of confrontation he said saturday 
the president in his radio speech said that he is extremely 
proud of the courage and resourcefulness of our military personnel 
in the persian gulf their performance under very difficult 
circumstances has been superb 
we are also very pleased with the role that the european 
allies are playing in a cooperative effort to counter the iranian 
mining threat and to help protect freedom of navigation such 
cooperative efforts supported by our gulf arab friends offer the 
best means of deterring iran and enhancing gulf security 
working together we can also put new life into the un 
security councils efforts to end the increasingly bloody inhumane 
iraniraq war and remove the root cause of tensions in the gulf 
reagan said

alabama has been chosen as the site for 
the nations first survivable state emergency operating center a 
disasterproof shelter designed to allow state government to keep 
running even during a nuclear attack 
many eocs date back to the 1950s said bill mcada a 
spokesman for the federal emergency management agency were 
looking for a modern approach to civil defense 
if funding is approved by the state legislature the facility 
would provide safe haven for the governor and other top officials 
to direct evacuation procedures and other emergency operations 
during a nuclear attack 
the population would be in disarray said j danny cooper 
director of the state emergency management agency they would be 
confused and afraid they would have confidence in those they 
have placed in high public office 
the federal agency chose alabama to receive 11 million in 
funding to build the center but only if alabama provides matching 
funds cooper said the state was chosen based on its letter of 
intent guaranteeing the center would provide for the number of 
state officials and personnel needed to coordinate disaster 
operations and resources 
cooper said recently that the facility has not yet been 
designed but it would have to be a subterranean windowless 
facility capable of accommodating as many as 270 members of state 
government necessary to ensure a return to normalcy that would 
include the governor top cabinet officials legislative leaders 
and judges 
walls several feet thick would protect inhabitants from 
radioactivity and a ventilation system would filter the air wells 
would be dug to provide an adequate water supply for at least two 
weeks 
it would not be the grand hotel said cooper referring to 
an exclusive resort on mobile bay it would provide food 
clothing and shelter 
more importantly cooper said would be the centers 
stateoftheart communications capability including retractable 
antennas and equipment that would be functional even under 
radioactive conditions such technology already is in place at 
federal facilities 
during a nuclear exchange the atmosphere would eliminate 
radio communications he said our facility would be the 
national model of a communications system that can function 
regardless of the situation 
in addition to a nuclear attack the center could be used during 
hurricanes tornadoes or any other natural or technological 
disaster such as a crisis at the states two nuclear power plants 
mcada said most states have some kind of emergency operations 
center but fema determined in a recent study that their 
capabilities were low and declining 
the continuity of government concept is one that fema will be 
pursuing very vigorously in the future said cooper

many us navy officers in the persian 
gulf eagerly had awaited the toplevel policy change that now 
allows them to intervene in iranian attacks on neutral merchant 
ships 
some expressed outrage in the past nine months over irans 
gunboat attacks on unarmed shipping and their own inability to do 
anything about them 
its like being a worldclass athlete whos always ready for 
the event but never gets to participate cmdr paul x rinn 
skipper of the us frigate samuel b roberts said recently 
the sweeping policy change may encounter strong objections in 
congress many lawmakers have opposed any step that could draw the 
united states into more confrontation with iran which has been 
fighting neighboring iraq for seven and a half years 
the us naval command in the middle east had no official 
reaction saturday to the policy swing a spokesman for the us 
joint task force middle east who spoke on condition of anonymity 
declined comment saying it was a matter for discussion among high 
administration officials 
but many us officers have privately made their feelings known 
in past months 
only two days before the reagan administration announced the 
policy change friday a senior navy commander described an incident 
in which he had to order one of his frigates to pull back from an 
iranian attack on a nonus flagged vessel 
the captain knew the rules but he really wanted to go after 
the iranian said the officer who spoke privately he asked 
for permission i told him no back off he was pretty unhappy i 
had to say it twice 
such officers have spoken hopefully of a policy change that 
would enable them to bring their firepower to bear 
if the iranians were going to attack one of our convoys 
theyd probably have done it by now one senior officer said 
but its pretty discouraging to watch them attacking these other 
people and not be able to do anything to stop it 
under a policy in effect since july when the us navy began 
escorting 11 reflagged kuwaiti oil tankers american warships could 
defend only ships flying american flags 
the policy included in socalled rules of engagement allowed 
the warships to provide humanitarian aid to a nonus flagged 
vessel in distress but only if the ship asked for it they could 
not intervene against the attacker 
thus us warships bristling with weapons were forced to stand 
off while iranian gunboats like the sabalan the frigate nasty 
as one norwegian captain calls it blazed away at unarmed vessels 
with virtual impunity the sabalan which usually goes for the crew 
quarters of its targets was severely damaged by us bombs in 
clashes monday 
indeed the plan for a more active role in the gulf is a direct 
result of the mining of a us frigate and mondays extensive 
fighting between iranian and us forces administration officials 
said friday us forces sank or crippled six iranian vessels that 
challenged them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in 
retaliation for the mining of the us vessel 
the washington officials stressed that the policy change does 
not mean the us navy will assume a broader role escorting 
merchant ships 
its a random targetofopportunity approach designed to 
throw the iranians off guard said one washington official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
this will give a lot of authority to local commanders and a 
lot of leeway to do as they see fit said another 
some officers say hints of a policy shift had been in the wind 
for months they speculated that the move came as a result of other 
highlevel changes including frank carlucci replacing caspar 
weinberger as defense secretary 
rear adm harold bernsen former commander of the us middle 
east force in the gulf was reported last year to have been denied 
expanded operating authority 
some officers felt that rear adm anthony a less a twostar 
admiral who replaced bernsen in late february was in a position 
if he wanted to argue the case anew with more clout 
one senior officer speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
believed a policy reappraisal was necessary because the us 
presence had not effectively discouraged iranian threats to 
international shipping 
the kuwait convoys have been a big success but the gulf is 
still a dangerous place for any ships not under that kind of 
escort he said

politicians and diplomats say 
president jose azconas already weak government has been crippled 
because of its apparent inability to stand up to the united states 
interviews with prominent hondurans as well as talks with 
foreign envoys and people in the street indicated that citizens of 
this old friend of the united states are peeved with what they see 
as yankee highhandedness 
local politicians said a series of events have prompted a 
fundamental review of ushonduran relations which they said 
probably will change definitively if not drastically 
in recent days hondurans have bristled at the transportation of 
a honduran national to the united states on cocaine charges done 
even though the honduran constitution prohibts extradition of 
honduran citizens 
many are angry about the use of honduran territory by the 
usbacked contra rebels in their fight against the nicarguan 
government 
and the maneuvers of 3200 american troops in honduras last 
month were also seen by many as another example of us dominance 
even a presidential decision monday to award a 
multimilliondollar compensation to a us citizen whose farm was 
expropriated in 1982 has incurred the peoples wrath 
yankee garbage out of honduras and if the yankees dont 
get out in honduras they will die about 2000 people chanted as 
they marched in the capital thursday 
the chants which rhyme in spanish would have sounded foreign 
on so many voices just a few months ago 
the march came two weeks after a mob sacked and burned the us 
consulate 
the demonstrators like others say azconas submission to us 
wishes in recent months has reached the point where honduran 
insitutions including the constitution are blatantly ignored 
despite the ire of the students who made up the core of the 
marchers most hondurans are far from antiamerican those 
consulted last week seemed especially hurt because the perceived 
slights are coming from a friend 
matta as an individual has no importance he was just a 
detonator said manuel acosta bonilla a lawyer and member of the 
directorate of the opposition national party 
he was referring to juan ramon matta who was arrested april 5 
and hustled out of the country and into the federal penetentiary in 
marion ill by honduran authorities working closely with us 
officials 
matta considered an international cocaine kingpin was one of 
the us druge enforcement agencys most wanted men 
if they can kidnap matta they can kidnap anybodys brother 
said truck driver marcos lezama the servileness of this 
president has no name 
there is complete indignation because of poor management of 
this matta situation said carlos montoya president of 
congress and a presidential hopeful for azconas liberal party in 
fall 1989 elections 
the image of azcona has been eroded he said but montoya 
said he doesnt think a military coup is possible 
the us congress would cut off aid and the economic 
situation here would go from bad to worse he said 
the armed forces governed honduras for nearly 20 years before a 
return to civilian rule in 1982 the military still continues to 
exercise much political power 
honduras is one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere with 
50 percent unemployment or underemployment 60 percent illiteracy 
and a per capita annual gross national product of just over 750 
gilberto goldstein a national party legislator agreed that a 
coup was almost out of the question because everyone involved 
would lose 
he said these are trying times for what had until a few months 
ago been an island of relative tranquility amid central americas 
turmoil 
but some good comes out of this he said it will make the 
united states realize its relations with honduras must be 
profoundly reanalyzed 
according to acosta bonilla it doesnt matter that the small 
left takes up this banner of resentment but it the resentment 
will consolidate the broader centerleft for a revision of the 
status quo 
meza said the presidential candidate who taps into this 
resentment will have an advantage 
our presidential campaign is virtually underway he said 
and no one who hopes to win can fail to take this resentment into 
account

a greek cycling champion pedaled a fragile 
plane 74 miles over the aegean sea saturday and broke the world 
record for humanpowered flight but the aircraft was destroyed in 
a crash landing 
a gust of wind snapped the tail boom off the ultralight daedalus 
88 which crashed into the sea just 10 yards short of the landing 
area on the island of santorini 3 hours after leaving the island 
of crete 
it happened in the last moments of the flight and the job was 
done i didnt worry about it the athletepilot kanellos 
kanellopoulos told a news conference in the greek capital he was 
not injured in the crash 
the situation in the landing area was too rough for this 
plane which is built for calm conditions i was under full control 
but the tail boom couldnt take the pressure said kanellopoulos 
who also broke the records for endurance and straightline 
humanpowered flight 
kanellopoulos 31 greek cycling champion for the past 14 years 
was flown to athens aboard an army helicopter shortly after the 
rough landing near the black sands of perissa beach on the 
southeast face of the volcanic island also known as thira 
the 72pound graphite epoxy and mylar plane designed by the 
massachusetts institute of technology fell after hitting a wind 
parallel to the beach said mit professor mark drela who was in 
one of the boats following the flight 
but drela the senior engineer responsible for the planes 
aerodynamic design said the project was definitely a success 
more than 500 islanders and foreign tourists gathered along the 
beach to watch the plane resembling oversized insect glide 
towards the sand 
the snapped tail boom caused the planes huge 112foot long 
wings to break dropping the pinkandsilver aircraft 10 feet into 
the water 
i was underwater so i forced my way through the cockpit and 
dove under the plane then i swam to shore the tanned blond 
cyclist said 
kanellopoulos pumped the pedals in the nose of the aircraft for 
3 hours and 55 minutes to fly from heraklion air base to santorini 
he lifted off at 706 am 1230 am edt and landed at 1100 
am 4 am edt 
the flight was intended to emulate the 3500yearold myth of 
daedalus a greek architect sculptor and engineer who flapped his 
way across the aegean from crete on wings of feathers and wax 
daedalus son icarus flew too close to the sun which melted the 
wax causing him to to fall to his death 
the previous world record for humanpowered flight was set by 
the light eagle a daedalus 88 prototype piloted by glenn tremml 
who flew 372 miles around edwards air base in california in 
january 1987 
kanellopoulos also shattered the record for straightline 
humanpowered flight set in 1979 by bryan allen who pedaled the 
gossamer albatross 22 miles across the english channel 
the third record broken was for flight duration the previous 
mark was held by allen with a time of 2 hours 49 minutes 
greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue 
craft had escorted the plane as it soared 15 feet above the aegean 
the flight came after a 36member team of mit experts waited for 
three weeks on the windswept island of crete for a suitable day to 
attempt the flight 
essential requirements were a calm sea southerly winds of less 
than 3 knots temperatures under 70 degress fahrenheit and 
visibility to the horizon according to steve k bussolari an mit 
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations 
conditions for the flight were ideal we even had a southerly 
tailwind bussolari said 
the southerly tailwind pushed the daedalus 88 over the agean 
waters at a rate faster than expected by the mit team with the 
plane averaging 185 miles per hour team officials said they had 
not expected the ungainly flying machine to go over 14 miles per 
hour 
we were predicting the low speeds because we had been 
estimating headwinds which are prevalent we have no idea where 
the tailwinds came from said project news director ken campbell 
in addition to kanellopoulos three other athletepilots had 
been standing by for 48 hours each in readiness for a possible 
record flight 
they were francis scioscia 27 of scranton pa greg zack 26 
of wilmington nc and 27yearold tremml the former 
worldrecord holder and a medical student from new haven conn

us mine sweepers on friday destroyed five such explosives 
pentagon officials said the navy examined the mines before they

leftist guerrillas battling the 
usbacked government said saturday they will prevent newly 
elected mayors from taking office and cited their recent 
assassination of one mayor 
a message broadcast by the rebels radio venceremos began with 
a call to all mayors in which the guerrillas said the fmln 
will not permit you to exercise your functions 
we warn that mayors will have to resign their posts or abandon 
their towns we will be strict in enforcing this measure the 
radio said 
the fmln is the farabundo marti national liberation front an 
alliance of five guerrilla groups waging an 8yearold campaign 
against usbacked forces 
the radio referred to the april 15 slaying by guerrillas of 
pedro ventura mayorelect of the eastern town of san isidro 
it said he was killed because he refused to withdraw he had 
been warned 
ventura represented the rightist party arena which won 
twothirds of the countrys 262 mayoralties in march 20 legislative 
and municipal elections 
the threat came a day after the supreme court admitted a writ 
filed by arena charging the incumbent christian democrats with 
fraud in counting votes for national legislators from the eastern 
province of la union 
the court did not say when it would rule definitively but it 
suspended certification of the disputed legislator from the 
province which means arena will have an outright majority when the 
new legislative assembly is installed may 1 
arena has 30 seats assured in the 60seat legislature which 
because of the suspension will have only 59 members until the la 
union case is resolved 
the count disputed by arena gave two of la unions three 
legislators to the christian democrats arena claims it won two of 
the three 
the disputed count gave arena a total of 30 deputies the 
christian democrats 23 and the national conciliation party seven 
but until the case is resolved the christian democrats who 
have formed an informal alliance with the conciliation party will 
have 22 seats 
an arenacontrolled legislature is expected to make president 
jose napoleon duartes last year in office an uphill struggle 
duarte is a christian democrat

french negotiators seeking to free three 
countrymen held by proiranian extremists flew away emptyhanded 
saturday after lastminute hitches 
the deal to free the hostages fell through because the 
kidnappers made lastminute demands that the french negotiators 
could not meet according to syrian and lebanese officials at 
beirut airport lebanese press reports said french officials had 
refused to pay ransom to the kidnappers 
the government of prime minister jacques chirac has been trying 
to free the three men before the first round of french presidential 
elections on sunday such a release could boost the chances of 
chirac who is favored to oppose president francois mitterrand in 
the final round of voting may 8 
a chartered swiss executive jet carrying the four french 
negotiators left beirut saturday for an unknown destination 
according to beirut airport officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity radio monitors in cyprus reported they heard the pilot 
say he was heading for paris 
the arrival of the 12seat falcon 50 in beirut from larnaca 
cyprus two hours earlier prompted speculation the release of the 
three frenchmen was imminent and that the jet had come to pick them 
up 
after a similar shuttle friday the planes pilot who would not 
give his name told reporters at larnaca airport we went to get 
the hostages but there were no hostages ready 
the three hostages are diplomats marcel fontaine and marcel 
carton and journalist jeanpaul kauffmann fontaine and carton were 
kidnapped separately march 22 1985 and kauffmann was seized later 
that year on may 22 
a fourth frenchman michel seurat a scientific researcher was 
kidnapped with kauffmann on may 22 1985 islamic jihad or islamic 
holy war which has claimed the abduction of all four said on 
march 5 1986 it had killed seurat seurats wife marie says 
french officials have confirmed her husband died in captivity 
syrian and lebanese officials said friday the release of the 
three other frenchmen was expected within hours dozens of

an underground preacher who spreads christian 
gospel in china was arrested in a beijing park after he came to 
hear us evangelist billy graham a religious rights activist said 
saturday 
xu yongzhe from chinas central henan province was detained 
april 16 one day before graham preached to more than 1500 people 
in a beijing church said jonathan chao director of the chinese 
church research center 
graham was in shanghai on saturday as part of his twoweek tour 
of china and could not immediately be reached for comment 
chao described xu as an itinerant evangelist who trains his 
followers to conduct preaching services and establish new 
nondenominational churches 
since 1980 xus team of evangelists has established more than 
3000 local churches that are loosely associated chao said his 
claim could not be independently verified 
chaos center is known in hong kong for having critical views of 
the chinese government 
china permits freedom of religion but religious activity is 
closely monitored by the state proselytizing to the general public 
is banned but preaching in the state churches is allowed 
there are 4000 statesanctioned churches in china the official 
patriotic catholic church which split with the vatican in the 
1950s claims more than 3 million members throughout china an 
unknown number of other chinese remain loyal to the pope 
china also says it has several million protestants 
xu worked outside the statesanctioned churches because if he 
worked with the state he would have been forbidden to expand the 
christian faith by preaching chao said 
chao said xu was arrested in 1982 for preaching and was put in a 
detention center for several years 
xu has since worked clandestinely in the countryside of central 
china spreading the gospel chao claimed 
chao said he was informed of xus arrest in a letter dated april 
20 from reliable christian sources inside china there was no way 
to independently confirm the information and authorities in beijing 
were unavailable for comment this afternoon 
according to the fourpage letter xu told a friend in beijing 
that he would come to the capital to see graham chao believes the 
letter was intercepted by authorities 
xu arrived in beijing on april 13 and was arrested three days 
later while walking in yuetan park with friends the letter says 
he was arrested because he wanted to hear billy graham 
preach said chao 
chao said he had no further updates on xus situation 
chao said his center publishes a weekly news report and a 
monthly magazine about religion in china he described himself as 
being critical of the religious policies of china which he said 
persecutes itinerant preachers

street clashes between members of 
rival parties left dozens injured saturday and police guarded 
scores of rallies leading up to this weeks elections police and 
newspapers reported 
a neighborhood leader in seoul died saturday after he was 
injured in a fight friday over how to distribute gift towels from a 
governing party candidate to voters one newspaper reported 
opposition politicians said the case showed irregular campaign 
methods by the democratic justice party 
major local newspapers said their surveys indicated the 
governing democratic justice party was likely to win a majority 
tuesday in the 299seat national assembly that would strengthen 
the position of president roh taewoo who won office in december 
with just 36 percent of the vote 
police said all available police forces were mobilized to 
watch 148 campaign rallies saturday the korean news agency 
yonhap reported the rallies were largely peaceful because of the 
heavy security 
at some rallies police in full riot gear lined up three or four 
deep along one side of the podium 
a dozen people were injured overnight when students armed with 
firebombs attacked a governing party office in the southern city of 
chonju and a nearby police station 
in the central city of taejon a campaign minibus covered with 
opposition party posters was set on fire overnight and gangs 
attacked opposition party supporters in some rural areas on 
saturday 
once again the opposition is split and the surveys showed 
governing party candidates leading for more than 90 of the seats 
being decided in 224 districts seventyfive other seats are being 
decided by nationwide vote proportions with the leading party 
predicted to win 38 of them 
the last assembly had 276 seats with 160 held by the democratic 
justice party 
in tuesdays voting 1045 candidates are competing for the 224 
district seats the winners will serve for four years compared 
with a fiveyear term for the president who is limited to one term 
in a news conference saturday opposition leader kim youngsam 
contended that our country will enter a gloomy period if the 
ruling party controlled by tycoons generals and corrupt 
bureaucrats wins a majority 
rival opposition leader kim daejung warned that the roh 
government would face popular outbursts if it continued the 
allegedly improper campaigning 
in december both kim daejung and kim youngsam insisted on 
running for president splitting the opposition vote 
under a new constitution that took effect in february the 
assembly has greater powers to investigate government actions and 
the president no longer can dissolve the legislature

french voters enjoyed a lull saturday on the eve of 
elections expected to determine who eventually faces off with 
president francois mitterrand a socialist acting like a social 
institution these days 
since the hectic twoweek official campaign ended friday the 
silence has been resounding no media appearances or campaigning 
were allowed on saturday 
even the political grease of voter surveys had run dry french 
law prohibits polls in the week before the elections 
even so voters had plenty to spin their wheels over 
the confrontation marks the first time in the 30 years of the 
fifth republic that a president and his own premier have faced one 
another in a presidential election 
all polls predict that mitterrand the 71yearold president 
seeking a second sevenyear term will square off in the may 8 
runoff with chirac frances 55yearold conservative premier 
they have cohabitated as the french put it since the 
rights victory in parliamentary elections in 1986 
the main interest in sundays voting then was reduced to 
numbers 
what percentage will mitterrand win will he be able to pick 
up enough communist and centrist votes to expand the 3537 percent 
the polls give him 
what will be the combined totals of chirac predicted to gain 
2224 percent and former centerright premier raymond barre 1617 
percent that number could give a good idea whether anyone can beat 
mitterrand in the final round of voting 
besides chirac 68yearold barre is the only other candidate 
with a whisper of a chance to make it to the runoff he was long 
the top rightist candidate before nosediving in the polls in the 
past two months 
barre has said he cant be counted out now but he pledges to 
support chirac if the premier comes out ahead in firstround 
voting chirac has vowed to do the same 
much also depends on backers of extreme right national front 
leader jeanmarie le pen le pens strident antiimmigration and 
french first appeal has won over an estimated 1012 percent of 
the electorate in an otherwise lackluster campaign 
actually voters will choose from nine candidates sunday 
theoretically it is possible to elect a president in the first 
round but the large number of candidates means that no one can 
expect to win the required absolute majority of votes 
other candidates in the race are andre lajoinie the official 
communist party candidate pierre juquin leader of a splinter 
communist reformist movement ecologist antoine waechter 
trotskyist arlette laguiller and another trotskyist pierre 
boussel 
the polls predict mitterrand will win the runoff no matter who 
he faces he has reshaped his image toward the center in recent 
months and has even been dubbed by the french with the avuncular 
nickname of tonton 
but chirac was closing the gap when the final surveys were 
published a week ago moreoever the undecided vote was high as 
much as 20 percent 
many political analysts say mitterrand must get 35 percent in 
the first round in order to win may 8 
on the right it was generally thought that the combined 
chiracbarre vote must total at least 43 percent to give 
conservatives a chance in the runoff 
however many of barres more centrist supporters may abandon 
chirac in the second round 
the polls open 8 am sunday and close in most areas at 6 pm 
in major urban areas however they remain open until 8 pm 
none of the candidates has come out with a detailed program 
focusing instead on generalities in his last television speech 
mitterrand stressed the need for solidarity equality of 
opportunity and the refusal of privileges for some people 
chirac has responded by accusing mitterrand of proposing 
nothing precise for our country he stands on his twoyear record 
as head of the government which he says started the country on the 
road back to prosperity

twentyfive years of romance turmoil 
romance treachery romance mystery and more romance were toasted 
by past and present stars of general hospital at a blacktie 
gala befitting the toprated daytime drama 
the abc soap which debuted april 1 1963 placed no 1 again in 
the most recent nielsen ratings but one of its original stars 
speaking at friday nights party at the ambassador hotel recalled 
its humble beginnings 
when we started i didnt think we were going to last 25 
minutes let alone 25 years it was very iffy said emily 
mclaughlin who as nurse jessie brewer is one of two original cast 
members still with the show we hit no 1 in 1968 and then we 
went down so far we were almost canceled 
we had a wonderful time recalled actor jack betts who was 
on general hospital during its first three years actor 
johnny beradino had been a ball player and had never done a soap 
before nor had i we never thought it would last and john kept 
saying hed have to go back and play baseball again 
betts character was written out of the show when he was sent to 
south america to do medical research and never came back 
general hospital has been consistently first in the daytime 
ratings although its locked in a tight race with cbs the young 
and the restless the show has been a huge success throughout the 
1980s 
nevertheless general hospital was on the brink of 
cancellation 10 years ago before gloria monty became executive 
producer and turned the show around 
the show became a pop phenomenon led by antihero luke and the 
headstrong laura a tainted romeo and juliet involved in murder 
rape and other shady activities their wedding in 1981 sent the 
ratings jumping off the chart with elizabeth taylor as a guest 
star for the wedding sequence 
although tony geary and genie francis who played the lovers 
have left there are enough plot twists and offbeat characters to 
keep the audience happy 
gloria monty has also left and been replaced by wes kenney

the show since the beginning rachel ames as the oftmarried audrey

two murder cases one of them 20 years 
old have been closed with the conviction of a man police 
considered a suspect from the beginning and whose arrest was 
sparked by a national television program 
to the women who knew him robert weeks was a clark gable 
lookalike but authorities say he was a man whose jealous rages led 
to the deaths of two women and most likely a third 
weeks was convicted friday in the 1968 murder of his exwife and 
the 1980 murder of a former girlfriend the jury recommended that 
he spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of 
parole 
i believe bob weeks is finally history said deputy district 
attorney mel harmon 
authorities had considered him the prime suspect in the killing 
of his exwife patricia weeks right from the beginning he also 
was convicted in the killing of cynthia jabour and police believe 
he also killed a san diego woman carol ann riley 
all three women vanished after agreeing to meet weeks for 
dinner all three had told him just before they disappeared that 
they were ending their relationship with him 
ironically it was weeks latest girlfriend a tucson ariz 
freelance writer who turned him in last year after seeing the 
television program unsolved mysteries and recognizing weeks as 
the man suspected of killing the women 
none of the bodies was ever found forcing prosecutors to put 
together a painstaking case of circumstantial evidence 
generally in a murder case youve got a body and you put on a 
medical examiner and he explains the cause of death said harmon 
we didnt have a body so we couldnt do that 
instead harmon put on members of the victims families former 
neighbors doctors anyone he could find with a connection to the 
victims and weeks in all 52 witnesses were called during a 
3weeklong trial 
many of the witnesses remembered weeks as very much a ladies 
man with a pencilthin mustache and dark hair that made him 
resemble clark gable 
we had to put on a whole lot of people so we could make it 
crystal clear that these disappearances couldnt be voluntary 
said harmon 
relatives testified that mrs weeks would never have voluntarily 
left her four young children 
a friend testified of seeing mrs weeks for the last time when 
she got a threatening phone call from weeks 15 days after their 
divorce the friend said he confronted weeks after the womans 
disappearance and that weeks matteroffactly replied she either 
had a nervous breakdown or is probably dead 
a doctor testified about treating mrs weeks several times for 
bruises that she suffered at weeks hands 
a friend of miss jabour testified that the real estate broker 
would never have gone off without her valued clothes or a 47000 
securities account 
and the father of miss riley recalled his daughter telling him 
she owed weeks one last dinner at which she was going to tell him 
of her engagement to a colorado doctor 
the real challenging part of the case was patricia weeks 
said harmon we had to go back years with family members who have 
done their best to block out the memory and the other people just 
didnt care that much about it 
harmon has a theory about the fate of the victims 
this fellow had a lot of interest in mining he knew where 
mineshafts were the prosecutor said if we knew where these 
mineshafts were i think wed find the remains of patricia weeks and 
cynthia jabour

emotions boiled over with violence as vendors 
failed to stop state lawmakers from selecting the place where the 
vendors work as the site for a convention center 
several scuffles broke out as about 100 vendors mostly 
immigrants from korea surged from a capitol meeting room trying 
to confront the lawmakers who were quickly escorted out by security 
officers 
ten honolulu police officers were dispatched to help a dozen 
security officers quiet the crowd in the capitol late friday night 
one korean woman collapsed apparently from emotion 
no no no went up the shouts as senate transportation 
committee chairman milton holt and house tourism committee chairman 
romy cachola announced agreement on the international market place 
in waikiki as site for the convention center 
some called the lawmakers traitors while others made death 
threats women wailed and sobbed uncontrollably as others grabbed 
and restrained several young men who attempted to chase the 
lawmakers 
tension had been building throughout the evening as the house 
and senate conferees exchanged proposals and then recessed for 
lengthy periods 
vendors have been staging rallies at the capitol since february 
and have attended every hearing to testify on the convention center 
issue 
ive been here 18 years and weve had all kinds of people here 
as lobbyists but this is the first time i went through this kind 
of experience said house speaker daniel kihano 
i just hope they vendors understand that the people who 
intend to develop the market place are putting up a lot of money to 
take care of their problems to relocate them said kihano 
won hee you who has served as a spokeswoman for the 900 
vendors said they fear the convention center will wipe out years 
of work to establish their businesses 
the measure will allow a private developer to exceed the citys 
280foot height limit on the fiveacre parcel and put up three 
400foot hotel and condominium towers 
in exchange for the additional height the developer has agreed 
to build a 625000 squarefoot convention center facility which 
would be turned over to the state such a facility would cost the 
state 150 million to 200 million to build according to cachola

israels security and intelligence services have 
become among the worlds most efficient years ago there was the 
successful raid on the entebbe airport then the destruction of the 
iraqi nuclear installation and now from all accounts the 
assassination of the no 2 man in the plo organization here is a 
look at the fabled institutions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when an assassination team gunned down the 
plos no 2 man at his villa in tunisia it was widely accepted as 
another daring action by the long arm of israels fabled security 
and intelligence services 
the slaying of khalil wazir 1500 miles from israel on april 16 
bore the fingerprints of the mossad the agency responsible for 
activities outside israels borders by all accounts it was quick 
decisive carried out with splitsecond timing and backed by 
israels air and naval forces 
israels intelligence has been able to gather precise 
information on locations of homes or installations and the 
movements of bodyguards teams have been able to make pinpoint 
attacks and often escape without detection 
although israeli officials declined public comment israeli 
sources privately acknowledged the killing was planned by the 
agency approved by the government and carried out by elite israeli 
commandos tunisia accused israel of carrying out the assassination 
israels intelligence services have planted an agent in syria 
found and kidnapped nazi war criminal adolf eichmann from argentina 
in 1960 participated in the dramatic rescue of israeli hostages 
held at entebbe airport in uganda in 1976 and the bombing of iraqs 
nuclear reactor in 1981 
the mossad has earned a reputation for carrying out imaginative 
highrisk operations to rescue israeli captives or punish those 
believed responsible for planning and carrying out attacks against 
israelis 
because of our special circumstances namely we are poor 
small and surrounded by belligerent countries the israeli 
intelligence is of utmost importance said meir amit head of the 
mossad from 1963 to 1968 we have to have ears and eyes beyond 
our borders 
if you can bang in the nail in one hit instead of two you 
save money and energy but to do that you have to know where the 
head of the nail is amit told the associated press thats 
where the mossad comes in 
despite some public failures israeli intelligence has been 
effective and the wazir operation fits the pattern 
wazir 52 also known as abu jihad was deputy to palestine 
liberation organization chief yasser arafat and head of the plos 
military operations 
the italian news agency ansa quoted italian military officials 
who it did not identify as saying a boeing 707 reportedly involved 
in the raid may have passed through international air space under 
direction of italian air traffic controllers 
italys air traffic control center confirmed to the ap that it 
tracked an israeli plane identifying itself as a civilian aircraft 
shortly before the commando attack at wazirs house on the 
outskirts of tunis 
israelis say wazir organized a 1978 bus hijacking in which 35 
israelis were killed and a tel aviv hotel takeover in 1975 in which 
11 hostages were slain 
more recently israelis contend he was the mastermind behind 
nearly five months of arab unrest as well as two successful 
guerrilla infiltrations in which nine israelis were killed 
founded in 1951 the agency is responsible for covert activities 
outside the country as is the cia unlike the cia however the 
israeli organization is so secret that israeli law bars publishing 
the name of the current mossad chief the agency is viewed as key 
to israels survival 
the agency is helped by the fact that israel because it is a 
nation of emigrants has among its ranks jews born in arab 
countries who speak arabic and can easily fit into enemy 
environments 
eli cohen the legendary israeli spy who developed close 
friendships with syrian government and military leaders is a 
classic example 
the egyptianborn cohen posing as an arab provided israel with 
critical information from 1960 until 1965 when he was unmasked 
tortured and hanged by the syrians 
in addition many jews who do not live in israel feel a sense of 
loyalty to the jewish state 
in 1966 the mossad used an american woman to persuade an iraqi 
fighter pilot to defect to israel with his sovietbuilt mig21 
fighter sought by israeli military intelligence 
mossad agents also were led to eichmann by a tip from a german 
official who was jewish 
although few details have yet emerged the wazir killing appears 
to bear the most similarity to the 1973 raid on plo offices in 
beirut in which three top plo officials including wazirs 
predecessor kamel adwan were killed 
as in the wazir killing that operation involved seaborne 
commandos who managed to carry out the killings on enemy territory 
despite the presence of armed guards 
the leader of that earlier raid was maj gen amnon shahak now 
the head of military intelligence who reportedly helped organize 
the wazir killing 
maj gen ehud barak israels deputy chief of staff planned 
the 1973 raid according to israeli sources barak was the officer 
who personally saw off the commandos who went to tunis to gun down 
wazir 
israel also had experience making the long trip to tunis over 
the mediterranean sea in 1985 israel bombed plo headquarters in 
tunis reportedly killing 50 people including an arafat bodyguard 
there have been some failures the mossad was criticized for 
failing to adequately warn israeli leaders of an arab military 
buildup prior to the 1973 yom kippur war 
in addition israeli agents killed the wrong man in july 1973 in 
their hunt for an arab guerrilla in lillehammer norway the 1972 
bengurion airport massacre in which japanese red army guerrillas 
killed 26 people and wounded 72 in the israeli passenger terminal 
was a serious security lapse 
wazirs killing was approved by key government ministers 
according to israeli sources 
but two foreign minister shimon peres and ezer weizman a 
cabinet minister without portfolio publicly expressed displeasure 
with the assassination fearing it could kill usbacked peace 
efforts and fuel greater arab extremism 
at the very time that israeli leaders are primarily concerned 
with calming the territories the elimination of abu jihad is like 
tossing an enormous amount of fuel on the flames wrote the daily 
hadashot 
moreover if the plo leaders are to be eliminated with whom 
then do we intend to discuss the issue of settling the palestinian 
problem 
many israelis however feel wazirs assassination provided some 
longawaited good news 
whether or not israel did it there is no question that we had 
not only the right but the obligation to kill people like abu 
jihad said uzi landau a legislator from the rightwing likud 
bloc such a success in our fight against terrorism cannot help 
but be met here with praise and enthusiasm

israeli troops enforced a tight curfew saturday 
on 400000 arabs during a day of rage ordered by palestinian 
leaders an israeli policeman shot and killed a palestinian man who 
attacked him with an ax 
the curfew confining palestinians in the occupied territories 
to their homes was maintained for a sixth straight day following 
violent protests over the assassination of plo military leader 
khalil wazir 
two palestinians were shot to death by israeli troops during the 
protests friday in the occupied gaza strip and the west bank 
a paramilitary border policeman shot and killed a palestinian 
man who attacked him with an ax during a protest in the west bank 
village of qabatiya the army said without identifying the dead man 
arab reports said the demonstration in the village 43 miles 
north of jerusalem was to protest wazirs slaying the army said 
dozens of palestinians participated 
in bethlehem some 200 youths many masking their faces with 
their arab headdresses hurled rocks at troops in the aida refugee 
camp 
an associated press reporter saw soldiers fire tear gas and 
rubber bullets at the protesters witnesses said a 7yearold arab 
boy was injured by rubber bullets and nine residents suffered from 
tear gas inhalation 
in the gaza strips maghazi refugee camp troops arrested two 
arabs after a firebomb was thrown at an army patrol israel radio 
said no injuries were reported 
the death on saturday brought to 172 the number of arabs killed 
since the uprising began 19 weeks ago an israeli teenager and an 
army soldier also have perished 
underground leaders of the palestinian uprising had called for a 
day of rage in the occupied territories saturday to mark a week 
since wazirs death 
in gaza city burning tires filled the air with smoke most 
shops were closed in response to a call for a general strike but 
vendors sold fruits vegetables and other goods from carts on the 
streets 
the army curfew saturday covered the gaza strip and the west 
bank towns of anabta and nablus population 100000 along with 20 
refugee camps in the former jordanian territory 
the army said it would lift on sunday a fourdayold ban on 
travel to israel by residents of the occupied lands 
israeli leaders had predicted that the uprising against israels 
21year occupation would falter both because of strong army action 
and economic strains on the palestinians caused by repeated general 
strikes 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said on israels 40th anniversary 
thursday that he believed violence would end soon in the occupied 
territories 
an israeli scholar said saturday however that wazirs 
assassination which has been blamed on israel could prompt more 
bloodshed 
we may see more terrorist operations not only against israeli 
targets in israel itself asher sasser of tel aviv university 
told israel radio there may be more terrorist operations against 
israeli objectives in europe which fatah at least has abstained 
from for quite a few years 
sasser a terrorism expert said that the plos mainstream fatah 
group may see the killing of wazir as a change of the rules in 
the war with israel that they would now be able to justify 
operations against israeli targets in europe 
wazir a close associate of plo leader yasser arafat was slain 
at his home in tunis tunisia on april 16 tunisian authorities 
and informed israeli sources have said the assassination was 
carried out by israeli commandos 
israeli officials have said that wazir directed much of the 
uprising in the occupied territories but sasser said he doubted 
wazirs death would cause either a sudden outburst of violence or 
an end to the uprising 
i think it should be recognized that the uprising in the west 
bank was not a ploorganized phenomena he said although the 
plo certainly supported and encouraged the uprising it was not 
totally controlled or initiated by the organization

attorney general edwin meese iii travels 
monday to detroit a city unhappy with the time hes taking to make 
a decision affecting thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in 
newspaper revenues 
at his office the embattled attorney general faces a desk piled 
high with other policy questions ranging from an intramural 
dispute between the fbi and the us marshals service to 
initiatives on drugs pornography gun control and the death 
penalty 
meeses chief spokesman terry eastland says the attorney 
general has indicated to anyone that has asked him that he is 
moving as quickly as possible to make decisions on issues that rise 
to his level 
but congressional critics pressing for meeses resignation 
suggest the tangle of ethical questions over his conduct and 
staffing problems at the justice department are hindering his 
ability to tend to regular business 
i dont know how decisions can be made in a timely way in the 
environment that he faces where senior staff has quit said sen 
carl levin a michigan democrat whose governmental affairs 
subcommittee has held extensive hearings into meeses affairs 
detroit is focusing on meeses statutory authority to decide 
whether the citys two daily newspapers the news and the free 
press will be allowed to merge their business and production 
operations and share profits a move they say is necessary to 
ensure that both survive 
we have been in this process for more than two years now and 
it is frankly a wearying exhausting process with everyones 
future on hold and in fact with people not knowing if the 
newspaper or they have a future said david lawrence publisher 
of the free press the papers owners knightridder inc say the 
free press will be closed if a joint operating agreement is 
rejected 
meese however has said he will not discuss the newspaper 
question when he speaks before the economic club of detroit his 
subject will be drug control 
on that front meese has shaped several recommendations which 
now must be steered through congress including a law controlling 
chemicals used to process cocaine he also seeks authorization to 
provide better weaponry to drug enforcement officials in source 
countries 
meese also seeks deathpenalty legislation for presidential 
assassins and prisoners serving life sentences who kill guards 
laws to modify the requirement that improperly obtained evidence be 
excluded in criminal cases stricter controls on pornography and 
obscenity a ban on guns invisible to metal detectors and increased 
funding for prison construction 
beyond broad issues meese also has several specific policy 
decisions to make such as a 9monthold dispute between the fbi 
and the marshals service over which should have authority to track 
down fugitives 
meese this month testified before a grand jury in an 
investigation of a 40000ayear job for his wife ursula his 
involvement with a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline his ownership of 
14000 in telephone company stock and his ties to the 
scandalplagued bronx defense contractor wedtech corp 
two key justice department posts became vacant last month when 
the secondranking official in the department and the head of the 
criminal division both resigned abruptly 
in a meeting with president reagan last wednesday one of the 
two deputy attorney general arnold burns told reagan vice 
president george bush and other white house officials that 
meeses behavior was hurting the department of justice an 
administration source said speaking on condition he not be 
identified by name 
i dont know how morale could not be affected by the mass 
resignations and by the continual problems that the attorney 
general faces the administration official said but reagan 
after a followup conversation with meese expressed continued 
support for meese 
the attorney general has said he spends virtually all his time 
during the work week to the business of the department and a 
substantial portion of the weekends 
but levin said i doubt that thats totally true i cant 
believe that given the amount of time that he has spent in front of 
grand juries and preparing for those visits that all of that was 
done after office hours 
asked if meeses legal and personnel problems had delayed the 
detroit ruling eastland said i just dont see that 
the news owned by gannett co inc and the free press sought 
the partial merger on may 9 1986 under the newspaper preservation 
act designed to preserve newspaper competition in cities where one 
publication is in danger of failing 
knightridder said in january the free press has had operating 
losses of 100 million since 1979 and the news in the same period 
had operating losses of about 75 million the news is the nations 
ninthlargest newspaper the free press the 10th largest

former television evangelist pat robertson 
picked up 14 delegates at the nevada republican convention on 
saturday his biggest oneday showing so far and his first delegate 
gain since super tuesday 
vice president george bush won four delegates and another two 
were elected as uncommitted 
the state convention was dominated by robertson forces who 
sought conciliation rather than confrontation with supporters of 
bush the all but certain winner of the republican presidential 
nomination 
support for bush at this point is very wise robertson said 
at a news conference as the convention opened 
republican national committee chairman frank fahrenkopf who was 
elected as an uncommitted delegate from his home state said 
saturday he met briefly with robertson to talk about holding 
unity meetings that will involve all the gop presidential 
candidates and robertson supported the plan 
fahrenkopf also said the robertson supporters are vital to gop 
efforts this year especially in southern states that have been 
solidly democratic and will be a boon because of their eagerness 
to get involved at the grass roots level 
rich bond bushs deputy campaign manager who also was at the 
convention said the robertson backers can have a very beneficial 
effect in the party if we all merge and thats our desire 
but bond also said some antipathy still exists between bush 
supporters and the robertson camp because passions were high 
words were spoken earlier in the campaign 
he added that the bush camp is prepared to smooth over those 
rough spots and work with robertson to ensure he has a voice in 
the gop robertson said he now wants to be a rallying point for 
conservatives 
the overwhelming robertson victory in nevada included the 
election of his nevada campaign strategist steve wark of las 
vegas as state gop chairman 
the nevada convention boosted robertsons national delegate 
total to 31 while bush now has 1081 delegates to the republican 
national convention according to the associated press delegate 
count 
that put bush just 58 delegates shy of the 1139 needed to win 
the gop presidential nomination 
while robertson did well in nevada he said republican unity is 
whats needed now and that for him the 1988 race was over 
robertson got repeated applause friday when he addressed the 
convention which at times took on a churchrevival atmosphere as 
some delegates their eyes closed and hands raised prayed aloud 
the convention whose 600 delegates included more than 400 
robertson backers also began singing god bless america at the 
end of robertsons speech 
robertson who has ceased active campaigning marked his last 
delegate gain on march 8 when he won five in arkansas two in 
massachusetts and two in mississippi he won another eight 
delegates at a stormy state convention in michigan in january

friends admirers and political allies of 
robert f kennedy assassinated as he sought the presidency 20 
years ago were reunited saturday at a conference to remember the 
senator and seek lessons from his life 
rfk remembered is partially a reunion but also and 
more significantly a reaffirmation and rededication to the 
purposes for which robert kennedy lived and died historian 
arthur m schlesinger jr told the loyola marymount university 
audience setting the theme for the conference 
schlesinger who served as an adviser to kennedys slain 
brother president john f kennedy received a standing ovation 
from a packed auditorium of onetime kennedy supporters friends and 
classes of youngsters who came to learn about the candidate they 
never knew 
one of kennedys 11 children lawyer kathleen kennedy townsend 
also was to speak other participants included kennedys former 
press secretary frank mankiewicz former kennedy aide edwin 
guthman united farm workers president cesar chavez former carter 
administration aide midge costanza and california assemblyman tom 
hayden 
twenty years ago this month many of us were working our heads 
and hearts out to make robert kennedy president of the united 
states schlesinger said no one can tell where roads not taken 
would have led 
but schlesinger said he believed that kennedy would have ended 
the vietnam war slowed the nuclear arms race and provided new 
opportunities for the poor and dispossessed 
a robert kennedy presidency would have delivered the public 
from watergate with its attendant perversions of the 
constitution schlesinger said 
in an address which had political overtones for this years 
presidential primaries the scholar and author of many political 
books said he believed american society was about to rouse itself 
from the conservative reagan years and move into a liberal 
political future 
reaganism is finished bankrupt used up played out he 
said to a loud round of applause at last it is truly bedtime 
for bonzo 
the days gathering began with the showing of a film documenting 
robert kennedys life and his role in his brothers administration 
paul schrade the onetime kennedy campaign organizer who was 
shot with kennedy but survived billed the conference as focusing 
on the legacy of a victory of life over death 
kennedy was gunned down in the kitchen of the ambassador hotel 
on june 5 1968 moments after he claimed victory in the california 
democratic presidential primary sirhan sirhan a jordanian 
immigrant was convicted of the killing and is serving a life term 
at soledad prison 
questions have been raised over the years concerning a possible 
second gun being fired at kennedy last weeks release of police 
files in the nearly 20yearold case has focused attention on 
conspiracy theories and the circumstances surrounding kennedys 
death 
schrade who organized the conference was chagrined at the 
timing of the release of files he had sought for years 
i thought it was monstrous bad timing by secretary of state 
march fong eu he said noting he had asked her to postpone the 
release until the conference was over 
schrade said the release focused attention again on kennedys 
death while the conference was meant to shift that focus to his 
life 
all of the pain and grief had buried a lot of the legacy he 
said 
bob was the best political candidate ive known in 40 years in 
politics said schrade he was committed to real social change 
to ending the war in vietnam he was committed to working for the 
underclass in this country 
during a panel discussion hayden a leader of the 1968 riots at 
the chicago democratic convention said he believed that the 
violence at the convention would not have occurred had kennedy been 
the candidate 
that would have been a convention without chaos hayden 
said because robert kennedy could work with mayor richard 
daley anyone who could work with tom hayden and richard daley was 
quite a fellow 
among spectators at the conference was former california gov 
jerry brown who said he came because schrade was his nextdoor 
neighbor but also because he found inspiration in the principles 
kennedy pursued 
he had such a clarity about what was right and what was 
wrong said brown he just went out and tried to change 
things 
brown declined comment on his own political future or on the 
contents of the book he is writing about his life in politics

officials of a federal agency created to sell 
property from insolvent savings institutions traveled in high style 
and awarded nobid contracts to former business associates all 
while receiving sixfigure salaries and bonuses a congressional 
report charges 
the house banking committee found the federal asset disposition 
association based in san francisco to be an organization out of 
control that had mushroomed into a bloated bureaucracy 
among the potential conflicts and abuses alleged in the report 
the owners of an executive search firm that recommended former 
fada president roslyn payne for her job later received 650000 in 
contracts from fada through another firm that they owned 
ms payne charged the agency for the personal travel of herself 
and her husband and doublebilled for some travel expenses 
robert axley former chief legal counsel of the agency ran up 
a hotel bill of 1200 including laundry at a hotel in san 
francisco even though he lived in the city 
neither ms payne nor axley had a published home telephone 
listing in the san francisco area and calls to their former office 
went unanswered saturday however the washington post quoted ms 
payne as calling the reports allegations outrageous 
house banking chairman fernand j st germain in a statement 
accompanying the report published friday in the congressional 
record called for fada to be abolished as soon as possible and 
its duties reabsorbed by the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp 
we havent the time to wait to rework the unworkable st 
germain said 
gerald carmen who took over as fada chief executive in 
february said in an interview friday that he is taking about six 
months to consider whether the agency should continue in its 
present structure however in the meantime he promised 
problems that are real and exist were going to fix 
the purpose of fada created by the federal home loan bank 
board which regulates 3147 federally insured sampls is to bring in 
money for fslic the financiallystrapped fund that guarantees sampl 
deposits up to 100000 
instead the report the result of a sevenmonth investigation 
said 
fada has not been and in all likelihood could never be 
a costeffective solution 
it has evolved into a bureaucracy outside all prudent checks 
and balances 
quality performance was nearly nonexistent 
fada employees awarded solesource contracts to former 
business associates and still maintain active interest in real 
estate investment and development firms and ties to the savings 
and loan industry that would not be appropriate for government 
employees 
fslic employees and contractors who criticized the agency 
often felt threatened and intimidated 
meanwhile fada officials lived first class and received 
excessive salaries and bonuses all at the expense of fslic 
fada according to the report has more than 5 billion worth of 
assets loans and real estate in its care yet had managed by 
the end of 1987 to sell only 124 million of the property 
the report said it was difficult to determine how much money 
fada has wasted but it said the agency has directly charged 20 
million from receiverships of failed sampls and passed on 51 million 
more in charges from subcontractors despite that revenue the 
agency has lost 15 million through the end of last year the 
report said 
since its creation in late 1985 fada has spent 22 million on a 
staff that has grown to more than 380 3 million of that for the 
1987 salaries of its 32 top officials the report said 
ms payne the former fada chief executive officer received 
325000 in salaries and bonuses in 1986 a third more than the 
salary of the president of the united states the report noted 
fada has spent 18 million on travel over and above travel to 
manage assets in its care including hotel rooms at more the 200 
a night the house committee said 
included in that is an august 1987 bill from axley for 1200 
for charges at a luxurious san francisco hotel including laundry 
bills although he lived in san francisco the report said 
it said that ms payne used her fada credit card to buy airplane 
tickets for herself and her husband and included the charge on her 
expense form although fada accountants refused to pay the bill 
between january and may 1987 ms payne received 800 through 
doublereporting expenses and did not repay the money until the 
overpayment was pointed out by congressional investigators the 
report said 
also cited as a potential conflict of interest were the 
650000 in payments to the san diegobased conam corp an asset 
management firm owned by lester korn and richard ferry 
they also own kornferry international an executive search firm 
that was paid 125000 to come up with a list of candidates for 
fada president the list included ms payne 
home telephone numbers for korn and ferry were not listed in the 
san diego area and neither man returned a reporters call to their 
office the post quoted another kornferry executive as saying that 
firms recommendation of ms payne and conams subsequent work for 
fada were purely coincidental 
carmen ms paynes replacement said he is cutting fadas 
staff having reduced the annual payroll so far by 1 million and 
is consolidating office space he said he expects the agency will 
be in the black for the first quarter this year

ships and airplanes searched the 
north atlantic for survivors saturday near the blazing remains of a 
greek tanker that broke in two leaving one crewman known dead and 
28 people missing 
but as darkness fell the us coast guard said it was 
suspending search operations and there was no plan to resume them 
sunday 
petty officer brad terrill of the us coast guards atlantic 
operations said search conditions were excellent all day with 
good to excellent visibility low seas and mild winds but nothing 
has been spotted since the one body was recovered friday evening 
a dutch cargo ship recovered the body of polish seaman andrej 
szukalski 41 from the oilslicked sea near the 500foot athenian 
venture around 6pm friday 
he was in a lifejacket but not in a liferaft said terrill 
in a telephone interview from new york terrill said an earlier 
report that the ships log was found with the body was incorrect 
and the document was the victims passport 
us coast guard officials said there were 29 people aboard the 
tanker including the wives of five crewmen and it was believed 
that all of the victims were polish nationals 
terrill said the stern section of the 18000ton tanker hauling 
gasoline and bunker fuel from amsterdam to new york was still 
burning and probably will be burning for quite a bit of time 
the bow portion sank friday 
the crippled tanker was about 800 miles east of new york when 
the canadian research ship hudson spotted it ablaze after midnight 
370 miles southeast of cape race newfoundland 
the hudson reported that one of the tankers lifeboats had been 
launched and a canadian coast guard spokesman said three life rafts 
and a lifeboat were missing from the tanker leading to hope there 
might be survivors 
but lt cmdr kent fisher of the us coast guard said the 
lifeboats may have been missing because they burned and there was 
little hope of finding any survivors 
although the coast guard initially said the tanker had sent no 
distress signals terrill said saturday there was a very brief 
sos thursday evening which was heard up and down the east coast 
it was just one brief mayday and thats all anyone heard 
terrill said a canadian airplane and the hudson were joined by 
two us coast guard c130 aircraft and a cutter in the search for 
survivors and they were working in much better weather late 
saturday that they had earlier 
early saturday the tankers fiery hulk was being buffeted in 
rain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up 5foot 
swells but later in the day terrill said there were calm and 
rolling seas three to five feet high with good visibility and high 
overcast 
there was no indication what caused the fire 
patron marine of athens owners of the cypriotregistered 
tanker notified the coast guard that there had been 29 people 
aboard the athenian venture including 24 crewmen and the wives of 
five of them 
about onesixth of the ship the bow broke off and sank with 
fivesixths of the rear of the ship still burning intensely 
terrill said 
capt loran strum of the hudson said the tanker was burning 
fiercely and had broken in two by the time his ship approached 
we could see fire through the house windows so shes all 
burned out in the bridge sector strum said in a shiptoshore 
radio interview i think i could quite safely say it would be 
impossible for anyone to be alive aboard 
strum a 37year veteran of the sea said a column of smoke from 
the tankers stern could be seen for 30 miles

israel had the palestine liberation 
organizations no 2 leader assassinated last week because he 
planned new terrorist attacks on israel and its allies including 
the united states a magazine reported saturday 
us news amp world report quoting jerusalem sources in its may 2 
edition says the decision to assassinate khalil alwazir also 
known as abu jihad despite known risks was based on more than his 
alleged involvement in a recent bus hijacking by the plo that 
resulted in three israeli deaths 
quoting israeli intelligence reports the magazine says abu 
jihad was said to have struck deals with libyas moammar gadhafi 
and various east european intelligence agencies to restore the 
sophisticated plo terrorist and combat capability that israel had 
destroyed in the invasion of lebanon 
the plo would then launch a major new series of terrorist 
attacks against israel itself and israeli interests and supporters 
in other countries including the united states the magazine 
says 
abu jihad was gunned downed april 16 in his villa in tunis 
tunisia 
us news says some foreign security specialists doubt key 
aspects of the israeli version of the story and jerusalems reasons 
for revealing it 
the magazine quotes one western official as saying it has 
selfserving aspects involves a strange bunch of bedfellows and 
doesnt make sense for the plo at this time 
the officials also are skeptical of abu jihads alleged presence 
at meetings with leaders he has fought for years and whether the 
mossad israels intelligence agency could identify precise 
details of plans for joint actions by arab groups that have battled 
one another as fiercely as they have fought the jewish state 
according to the magazine 
but israeli sources insist that the reasons for hitting abu 
jihad and striking now were compelling us news says

survivors of the victims huddled with politicians in dark suits and 
construction workers in jeans as the skies darkened 
as the cold rain got heavier the small group of politicans 
standing under a covered platform who were scheduled to talk chose 
to end the ceremony early before a moment of silence planned for 
136 pm the minute that the building collapsed on april 23 1987 
there was something very symbolic here that we were 
covered and they families and rescue volunteers werent said 
us rep christopher shays 
as the crowd quickly broke up a lone construction worker in 
jeans and a green hard hat lingered in the heavy rain then turned 
and walked slowly away the last to leave 
shortly after the ceremony there were no mourners at the site 
but two sprays of fresh red white and pink carnations adorned the 
fence and a twisted blue sign with the name of the project still 
lay on the ground 
the memorial service began earlier at st augustines where 
clergymen encouraged survivors to reach out to each other and 
remember the outpouring of generosity from people around the world 
they also noted that there had been two births and one adoption in 
victims families in the past year 
although we were stricken by tragedy on april 23 1987 we 
were not destroyed scheyd said 
as we come here today to look back let us not be afraid to 
look forward the future will come for each of us 
after the ceremony several politicians and union leaders 
focused on the future of legislative efforts to improve 
construction safety 
when people say this will never happen again i wonder if it 
will said us sen lowell p weicker jr he said a bill 
requiring employers to post a notice if dangerous chemicals were on 
a site was blocked by a recent senate filibuster 
safety in the workplace seems to be a low priority with my 
colleagues and with the people weicker said 
there was a tremendous showing here today now we need to 
work on legislation and see this doesnt happen again said frank 
carroll jr business manager for local 488 of the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers the hearts of the families are 
still broken

premier ciriaco de mita won final parliamentary 
approval saturday for his new government but the fiveparty 
coalition is already embroiled in a dispute over italys middle 
east policy 
after a twoday debate the christian democrat leader won a 
confidence vote in the senate 177106 the coalition had won a vote 
of confidence in the chamber of deputies thursday 
both votes were a formality since the coalition has a 
comfortable majority in both houses 
de mita formed italys 48th postworld war ii government on 
april 13 after a monthlong political crisis caused by the 
resignation of premier giovanni goria a fellow christian democrat 
who served for 7 months 
the government is made up of the five parties that have governed 
most of the decade the dominant christian democrats the 
socialists and the small republican social democrat and liberal 
parties 
de mita has expressed hope his government can last through the 
end of the legislative term in 1992 but a dispute developed as he 
was winning parliamentary approval 
it involves italys policies toward israel and the palestine 
liberation organization including the months of violence in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and the april 16 
assassination in tunisia of plo military chief khalil wazir it is 
widely believed wazir was slain by israeli commandos 
socialist leader bettino craxi a former premier proposed that 
italy give official recognition to the plo the plo does have a 
representative in italy but he does not have full diplomatic 
status 
craxis suggestion was criticized by the liberals and 
republicans the two most conservative parties in the coalition 
at a news conference saturday in naples craxi added a new 
element to the debate he suggested the european economic community 
common market assume a mandate to administer the israelioccupied 
territories for a transitional period pending a solution of the 
palestinian problem 
craxi said palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip were 
oppressed and had the right and duty to rebel against israeli 
occupation he said israel had the right to demand secure frontiers 
but nothing else 
the socialist leader also said the italian government should 
lodge a protest with israeli if it is confirmed that italian 
airspace was violated by an israeli boeing 707 that reportedly 
helped direct the commando team that killed wazir 
italian air controllers have reported that an israeli plane 
which identified itself as a civilian aircraft passed through 
their jurisdictional zone near sicily the night of the 
assassination 
in his 90minute speech before the senate vote de mita said the 
position of italian governments on the arabisraeli conflict has 
always been constant intelligent and active and that he would 
follow that path italy has maintained good relations with both 
israel and the arab world 
de mita called the assassination of wazir a useless crime 
which makes the process of peace more difficult 
on domestic issues de mita restated his intentions to 
streamline political institutions he has promised to make the 
legislative process more efficient and strengthen the executive 
branch 
de mitas close adviser on institutional reforms sen roberto 
ruffilli was assassinated a week ago by red brigades terrorists

jesse jackson revisited a democratic 
stronghold saturday to collect favors on a bluecollar cause he 
supported and to tap the working class sentiments he hopes to 
represent in the white house 
in the mon valley i stood with you fighting for our children 
fighting for justice now on tuesday my friends stand 
with me jackson said at the first of three riverside stops in 
monongahela valley towns that have been staggered by the decline of 
steelmaking in the american industrys birthplace 
in january 1985 after losing the 1984 democratic presidential 
nomination jackson appeared in neighboring duquesne with 
unemployed steel workers to fight for the reopening of a giant 
ironmaking blast furnace affectionately known as dorothy six 
the furnace and the surrounding duquesne works have been closed 
by usx corp and will be demolished to make way for an industrial 
park 
jackson reminded saturday of the disappointing results of the 
fruitless struggle to have the furnace restarted said it was 
the principle to try to sustain their faith and their will to 
fight back 
those workers are fighting against the odds of a government 
administration that does not care about their predicament he 
said as he campaigned before tuesdays pennsylvania primary in 
which jackson is pitted against the current democratic 
frontrunner massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
between stops jackson and his campaign workers traveled the 
monongahela river on a sightseeing boat floating past red brick 
and aluminumsided homes between scrap yards coal piles rail 
sidings fuel tanks greening valley walls churches and war 
memorials of the struggling towns of monongahela elizabeth and 
mckeesport 
the democrats 12000to2000 voter registration edge over 
republicans in mckeesport is typical of the grip the party has had 
on allegheny county over the last 50 years walter mondale beat 
ronald reagan by 88000 votes in the county in 1984 said 
pittsburgh democratic chairman frank lucchino 
jackson was one of the biggest names to join the fight for 
dorothy six 
i think hes gone out on a limb to identify himself with that 
sort of small and powerless struggle said david demarest of 
pittsburgh 
the carnegie mellon university english professor and his wife 
marlene said they liked jackson as one who could broaden the 
democratic party 
if we cant bring blacks into mainstream politics were in 
trouble he said 
our campaign is changing the face of america jackson said 
coalitions are coming together that never were involved in 
politics before 
one such newcomer is joseph heckel 62 of mars 
jackson represents humanity hed like to build rather than 
destroy said heckel a world war ii navy veteran who has been to 
nicaragua to help the village of el cedro rebuild after being 
devastated by the usbacked contras 
our foreign policy is just a disaster and jackson is the 
only one who represents change heckel said 
demarest favors workerownership as a way to revive the areas 
manufacturing economy 
the inability of pittsburgh to do that in steel is kind of a 
missing link and i see jackson as being able to communicate 
strongly on that level demarest said 
jackson said rebuilding roads bridges and other public 
structures would reemploy displaced steel workers 
were not fighting for welfare were fighting for fair 
share he said at a park beside usxs closed national tube works 
the now silent engine of mckeesports whimpering economy 
jackson salted his three speeches with invocations against dope 
despair and prejudice he encouraged his listeners to have hope and 
to organize behind him tuesday

the use of a braindead mans heart 
for a transplant before he was identified was justified because it 
helped save another life the mans sister said 
the transplant was criticized friday by medical ethicists 
im happy that at least even if his body is dead his heart 
is beating in another person said maria celsa torres 20 sister 
of eleno ulloa ramirez 19 im also very satisfied with the 
explanation that they gave me the authorities 
ramirez was found unconscious with no identification on a costa 
mesa street early tuesday and declared brain dead the next day 
after surgery to remove a clot in the brain police believe he was 
the victim of a blow to the head 
before he was identified doctors at hoag memorial hospital 
presbyterian transplanted his heart into dr norton humphreys 58 
a retired fountain valley physician suffering from a degenerative 
heart disease 
a nursing supervisor who declined to give her name said saturday 
that humphreys condition was listed as critical but stable 
ramirezs heart was transplanted under a state law that allows 
removal of an organ without the permission of the donor or his 
family if police are unable to identify someone after making a 
diligent effort for 24 hours 
his relatives didnt find out his heart was transplanted until 
friday 
i think it was good what they did taking my brothers 
heart mrs torres said friday they saved another life yes 
it is painful for us but we have to accept the reality of it 
mrs torres said she last saw her brother on monday and that on 
tuesday her father contacted her and said he had been unable to 
reach his son 
a friend who works at the hospital told family members a man on 
life support there could be the missing man and they gave 
officials there information on ramirez 
mrs torres said that on friday morning people she assumed were 
police officers in plain clothes took her to the hospital to 
identify her brothers body 
the use of organs for transplant before the victim was 
identified drew some criticism 
george annas a law and ethics professor at boston universitys 
medical school said the procedure was incredible 
if other people have done it they havent talked about it in 
the newspaper thats for sure annas said 
john robertson an ethics professor at the university of texas 
in austin and a member of the national task force on organ 
transplantation defended the operation 
first of all were dealing with someone who is dead its not 
like theyre harming the person that body is either going to get 
cremated or buried robertson said im not sure theres any 
serious abuse if theyre complying with applicable law

the last emperor the first movie shot 
in communist china to be shown on this nationalist chinese island 
opened to large crowds saturday 
people formed lines to buy tickets to the movie that won nine 
academy awards it is about the life of chinas last emperor and 
was filmed by an international production company 
it is very touching reporter huang wulan of the china 
times express said of the movie that opened in 20 theaters in 
taipei and five other cities 
she said italian director bernardo bertolucci presented a 
chinese world very real and persuasive to the young generation of 
chinese growing up in taiwan 
a vast majority of taiwans nearly 20 million people are ethnic 
chinese the chinese nationalist government fled to taiwan in 1949 
after losing a civil war to the communists and has since refused 
all official contacts with mainland china 
unofficially the policy has been relaxed in recent months 
taiwanese chinese can travel to china to visit family members and 
many mainland products are now legally sold in taiwan 
last month the government sanctioned the showing of foreign 
films shot on the mainland but movies made by china still are 
forbidden 
government spokesman shaw yuming said the nationalists allowed 
the showing of the last emperor because the movie does not 
contain the poisonous elements of communism nor violate our 
national interests 
but shaw said government censors cut a 30second jail scene in 
which prisoners sing dongfang hong or the east is red 
which praises communism 
we dont have to listen to this song shaw told reporters 
thursday 
officials of the government information office which screens 
movies said a brief scene showing the young emperor flirting in 
bed with his empress also was cut 
the last emperor follows the life of pu yi as child emperor 
of the qing dynasty later japans world war ii puppet ruler of 
manchuria then a prisoner of the communists and finally a 
gardener pu yi died in beijing in 1967

enthusiastic bidders ran up prices saturday at 
the opening of a 10day auction of andy warhols personal 
collection paying more than 5 million for the art deco and art 
nouveau items that went on the block first 
its amazing the prices people are paying some are going for 
10 times the amount estimated said sothebys spokesman matthew 
weigman 
more than 10000 items from paintings rare art deco furniture 
watches and clocks and photographs of marilyn monroe are being put 
on the auction block in one of the most extensive sales ever held 
by sothebys in new york 
pieces auctioned saturday included art nouveau and art deco 
furniture jewelry lamps and household items 
the two sessions fetched a total of 5314347 more than twice 
what sothebys expected said diana levitt a spokeswoman for 
sothebys auction house 
it was a wonderful day said levitt who said the skyhigh 
prices were attributable to some degree to the warhol factor 
but to a great degree the quality and rarity of the objects 
proceeds will benefit the andy warhol foundation for the visual 
arts which will support and award grants to cultural institutions 
in the united states and abroad 
the highest bid was 275000 by an anonymous private collector 
for a wood center table by charles rennie mackintosh made about 
1902 sothebys expected the table to sell for 30000 to 50000 
the collection includes more than 60 works including paintings 
by jasper johns roy lichtenstein james rosenquist and cy twombly 
before saturdays bidding sothebys had expected the collection to 
sell for 10 to 15 million 
the crowd estimated by sothebys at 2200 seemed as eclectic 
as the collection some came to buy specific items and others came 
to buy something connected with andy warhol 
one man alan dolleck came to buy something for himself but was 
disappointed the prices are outrageous they went out of sight 
its not worth it 
most of the people actually buying were dealers looking for rare 
items 
i came to buy some of the art deco vases because it is very 
difficult to get them in europe but they are too expensive here 
said vincenzo geddes da filicaia an antique dealer from italy 
i could get them cheaper elsewhere but it is because of the 
andy warhol name that i cannot afford them 
warhol fans merely wanted something connected with the famed pop 
artist who died last year 
i wanted a very strong piece of jewelry connected with 
warhol said sheila tronn cooper a theatrical producer and 
writer looking at a piece that would go on sale sunday i saw 
this bracelet and fell in love with it 
cooper also came to buy a graduation present for her son who 
she said was an artist somewhat like warhol and i thought it 
would be nice to get him a graduation gift that had belonged to 
andy 
cooper who has attended many auctions decribed saturdays sale 
as one of the most exciting she had been to its mind 
boggling she said there are so many newcomers its like a 
party 
sothebys distributed a special sheet of advice for firsttime 
bidders 
a sharkskincovered console by pierre legrain fetched 209000 
as did a matching table both purchased by a foreign dealer 
sothebys had estimated winning bids between 40000 and 60000 
for each piece 
an ivory inlaid armchair by ebene de macassar was sold for 
154000 to a private collector sothebys expected 40000 to 
60000 
a silver tureen and cover made by frenchman jean puiforcat 
which was bought by a london dealer for 55000 sothebys had 
estimated it would go for 10000 to 15000 
a silver fourpiece tea and coffee set also by puiforcat was 
sold to a new york dealer for 44000 while sothebys officially 
had expected 12000 to 16000 
one of the most unusual purchases according to weigman was a 
gold and silver ring by jean despres estimated at 1800 to 2500 
and sold to an anonymous buyer for 28600 
the remaining auctions will offer an enormous collection of 
wristwatches indian rugs folk art drawings and prints warhols 
collection of american classical and federal furniture which 
sothebys called the largest and most important available for 
auction in many years will be sold tuesday

a year after gov bob martinez signed 
one of the more controversial levies in florida history lawmakers 
are avoiding tax talk because of battles that left many licking 
political wounds in an election year 
one year ago saturday martinez signed a bill initiating a 5 
percent tax on service industries ranging from lawn care to law and 
from accounting to advertising 
the tax sparked an outcry from many service groups and 
companies such as lever brothers procter amp gamble and nabisco 
withdrew local advertising of national brands the protests 
prompted martinez to reverse himself and lead a successful drive to 
repeal the tax and replace it with a sales tax increase 
but the wear and tear of the tax battle is still evident and 
some say the state merely put off a longterm revenue problem 
the legislature which is three weeks into this years twomonth 
regular session shows signs of burnout after five special sessions 
in the last 15 months 
i think the session in terms of actually starting has almost 
been delayed by the backup of special sessions and the result of 
everything that has happened in the last year said house speaker 
jon mills 
three of the five sessions concerned the services tax which had 
been heralded as fair because it tapped the states fastest growing 
economic sector and because higherincome people purchase more 
services than those with lower incomes 
martinez a selfproclaimed fiscal conservative who does not 
face reelection until 1990 still is working to rebuild his 
tarnished standing with voters 
proponents of the services tax said it would ensure adequate 
revenue to provide services to the states burgeoning population 
and they were outraged when martinez flipflopped on the measure 
last august 
the governor also angered republicans because he pushed for a 1 
percentage point increase in sales tax as a replacement instead of 
meeting a 1986 campaign pledge to cut 800 million from state 
spending 
in his state of the state address earlier this month martinez 
promised to veto any tax bill sent to his desk this year 
the governor has not intentions of supporting the services tax 
again press secretary jon peck said 
but some legislators including mills predict that the 
legislature is likely to consider another services tax eventually 
the boost in the sales tax to 6 percent which took effect feb 
1 is projected to raise 1 billion this year just as the services 
tax was expected to do 
but economists say the services tax would produce more revenue 
over time as the states services sector grows revenue that some 
lawmakers believe is badly needed 
the governor has proposed a 203 billion budget for the fiscal 
year beginning july 1 up from 185 billion this year many 
democratics say even that increase would not satisfy the needs of a 
growing population the state had just over 12 million residents 
in 1987 and officials say it is growing by up to 1000 people a day 
and correct for previous inadequacies in some programs 
martinez and the legislature must reach a budget compromise by 
july 1 
the governor has proposed increasing fees for such things as 
state university tuition fishing licenses and environmental 
permits 
lawmakers have quietly discussed increasing gasoline taxes to 
help pay for transportation needs but no formal proposal has been 
launched and martinez has refused to consider such a plan

gen manuel antonio noriega was 
quoted saturday as saying he could retire any time but that caving 
in to us pressure to resign would have a domino effect on the 
rest of latin america 
gen noriega can go any day on aug 12 nov 3 dec 19 the 
first of january 1989 the armed forces chief and panamas de 
facto ruler said in an interview with the progovernment newspaper 
la estrella de panama the star of panama the calendar is 
open and full of dates 
but noriega gave no indication he is willing to step down soon 
noriega who has been indicted in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges he denies has been head of the 15000member 
defense forces since 1983 his official biography says he is 50 
years old but his high school yearbooks indicate he is 54 
as he has in the past noriega said economic and other pressures 
applied by the united states to force his ouster are motivated by 
political considerations unrelated to the drug charges against him 
although he did not specifically refer to the matter noriega 
has said previously that us actions are the result of his refusal 
to help the reagan administration overthrow nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government 
if he submits to us pressure the general said it will mean 
that like a domino the destiny of all other latin american peoples 
is marked 
when a people are not docile to an empire those people and 
their leaders will be made a target of that empire said noriega 
noriega also scoffed at reports that some opposition figures and 
the roman catholic church have been secretly trying to negotiate 
his resignation with his supporters including leaders of the major 
progovernment political party 
its too bad theyre not talking with gen noriega the 
general said adding that many opposition leaders are trying to 
ride the wave and gain prestige 
they all want to be like monsignor obando y bravo they want 
to be like oscar arias vinicio cerezo or the secretary of the 
organization of american states he said 
obando y bravo is the catholic archbishop of nicaragua who has 
mediated talks between that government and rebels arias and cerezo 
are the presidents of costa rica and guatemala who pushed for those 
negotiations 
panamas catholic hierachy called on the reagan administration 
friday to end its sanctions against panama and said the country has 
suffered enough 
we cannot continue like this the church said in an 
eightpage pastoral letter signed by archbishop marcos gregorio 
mcgrath and the nations 10 bishops 
describing the sanctions as the cause of misery and 
desperation for thousands of panamanians the letter said they go 
beyond any strategy of political pressure and constitute by 
themselves a threat to the life of our people 
speaking with reporters on saturday mcgrath said panama was 
going through the pathetic and slow agony of a nation whose 
economy is rapidly being destroyed 
in two or three weeks there will be chaos in this country if 
the sanctions are not lifted he said 
the archbishop called for urgent negotiations to resolve the 
crisis some talks are being held but they are not the really 
effective conversations that carry commitment that the nation 
needs he said 
in its efforts to oust noriega the reagan administration has 
cut off all military and economic aid to panama blocked its assets 
in the united states and prohibited any us payments to the 
government panama uses the us dollar for its currency 
the sanctions combined with a lengthy shutdown of the nations 
120 banks and a twoweek general strike in march have brought 
panamas economy to a virtual halt 
noriegabacked supporters in the national assembly voted feb 26 
to oust president eric arturo delvalle a day after delvalle tried 
to fire noriega delvalle whom the united states still recognizes 
as the countrys head of state has remained in hiding in panama 
since his ouster

the memory of an antislavery protest by 
quakers 300 years ago should stir consciences against modernday 
injustices a group that marked the event was told saturday 
i think the real question that we should be asking ourselves 
today especially those of us who are white is how in the name of 
god could it be that it has taken us 300 years to get rid of racism 
and we still havent done it stephen cary chairman of the 
american friends service committee said 
the only thing that i can think of thats encouraging is that 
for the past 35 years weve been gaining on it 
cary spoke to about 300 people at a vacant lot in the citys 
germantown section which was the site of a house where where 
francis daniel pastorius and three other dutch quakers in 1688 
drafted one of the earliest recorded protests against slavery 
according to the germantown protest the organization that 
sponsored the gathering 
the statement was forwarded to larger quaker assemblies which 
tabled it it was not until 1776 that quakers who became leaders 
of the abolition movement forbade slaveholding by their members 
in 1780 pennsylvania became the first state to pass a law phasing 
out slavery 
one speaker told the audience that the german and dutch quakers 
who authored the statement saw only the beginnings of a rigid form 
of slavery 
we think of their protest as a protest against something that 
was in place it was not said stephanie wolf president of the 
germantown historical society and a history professor at the 
university of pennsylvania 
it was a brave and courageous thing in a new land with a new 
language for them to do 
the organizers of the commemoration drew up a petition called 
1988 germantown protest which said our germantown forbears 
would have us stand today with the homeless the hungry the 
unemployed and the neglected 
robert simpkins a retired tax assessor said the need for 
protests still existed 
today the idea of slavery of men doesnt exist but the 
shortcomings of life such as a lack of decent housing waste of 
youth and other areas where the quality of life is wanting 
simpkins said

sen albert gore jr who put his campaign 
for the democratic presidential nomination on hold thursday scored 
big gains at the expense of jesse jackson as kansas democrats 
elected national delegates at congressional district conventions 
saturday 
but the big winner in kansas was still massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis the frontrunner for the partys nomination 
following a big victory last tuesday in new yorks primary 
of 26 delegates elected at the district conventions saturday 
dukakis claimed 12 jackson seven and gore five with two others 
elected as uncommitted 
that breakdown will dictate how 13 more kansas delegates are 
elected at a meeting of the democratic state convention on may 14 
dukakis will claim seven of those 13 for a total of 19 elected 
delegates from the sunflower state jackson and gore of tennessee 
will split the other six atlarge delegates giving jackson a total 
of 10 of the elected kansas delegates and gore eight 
kansas also will have two uncommitted elected delegates and six 
socalled super delegates from elected and party officials for its 
total of 45 delegates at the democratic national convention in 
atlanta in july 
the super delegates are officially uncommitted and none has yet 
declared a preference between dukakis and jackson the only 
remaining active candidates 
based on voting at county caucuses held march 19 dukakis had 
been projected to win 11 delegates at the district level he got 
one more when previously uncommitted delegates threw in with the 
dukakis forces at the 4th district convention in wichita that took 
a delegate away from jackson 
jackson also lost delegates to gore at the 2nd district 
convention in topeka and at the 3rd district convention in prairie 
village 
when gore gained those two delegates at the district level it 
enabled him to meet a party requirement that a candidate garner at 
least 15 percent of the delegates in order to contend for the 13 
state delegates 
with eight delegates from the district conventions to jacksons 
10 gore was able mathematically to claim three of the 13 state 
delegates jackson also will get three of the delegates to be named 
by the state committee while dukakis will get seven of them 
jackson would have won 10 delegates at the district level and 
six more at the state level for a total of 16 if he had maintained 
his support from the county caucuses but the erosion cost him six 
delegates enabling gore to add five to what had been projected for 
him dukakis picked up the other delegate jackson lost from his 
projected total following the local caucuses five weeks ago 
the reason for the shifts is the gore people stayed in there 
and picked up the uncommitted in key places said state party 
chairman jim parrish 
had it not been for the 15 percent threshold they would have 
had five delegates based on the county caucuses parrish said 
now they recaptured them plus one this shifting around got him 
the boost he needed 
fred phelps jr a topeka attorney who was a chief organizer for 
gore in the 2nd district of northeast kansas said were just 
delighted we worked for it and the work paid off

democratic presidential candidates michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson called on president reagan on saturday to 
reconsider his threat to veto a trade bill that includes a 
provision requiring companies to give advance notice before closing 
plants 
debating for the second night in a row dukakis and jackson 
continued their kidglove competition for their partys 
presidential nomination steadfastly avoiding strong criticism of 
each other 
even when pressed to cite differences the two candidates lapsed 
into familiar campaign rhetoric that hardly qualified as political 
attacks 
jackson cited his proposals for specific budget figures to deal 
with national problems while dukakis cited his experience as 
governor of massachusetts 
i have put the numbers together to pay for my dreams said 
jackson i take the heat but i am consistent 
i dont just talk about jobs said dukakis ive helped to 
create and save hundreds of thousands of jobs 
after the debate jackson said dukakis did not answer the 
question of the budget i know its good to project for a 
national health care plan which i support but it will cost 
dukakis appeared in the debate press room after jackson and 
responded to the former civil rights actvists criticism by saying 
ive already made many commitments in dollars i know what 
its like to walk into a deficit the president of the united 
states had better be somebody who knows how to mop up red ink 
the candidates were given some of the questions in advance of 
the forum which concentrated on the problems of the steel industry 
the point jesse is making is a very sound one dukakis said 
during a discussion on education it was typical of the interchange 
between the two candidates 
asked what promises the candidates would make to the 
economically distressed residents of western pennsylvania dukakis 
said i hope the president will sign the new trade bill 
jackson joined in that plea and also said we cannot allow 
slave or repressed labor to undercut organized labor so long 
as there is slave labor among the coal miners and steelworkers in 
south africa slave labor will undercut organized labor 
reagan has cited the plantclosing provision as one of his 
principal objections to the legislation 
jackson also called for creation of an american investment bank 
to finance projects to repair the nations infrastructure a 
bridge closes in america every other day he said 
earlier in the day at a stop in bethlehem pa dukakis said he 
was unsure of whether jackson has any interest in a no 2 spot on 
the democratic ticket a subject which came up at the friday night 
debate 
i asked him if he were interested but he didnt tell me 
dukakis said 
the two rivals began the day campaigning at opposite ends of the 
state dukakis in the east and jackson in the west 
campaigning on the philadelphia waterfront dukakis said its 
important that we run a strong and positive campaign i dont think 
the american people are interested in what i think of jesse jackson 
or what he thinks of me 
they want to know what kind of leadership were going to 
provide for this country 
jackson campaigned by boat stopping for rallies along the 
monongahela river which runs through pittsburgh 
after his strong showing in the new york primary on april 19 
dukakis was heavily favored to take another jump toward the 
nomination when pennsylvania democrats vote on tuesday at stake in 
pennsylvania were 178 democratic delegates 
preprimary polls gave dukakis a big lead among pennsylvania 
democrats and he was favored to win the two key contests on 
tuesday the presidential preference beauty contest vote and the 
separate election of convention delegates 
the philadelphia inquirer and the centre daily times in state 
college endorsed dukakis in their sunday editions on friday 
dukakis got the endorsement of the pittsburgh postgazette while 
jackson received the support of the philadelphia daily news many 
other newspapers in the state do not plan to endorse a candidate 
before the primary 
jackson told a crowd of some 500 at the first of his three 
riverside rallies that leadership does not follow opinion polls 
it molds opinion it takes the heat 
jacksons saturday campaigning aboard a sightseeing boat was 
aimed at communities struggling to overcome job losses and plant 
closings that accompanied the decline of steel making in the 
pittsburgh area 
in kansas meanwhile sen albert gore jr of tennessee who put 
his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination on hold 
thursday scored big gains as the states democrats elected 
national delegates at congressional district conventions saturday 
dukakis however claimed most of the delegates elected winning 
12 while jackson got seven and gore five with two others elected 
as uncommitted that breakdown will dictate how 13 more kansas 
delegates are elected at a meeting of the democratic state 
convention on may 14 when dukakis will claim seven more and 
jackson and gore will split the other six atlarge delegates 
the latest associated press delegate count gave dukakis 107515 
and jackson the only other active candidate 8361 gore has 
42755 and uncommitted number 59975 a total of 2081 was needed 
for the nomination 
in a reminder that there still was a race for the republican 
nomination however lopsided pat robertson captured the lions 
share of 20 delegates chosen saturday at the nevada republican 
convention 
the former television evangelist picked up 14 delegates his 
biggest oneday showing so far and his first delegate gain since 
super tuesday while vice president george bush won four delegates 
and another two were elected as uncommitted 
but the victory still left robertson more than 1000 delegates 
behind bush the all but certain gop nominee 
a strong showing in pennsylvania could boost bush over the 1139 
delegates needed for the gop nomination 
the ap count gave bush 1081 and robertson 31 
dukakis was campaigning as if his principal opponent were 
overconfidence 
every single primary is important please dont pay any 
attention to the polls he told a union audience we need a big 
turnout everybody has to vote and you have to vote not only for 
me but for my delegates 
at nearly every stop he reminded voters that he was leading by 
50 points in the polls in 1978 when he lost the democratic 
gubernatorial primary to a far lesser known opponent 
we were all looking at our statistics and we werent 
remembering that its out on the ball field where you have to win 
that game he said 
at the same time he sounded optimistic about the chances of 
taking the white house back from the republicans 
were going to take back the presidency for the democratic 
party and for the country in november its out there to be won 
the people of this country are ready for a change you know and i 
know we hear it every day dukakis told about 100 people at a 
machinists union hall in philadelphia his second stop saturday 
morning they want an attorney general we can be proud of not an 
attorney general were embarrassed about

they are more subdued and thoughtful now their 
hair shorter and their waists larger but 20 years after they shut 
down columbia university these soulmates of the revolution 
remember those heady days with pride 
the moment we had there the power we felt the experience of 
turning defeat into victory has to be recovered historian mark 
naison told his classmates gathered once more at the morningside 
heights campus for a weekend reunion 
at panel discussions a picnic and a party these veterans of 
the campus uprising recalled how about 1000 people mostly 
students barricaded themselves inside five campus buildings for 
the week of april 23 1968 
the protest closed the college and drew international attention 
to their opposition to racism the vietnam war and the status quo 
in general 
acting columbia college dean henry coleman was held hostage 
professor orest ranum lost a decades research when a protester 
torched his files protesters andrea and richard egan were married 
in occupied fayerweather hall by episcopal chaplain william starr 
who crawled in through the window 
after a week columbia officials called in the police to clear 
the buildings nearly 700 people were arrested in brawls between 
police and protesters and 103 people were injured 85 of them 
students or teachers 
a student strike ensued and a month later students again 
occupied a college building to protest the discipline of protest 
leaders again the police moved in this time with 68 arrests and 
177 injuries 
this reunion is an example of what the university has always 
provided a forum for the open discussion of ideas said 
columbia spokesman fred knubel reunions can be useful looking 
back almost always helps us look ahead 
several hundred alumni milled around earl hall on saturday 
wearing bright orange tags that listed the buildings they had 
occupied 
this is not the me generation said tom hurwitz of 
manhattan a freelance cinematographer everybody here and 
everyone i know is a trace of the good things 
hurwitz recalled the incredible unity a kind of physical 
feeling it was a triumph of morality in a way that morality has 
rarely triumphed since 
on saturday rain forced the picnic inside after which more 
than 500 people listened to a panel of former campus activists 
discuss how their lives had been changed by the turbulent era 
then everyone adjourned for chinese food and a party with 
dancing to rock n roll both old and new 
theres an atmosphere of great camaraderie people talking 
about what theyre doing now its a general good feeling said 
eric foner one of the events organizers and a graduate student in 
1968 
dave crebs who attended columbia in the 1970s said the 
informal conversations after the panel discussion were most 
interesting 
its sort of sweet like people around the campfire said 
crebs 33 who lives in boston when i was deciding on college 
people told me dont go to columbia they go on strike there 
and now it turns out all these are all wellmeaning kind folks who 
had the best interest of the rest of us at heart 
on friday night the bluejeans were teamed with a few ties and 
sports jackets a few paunches and plenty of smiles and embraces 
as former soulmates greeted one another at a campus auditorium 
buzzwords like the perversion of capitalism surfaced now and 
then someone in the balcony unfurled a banner that read smash 
us imperialist revolution 
up against the wall hollered members of the audience 
invoking the oncefamiliar phrase to request that a podium be moved 
away from the movie screen 
the crowd applauded abbie hoffman who wore a tiedyed tshirt 
and sat in the front row a red bandanna adorning his frizzy gray 
hair 
hoffman had helped fuel the strikers conviction along with tom 
hayden now a california assemblyman black militants h rap brown 
and stokely carmichael civil rights lawyer william kunstler poet 
allen ginsberg and the grateful dead rock band 
many recollections were serious a few brought laughter 
a pie tossed in the face of a marine colonel recruiting on 
campus 
naison taking his phd oral exam in a building that was under 
occupation he passed the exam and his professors exited through a 
window 
it was not a prank or a party although many have described it 
as the best time of their lives said mark rudd of albuquerque 
nm who was chairman of students for a democratic society in 1968 
in the old days we were kids smart kids but kids said 
exprotester nancy biberman 40 now a new york city housing lawyer 
with two children of her own one of the nice things about 
getting older is that it does mellow some of the hard edges around 
the anger 
as students rudd said the protesters were intolerant 
arrogant driven and out of touch with reality our rage blinded 
us we allowed the evil we were fighting to penetrate our 
souls 
we failed to create a permanent significant left in the 
us rudd said even so he still is protesting this time 
against us involvement in central america and is writing his 
autobiography

jim bakker renewed his call saturday to 
be allowed to return to ptl to help erase its debts but ministry 
officials blamed the former television evangelist for the 
revocation of its taxexempt status and other financial problems 
the internal revenue service revoked ptls exemption friday and 
said contributions to the organization were no longer tax 
deductible 
the irs said jim and tammy faye bakker and their aides profited 
excessively from donations to the ministry the agency also said 
much of ptls heritage usa theme park in fort mill was commercial 
rather than ministerial 
bakker in a telephone call to the associated press from his 
home in palm springs calif acknowledged that he made mistakes 
but he denied taking excessive profits and said contributions he 
convinced people to send built ptls evangelical empire 
its typical of the irs they throw everything at you but the 
kitchen sink and then ask you to sort it out with documents and 
vouchers and receipts and defend yourself bakker said 
bakker said ptl faces liquidation so its current leadership 
should give him another chance 
now that its reached the end of the line and will be broken 
up what do they have to lose bakker said 
bakker resigned as leader of the ministry in march 1987 in the 
midst of a scandal over his sexual encounter with former church 
secretary jessica hahn in 1980 
ptl trustee david clark has said he has no intention of letting 
bakker return 
ministry officials probably will announce on mondays ptl 
club television show their response to the irs action ptl 
attorney bradford leggett said 
if ptl appeals contributions by individuals would be deductible 
up to 1000 until the appeal is decided the irs said 
this ruling could have an impact on contributions if people 
dont keep their focus on the fact that what we are dealing with 
here is a legacy that was left by the bakkers leggett said 
ptl has applied for a new taxexempt charter and wants to 
legally separate its ministry functions the daily tv show 
satellite network and heritage village church from its theme park 
and hotel there was no indication when the irs would rule 
the irs says ptl owes more than 55 million in taxes from june 
1983 to june 1987 the month ptl filed for protection from 
creditors in us bankruptcy court because of 72 million in other 
debts 
meanwhile the rev jerry falwell on saturday criticized the irs 
ruling as a kneejerk reaction that has guaranteed the demise 
of the ministry 
falwell who headed ptl briefly after bakker stepped down said 
in a speech to the north carolina associated press broadcasters 
association that the irs should have revoked ptls exemption only 
for the years bakker headed the ministry

a greek cycling champion pedaled a fragile 
plane 74 miles over the aegean sea saturday and broke the world 
record for humanpowered flight but the aircraft was destroyed in 
a crash landing 
a gust of wind snapped the tail boom off the ultralight daedalus 
88 which crashed into the sea just 10 yards short of the landing 
area on the island of santorini more than 3 hours after leaving 
the island of crete 
it happened in the last moments of the flight and the job was 
done i didnt worry about it the athletepilot kanellos 
kanellopoulos told a news conference in the greek capital he was 
not injured in the crash 
the situation in the landing area was too rough for this 
plane which is built for calm conditions i was under full control 
but the tail boom couldnt take the pressure said kanellopoulos 
who also broke the records for endurance and straightline 
humanpowered flight 
kanellopoulos 31 greek cycling champion for the past 14 years 
was flown to athens aboard an army helicopter shortly after the 
rough landing near the black sands of perissa beach on the 
southeast face of the volcanic island also known as thira 
the 72pound graphite epoxy and mylar plane designed by the 
massachusetts institute of technology fell after hitting a wind 
parallel to the beach said mit professor mark drela who was in 
one of the boats following the flight 
but drela the senior engineer responsible for the planes 
aerodynamic design said the project was definitely a success 
more than 500 islanders and foreign tourists gathered along the 
beach to watch the plane resembling an oversized insect glide 
toward the sand 
the snapped tail boom caused the planes huge 112foot long 
wings to break dropping the pinkandsilver aircraft 10 feet into 
the water 
i was underwater so i forced my way through the cockpit and 
dove under the plane then i swam to shore the tanned blond 
cyclist said 
kanellopoulos pumped the pedals in the nose of the aircraft for 
3 hours and 54 minutes to fly from heraklion air base to santorini 
he lifted off at 706 am 1206 am edt and landed at 1100 
am 4 am edt 
the flight was intended to emulate the 3500yearold myth of 
daedalus a greek architect sculptor and engineer who flapped his 
way across the aegean from crete on wings of feathers and wax 
daedalus son icarus flew too close to the sun which melted the 
wax causing him to to fall to his death 
the previous world record for humanpowered flight was set by 
the light eagle a daedalus 88 prototype piloted by glenn tremml 
who flew 372 miles around edwards air base in california in 
january 1987 
kanellopoulos also shattered the record for straightline 
humanpowered flight set in 1979 by bryan allen who pedaled the 
gossamer albatross 22 miles across the english channel 
the third record broken was for flight duration the previous 
mark was held by allen with a time of 2 hours 49 minutes 
greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue 
craft had escorted the plane as it soared 15 feet above the aegean 
the flight came after a 36member team of mit experts waited for 
three weeks on the windswept island of crete for a suitable day to 
attempt the flight 
essential requirements were a calm sea southerly winds of less 
than 3 knots temperatures under 70 degress fahrenheit and 
visibility to the horizon according to steve k bussolari an mit 
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations 
conditions for the flight were ideal we even had a southerly 
tailwind bussolari said 
the southerly tailwind pushed the daedalus 88 over the agean 
waters at a rate faster than expected by the mit team with the 
plane averaging 185 miles per hour team officials said they had 
not expected the ungainly flying machine to go over 14 miles per 
hour 
we were predicting the low speeds because we had been 
estimating headwinds which are prevalent we have no idea where 
the tailwinds came from said project news director ken campbell 
in addition to kanellopoulos three other athletepilots had 
been standing by for 48 hours each in readiness for a possible 
record flight 
they were francis scioscia 27 of scranton pa greg zack 26 
of wilmington nc and 27yearold tremml the former

the deployment of coast guard vessels in the 
persian gulf has been raised again at the pentagon a defense 
department official confirmed saturday night 
it was the brainchild of the commandant of the coast guard 
last year and it went nowhere said the official who asked that 
he not be identified by name it was raised again last week i 
dont know how serious it is 
a defense department spokesman maj randy morger said he had 
no information on the report 
the new york times said in its sunday editions that the coast 
guard vessels would assist larger warships in escorting merchant 
vessels keeping watch over sea lanes to prevent the laying of 
mines and guarding offshore installations from attacks by small 
craft 
the vessels also would free larger ships from routine patrols 
the paper said 
the times quoted unidentified pentagon officials as saying they 
did not know how many or precisely what kind of coast guard vessels 
would be sent if defense secretary frank carlucci approved the plan 
the coast guard is eager to assume a role in the gulf 
operations officials told the times 
the idea of using coast guard vessels had been proposed last 
october but was rejected by then defense secretary caspar 
weinberger 
the reagan administration expanded its naval presence in the 
persian gulf last summer at the request of kuwait an ally of iraq 
in the 7year iraniraq war which had seen its tankers become 
special targets of iranian attack 
president reagan saying it was essential to protect freedom of 
navigation in international waters announced the navy would 
protect any kuwaitiowned tankers that were reregistered to fly 
the us flag ultimately 11 kuwaiti ships were reflagged 
on friday administration officials said the reagan 
administration has decided to expand its policy to allow us 
warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack 
the change resulted from the mining of the us frigate samuel 
b roberts on april 14 and last mondays extensive fighting between 
iranian and us forces the officials said 
in that fighting us forces sank or crippled six iranian 
vessels that challenged them after they destroyed two offshore 
platforms in retaliation for the mining of the roberts 
despite the change in policy the pentagon hopes that it can 
avoid the assignment of additional ships to the gulf the officials 
said 
the pentagon recently has deployed the following numbers and 
types of ships in the persian gulf two command ships one cruiser 
one destroyer six frigates six minesweepers and an amphibious 
landing ship 
the department announced last week that the navy was deploying 
13 ships to the gulf region but said it was part of a longplanned 
and routine series of rotations pentagon spokesman dan howard said 
he announced the ship movements to head off speculation that the 
united states had decided to increase the size of its middle east 
force

rescue workers searching through the rubble 
of a grain elevator saturday found the bodies of the last of five 
people killed in an explosion a day earlier police said 
three bodies were discovered within half an hour of each other 
late saturday afternoon by rescue workers digging through debris 
corn and soybeans in the basement of the elevator said police 
detective alan horvath 
there were five people unaccounted for and we have recovered 
all five said joliet police captain james grace 
the three victims apparently had been in an office area of the 
elevator when it exploded and were found under a whole roomful of 
grain grace said 
authorities at first believed that another person had been blown 
into the river from a barge by the force of the explosion but 
grace said they no longer believe that report 
he added however that rescue workers are continuing their 
search in the area just as a precaution 
two bodies were recovered friday after the two explosions 
flattened four solos and an office building at the adm growmark 
granary about 40 miles southwest of chicago 
this is just one of those tragic things that should never 
happen said dan stewart whose 20yearold son mark was killed 
in fridays explosions 
he was a good son and i loved him said stewart a farmer 
from anchor ill whose son had been a trainee at the site as part 
of a program at joliet junior college 
the tragedy was especially horrifying for the family of dale 
brent slatton 28 of newark ill whose younger brother was 
killed in a car accident 10 months ago 
its totally devastating to have three sons and to lose two 
said the victims mother carol to lose any is a tragedy 
now this is something we have to go through again 
after toiling overnight workers using bulldozers and cranes had 
cleared about 50 percent of the debris strewn over the site by the 
explosions said an official at the joliet police command post at 
the site who would not identify himself 
authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first 
explosion which apparently ruptured a natural gas main about 11 
am and touched off a second blast moments later said joliet fire 
chief george plese 
but plese said saturday that the exact cause would be hard to 
determine 
we have no idea what caused the explosions and due to that 
much destruction it will be very hard to try to pinpoint anything 
but were going to try to make that attempt he said 
the bodies recovered saturday were identified as those of donald 
e zack of joliet daniel mclaughlin 18 of manhattan and michael 
dupuis 23 of bourbonnais said will county deputy coroner william 
ferguson 
david munchalfen a security guard said there had been four 
silos at the site and only a sheetmetal covered grain dryer 
remained standing one of the silos crushed an adjacent onestory 
office building

a rooftop parking area 
collapsed saturday during the grand opening of a grocery store 
dropping automobiles and blocks of concrete onto store displays and 
injuring 21 people police said 
it was not immediately known how many people were in the 
saveonfoods store when the parking area holding about 22 autos 
collapsed but constable lloyd wall of the royal canadian mounted 
police in burnaby said estimates ran as high as 900 many were 
elderly people being given a preview tour 
three of the injured were admitted to hospitals with one in 
serious condition 
police used cranes to remove huge blocks of concrete and cars 
that fell about 40 feet from the parking area to the floor of the 
store in the metrotown shopping center mounted police constable 
dave muir said 
it took several hours for searchers who used police dogs to 
get through the rubble officials believed everyone was accounted 
for wall said 
were being optimistic there wont be any deaths said 
mounted police sgt gary schauer but were still going through 
the rubble 
some cars were piled on each other on the supermarket floor amid 
soda and produce displays while above other autos teetered on the 
edge of a hole about half the size of a football field 
i heard a crack and i looked up and saw the center beam wobble 
and saw the floor from the parking garage come down so i 
immediately told people to get outside said one witness george 
sanderson 
as soon as the first crack came in the beam they started 
getting people out heppell said 
the collapse was preceded by the sound of a buckling beam and 
spray from a bursting water pipe officials said there were three 
warnings over the stores loudspeaker system to clear the area 
clarence heppell president of overwaitea foods which operates 
the store chain said a structural failure caused the cavein 
eight people were taken to a hospital by ambulance and others 
went to emergency wards on their own 
the staff was wellorganized but we had some problems with the 
customers said meatcutter john hill 38 they didnt appear to 
be trying to move too fast 
they were still checking out our prices its amazing how some 
people react 
freelance photographer robert klein who was taking pictures of 
the preview event said many thought it was a joke that a water 
pipe should burst in a brand new supermarket 
then i could see that the roof was bent and old this older man 
that the roof was going to go 
id just turned my back for one second and down it came there 
was suddenly a tremendous gust of wind at my back as i ran he 
said suddenly everybody was in shock everybody was stunned and 
some of the people were really freaked out

an unpublished congressional report says 
president reagans proposed missile defense system known as star 
wars likely would suffer a catastrophic failure the first time 
it was used the washington post reported sunday 
the first time would therefore be the only time it was used to 
protect the united states against a soviet nuclear attack the 
newspaper said 
the post said the conclusions are contained in a report by the 
office of technology assessment a nonpartisan scientific arm of 
the congress which studied reagans strategic defense initiative 
for the past two years 
the ota says in the report that the detailed computer 
instructions needed to destroy thousands of warheads streaking 
towards the united states probably cannot be produced in the 
foreseeable future according to the newspaper which said it 
obtained a copy of the reports summary chapter 
the post said the report also says that the timetable for 
missile defense deployment in the mid1990s established by sdi 
officials requires an act of faith in assuming that the system 
could indefinitely stop a substantial portion of soviet missiles 
because there is no scientific evidence to date to support the 
assumption 
the conclusions are among the principal findings of a 900page 
report on sdi prepared by the otas staff which was given access 
to classified sdi data and drew advice from an expert panel 
containing sdi supporters and opponents 
public release of an unclassified version of the report has been 
withheld for seven months by pentagon officials who say it 
contains sensitive information the paper said although three of 
the reports chapters remain in dispute sdi officials last month 
cleared nine others including the summary chapter obtained by the 
post 
the ota reports overall conclusion is that despite five years 
and 12 billion worth of scientific research many questions 
remain about the feasibility of meeting sdi goals which include 
at the outset substantial disruption of a soviet missile attack and 
in later stages elimination of the threat posed by soviet 
missiles the paper said 
noting that the nation would not want to base a major change 
in its nuclear strategy on a missile defense in which it had 
little confidence the ota report cautioned that the systems 
sheer complexity suggested there would always be irresolvable 
questions about how dependable the computer software was 
the post said 
extrapolating from past experience it appears to ota that 
the complexity of ballistic missile defense the uncertainty 
of the requirements it must meet and the novelty of the technology 
it must control would impose a significant probability of 
softwareinduced catastrophic failure in the systems first real 
battle the newspaper quoted the report as saying

us navy mine sweepers detonated mines 
friday that were found earlier in the week near an offshore iranian 
oil platform in the persian gulf the pentagon and shipping 
executives reported 
in another development officials in washington said the reagan 
administration has decided to permit navy warships in the gulf to 
intervene with force to help neutral merchant vessels that are 
attacked their orders have been to offer only humanitarian 
assistance 
shipping executives said three mines were detonated friday but 
pentagon officials in washington speaking privately said mine 
sweepers examined and destroyed five mines they said the 
explosives carried serial numbers indicating iran manufactured them 
the mines were spotted by a french warship tuesday near the 
sassan oil platform about 80 miles from the qatar peninsula the 
area was declared a navigational hazard and commercial vessels were 
warned to stay away 
sassan is one of two iranian platforms the navy destroyed monday 
in retaliation for a mine explosion that damaged the frigate samuel 
b roberts last week and wounded 10 sailors 
the navy and other nations mine sweepers have worked all week 
to clear a mine field about 70 miles northeast of where the mines 
were detonated friday 
that field is in a main shipping channel for reflagged kuwaiti 
tankers escorted by us warships 
escort operations which began last july have been suspended 
until the mines are cleared at least three of the 11 kuwaiti 
tankers given american flags and registration were anchored outside 
the gulf friday 
under the new us policy navy ships no longer would be 
instructed to stay away when iran attacks merchant ships sailing 
under other flags 
if a navy warship observed an iranian raid and was close enough 
to intervene it would have the authority to do so said the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity its a random 
targetofopportunity approach designed to throw the iranians off 
guard one said 
a capitol hill official briefed on the matter friday said 
this will give a lot of authority to local commanders and a lot 
of leeway to do as they see fit 
another official said our purpose is not to get into a war 
with iran our purpose is to secure safe passage for neutral 
shipping moving back and forth between neutral ports 
they said the policy change does not extend us military 
protection to convoys of foreignflag ships only ships flying the 
american flag will be entitled to doortodoor protection in 
convoys one official said

a week of ussoviet talks on the bering sea 
fishery that included discussion of a possible ban on fishing in 
the socalled doughnut hole ended friday with only a promise 
of additional meetings 
it was a good first meeting said edward wolfe the state 
departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries who headed the 
us delegation we agreed this was going to be an exploratory 
meeting and we exchanged views 
wolfe said no agreement was reached on a fishing moratorium in 
the doughnut hole a 4500square mile area in the center of 
the bering sea that is one of the richest fishing grounds in the 
world 
wolfe declined further comment adding only that such a fishing 
ban was discussed 
we will continue to discuss this issue said wolfe adding 
that he would brief members of congress next week 
the two sides agreed to meet again in moscow later this spring 
wolfe said the soviet union shares us concerns that foreign 
trawlers may be overfishing the doughnut hole and that could 
cause a decline in the catch in the american and soviet fishing 
zones that surround the area 
the catch by foreign vessels including those from japan south 
korea china and poland has risen from roughly 200000 metric tons 
in 1984 to more than 1 million metric tons in 1987 
according to a joint statement issued after the negotiations 
ended both sides agreed to develop further cooperation between 
the united states and the soviet union and the exercise of their 
rights and duties under international law to coordinate 
conservation and management of fishing in the bering sea 
earlier this year the senate overhwelmingly approved a 
resolution calling on the state department to negotiate a fishing 
moratorium in the doughnut hole 
the senate vote came in the wake of the videotapping by american 
fishermen of seven japanese trawlers fishing illegally in us 
waters off alaska

the soviet union on friday accused israel 
of state terrorism in the assassination of the palestine liberation 
organizations military commander 
it is but another example of israels cynical contempt for 
world public opinion soviet ambassador alexander belonogov told 
the security council 
belonogov also called the slaying another act of the policy of 
state terrorism which has long been practiced by israel 
tunisia which requested the council meeting wants israel 
condemned for the assassination of khalil wazir at his home in 
suburban tunis last saturday 
tunisian officials and israeli sources say israeli commandos 
gunned down wazir also known as abu jihad officially israel has 
neither confirmed nor denied the allegations 
in a carefully worded statement issued thursday by the israeli 
mission to the united nations the jewish state denied it 
admitted the attack as tunisia claimed 
the soviets joined a growing list of nations condemning israel 
for the assassination most have singled it out by name a few 
such as britain and france have not 
japans ambassador hideo kagami noted the absence of firm 
proof against israel kagami said any condemnation must be based 
on solid and irrefutable evidence 
many diplomats said they expected united states to veto 
tunisias resolution as it has several resolutions on the unrest 
considered by the council recently 
they said the us vote hinged on the wording of the resolution 
a direct condemnation of israel was sure to be vetoed but a 
general condemnation of political assassination might survive said 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a vote was expected monday dozens of nations have joined the 
debate including many accused of sponsoring terrorism such as 
libya 
many speakers told the council the slaying further hampers the 
prospects of a settlement between israel and arab neighbors 
the shots in tunisia are shots against peace in the middle 
east said yugoslav ambassador dragoslav pejic 
a number of speakers told israel that wazirs death will not end 
the palestinian unrest since dec 8 in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip that has left 171 palestinians and two israelis dead 
wazir who grew up in the gaza strip was the plo coordinator 
for the uprising 
the plo has issued orders for a day of rage in the 
israelioccupied terrorities saturday to avenge wazir according to 
a leaflet circulating in the area

patty nowakowski says she agreed to be a 
surrogate mother and gave birth to a boy and a girl only to find 
that the couple wanted just the girl 
now the twins not yet 3 weeks old live separately because the 
couple who hired her didnt want the boy after some hesitation 
she and her husband aaron have decided to raise the boy 
themselves and have named him arthur jay 
nowakowski 27 told her story this week to a special 
legislative panel looking into surrogacy contracts 
i was not aware of how carelessly the program is run the 
woman said when i entered into it i thought it would be a 
wonderful thing to do for someone else to help them have a family 
i never dreamed it would turn out this way 
the babies were born under a 10000 contract arranged by noel 
keane a dearborn attrney who specializes in surrogate birth 
agreements keane arranged mary beth whiteheads surrogate 
pregnancy which resulted in a protracted legal battle in new 
jersey known as the baby m case 
keane said he did not know of a couple ever having rejected a 
surrogate baby because of its sex and would not discuss the 
specifics of the nowakowski contract 
nowakowski was given fertility drugs and became pregnant at the 
first artificial insemination last july 
she said she learned she was carrying twins and underwent a 
procedure to determine the sex of the babies the test showed that 
one baby was a boy but the sex of the other could not be 
determined 
two weeks before the twins were born the other couple who 
already had children told her a doctor had recommended against 
adding more children to their family because of the added stress 
they had decided they did not want the boy nowakowski said 
in an interview thursday with the grand rapids press but the 
couple told her that if the other baby was a girl they would take 
her 
at that point i did not know what to do i was very angry 
nowakowski said it put us in a bad position 
nowakowski said she and her husband who have three other 
children thought they would put up the babies for adoption if they 
were both boys when the babies were born in a lansing hospital 
the couple came and took the baby girl the boy was sent to a 
foster home 
but that bothered nowakowski and she and her husband ended up 
taking arthur jay home 
it didnt seem fair to him that he was rejected by his 
biological father then rejected again by his surrogate parents

the foreign ministry on friday demanded an 
explanation from the us government after a state department 
official was quoted as saying that peru and ecuador face the threat 
of military coups 
ecuadors interior minister heinz moeller also assailed the 
statements attributed to elliot abrams assistant secretary of 
state for latin american affairs that were published in the 
argentine newspaper la nacion earlier this week 
la nacion said that in the interview conducted in buenos aires 
abrams was asked about threats to fragile latin american 
democracies it quoted him as saying that in meetings with latin 
american leaders he is frequently told that peru and ecuador are 
the most worrisome cases 
perus foreign ministry issued a communique saying it has 
presented its protest and solicited an explanation from the 
united states involving statements made in buenos aires two days 
previously regarding the existence of dangers of a coup in peru 
it added apart from being intrinsically erroneous those 
declarations constitute inadmissible interference in internal 
matters that deserves our energetic rejection 
moeller said thursday mr abrams is damaging the democratic 
process with his declarations 
there was no comment from the us embassies in lima and quito 
there are occasional rumors of possible coups in both andean 
nations which are suffering severe economic problems peru also is 
battling leftwing rebels in a revolt that has claimed more than 
10000 lives since 1980 
peruvian congressmen from various political parties discarded 
the chances of a military coup against the centrist government of 
president alan garcia 
political leaders in ecuador also dimissed the possibility of a 
coup against conservative president leon febres cordero 
both countries had military governments during the 1970s 
democracy was restored in ecuador in 1979 and in peru in 1980

a secret report prepared by a team of 
specialists from prime minister yitzhak shamirs office said israel 
is facing a new and improved period in its troubled relations with 
the soviet union 
israel television said it obtained details of the report and 
quoted it on friday as predicting a qualitative change in 
israelisoviet ties 
the study was completed this week and was based on various 
materials pertaining to the soviet union open as well as 
classified and on an analysis of the kremlins latest contacts 
with the arab countries and the palestine liberation organization 
the television report said without attribution 
officials from shamirs office were not available for comment 
the soviet union and all east european countries except romania 
broke ties with the jewish state following the 1967 middle east 
war in 1986 and 1987 israel reestablished lowlevel diplomatic 
ties with poland and hungary 
last july moscow sent a consular delegation to jerusalem the 
first soviet diplomatic group to visit israel in 20 years a 
similar israeli group was expected to travel to moscow this month 
but its visas have been delayed according to foreign ministry 
officials 
the specialists report said the soviets may now make serious 
concessions to israel including the issue of the emigration of 
soviet jews israel television said but it gave not details 
soviet leaders recently permitted increased jewish emigration 
which reached a 15month high of 984 in march 
dozens of soviet jews including some who have been denied exit 
visas have been allowed to visit relatives in israel in recent 
months some israeli immigrants from the soviet union were 
permitted to visit their families in the soviet union 
the television broadcast quoted the report as saying the soviet 
union may change its pattern of contacts with israel while taking 
into account israels close ties with the united states 
according to the broadcast account the report predicted an 
intensive period of soviet peacemaking activity in the middle east 
and said it may result in an official visit of foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze to israel during his upcoming mideast trip 
the study reportedly noted that moscow is undertaking a 
consistent course of restoring friendly relations with israel while 
demanding more diplomatic flexibility from the arab states 
the soviet union has said the middle east conflicts should be 
resolved by an international conference and the palestine 
liberation organization should participate in peace talks 
israel is not ready to accept the participation of the plo 
which it views as a terrorist group it also has said the soviets 
must restore diplomatic ties and increase jewish emigration before 
playing any major role in peace talks 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc opposes the proposal 
for an international conference which would include the soviet 
union as one of the five permanent members of the un security 
council shamir has said israel could be isolated at such a forum 
and forced to make territorial concessions on the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
shamirs political rival foreign minister shimon peres has 
said an international conference is the only way to prepare for 
peace talks with israels arab neighbors 
peres head of the socialist labor party expressed optimism 
friday about possible soviet involvement asked to comment on talks 
by us secretary of state george p shultz over the last two days 
in moscow peres said 
we still dont know the results of the meeting but there is 
one issue from which we may learn something its afganistan it 
was a very severe case of regional conflict and the superpowers 
agreed on how to stop it positively 
but shultz could not persuade the soviets to restore diplomatic 
ties with israel or pledge to increase jewish emigration a us 
official in moscow said 
the harsh tone of official soviet statements also contrasted 
with the reportedly optimistic study conducted by shamirs office 
on friday the soviets accused israel of state terrorism in the 
killing of plo military chief khalil wazir last week in tunisia 
it is but another example of israels cynical contempt for the 
world public opinion soviet ambassador alexander belonogov told 
the un security council he called the killing another act of 
the policy of state terrorism which has long been practiced by 
israel

the stock markets attempt to rally since the 
crash last fall has failed to impress decisionmakers at one of the 
nations largest moneymanagement firms 
it is a rally in a bear market and we are toward the end of 
it contends henry gailliot senior vice president and economist 
at the pittsburghbased federated research corp 
whatever you regard as your defensive position in regard to 
the stock market we believe you should now be in it gailliot 
added in an interview 
that puts him at odds with analysts at some of wall streets 
most prominent brokerage firms who argue that the current mood of 
fear and pessimism is setting the stage for higher stock prices 
gailliot agrees rallies usually exhaust themselves only when 
they have attracted a large following of true believers id like 
to see more enthusiasm at the top he acknowledges 
nevertheless he says spotting the precise moment when such an 
event occurs is a very difficult and chancy assignment and he 
adds the easy money in the rally has already been made 
gailliot bases his reasoning on an appraisal of the 
character of the markets rise from its lows late last year 
in the aftermath of the october crash gailliot asserted that 
stock prices were almost certain to rebound however he added at 
the time the upswing itself would have to be watched for a while 
to see whether it looked like only a passing phenomenon or 
something more durable 
by april 13 he concluded the rally had flunked that test 
in its early stages the markets rise produced a strong 
plurality of individual stocks rising in price vs those that 
declined but these very positive breadth characteristics have 
deteriorated significantly in the last month he said 
meanwhile volume of stock trading has contracted as prices have 
risen he observed that is a classic bearmarket 
characteristic he said 
in spite of all the recent signs of strength in the economy 
gailliot believes a recession is lurking in the nottoodistant 
future 
the federal reserve is being forced back into its old position 
of fighting inflation and defending the dollar he says one 
must remember that about onethird of all recessions are not 
predictable we only know after the fact 
but while he believes the portents are bad for stocks gailliot 
takes a far more upbeat view of the outlook for bonds a bull 
market in bonds began on black monday when 30year treasury 
bonds were yielding about 104 percent 
from that point prices rose and yields fell to about 83 
percent several weeks ago since then they have climbed back up to 
9 percent creating what gailliot views as another opportunity to 
buy 
once the recession he expects manifests itself and becomes 
widely recognized he maintains the yield on longterm treasury 
bonds could get as low as 6 percent 
the recession will eventually set the stage for a new bull 
market that could cap off the 1980s as a true decade for 
financial assets gailliot says but he views the investment 
outlook for the 1990s as less certain 
by then he says the nation will have stretched its habit of 
deficit spending of consuming more than it produces to an 
important limit 
at that point he says the worlds financial markets will 
provide the united states with only enough money to carry its 
existing debts rather than to expand them 
when that happens he says the nation will be forced into 
making tough choices about how to deal with its domestic and 
international deficits and the choices it makes will go a long way 
toward determining the financial shape of the 1990s

the communist government has taken 
significant steps toward reconciliation with vietnams roman 
catholic and protestant minorities but it remains in serious 
dispute with the vatican 
the vietnamese authorities object to vatican plans to canonize 
117 people including 11 spaniards and 10 frenchmen who died at 
the hands of vietnamese rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries 
the vatican holds the victims to be martyrs who died in a period 
of repression of catholicism but vietnam maintains they were 
agents of french colonialism 
hanoi says it does not oppose the canonization as such but 
objects to the way it says vietnamese abroad have seized on it to 
make it an anticommunist political issue 
this canonization is not any more a religious affair vu 
thai hoa an official of the governments commission on religious 
affairs said in an interview with the associated press 
the martyrs were beatified earlier this century as the first 
step toward sainthood vietnam was a french colony at the time the 
vatican announced the canonization last june and the elevations are 
scheduled to take place this june 19 
hoa charged that the vatican never consulted with hanoi about 
the canonization 
he said those to be canonized include frenchmen who invaded the 
country disguised as missionaries 
hoa added that in the documents promoting the cause of 
sainthood the vatican should delete charges that vietnamese 
authorities have persecuted the church for 300 years 
he also said references to republic of vietnam the name of the 
pre1975 government in south vietnam should be changed to the 
vietnams current official name socialist republic of vietnam 
he also said vietnam also wants the the date of the ceremony 
changed because june 19 was the army holiday of the old south 
vietnamese government which the north vietnamese and viet cong 
defeated in 1975 
hanois main concern however appears to be that thousands of 
the estimated 1 million overseas vietnamese will stage protests at 
the ceremony to be officiated by pope john paul ii at st peters 
basilica and call on catholics in vietnam to oppose their 
government 
they are preparing south vietnam flags and anticommunist 
posters for the occasion hoa said 
vietnamese officials also are concerned that this may be the 
first step in an attempt to set up a church in exile 
a vatican source speaking on condition of anonmyity said 
protests wont be permitted at the ceremony but added that the 
documents of sainthood were prepared long ago and cant be changed 
the date was pure coincidence the source said adding that the 
ceremony was to have been june 26 but had to be changed because 
pope john paul ii had another commitment 
hoa said about 2500 catholic priests and 5 million catholics 
remain in vietnam along with about 400 protestant pastors and 
200000 protestants 
vietnam is a mainly buddhist country of 63 million people 
vietnamese emperors executed some catholics after the first 
missionaries began arriving in the late 16th century american 
missionaries brought protestantism to vietnam early this century 
hundreds of thousands of catholics streamed south when the 
country was divided in 1954 into the communist north and 
noncommunist south many fled the country after the communists 
reunified it in 1975 
protestants and catholics were perceived as having backed not 
only the french but later south vietnam and its ally the united 
states 
south vietnam and the vatican had official relations 
the vietnamese communist party leader nguyen van linh who came 
to power in december 1986 has called for an end to discrimination 
against catholics saying they have a valuable role to play in 
vietnams development 
since then dozens of priests many of them military chaplains 
or otherwise associated with the south vietnam government were 
freed from socalled political reeducation camps the communists 
established after winning the war 
hoa said almost all priests have now been released 
in february 1987 authorities reopened in ho chi minh city 
formerly saigon the first catholic seminary since all of them were 
closed by 1982 this past february officials permitted the opening 
in hanoi the nations capital the first protestant seminary since 
the last previous one was closed in 1976 hoa said two more 
catholic seminaries probably will be opened by years end 
last year two vietnamese catholic prelates were allowed to 
attend the worldwide synod of bishops at the vatican and the head 
of the protestant church in northern vietnam was permitted to go to 
western europe for a church congress priests also have been freer 
to travel inside vietnam and to talk with foreigners 
there are signs too that churches will be allowed to resume 
social welfare work such as in schools and orphanages a move 
likely to bring more aid from christian relief agencies in the 
west in november government officials met with catholic relief 
agency officials from 13 western countries 
suspicions remain however that the government is actually 
trying to coopt church leaders rather than allow more freedom 
the archbishop of hue the rev nguyen kim dien remains under 
house arrest for opposing a statesupervised organization for 
priests 
the rev tran dinh thu who is 81 years old has been sentenced 
to life in prison after his conviction of printing propaganda and 
training dissidents in his ho chi minh city church

the trade bill that emerged from the house this 
past week was too strong for president reagan but it was too weak 
for richard gephardt and clyde v prestowitz jr 
the washington insiders say the united states must go even 
farther to force other nations to open their markets to us 
products and protect vital us industries from unfair competition 
government needs to have a master plan for managing foreign 
trade say the people who are sometimes described as economic 
nationalists 
according to their theory americans are only kidding themselves 
by clinging to the idea that other nations will spontaneously drop 
their trade barriers out of enlightened selfinterest 
in fact they say japan has made a national policy of 
protecting its domestic industries while picking off american 
industries one at a time 
the united states which reigned supreme at the end of world war 
ii foolishly allowed its economic power to deteriorate at the same 
time it was spending billions on its military the argument goes 
gephardt ran for president on this platform and the missouri 
congressman continues to believe that the public agrees with him 
despite his early exit from the democratic race he says he was 
held back in the presidential primaries only by a lack of money to 
get his message across 
now comes prestowitz to add meat to the bones of the argument 
with a book called trading places how we allowed japan to take 
the lead basic books 365 pages 
prestowitz started the book in 1986 after quitting the reagan 
administration where he was the commerce departments chief 
negotiator on trade with japan 
endorsers of the book include such hightechnology business 
leaders as david packard chairman of hewlettpackard co and 
robert w galvin chairman of motorola inc 
prestowitz says people who oppose government involvement in 
trade and industry need to recognize that the government is already 
intimately involved in both areas only in an inefficient and 
unplanned way 
we do manage trade but because we kind of back into it and 
say that were not winking we come up with the worst of all 
possible worlds we protect industries that are practically corpses 
without doing anything to rebuild them prestowitz said in a 
recent interview 
no more than 10 percent of world trade is fully free now the 
us trade representatives office has estimated even the reagan 
administration has import limits voluntary or otherwise on 
cars steel textiles and semiconductors 
lets be honest prestowitz said lets recognize what 
were doing and lets proceed in a way that gives us more 
benefits 
prestowitz praises the reagan administrations semiconductor 
accord with japan which he said made it clear that the government 
would not let the us chip industry go down the drain 
that public assurance which is rare in the united states but 
common in japan gave companies like motorola the sense of security 
they needed to make a huge investment in returning to production of 
memory chips 
gephardt in an interview friday said prestowitz performed a 
great service by writing this book thres no one in the country 
whos had more epxierience in trying to get fair trade than clyde 
prestowitz 
gephardt was the only democrat in the house who voted against 
the trade bill this past thursday because he thought it was too 
weak one other democratic dissenter new yorks robert j mrazek 
thought the bill was too strong 
fear is one reason many leaders in government and industry hold 
back from more aggressive trading practices gephardt believes 
fear that if you disagree with somebody as we disagree with the 
russians all the time that well be accused of unfairness of 
racism 
in fact the housepassed trade bill was reviled as 
antijapanese on friday by hajime tamura japans minister of 
international trade and industry according to kyodo news service 
in japan antijapanese is almost the same as racist 
the trade bill is the most comprehensive trade legislation since 
1974 and garnered 24 more votes than the twothirds necessary to 
override a reagan veto a vote in the senate is expected tuesday 
the most attentiongetting portion of the bill was one that had 
almost nothing to do with trade a provision requiring 60 days 
notice of a plantclosing or longterm layoff by companies 
employing more than 100 people 
more significant was a provision requiring investigation of 
countries with pervasive unfair trade practices the government 
could retaliate if the barriers were not eliminated 
similarly industries seriously injured by imports could get 
protection if they were willing to make a positive adjustment 
to foreign competition 
free traders say the united states is largely to blame for its 
failure to penetrate foreign markets

the story of the stock markets behavior over 
the past couple of months has been a whole lot of motion and very 
little progress 
wide swings stretching over a few days or even a few hours have 
been commonplace yet a glance back to midfebruary shows most of 
the popular market indicators barely changed from where they stood 
then 
as they survey this situation many observers see the market 
caught in a classic dilemma 
shortterm volatility in stock prices in the aftermath of last 
years crash they agree has frightened away many individual 
investors and money managers at investing institutions 
but the presence of those same investors may be required if 
volatility is going to be reduced 
in the meantime many wall streeters lament a market climate 
that seems given over almost entirely to players with a gimmick a 
takeover rumor a matched set of buy and sell orders keyed to an 
impending dividend payment or a computer program index 
arbitrage transaction 
the outcry over program trading was raised again on thursday 
when the market rose sharply in early trading took an abrupt drop 
at midafternoon and then bounced back again at the close to finish 
little changed 
there seemed to be no fundamental reasons for all these sudden 
swings other than fluctuations in stock index futures that kept 
changing the equations on which program trading is based 
the situation has been described as the tail wagging the 
dog but william king head equity trader at nikko securities 
international says that description doesnt go far enough 
it has the dog by the tail and is whipping it around in the 
air he says 
defenders of program trading contend that by serving an 
arbitrage function of keeping prices in line between the futures 
and cash markets the practice actually serves as a stabilizing 
influence over time 
but king says that argument glosses over the dirty little 
secret of program trading 
derivativeproduct traders need volatility to prosper if they 
dont have it they try to manufacture it he said 
they move into positions and when the conditions are right 
they try to influence prices 
instead of providing liquidity they aggravate the movement in 
the direction of the trend 
at the close on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
stood at 201509 up 116 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 03 to 14703 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
14 to 37404 and the american stock exchange market value index 
slipped 121 to 29803 
volume on the big board averaged 15502 million shares a day 
against 18357 million the week before 
the shortterm trading mentality prevading the street these days 
also came under attack on april 14 when disappointing news on the 
trade deficit touched off a 10146point drop in the dow jones 
industrial average 
what sense could it make many people asked to chop 100 
billion off the value of stocks on the basis of a single statistic 
for just one month which may or may not be reliable and could well 
be substantially revised in the next monthly report 
but longtime observers of the markets say such behavior isnt 
really as irrational as it looks 
after all they say professional traders arent in the business 
of contemplative analysis they are engaged in trying to outwit 
each other on a battleground that is constantly shifting 
the latest number is new additional information even if it 
is often unreliable observed john connolly at dean witter 
reynolds inc 
this information either fits preconceived notions or 
challenges them arguments may be buttressed and markets moved

the supreme courts ruling this past week that 
the federal government may tax interest paid on state and local 
government bonds was widely seen as ratifying authority congress 
already felt it had 
but the decision enraged one group of bond issuers who called it 
a butchery of the constitution and threatened drastic 
remedies if necessary to protect tax exemption from further 
erosion 
others worried the ruling may encourage a revenuehungry 
congress to find ways to tax interest on such bonds to fill the 
gaping budget deficit 
the ruling had no effect on the taxexempt status of the 
estimated 730 billion in municipal bonds already outstanding nor 
on future issues which are expected to amount to another 100 
billion this year alone 
bond fund managers reported no significant selling in taxexempt 
funds occurred after the ruling and expressed confidence that 
congress would never remove tax exemption retroactively anyway 
but the ruling could have longrange implications for issuers 
who have been selling taxexempt bonds at relatively low rates of 
interest for projects such as schools and roads as well as for 
investors who accept lower interest for their money because the 
payments have not been taxed by the federal government 
we dont take this as an inconsequential ruling said 
randolph c arndt a spokesman for the national league of cities 
it is a very big threat to the capacity of state and local 
revenue systems 
the case was brought by the state of south carolina challenging 
a law requiring that state and municipal bonds be registered in the 
name of the owner if the interest paid is to be exempt from federal 
taxation it cited the 1895 case pollock vs farmers loan amp trust 
co in which the supreme court held that interest earned on a state 
bond was exempt from federal taxation 
this past wednesday the supreme court rejected the challenge 
in writing the majority opinion justice william j brennan said 
that owners of state bonds have no constitutional entitlement 
against having to pay federal taxes on the interest earned on the 
bonds 
justice sandra day oconnor dissenting from the 71 decision 
said the court overruled a precedent it has honored for nearly a 
hundred years and makes state and local government financing 
activities partly dependent on whether congress voluntarily 
abstains from tapping this permissible source of income tax 
revenue 
word of the decision initially sent taxexempt bond prices 
lower but the market quickly bounced back as traders appeared to 
conclude that it made no fundamental changes in how congress viewed 
the issue anyway 
congress has been legislating for some time under the 
presumption that the pollock decision of 1895 was obsolete said 
george friedlander managing director for municipal bond research 
at smith barney harris upham amp co 
the chairman of the taxwriting house ways and means committee 
rep dan rostenkowski dill said congress has presumed for 20 
years that it could enact laws involving the federal tax treatment 
of state and local government bonds he said there was no reason to 
believe that the courts latest decision will either prompt or 
deter future congressional action 
the public securities association a trade group for bond 
dealers said it was surprised and disappointed that the supreme 
court went out of its way to state its views on tax exemption 
the groups president heather ruth said laws enacted in the 
past few years have chipped away at the taxexempt status of some 
municipal bonds 
fears that congress would enact restrictions as part of the 1986 
tax law prompted issuers to sell a record 220 billion in new 
longterm municipal bonds in 1985 newissue volume has since 
fallen to 151 billion in 1986 and 105 billion in 1987 and is 
expected to fall to 100 billion this year she said 
alan beals the executive director of the national league of 
cities said local government officials have been angered and 
disgusted by the unrelenting assault by congress and the 
executive branch on local revenue systems and was even more 
outraged at the willingness of the judicial branch to condone and 
even encourage such activities 
we do not accept this butchery of the constitution and we are 
prepared to respond with drastic remedies if necessary he said 
arndt said that among the remedies are the possibility of 
amending the constitution enacting legislation to spell out the 
exemption or making the issue fundamental to support or opposition 
for political candidates

despite lowerthanexpected orders to us factories in march 
analysts say the economy remains strong 
the commerce department said friday that orders for durable 
goods items expected to last at least three years were virtually 
unchanged last month reflecting a drop in military hardware that 
offset gains in other areas 
that was far less than the 13 percent advance most economists 
were expecting however the government raised its estimate of new 
orders in february the revised report shows a 01 percent gain for 
the month rather than the previously reported 11 percent drop 
the net result was a relatively strong level of orders through 
the first quarter of this year 79 percent above a year ago when 
compared march to march 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers said the report indicated modest growth in the 
economy not a boom but no signs of a big dip 
roger brinner an economist with data resources inc a 
lexington mass forecasting firm said it was premature to worry 
about sluggish growth in new orders because shipments remain strong 
and the backlog in unfilled orders remains high 
but the lowerthanexpected results for march along with a 
stronger dollar overseas helped both the bond and stock markets 
which have been depressed over fears of inflation and higher 
interest rates 
the key 30year treasury bonds price rose about 5 per 1000 
in face amount friday and its yield fell back under 9 percent on

a new federal ban on smoking on domestic airline 
flights lasting under two hours went into effect at 1201 am edt 
today 
the new regulations which outlaw smoking on flights of less 
than two hours carry stiff fines for violations up to 1000 for 
smoking and 2000 for tinkering with lavatory smoke alarms 
they apply to around 80 percent of all us flights or an 
estimated 13600 a day 
under the new rules airlines are required to announce to 
passengers onboard before takeoff that smoking is prohibited on the 
flight and to keep the no smoking indicator lights illuminated 
for the duration of affected flights 
even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes 
beyond two hours smoking will be prohibited if the schedule has it 
as lasting two hours or less according to officials of the federal 
aviation administration 
in addition to the onboard warning many airlines are making 
announcements in the gate area before passengers board the plane 
travelers flying united airlines the nations largest carrier 
are being advised individually of the new regulations when they 
check in 
secondranked american airlines flight attendants and ticket 
agents have been given special instructions to inform passengers 
about which flights will be nonsmoking and boarding passes have 
been changed 
northwest airlines whose tough policy goes beyond the federal 
requirements by banning smoking on nearly all its domestic flights 
is handing out candies and mints as well as brochures to 
passengers american is providing cinnamon hard candies suggested 
by the american heart association and the american lung association 
as a substitute for cigarettes 
and continental airlines is distributing more than 430000 
pieces of a gum called ban smoke designed to temporarily 
control the urge 
airlines say they have briefed their cabin crews on the new 
regulations and how to handle potentially defiant smokers flight 
attendants will tell the rebels that they are in violation of 
federal law and advise them of the consequences 
if a passenger persists in smoking airlines say they may notify 
authorities at the planes next destination arrange for the plane 
to be met by the police or even divert the aircraft in some cases 
involving unruly smokers
