slashing across floridas midsection from 
coast to coast tropical storm keith blew northward into the 
atlantic on wednesday leaving damaged homes eroded beaches and up 
to 6 inches of rain 
disasterpreparedness officials reported no major damage or 
injuries from the lateblooming storm which generated winds up to 
65 mph in a path ranging from the sarasota area on the gulf coast to 
cape canaveral on the east 
the space shuttle atlantis perched on its atlantic seashore 
launch pad was unscathed and the storm will have no impact on its 
scheduled dec 1 launch said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone workers 
mopped up rainwater that blew into its aft compartment 
schools were closed in three counties red cross officials said 
more than 500 residents of lowlying areas along the gulf coast 
returned to their homes wednesday after spending the night in 
shelters 
keith was just below hurricane strength and as we thought 
the main problem was coastal erosion said bob sheets director of 
the national hurricane center in miami now its going out over 
the atlantic its not going to intensify its going to just keep 
moving bermuda could get some tropical storm conditions over there 
so were keeping an eye on that 
at 11 pm est the center of the storm was near latitude 299 
north and longitude 767 west or about 725 miles westsouthwest of 
bermuda moving eastnortheast at 20 to 25 mph with 50 mph winds on 
a track that could bring it to bermuda by thursday afternoon the 
center reported 
the storm was blamed for several tornadoes which damaged mobile 
homes and for the derailing of 20 train cars near lakeland when the 
railroad bed was washed out by heavy rains 
the derailment ruptured a natural gas line and forced the 
evacuation of 450 people from a onesquaremile area no one was 
reported injured the gas dissipated and most people returned to 
their homes by early afternoon polk county officials said 
a tornado struck two mobile home parks near leesburg in central 
florida on tuesday causing slighttomedium damage to about 25 
trailers and several vehicles no one was injured said bob reymont 
lake county director for emergency management 
keith stormed ashore after midnight near sarasota which may 
have experienced the most substantial damage said dick morgan of 
the state division of emergency management 
sand blown by keith was up to the doorknobs of some beachfront 
motels in naples on the gulf coast and workers with bulldozers and 
shovels began the slow task of digging them out wednesday 
but other naples residents said they never felt a thing 
we slept through the whole thing we could hardly believe 
there was a storm at all said mary joe park 
the storms exit from the state near cape canaveral was 
accompanied by 35 to 45 mph wind gusts and heavy rains causing some 
temporary road flooding and downed trees and power lines but most 
central florida residents made light of it with one comparing it to 
a sudden summer thunderstorm 
for once the weather did us a favor said orlandoarea 
citrus grower jerry chicone jr 
we got about six inches of rain which was much needed it 
prepares us for the winter season and the winds werent strong 
enough to do any tree damage chicone said so it was very 
positive for us here 
tampa orlando daytona and the cape canaveral area reported from 
5 to 6 inches of rain 
orlando airport spokeswoman carolyn fennell reported no undue 
delays in air traffic disney world spokesman jim hampton said keith 
did not alter the operations schedule at the large tourist 
attraction and the florida highway patrols randy harper said 
central florida roads suffered no major problems

every day is thanksgiving day at the 
rainbow kitchen one of hundreds of american soup kitchens where 
hunger never takes a holiday 
these people need help yearround not just during the 
holidays kevin amos said as he stocked the rainbow kitchens 
pantry with canned goods 
this is one of those thousand points of light presidentelect 
george bush talks about said bob anderson a former steel 
worker but theres no reason this kind of charity should have to 
exist we just keep going because we dont want to see people turned 
away 
anderson opened the rainbow kitchen in 1984 after the sharp 
decline of steel and heavy manufacturing left thousands jobless in 
homestead a historic steel town adjacent to pittsburgh 
the rainbow kitchen is one cog amid all the soup lines food 
banks churches and senior citizen centers nationwide that make up 
an evergrowing mostly volunteer and imperfect machine that 
distributes millions of pounds of free food every year 
we never thought wed be in operation this long anderson 
said the number of people we serve just keeps growing and 
growing 
homesteads eighth avenue bustled when us steels sprawling 
homestead works was turning out giant steel slabs into the early 
1980s but the mill is cold and shuttered now and business on the 
avenue is slower 
at noon each day a quiet line forms outside the rainbow kitchen 
where hot lunches are served to an average of 185 people 
we get a mixture of people anderson said it used to be a 
lot more unemployed people i think now its more underemployed 
people i see more children than id like to see here we get whole 
families 
one recent chilly afternoon sharon fischer 25 expressed 
gratitude as she and two of her three young children munched on 
hamburger patties pasta and potato salad served on plastic plates 
im not ashamed im not rich she said this is decent 
they make sure youre full when you leave 
ms fischer single and unemployed said she has looked for work 
but they arent hiring she said she cant get by on food 
stamps so she eats at the kitchen several times a week 
anderson operates the rainbow kitchen on 125000 a year most of 
the money comes from small donations although rock star bruce 
springstein donated 10000 in 1985 
sometimes we run out of food and just hold up the line 
anderson said we open up some big cans of beans or something and 
just start making sandwiches like crazy 
every thursday the rainbow kitchen opens its pantry to about 700 
families who are given a bag or two of groceries 
since 1980 changes by congress and the reagan administration 
have narrowed eligibility for food stamps and therefore reduced the 
amount going out last year the federal government spent 1059 
billion for food stamps compared with 1198 billion in 1980 
according to census bureau figures adjusted for inflation in that 
time the number of people receiving food stamps declined by about 
900000 the census bureau said 
in roughly the same period from 1979 to the present the number 
of people living below the poverty line of 11600 annual income for 
a family of four has grown by 6 million the government reports 
many people eligible for food stamps either dont apply or are 
wrongly rejected according to robert fersh executive director of 
the nonprofit food research and action center in washington dc 
on average food stamp recipients each month get stamps worth 
about 54 cents per meal although fersh said some elderly 
individuals get as little as 10 a month its therefore no surprise 
many run out of money at months end and turn to pantries and soup 
kitchens for help he said 
the number of people needing food by the end of the month has 
risen fersh said the people who rely on the safety net not 
only have had food assistance cut but have to pay more for medical 
care and utilities 
annual surveys by the us conference of mayors reveal a steady 
increase in the need for emergency food said laura waxman 
assistant executive director of the group 
a survey of 26 cities found twothirds of those who needed food 
in 1987 were families with children she said 
you think of the traditional soup kitchen user as the single 
man or the single woman but we know there are more and more 
families ms waxman said 
the heart of the nations grassroots food distribution is the 
second harvest national food bank network which began in 1979 in 
phoenix 
last year second harvest now based in chicago distributed 
about 387 million pounds of food its 205 affiliated food banks 
served 38000 local charities including pantries soup kitchens 
shelters and daycare and senior citizen centers 
yet the need for more food is constant 
what i generally hear are stories of a food pantry that is so 
strapped for food and money that it is only able to supply three 
days supply of food per family per month regardless of the depth of 
the familys need said john arnold public policy manager for 
second harvest 
many of the nations food banks started in church basements with 
one vehicle to haul food but the average food bank today has 
several trucks and handles 3 million to 6 million pounds of food a 
year arnold said 
the greater pittsburgh community food bank boasts a 
160000squarefoot warehouse in nearby mckeesport that was bought 
after a fundraising drive led by two local banks in 1987 the food 
bank distributed about 73 million pounds of food to about 300 
affiliates including the rainbow kitchen said executive director 
joyce rothermal 
more than half the food banks supplies are donated by second 
harvest grocery stores and individuals some are bought with state 
money a small portion with federal money and the remainder with 
food bank money 
theres a group of people who are really bad off ms 
rothermal said its falling to the private sector to help them 
harry and marian halt of homestead who have a teenage son and 
daughter were among those crowded into the rainbow kitchen on a 
recent thursday waiting with paper bags and carts to pick up a slab 
of butter a carton of eggs and other groceries 
we usually make the food stretch but we sometimes get a little 
close said halt 47 he said heart problems forced him in 1986 to 
quit his job as a caseworker for the state department of welfare 
i dont know what wed do without these food banks halt said

east germanys dispute with the kremlin over a 
reformist soviet magazine intensified when radio moscow defended the 
publication as mirroring a plurality of opinions in the soviet 
press 
in a related development on tuesday a west german newspaper 
reported that east german authorities have pulled five 
antistalinist soviet films from theaters around the german 
communist state 
on saturday the east german communist party newspaper neues 
deutschland said the government in east berlin had suspended 
delivery of sputnik a soviet periodical that contains a selection 
of articles from the soviet press 
neues deutschland charged that the magazines articles do not 
contribute to cementing sovieteast german relations and instead 
contain articles that distort history 
in recent issues sputnik has carried articles containing frank 
appraisals of the stalin era along with letters and commentaries 
critical of kremlin policies 
radio moscows germanlanguage service heard in berlin on 
tuesday said the ban resulted from a misunderstanding here at 
the editorial side of radio moscow we have understanding for the 
motives which have been given for this decision 
but we believe that in this case there is a misunderstanding 
the publication of the magazine sputnik only mirrors the 
plurality of opinions in the soviet press we hope that this 
regretful incident will be settled over time it said 
the west german newspaper die welt said east german authorities 
have pulled five antistalinist soviet films from theaters in east 
germany 
die welt said the order came from the east german culture 
ministry and took effect on saturday the newspaper did not identify 
its sources 
east german leaders have resisted soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness contending that a such 
critical discussion of problems in east germany is unnecessary 
gorbachev enjoys enormous popularity among east germans who hope 
the soviet leaders influence will bring about similar reforms in 
their country 
in recent months east german authorities have cracked down on 
the nations lutheran church press censoring or banning 
publications dealing with human rights issues

with unemployment the highest in western 
europe spains socialist government and labor unions longtime 
allies are on the verge of a serious split 
when leaders of spains 100yearold general workers union called 
recently for a nationwide strike to protest government economic 
austerity policies they took what many saw as the final step toward 
a divorce from the governing spanish socialist workers party and the 
46yearold prime minister felipe gonzalez 
the union and its erstwhile rival the communistoriented workers 
commissions have set a 24hour nationwide strike for dec 14 
the aim of both unions is to force gonzalez a former labor 
lawyer to shift his support to labor and drop policies favoring 
only moderate wage hikes and low inflation as the way to high 
economic growth 
labor minister manuel chaves decision to create a youth job 
corps was the last straw for the unions who claim the low wages 
proposed in the plan will take jobs away from older workers at a 
time when the unemployment rate has soared to 188 percent 
the youth plan calls for the creation of up to to 800000 jobs 
for unemployed youths 16 to 25 years old over the next three years 
through low wages and tax credits for businesses who must provide 
training during their sixto18 month contracts 
at least 45 percent of those in the 1625 age group are 
unemployed and many have never held a job 
apolinar rodriguez member of the general workers union executive 
committee said the program foments inequities among workers since 
youths hired under the plan will be making less than the minimum 
legal wage the equivalent of 376 a month for those aged 18 to 
25 and will be excluded from collective bargaining agreements 
economy minister carlos solchaga reponded however that the 
unions may find the majority of spaniards do not share their 
disapproval of the youth jobs program 
even before the jobs plan conflict the unions had clashed with 
the gonzalez government over wage agreements 
union leaders have denounced the governments request that 
employers reject demands for immediate wage increases until after 
the first of the year despite a recent rise in inflation to 5 
percent two points above the 1988 government target 
nicolas redondo secretary general of the general workers union 
helped propel gonzalez to the top of the socialist party during the 
bitter years of the opposition to the authoritarian regime of gen 
francisco franco but redondo quit his parliament seat in 1987 to 
protest a budget he viewed as antilabor 
the strikes are not just about money but about ideology 
redondo said recently the economic policies of this government 
instead of helping workers lean clearly to the right it should 
realize it cannot remain in power very long with just the support of 
businessmen and bankers 
the spanish confederation of employers has given its full support 
to the youth plan and backs continued government calls for moderate 
wages 
the economic policies criticized by the unions have helped end a 
decade of economic stagnation in spain and spurred a boom that has 
fueled a 5 percent annual growth the highest in western europe for 
the past two years 
a top labor ministry official alvaro espina has criticized the 
unions opposition to the jobs plan saying they appear more 
interested in politics than helping youths get jobs 
espina lamented the growing separation between the unions and the 
socialist administration which diminishes their the unions role 
in society which is absolutely necessary and which should be 
reinforced 
only 10 percent of spains active work force belongs to a union 
according to labor ministry statistics and the government appears 
confident of public support for its jobs plan 
a government poll recently indicated that 85 percent of those 
surveyed believed the administrations top priority should be 
creating jobs for youths 
an additional 77 percent said they preferred that the government 
create the jobs through incentives to businesses rather than 
directly hand out unemployment pay

the meeting i expect a much better relationship

two countries and acknowledged their two most important bilateral 
problems mexicos foreign debt and drug trafficking from mexico to 
the united states market 
they the united states will work on the problem of 
consumption and mexico will fight trafficking salinas said drug

us officials often charging that mexican officials corruption 
facilitates the drug trade 
in a joint communique the two presidents said they recognized 
that the solidarity and understanding of the united states is 
essential if mexico is to find ways to grow economically

it was the evening of david hibbards last day 
as a peace corps volunteer in a mudhut village in nigeria when his 
overseas radio crackled with the bulletin that john f kennedy had 
been assassinated and hibbards lonely nightmare began 
i felt an overwhelming sense of loss and grief said hibbard 
now a doctor in boulder colo i stayed up all night listening for 
details i wondered irrationally whether he might have lived if id 
stayed in nigeria another year i cried myself to sleep exhausted 
jim hagan of santa cruz calif recalls he was a youngster 
trying to hitchhike out of a blizzard in buffalo ny to attend 
the presidents funeral in washington he never made it but he 
joined the peace corps three years later for a stint in india 
kennedy said hagan embodied the peace corps ideal of helping 
others breaking down barriers and promoting peace instead of 
war 
hibbard and hagan were among 450 former peace corps volunteers or 
their surrogates who saluted kennedys memory during a 24hour vigil 
in the capitol rotunda which ended at midday tuesday the 25th 
anniversary of the presidents murder in dallas 
they joined hundreds of other former volunteers at a memorial 
mass at st matthews roman catholic cathedral where the rev 
theodore hesburgh recalled nov 22 1963 as the day when the 
heartbeat of a nation stood still 
americans across the land stood still for a moment tuesday to 
recall that dark day although members of the kennedy family said 
they hoped the president could be remembered for his life not his 
death 
i think we should think of the high points of his life the 
laughter and the vision said eunice shriver the presidents 
sister who made an earlymorning visit to his grave at arlington 
national cemetery hopefully someday well get excited about his 
birthday kennedy would have been 71 last may 29 
robert kennedys widow ethel appeared shortly after the 
cemetery gates opened at 8 am later in the day evelyn lincoln 
the presidents personal secretary laid three red roses before the 
eternal flame she has visited the site every nov 22 since the 
assassination 
thirty uniformed men of the armys elite green berets laid a 
wreathe formed a semicircle and saluted their former commander in 
chief 
the presidents youngest and only surviving brother sen edward 
m kennedy dmass laid a single white rose at the kennedy 
memorial at runnymede england where king john made a historic 
grant of civil and political liberties in the magna carta 
we think its extremely important to celebrate the life of 
president kennedy rather than the tragedy kennedy told reporters 
were focusing on the birthday and the hope of his life rather 
than dwelling upon his loss 
a private mass was held for the presidents widow jacqueline 
kennedy onassis and her two children john jr and caroline at st 
thomas mores roman catholic church in new york city the former 
first lady made no public appearances 
in dallas no official ceremonies were held but about 2500 
people gathered at dealey plaza to pray silently and observe the 
site where kennedy was killed by an assassins gunfire as he waved 
to crowds from the back of an open limousine 
twenty people clasped hands along the motorcade route a crucifix 
and two bouquets of flowers were left at the approximate spot on elm 
street where the president was struck notes attached to the flowers 
read we still miss you nov 22 and after 25 years we still 
love you john 
schoolteacher jean hill who witnessed kennedys murder a 
quartercentury ago brought her 50 thirdgraders to dealey plaza 
i want my kids to know it does not take violence of any kind to 
bring about change and that they themselves can be instruments of 
change and it can be good she said 
some cable television viewers relived the hours after the 
assassination as the arts amp entertainment channel interrupted its 
regular programming and played nbc news actual coverage of the day 
minutebyminute exactly 25 years later 
it started at around 2 pm just after the bullets were fired and 
ended in the evening with events in washington after president 
lyndon b johnson landed in the presidential plane that also brought 
kennedys body and widow back to andrews air force base outside the 
capital

the reagan administration says last summers 
drought took such a large bite out of the economy that it will add 
about 3 billion to the reductions needed in next years federal 
budget deficit 
joseph r wright director of the white houses office of 
management and budget said in an interview tuesday that the 
administration now believes the fiscal 1990 deficit will have to be 
slashed by about 35 billion to comply with federal law 
he said that in the 1990 budget the administration currently is 
writing about 15 billion in reductions probably would come from 
various benefit programs for the sick farmers federal retirees and 
others who automatically qualify for government help 
he said the rest would come from a combination of reductions in 
other federal spending sales of federal assets and increases in 
user fees 
the 1990 budget year begins next oct 1 
he insisted there would be no new taxes although there have 
been disputes in the past between the democraticcontrolled congress 
and president reagan over whether some of his proposals for new 
revenues should be called tax increases 
wright also said social security would not be cut and that 
defense programs would probably receive a slight increase over the 
inflation rate military spending eats up about 30 percent of this 
years 11 trillion budget 
it is a conservative budget and i think thats what ronald 
reagan should leave as his legacy in his last budget wright said 
he said the spending blueprint so far had no input from 
presidentelect george bush but that the vice president easily 
would be able to adjust it to his own priorities once he takes 
office 
wright said the administration now believes the deficit for 
fiscal 1990 will be 135 billion or 3 billion higher than 
previously forecast the grammrudman deficit reduction law requires 
a shortfall of no more than 100 billion next year with billions in 
acrosstheboard spending cuts the consequence if the target is 
breached 
wright said the budget would achieve the 100 billion target 
he also said reagan had declared that cuts should not be made in 
benefits received directly by the elderly or the poor but the 
budget director said that would leave open the possibility of cuts 
in items such as medicare payments that go to doctors and hospitals 
citing the ongoing budget preparation process in which omb 
officials and agency heads still are making spending and program 
decisions wright said he could provide few details of where all 
the cuts would be made 
but he said that when the spending plan is sent to congress on 
jan 9 it would incorporate many of the program reductions asset 
sales and other proposals that reagan has made in the past 
i dont see any firestorms coming from the hill as a result of 
this budget he said 
in recent years many of reagans budgets have been declared 
dead on arrival by leading lawmakers last years budget process 
went unusually smoothly largely because of an agreement reached 
between congress and the administration last november that solved 
many of the perennial disputes 
just two weeks ago the administration projected the 1990 deficit 
at 132 billion 
but earlier tuesday in its final economic forecast the 
administration said the nations economy would grow by 26 percent 
this year 07 percent less than it would have without the dry hot 
weather that devastated many farmers and food producers 
poorer than expected economic performance adds to the 
governments deficit by reducing its revenues and increasing its 
expenditures 
the government however projected a healthy growth rate for 1989 
of 35 percent it said consumer prices would rise by 37 percent 
next year down from an annual rate of 46 percent through the first 
10 months of 1988 
it also forecast that interest rates would begin to ease and 
that unemployment would average 52 percent it was 53 percent in 
october 
private economists immediately disputed the rosy forecasts 
theyre very optimistic said sandra shaber an economist 
with the futures group in washington 
but beryl sprinkel reagans top economic adviser said the 
critics were being too gloomy 
i do not want to be accused of making the final forecast of the 
reagan presidency too rosy he said

a safety review at delta air lines shows 
improvements in operations and training but lingering concern over 
lapses in crew coordination and discipline in some delta 
cockpits according to the federal aviation administration 
the faa gave the assessment in a document made public tuesday in 
which an faa team outlined its findings during an inspection at 
delta in early october 
the agency team said deltas management has taken strong and 
positive action in response to a critical review of deltas 
operations 14 months ago and that it observed competent 
performances in the majority of deltas cockpits 
but the faa said the team also observed many of the same 
behavior patterns that were previously noted in the l987 audit in 
which the airline was chatized for allowing poor discipline and 
communications among flight crews it said some delta pilots may 
not perceive a problem or may simply not be observant enough 
to correct their shortcomings 
in the recent followup review the faa inspection team again 
observed lapses in crew coordination and discipine in a small but 
significant percentage of cockpits said the agency it said some 
pilots improperly used checklists relied on memory when conducting 
preflight checks and in some cases demonstrated an unstructured 
cockpit management style 
the faa also said delta management pilots should be tougher when 
conducting proficiency checks and too often require pilots to meet 
only minimum standards 
the airline has more than 6500 pilots 
delta spokesman bill berry said the company was in general 
agreement with the report he said the shortcomings cited by the 
faa inspection team will be addressed in new programs soon to go 
into effect 
deltas cockpit operations and its training program came under 
intense faa scrutiny in the summer of l987 after a series of errors 
by delta pilots brought the airline close to having several serious 
accidents including a nearcollision over the atlantic 
pilot performance also has become a focal point in the 
investigation of the crash last august of a delta boeing 727 as it 
attempted to depart the dallasfort worth airport federal 
invetigators are trying to determine whether the threeman crew 
forgot to properly set the wing flaps causing the crash which 
killed 14 of the 108 people aboard 
the faa review made no mention of the crash 
since the string of incidents in l987 deltas management has 
improved its training and operational manuals and instituted other 
training and quality control improvements the faa said 
but it said some of the improvements have yet to go into effect 
a series of changes in the way pilots conduct checklists before 
departure and prior to landing will go into effect next month the 
new procedures are aimed at clarifying the duties of each flight 
crew member and require that each check procedure be acknowleged 
verbally to lessen the possiblity one will be forgotten 
deltas revised cockpit resource management training program 
which has been under development for some time is scheduled to be 
implemented next january the faa said 
the faa said it plans to continue monitoring the airlines 
progress on implementing both programs 
the faas interest in cockpit procedures at the major airlines 
was sharpened last year by the string of delta incidents and by the 
crash in detroit of a northwest airlines jet in which the two pilots 
forgot to set the wing flaps preventing the aircraft from gaining 
proper lift 
the 1987 delta incidents included a plane nearly colliding with 
another jetliner over the north atlantic because the delta pilots 
made a navigational error that took them 60 miles off course a jet 
almost ditching into the pacific after the delta captain mistakenly 
turned off both of its engines and two delta planes in separate 
incidents landing at a wrong airport and on a wrong runway

ranking members of the senate agriculture 
committee are pushing for expansion of a major soil conservation 
program in an effort to improve the nations water quality 
the lawmakers led by panel chairman patrick leahy dvt are 
asking agriculture secretary richard lyng to broaden the focus of 
the conservation reserve program which began in 1986 
to date some 255 million acres of farmland have been taken out 
of production under the program which is bringing participating 
farmers an average of 50 a year for each acre not planted with 
commercial crops 
most of the land falls into the category of highly erodible 
terrain which is stabilized with vegetation to minimize loss of 
topsoil from precipitation and wind 
but leahy richard lugar rind wyche fowler dga and 
christopher bond rmo told lyng in a letter released tuesday that 
they think its time to broaden the program beyond combating soil 
erosion 
they said the eligibility guidelines should be expanded to 
include croplands whose continued intensive use threatens surface 
and groundwater 
with its emphasis almost entirely on highly erodible lands the 
department is missing a crucial opportunity to protect public health 
and the environment the senators wrote 
runoffs of pesticides and fertilizers are becoming an increasing 
problem for both surface water and underground aquifers according 
to kenneth cook of the conservation foundation a washington 
research group 
the senators said that soil conservation also would be served by 
allowing enrollment of land that is not classified as highly 
erodible 
the departments economic research service has estimated that 
targeting water quality could reduce the delivery of 90 million tons 
of sediment to us water annually they said this respresents 
a 20 percent improvement over the existing program 
jack webb chief of the departments land retirement and water 
quality branch said steps are being taken to make more than just 
highly erodible land eligible for the 186 billion a year program 
he said that earlier this year eligiblity was extended to 
socalled filter strips parcels of land abutting waterways 
webb also said officials are preparing to propose rules that 
would make another 10 million or more acres eligible for inclusion 
these proposals are aimed at two areas the mississippi river 
bottom lands from baton rouge la to cairo ill and the 
socalled prairie pothole region of the northern great plains 
according to webb

republican governors folding the tent 
on their national conference are giving up jellybeans for fried 
pork rinds 
as alabama gov guy hunt sees it the jellybeans favored by 
president reagan are now giving way to the new symbol of the new 
administration crisply fried hog skins which presidentelect 
george bush claims as a favorite snack 
i guess it means we skin the hogs hunt quipped tuesday as he 
passed out packages of the fried rinds to members of the national 
republican governors conference as it closed its fourday meeting at 
the grand hotel resort 
the light moment came after bush spoke to the gop governors 
saying republicans are on our way to becoming the majority party 
in america if we dont lose sight of what is driving our success 
were off and running on a very positive note with this 
administration as republican governors said kansas gov mike 
hayden the new chairman of the conference which heard from bush 
and several members of his new white house team 
delaware gov michael n castle outgoing chairman of the 
conference said the sessions made clear there has been a 
fundamental change in the way the country is looking at its 
governing and its policies 
you begin to realize it is very much the republican party that 
is in the mainstream said castle 
its a changing scene said hunt host of the conference at 
the coastal resort 
were not the party of big business said the alabama 
governor a primitive baptist minister i was born on a farm 
hunt said before the conference that about 200000 was raised 
from private sources to put the meeting together at the resort 
hosts for the meeting included several major oil companies with 
interests in offshore tracts near the alabama coast along with 
waste management inc and other corporations 
hunt however emphasized the gops ties to grassroots voters 
and bush in his speech said hunt is a man who has never 
forgotten his roots 
bush said hunts religious faith and political courage were 
emblematic of the modern gop 
he still preaches on sunday at his home church in holly pond i 
believe is the name of it said bush two years ago guy had 
the courage to step up into the fray or what teddy roosevelt called 
the arena against what were considered enormous odds and he 
showed those pollsters wrong and what an oustanding job hes doing 
for alabama 
hunt who got help from a fractured democratic party when he rose 
from alsoran to winner in 1986 was cited often at the conference 
as an example of a new republican south 
republicans suffered a net loss of one governorship in the 
november election dropping from 23 to 22 but gop leaders said it 
was actually a strong showing with more significant losses often 
expected for a party already in power in the white house 
hayden said bushs speech indicated the new president will be 
very close to the reagan administration on economic policy 
but he said bush demonstrated again that hes his own man 
iowa gov terry branstad said the gop conference at point clear 
was the first such meeting ever held in the heart of dixie 
branstad who will become chairman of the national governors 
conference next year said he looks forward to that groups meeting 
at nearby mobile in 1990 
this humble country preacher really knows how to put on a great 
conference he said of hunt

a growing japanese appetite for hotdogs is 
stirring up competition between the united states and several other 
countries including australia and mexico 
total sausage sales in japan made up mostly of frankfurters and 
weiners have grown 26 percent in the last three years an 
agriculture department report said tuesday imports have more than 
doubled 
shipments by us processors in 1987 totaled 699 metric tons

denmark 6 percent netherlands 5 percent west germany 5 percent 
and others 10 percent 
annual per capita consumption of sausage rose from 376 pounds 
in 1983 to 483 pounds in 1987 fueled by a mushrooming demand for 
westernstyle meats and menus said the report in foreign 
agriculture magazine 
sausage as a main breakfast item is less common in japan than in

the soviet union has bought 500000 metric tons 
of us grain sorghum for delivery in the marketing year that began 
on sept 1 says the agriculture department 
a spokeswoman vivian ramey said tuesday it was the first time 
that the soviets have purchased us sorghum traditionally corn 
and wheat are the chief grains for import along with soybeans and 
soybean meal 
for example more than 59 million tons of us corn have been 
sold to the soviet union for delivery in 198889 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or sorghum grain or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 
500000 tons of sorghum would be about 197 million bushels or about 
11 million hundredweight 
sorghum prices last month averaged around 421 per 100 pounds or 
236 per bushel according to usda reports thus the sale could 
have a us farm value of about 46 million

a 109 percent drop in the october federal 
deficit over last year is offering little comfort to financial 
markets and economists who expect only minimal improvement in the 
budget gap this year 
the treasury department said federal spending exceeded revenue by 
274 billion last month the first month of the 1989 fiscal year 
down from 308 billion in the corresponding month a year ago 
however the 34 billion improvement was more than accounted for 
by several special factors farm subsidy payments were down 23 
billion thanks to higher commodity prices triggered by the summer 
drought 
and military pay fell 26 billion because a year ago the 
government shifted a pay period from 1987 to 1988 the accounting 
trick made the 1987 deficit abnormally low and the 1988 budget gap 
worse than otherwise 
the reagan administration is projecting the budget deficit in 
fiscal 1989 will shrink to 1455 billion down from 1551 billion 
in the year ended sept 30 the congressional budget office 
forecasts 148 billion in red ink 
but most private economists are projecting a 1989 deficit little 
improved and perhaps worse than 1988 in fact fears in the markets 
concerning presidentelect george bushs ability to curb the deficit 
without breaking his notax pledge have driven the value of the 
dollar down since his election 
foreign investors who are financing a significant portion of 
the seemingly endless budget deficit are concerned about the 
prospects for reduction in the bush administration said david 
jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york 
he cited several factors including the cleanup of the 
governments nuclear plants and the rescue of the savings and loan 
industry that will demand new and higher government expenditures 
in october the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
backs sampl deposits up to 100000 spent 1 billion compared with 
98 million a year ago 
also the administrations economic forecast underlying its 
budget projection higher growth and lower interest rates 
conflicts with the more pessimistic view of most private analysts 
beryl sprinkel president reagans chief economic adviser said 
tuesday that the economy as measured by the gross national product 
will grow 35 percent private economists however expect growth of 
only 2 to 25 percent consequently they believe the government 
will collect less tax revenue they also project higher interest 
rates than the government making it more costly to finance the 26 
trillion national debt 
we may have a few months that look better than last year but i 
dont think that can last said bruce steinberg an economist with 
merrill lynch i suspect well see a deficit similar to last 
years 150 billion to 160 billion is quite likely 
government revenue in october totaled 636 billion up 21 
percent from the same month a year ago spending totaled 911 
billion down 22 percent 
the largest spending categories in october were the military 
followed by social security interest on the national debt and 
programs in the department of health and human services other than 
social security 
military spending totaled 252 billion last month down 03 
percent from the same month a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 175 billion last month up 
54 percent the other programs in the department of health and 
human services including medicare and medicaid cost 117 billion 
in october a 168 percent decline over fiscal 1988 
interest on the national debt totaled 152 billion last month 
an increase of 74 percent

up to 15 students from each of 30 us 
secondary schools will be spending their spring break in soviet 
classrooms theyll be part of the first nationwide program allowing 
students from each country to study in the others schools 
by then the russian students who travel to america from sister 
schools in the soviet union during their january holiday will have 
returned home from the first phase of the usussr high school 
academic partnership program announced tuesday by an education 
consortium 
were really excited because in about 90 days we will be going 
to live with soviet families and attend soviet schools said lisa 
cooper a senior and student in fourthyear russian at 
bethesdachevy chase high school in maryland 
this program has the potential to be a very big step in 
ussoviet relations the 17yearold cooper told reporters at a 
studentrun press conference tuesday 
what makes this program so important is that when you talk 
about international relations youre talking about more than just 
governments youre talking about people said cooper one of close 
to 450 american students who will go to the soviet union in march 
anthony mustillo 17 also a fourthyear russian language student 
at technical high school in staten island ny said he believes 
the program will change many preconceived notions american and 
soviet students have of each other 
kids are kids everywhere and politics are not their first 
priority said mustillo who will be making his second visit to 
the soviet union through the partnership program 
the program an outgrowth of agreements signed by president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev during the moscow 
summit last may will involve public and private schools from 19 
states and will be administered by a consortium consisting of the 
american council of teachers of russian the national association of 
secondary school principals and sister cities international 
schools were selected for participation in the program in a 
national competition on the basis of overall academic excellence 
availability of advance russian language instruction prospects for 
developing local funding and commitment to international studies 
sister city relationships were also a consideration said the 
sponsors in a statement 
the biggest challenge for american participation in the second 
and third years of the program will be the need to find schools 
with russian language programs said nancy powell principal of 
bethesdachevy chase 
powell said she hoped the program will lead to a real sharing 
of curriculum and teachers between the two superpowers 
the program has received initial financing of 1 million for 
three years from the united states information agency grants from 
the sponsoring organizations as well as school and community 
fundraisers will provide additional funding for american students 
said project director dan davidson 
the soviet unions committee for public education will pay all 
expenses for the russian students 
research on students attitudes and language ability will be done 
before and after their travel said davidson 
vladmir lukashin head of the soviet committees department for 
cooperation with capitalist countries said through an interpreter 
i think this program is a result of perestroika and glasnost 
the reform policies being developed under gorbachevs leadership 
i think that there will be such programs with all the countries 
of the world lukashin added 
project officials stressed that they are still looking for 
schools to participate in the second and third years of the program 
the deadline for applying is january 10 1989 schools can contact 
the program office by mail at 1619 massachusetts ave nw 
washington dc 20036 or by phone at 2023287309

president corazon aquino said today 
that the tasaday are a legitimate stone age tribe and that those 
seeking to discredit them as impostors are simply out to rob them of 
their ancestral lands 
it was the first time mrs aquino commented publicly on the 
tasaday who have become involved in international controversy since 
the government said they were discovered in 1971 in the jungles of 
mindanao island 
thenpresident ferdinand marcos declared the tasaday who 
numbered in the dozens an indigenous tribe and set aside 
timberrich lands for them in mindanao 
but some philippine scholars have branded the tasaday a hoax that 
marcos perpetrated to gain international publicity for the 
philippines 
defenders of the tasaday say skeptics simply want access to rich 
timber lands or to discredit marcos but mrs aquino told an 
international conference of tribal minorities that the tasaday 
controversy underscores the need to protect primitive cultures from 
exploitation 
for apparently materialistic motives and to open the groups 
rich agricultural and timber ancestral lands for exploitation 
some scholars with media support denounced the existence of the 
tribe as a hoax she said 
the president said the tasaday controversy was a concrete 
illustration of how an ethnic tribes identity was all but lost in 
the crosscurrents of media hype and scholarly posturing 
scholars who defend the tasaday say they are descendants of 
manubospeaking tribesmen who fled their coastal village more than 
700 years ago to escape pirates 
they fled into isolated jungle caves and over the centuries 
reverted back to a stone age culture supporters say others believe 
the tasaday remained in isolation because they feared diseases such 
as smallpox which were rampant in coastal areas 
on nov 3 a congressional committee said a oneyear study 
substantiated the tasadays claim the 21page report said there was 
no credible evidence to substantiate claims by several professors at

three supreme court justices got a firsthand 
look at what televised coverage of the high court would be like but 
it may be quite a while before the public gets the same opportunity 
timothy b dyk a lawyer representing 12 news organizations 
provided a 25minute demonstration monday on how cameras in the 
courts ornate chamber would function 
the idea was to prove coverage would not be disruptive 
on hand and on the bench for the private demonstration were chief 
justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r white and anthony 
m kennedy dressed in business attire without their ceremonial 
robes 
dyk declined to say how the justices reacted to the trial run 
but he added i dont know if there is a change in the courts 
longstanding opposition to televised coverage of its argument 
sessions 
a court source who requested anonymity said im not sure how 
much significance can be read into this there is still a great deal 
of concern over the impact of televising court proceedings 
the news organizations who asked for permission to give the court 
a sample of televised coverage invited all nine justices the 
demonstration was not publicized although word that it took place 
leaked out 
dyk said the justices asked questions about the use of cameras 
and a portion of the taped session was played back for them 
one stationary camera was placed in front of the podium where 
attorneys stand to address the court a second camera operated by a 
cameraman was placed on a tripod in an alcove of the chamber and was 
focused on the bench to record the comments of the justices 
there were no additional lights or microphones other than those 
normally in use 
some justices have expressed concern over possible grandstanding 
by lawyers and members of the court if cameras are allowed they 
also have said snippets of film footage shown to the public would 
distort the nature of the hourlong argument sessions in cases heard 
by the court 
rehnquist told a judicial conference earlier this year i hope 
we dont get to the time where the members of our court are trying 
to get on the six oclock news every night and i think if they did 
it would lessen to a certain extent some of the courts mystique 
and moral authority 
there also reportedly are fears by the justices they would not be 
particularly telegenic sources said those concerns were heightened 
by television coverage of the 1987 senate hearings on the nomination 
of robert h bork to the court 
bork was defeated by the senate in a bitter political battle and 
some commentators said he came across on television as too aloof and 
scholarly 
while nearly all states allow some televised state court 
coverage the federal courts have remained adamant in banning 
cameras from their proceedings

american voters the polls said werent too 
happy with the presidential choice between george bush and michael 
dukakis turnout plunged to its lowest point in years in this 
months balloting 
does this mean the time has come for a third party for a new 
political force to replace the faltering machinery of one of the 
major parties 
thirdparty presidential hopefuls led by ron paul of the 
libertarian party and lenora fulani from the new alliance party made 
the case for major political change throughout the campaign 
but the voters didnt much care for the choices that paul fulani 
and more than a dozen other minor party candidates offered on nov 8 
either a sign that prospects remain dim for a major new party to 
emerge in this country 
bush won about 481 million votes in defeating dukakis who 
received about 411 million votes that means only about half of the 
adults in this country bothered to vote 
but those numbers do add up to 991 percent of all the votes cast 
in the presidential race 
paul the former republican congressman from texas got about 
410000 votes across the country that figures out to only about 
045 percent of the more than 90 million votes cast 
fulani was second among the secondrank candidates drawing about 
200000 votes for about 022 percent of the vote her share of the 
vote will probably rise slightly when final official numbers come 
in from her hometown new york city 
then came such figures as former ku klux klan leader david duke 
who got about 44000 votes running under such labels as populist 
onetime democratic candidate eugene mccarthy received about 30000 
votes in several states as the consumer party nominee extremist 
lyndon larouche whose trial on various charges began this week got 
23000 votes 
then there was prohibition party candidate earl f dodge with 
almost 8000 votes 
taken all together this was a bit better than their showing in 
1984 when thirdparty candidates got about 07 percent of the vote 
in the race featuring president reagan and former vice president 
walter mondale 
pauls showing was better than the 1984 tallies for libertarian 
david bergland who he received about a quarter of one percent of 
the total 
but that is just trying to put the best light on bad returns 
none of these candidates came even close to the showing of george 
wallace in 1968 or john anderson in 1980 
the voters faced by a choice they werent happy with did not 
cast their ballots for any of the 18 or so minor party candidates 
whose names were listed in this state or that 
the other signs for third parties also are not too good 
even richard viguerie the directmail guru admits his 
oftvoiced hopes for a conservative third party just arent 
realistic 
what well do is go out there and put together a third force 
he said this week as he expressed displeasure with bush and what is 
becoming a mostly moderate administrationtobe 
does this mean a third party 
oh no no no no just a third force the left operates in the 
thirdforce arena with labor unions with civil rights 
organizations with their own agenda separate and apart from the 
democrats thats what i think conservatives should be doing 
minor parties havent become major parties in this country for 
more than 100 years and the reasons are many 
most americans still grow up with some kind of partisan identity 
as democrats or republicans even though independent is now a label 
many display even as they back the major parties candidates with 
remarkable consistency 
the nations election laws written largely by major party 
legislators make that which is easy for majorparty candidates 
getting on the ballot for example very hard for thirdparty 
candidates witness that only fulani was able to get on the ballot 
in all 50 states for nov 8 as a thirdparty hopeful 
raising money for third parties is tough while the major party 
candidates can even tap the federal treasury for presidential 
elections 
for all their problems the democratic and republican parties 
remain the only serious choices available in most elections and 
probably will be so for years to come 
even when faced with a clear chance to just vote no the 
voters declined to pull that lever none of these candidates got 
only about 2 percent of the vote in nevada when running against bush 
and dukakis this year

a presentation of shakespeares political tragedy 
coriolanus so soon after election day may seem apt but the new 
york shakespeare festival production evokes the world of rock stars 
more than that of presidential candidates 
christopher walken in the title role is known primarily from 
films but has acted other classical roles at the offbroadway public 
theater where coriolanus opened tuesday night 
he makes the part funnier than one might expect and the play less 
tragic coriolanus is the equivalent of a roman fivestar general 
he comes back victorious and is expected to put on a cloak of 
poverty and display wounds after which the people will acclaim him 
a consul he thinks thats dishonest he is what he is a successful 
soldier not given to pretending poverty or anything else to seek 
favor 
his two enemies say hes proud he acts humble the necktieless 
walken shows humility in a perfect imitation of some top rock stars 
selfdeprecating humor ask phil collins if hes special and hed 
probably reply hes an ordinary bloke the beatles used to deflect 
adulation with wit 
what walken doesnt do is address whether underneath coriolanus 
is proud or not his characterization is understandable in 
contemporary terms and rock stars are often more interesting than 
politicos but its more simple than the play and therefore doesnt 
allow his eventual destruction to fulfill the title the tragedy 
of coriolanus 
irene worth plays the silvertongued dominating mother who has 
instilled warlike qualities in her son and glories in them however 
she cant bring him up to her equal in brains or cunning she calls 
herself junolike in the play and miss worth certainly lives up to 
the largerthanlife passions of that goddess 
broadway veteran paul hecht displays a statesmanlike demeanor and 
authoritative voice as menenius who is procoriolanus keith david 
is stalwart while knowing he is jealous of coriolanus popularity 
as aufidius general opposing coriolanus in war 
moses gunn and thomas kopache speak well and appropriately as 
roman generals 
the two tribunes who inflame the people against coriolanus are 
more onedimensionally selfinterested than sometimes played 
sharpfeatured larry bryggman cast as a villain on tv and andre 
braugher were directed by steven berkoff to walk in lockstep and 
dress like mafia henchmen they could be played to show some concern 
for the people or the state 
battles are choreographed motions without prop swords since the 
same actors make up both armies a battle scene takes place with 
whichever army is on stage individuals fighting unseen 
opponents 
some speeches are cut mostly by peripheral people coriolanus 
son doesnt appear the scene in which a roman tells one of 
aufidius men that coriolanus is banished from rome is gone but the 
play isnt damaged by making his arrival before aufidius a surprise 
coriolanus in the public theaters anspacher theater is the 
sixth in the festivals shakespeare marathon which will present 
all 36 plays its the first obscure one but thus far among the 
more successful presentations

a diver seeking clues to the fate of db 
cooper the legendary hijacker who disappeared 17 years ago says he 
found a small parachute in the columbia river about a mile upstream 
from where 5800 of coopers ransom washed up in 1980 
the diver 33yearold curtis rainey of portland ore was 
working for richard tosaw a lawyer from ceres calif who has 
spent each thanksgiving season for seven years searching for 
coopers remains 
the nylon pilot parachute used for deploying the main canopy 
of a parachute such as the one cooper had was found monday about 5 
miles west of vancouver on the washington side of the river rainey 
and tosaw said 
cooper parachuted out of a northwest air lines 727 with 200000 
in ransom money on thanksgiving eve 1971 except for the 
waterlogged bills that washed up on the banks of the columbia nine 
years later no trace of him has ever turned up 
tosaw admitted there could be many explanations for the 
discovery but he noted it was the most interesting piece of 
evidence hes found since he made the cooper search his hobby 
the interesting thing is it was found in a place where he 
pretty much has to be give or take a mile or so tosaw said 
rainey planned to take the parachute on thanksgiving to 
woodinville to be examined by earl cossey who packed coopers 
parachute 
however cossey said late tuesday that he had been given a 
description of the pilot chute by telephone and it sounded like it 
was from an earlier design than the one cooper used 
there are probably a million of those in the world cossey 
said while the main parachute would be identifiable by stitching or 
possibly a registration number the pilot chute would bear no 
identifying marks he said 
the fbi said tosaw hadnt informed the agency of the discovery 
we would be able to identify these parachutes but the process 
would be part of our investigation and therefore something we 
wouldnt comment on said john eyer of the seattle fbi office 
tosaw who has written a book titled db cooper dead or 
alive said he has decided cooper drowned and his remains became 
hung up on one of the rows of pilings that extend into the river 
about every halfmile to prevent erosion 
the parachute was found snagged among such pilings about a mile 
upstream from the beach where 8yearold brian ingram found 5800 
of coopers loot in 1980 tosaw said 
rainey who along with diving partner jamie winkle of portland 
has worked for tosaw on the cooper search for three years found the 
parachute mostly intact and barely sticking out of the sand under 
about 20 feet of water the divers said 
cooper got his ransom and parachutes during a seattle stopover 
after hijacking a flight by displaying what appeared to be dynamite

emperor hirohito bedridden since sept 19 with 
severe internal bleeding no longer initiates conversations and 
sleeps most of the time a palace official said today 
japanese news media said the 87yearold monarchs condition is 
declining but palace officials said that although hirohito is 
feeble he is in stable condition one official said on condition of 
anonymity that the emperor nods in response to questions from his 
aides 
hirohitos blood pressure was relatively low but palace doctors 
did not anticipate any major changes in his condition said kenji 
maeda spokesman for the imperial household agency which handles 
all palace affairs 
the emperors condition was judged stable enough for his 
grandson prince aya to return today to england where he is 
studying at oxford university aya was summoned back to japan on 
nov 7 after a sudden deterioration in hirohitos condition 
the worlds longestreigning monarch has not discharged any blood 
for more than two weeks but his doctors are concerned about the 
danger of another massive hemorrhage maeda said in a regular 
briefing 
the bleeding is believed to be coming from the upper intestine 
near an intestinal bypass operation performed in september 1987 
hirohito has eaten just a few spoonfuls of porridge since falling 
ill and is fed intravenously his weight has fallen from 106 to 66 
pounds 
the emperor has received a 424 pints of blood in transfusions in 
over the past two months to combat anemia and jaundice court 
doctors said 
palace officials say court doctors are unsure whether hirohito 
actually watches his favorite weekday drama when the television set 
is turned on for him a major newspaper the mainichi shimbun 
quoted unidentified palace sources today as saying that the emperor 
can no longer distinguish between night and day 
palace officials have refused to comment on news reports that the 
emperor has pancreatic cancer

federal officials are setting up a 
communitybased research network that would encourage more 
physicians and patients to participate in and learn from 
experimental aids treatments 
the program announced tuesday by dr anthony s fauci aids 
coordinator for the national institutes of health is designed to 
complement more than 30 fullfledged nih controlled clinical 
studies already under way at major research centers around the 
nation 
the effort is calculated in part to offer hope to aids patients 
and their doctors who are not part of such classic experiments 
grants to be distributed by the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases headed by fauci will go primarily to linking 
via computers the health professions willing to participate in the 
grassroots program 
these new programs will broaden the base of our clinical 
investigations by including primary care physicians who are not 
affiliated with aids research efforts that are currently supported 
by niaid said fauci 
we are pleased to create a way to draw on the enthusiasm and 
experience of community physicians and their patients who wish to 
have greater involvement in the national research effort on aids 
he said in announcing the program at a conference of the private 
national foundation for infectious diseases 
through these programs we also hope to include in clinical 
trials more hivinfected black and hispanic persons and intravenous 
drug users and more women at risk of hiv infection 
in its final report last summer the white house aids commission 
called for greater attention to communitybased initiatives against 
aids and more federal effort to coordinate those efforts 
the commission also noted that hiv infection the virus that 
causes aids is now spreading most rapidly among intravenous drug 
users who share contaminated needs and called for spending 15 
billion over the next decade to tackle the drug problem 
fauci said the community programs will operated separately but be 
coordinated with the treatment evaluation network already in place 
by his institute to keep tabs on more sophisticated research 
dr lawrence r deyton one of the founders of the whitmanwalker 
clinic in washington a major community treatment and testing 
center is the nih official designated to head the expanded 
community network 
the focus of this program is the community practitioner working 
in the area where his or her patients said deyton it can help 
improve the quality of their health care and at the same time 
increase the knowledge gained through treatment research 
an nih background paper said the relative lack of proven 
medical interventions for hiv infection and the many men and women 
willing in fact desperate to participate in clinical trials has 
created an environment in which potential therapies are administered 
in the face of meager or even no evidence 
enrolling in a research study offers each participant a 
personal measure of hope the paper continued extensive and 
well organized networks of information on current research studies 
commonly accepted therapies and alternative therapies have become 
integral in the lives of many hiv infections persons as well as the 
physicians and nurses caring for them 
recognizing that many treatment centers unaccustomed to applying 
for federal grants may want to participate announcements being 
prepared by nih invite those who need help in making formal 
applications to request such assistance in their initial contact 
with deytons office

noah the boa is a free snake again 
after nearly four days of captivity in the dashboard of a car 
belonging to one of his redfaced handlers 
judy booth of the jl johnson nature center said she drove the 
6pound 5footlong boa constrictor to a preschool for a friday 
morning presentation 
i put him back in the car and went to lunch for about an 
hour booth said that was a big mistake 
noah probably spooked by unfamiliar surroundings slithered out 
of his pillowcase carrier and under the dashboard she said 
after failing to lure the serpent out with morsels of his 
favorite foods she was forced to spend the weekend keeping noah 
warm with a heat lamp 
booth took the car to a auto dealership monday where rick 
hetchler and another mechanic freed the snake as about two dozen 
people watched 
i dont see any puncture wounds booth said after inspecting 
noah i think hes ok 
it was no big deal hetchler said its just a snake the 
fun part will be putting the dashboard back together

well before the dramatic escalation of art prices it was valued at 
an estimated 30 million their home has been assessed at 33 
million but is worth much more than that on the market

a federal advisory panel is calling for a 
longterm study of the safety of silicone breast implants but says 
there is not enough evidence of health risk now to ban the procedure 
an estimated 2 million us women have received implants over the 
past two decades even though the food and drug administration has 
never fully reviewed how safe they are 
a sevenmember panel of outside experts convened by the agency 
concluded tuesday that the fda should work with physicians patients 
and silicone implant manufacturers to design a series of studies 
that will fully address the question over the next few years 
meanwhile the committee agreed unanimously that there is no 
reason to call for a ban on new implants unless new and substantial 
evidence of harm surfaces before the group meets again in two months 
dr john h davis chairman of surgery at the university of 
vermont medical school told fellow panelists he had never done a 
breast implant but could speak as a husband and father of three 
daughters 
he said the procedure has been a great boon to women and that 
since no comparable substitute is available i dont believe i can 
throw it out the window and say no 
about 15 percent of breast implants are done for women who have 
lost part or all of their breasts to cancer surgery and davis said 
denying them access to reconstructive surgery might influence some 
to accept the wrong kind of threatment or retreat from seeking 
early treatment at all 
he acknowledged that it will take a long time perhaps decades 
to definitely determine the safety of breast implants 
we will not answer this question for the women in this room 
unfortunately but we can answer it for your children said davis 
dr geneviene m matanoski an epidemologist at johns hopkins 
agreed with davis assessment of the difficulties in compiling 
definitive data over a period of years 
certainly the answer is not to panic 2 million women she 
said in concurring with the panels unanimous recommendation against 
calling for a ban 
dr sidney wolfe of public citizen health research group has 
called for a ban based largely on recent studies that showed 
silicone implants caused certain types of cancer in rats 
however there are substantial questions about whether human 
tissue reacts the same way as rat tissue when confronted with 
foreign tissue particularly in developing the type of tumors caused 
in the rats 
dr john e martin appearing on behalf of the american college 
of radiology told the panel that of the thousands of women who have 
sought treatment for breast cancer at the md anderson cancer 
center in texas over the past 40 years only 35 had the type of 
tumor the rat studies suggested might occur in humans subjected to 
silicone transplants 
martin said no such breast cancers had been seen at md anderson 
in the past 10 years and decried what he called unfortunate 
publicity associated with this scare 
he compared the recent concern by women about breast implants 
with earlier questions about whether the radiation associated with a 
breast xray argued against using the procedure as a screening 
device by the time those questions had been resolved in the 
negative he said the emotional damage to women had already been 
done 
the advisory committee called for 
establishment of a national registry of women who have breast 
implants so longrange studies can be carried out to determine 
whether there is a heightened risk of breast cancer or other health 
problems 
drafting of a mandatory standardized consent form to be signed 
by any prospective patient for a breast implant before the procedure 
can be done 
an fda policy to keep physicians and the public aware of any new 
information as it develops from whatever longrange studies are 
devised 
since silicone breast implants were already on the market in 1976 
when congress gave the fda authority over medical devices they were 
given grandfather approval under the law 
now the fda has invoked essentially the same procedure that would 
be used to establish the safety of a new product but has no 
standing to remove breast implants from the market in the absence of 
clear evidence that they are a definite health risk 
the significance of the advisory panels conclusion was that it 
saw no evidence of such a clear risk

a hospitals antismoking policy has gone up 
in smoke because it sent so many patients doctors and nurses 
outside to light up 
trinity memorial hospital was among the milwaukee area hospitals 
that became smokefree as of july 4 with smoking either banned or 
severely restricted 
the edict at trinity memorial meant smokers had no alternative 
but to go outside and they persisted in doing so said james 
streed a hospital spokesman 
the resulting problems he said included 
patients began congregating outdoors in their hospital gowns 
even though many of them had to drag their intravenous equipment 
with them 
nurses sometimes had to accompany the patients which took 
personnel away from work stations 
some nurses physicians and other employees also went outdoors 
to smoke and while outside were unable to hear the paging system 
after four months it was decided that for the sake of patient 
safety smokers would be brought back indoors under a relaxed 
policy streed said this week 
smoking now is allowed in designated areas of the coffee shop and 
employee cafeteria he said 
although ventilation in the two designated smoking areas has been 
improved to keep smoke out of nonsmoking areas the new policy has 
rekindled some of the past debate over the issue 
it gets to be a bit like legislating morality streed said 
the smokers feel its about time that theyre accommodated more 
humanely 
on the other hand he said the nonsmokers felt that it was 
hypocritical for a hospital to allow people to pursue an unhealthy 
habit on its premises 
people are people and theyre all different streed said 
to deal with stress some people do unhealthy things 
were not doing anything to encourage smoking he said we 
dont sell tobacco

claiming a clear national mandate for the free 
trade agreement with the united states prime minister brian 
mulroney said he will proceed to quick enactment 
he announced tuesday the day after leading his progressive 
conservative party to its second consecutive majority government 
that parliament will be called back into session the week of dec 12 
the us congress has passed legislation needed for the trade 
pact to start taking effect jan 1 as scheduled but it still needs 
final canadian parliamentary approval 
the canadian people have given us a clear mandate to implement 
the free trade agreement we intend to do so the prime minister 
said at a nationally televised news conference from his hometown of 
baiecomeau quebec 
his party won 170 seats in the 295member house of commons in a 
campaign completely dominated by the free trade issue and marked by 
intense opposition from liberal party leader john turner 
the liberals won 82 seats and the socialist new democratic party 
which also opposed the agreement will have 43 seats in the new 
house 
president reagan who signed the agreement with mulroney on jan 
2 congratulated the prime minister in a telephone call tuesday from 
his ranch in santa barbara calif 
in recent years relations between the united states and canada 
have been marked by cooperative dialogue and a remarkable record of 
mutually beneficial achievement he said in a statement released 
by the white house 
mulroney also said he spoke with presidentelect george bush and 
was willing to meet with him before the us inauguration 
the canadian dollar jumped in value against the us dollar to 
more than 83 cents on the strength of the conservative victory it 
had slipped as low as below 81 cents during the campaign 
the trade pact phases out all remaining tariffs between the two 
countries already each others largest trading partners over a 
10year period it also dismantles many investment barriers frees 
up trade in energy and services and creates canadianus panels to 
settle disputes 
during the campaign turner and other opponents of the agreement 
charged that it endangers not just canadas extensive social and 
health care programs but national sovereignty itself 
they said canadas 26 million people will be overwhelmed by the 
245 million people and vastly superior economic power of the united 
states 
mulroney and the supporters said instead that future canadian 
prosperity is assured by guaranteeing access to the larger us 
market they insisted that canada is mature and fully able to 
compete in a north american marketplace without the system of high 
tariffs dating back to the last century 
the support was solid for the free trade agreement in mulroneys 
native quebec the frenchspeaking province where entrepreneurship 
is credited for a 1980s economic revival and in the western 
oilandgas center of alberta 
and the opposition was not solid enough in englishspeaking 
ontario canadas largest province where the liberals were counting 
on a strong showing to keep mulroney from a majority 
we have received considerable support in all regions 
mulroney said tuesday we have received very heavy support in 
quebec and ontario and in the west i think we have the right to say 
we have a national mandate 
about 75 percent of canadas 175 million voters took part in the 
election the conservatives got 43 percent of the popular vote the 
liberals 32 and the new democrats 20 percent

a landmark agreement under which the us 
government will conduct a 50 million cleanup of a 
uraniumenrichment plant could become a model for dealing with other 
toxic waste sites officials said 
the agreement covering the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant 
near piketon in southern ohio was significant because the us 
department of energy would be bound by state law and regulation 
said gov richard celeste 
the department of energy is now voluntarily without court 
action declaring itself in effect free from sovereign immunity 
celeste told a news conference tuesday theyre acknowledging that 
they must be accountable under the environmental laws of the state 
of ohio 
its a good arrangement and i would hope that it could become 
a model for other tough cases that were wrestling with like that 
at fernald celeste said 
the federally owned fernald plant near cincinnati has dumped 
radioactive waste improperly possibly contaminating ground water 
since it began processing uranium for nuclear weapons in 1951 
according to environmental officials 
the piketon plant which processes uranium for fuel for nuclear 
power reactors generates toxic wastes such as polychlorinated 
byphenyls or pcbs solvents and metals as well as radioactive 
materials 
the settlement provides for the energy department to be subject 
to newly issued orders from the ohio environmental protection agency 
requiring a comprehensive cleanup of the site under state 
supervision 
details of the pact still must be incorporated into a federal 
court consent decree 
its a very large step forward and a significant shift in their 
own policies and their own attitudes said state attorney general 
anthony j celebrezze jr 
increasing congressional and public scrutiny of the nuclear waste 
problem helped change the energy departments stance he added 
anytime somebody that has a say over your budget starts putting 
heat on you people tend to react he said the other thing i 
think that was a factor is that very simply the department of energy 
was perceiving that it had truly an image problem with the sort of 
arrogant attitude that they were taking 
the energy department has disclosed problems at some of its 
nuclear production plants and has wholly or partly closed down four 
of its 17 major plants officials have estimated cleanup will cost 
110 billion 
celebrezze said the agreement didnt address the question of 
fines for pollution violations but talks are continuing between 
state and federal officials 
were negotiating and any time we start talking about 
penalties and fines you get to very sensitive parts of the 
negotiations celebrezze said i just dont even want to 
speculate on that 
piketon site manager gene gillespie said the department of energy 
had agreed to clean up roughly 6 million pounds of wastes after a 
final negotiating session nov 7 
theres a lot of things involved were cleaning up waste that 
had been generated over the past 30 years a lot of things that were 
accepted practices in the past that arent any more gillespie 
said 
the cleanup may cost more than 50 million during the next five 
years he said the departments fiscal 1989 budget sets aside 10 
million for the first phase 
robert e anderson environmental coordinator for martin marietta 
energy systems the contractor that operates piketon said some 
cleanup was started in 1987 and continued this year during 
negotiations 
he said the toxic solvent levels in ground water at the site are 
tens to hundreds of times the acceptable levels for drinking 
water 
bedrock separates the ground water at the site from the teays 
valley aquifer that provides drinking water for the area he said 
adding that it would take 10 to 15 years for contaminated water to 
leave the site

israeli journalists say government orders 
restricting news coverage of the plo and the palestinian uprising 
make israel look like arab nations whose news coverage is completely 
under government control 
there is a political consensus to stop information from coming 
out elisha shpiegelman head of the jerusalem journalists 
association told about 300 people at a rally tuesday other 
meetings were held in tel aviv and haifa 
the protests followed a government order to restrict coverage of 
the palestine national council meeting in algiers last week during 
which a palestinian state was proclaimed 
the order banned coverage of speeches at the council session and 
affected israels staterun television and radio the council acts 
as legislature for the palestine liberation organization 
syria egypt and jordan did not broadcast the conference are 
we democracies like they are said gabi brun a union leader at 
the newspaper yediot ahronot newspaper 
israel broadcast authority officials said they acted at the 
request of defense minister yitzhak rabin who feared televised 
excerpts of the council session would fuel the yearlong palestinian 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
its not a form of censorship its a form of exercising our 
editorial function said ari avneri an aide to broadcast 
authority chief uri porat 
tv correspondent moshe raz said broadcast journalists must refer 
to the occupied lands by their biblical names a practice that 
implies israel has an ancient right to the areas which it seized in 
the 1967 middle east war 
one day they decided that there was no west bank and gaza 
strip only judea samaria and the gaza district raz said 
he said television news is required to call plo members 
terrorists whether or not they belonged to a military wing of 
the plo 
shpiegelman said journalists who violate the unwritten guidelines 
or complain are asked to resign

a judge ordered an auction house to pay a woman 
200000 for failing to recognize a pair of paintings as possible 
masterworks and then selling them for just onetenth of their worth 
high court judge simon brown on tuesday ordered messenger may 
baverstock to pay damages to penelope luxmooremay for botching the 
1985 auction of two paintings that were in the style of 18th century 
master george stubbs 
the paintings renderings of foxhounds were sold by the auction 
house for 1500 
they were purchased by an art dealer who subsequently sold them 
through the sothebys auction house as the work of stubbs for 
162000 they were subsequently sold again for an undisclosed price 
to american multimillionaire paul mellon 
brown ruled that it wasnt necessary for the court to determine 
whether the paintings were in fact stubbs work 
their error lay not in failing to make a positive stubbs 
attribution they did not themselves have the expertise to do that 
any more than to the contrary but rather in their failure to spot 
the potential in these paintings he said 
an art expert testified during the trial that she could not 
verify the authenticity of the paintings but said there was an 85 
percent chance they were painted not by stubbs but by a 19th 
century admirer 
mrs luxmooremay said she was absolutely delighted with the 
200000 judgement she said she went to the auctioneers because her 
husband was a former director 
i would prefer to have the pictures on my wall knowing they 
were by stubbs than have the damages she said 
mrs luxmooremay a magistrate testified that she was given the 
paintings in 1948 by a family friend but she said she and her 
husband never liked them 
paul thomas the expert at messenger may baverstock said he 
thought the paintings were badly drawn and without quality so he 
valued them at 54 to 90 
brown said the luxmooremays were mortified to read on the 
front page of the times of london some months later that the 
pictures had been bought by spinks fine art dealers for 162000 
spinks later sold them to mellon for an undisclosed sum 
mrs luxmooremay 66 sued for breach of contract and failure to 
exercise reasonable skill and care in its valuation and sale in 
october 1985 in godalming 35 miles southwest of london 
stubbs who lived from 1724 to 1806 is regarded as englands 
finest animal painter

thousands made a pilgrimage to dealey plaza to 
honor john f kennedy with prayers and tears and by dropping 
bouquets and kennedy halfdollars in the street where the president 
was assassinated 25 years ago 
its just something to remember him by alvin marin of 
suburban farmers branch said tuesday as he laid down the crucifix he 
said he had grasped upon hearing of kennedys assassination this 
is very emotional 
howard hartog of edgerton minn drove more than 900 miles for 
the anniversary then was among the first to drop flowers at the 
approximate spot by a grassy knoll where the president was gunned 
down 
i found myself fighting back tears said hartog moments 
after leaving a red rose thats where the uplift came from the 
spontaneity that occurred when that first flower was dropped 
although dallas held no official ceremony about 2500 people 
gathered along elm street to pass the anniversary hour of kennedys 
death as he rode by in a motorcade at 1229 pm the time of the 
fatal shots mourners began dropping bouquets of flowers 
halfdollars and other memorabilia on the street 
it was a show of camaraderie hartog said 
the flowers remained on the street and passing motorists were 
careful to avoid them backing up traffic downtown a note attached 
to one bouquet said after 25 years we still love you john 
another said we still miss you nov 22 about 20 people 
clapsed hands in a loose chain along the motorcade route 
at the flowerdraped stone memorial about 200 yards away where 
one card read dallas loves jfk too a few people knelt in 
prayer others snapped pictures of the memorial and the texas school 
book depository building where police found lee harvey oswalds 
rifle 
the buildings sixth floor where authorities believe the shots 
were fired is being converted to a museum by the dallas county 
historical foundation and is expected to open feb 20 presidents 
day 
elsewhere members of the kennedy family observed the anniversary 
in mostly private services jacqueline kennedy onassis attended a 
private mass in new york city along with her son john and 
daughter caroline sen edward m kennedy dmass placed a white 
rose on a monument honoring his brother n runnymede england 
eunice kennedy shriver the late presidents sister visited his 
grave and that of her brother robert at arlington national cemetery 
in virginia and said she hopes people remember the high points of 
his life the laughter and the vision 
the lack of official ceremonies in dallas and elsewhere were 
mostly in deference to a request from the presidents family his 
birthday on may 29 be marked instead of the assassination 
however jean hill of dallas said she had something important to 
impart to her class of 50 thirdgrade students who visited the site 
although this was a traumatic event i want them to feel they 
are a part of americas history she said were here because 
this is an important place in dallas an important place in 
history 
ms hill said she had been waiting at dealey plaza on nov 22 
1963 to see the presidents motorcade she jumped from the curb and 
hollered at kennedy to turn her way for a picture then the shots 
rang out 
i could have touched the car when i jumped out into the 
street she said the anniversary is bringing all of those 
anxiety feelings and traumatic feelings back to me the nightmares 
are coming back 
at parkland memorial hospital where the mortally wounded 
president was taken a panel of 11 employees recounted their 
experiences from the tragic day with about 200 hospital staff 
members 
it was as hopeless as anything we ever worked on said 
charles baxter assistant professor of surgery and director of the 
emergency room at the time the emotion in the room would have 
said to try and do something even though it was a hopeless 
situation

in an attempt to deal with a shrinking economy 
and runaway inflation the government has devalued perus currency 
by 50 percent and imposed other severe austerity measures including 
food price increases 
also tuesday leftist rebels launched a mortar attack on the lima 
headquarters of the national security police and raided an isolated 
mountain town capping a fourday wave of violence that has killed 
41 people 
though the countrys two main leftist insurgencies are a serious 
problem for the government of president alan garcia they do not 
pose as daunting a threat as perus grave economic crisis 
announcing the devaluation of the inti economy minister abel 
salinas also said the government would eliminate subsidies for basic 
food products in stages over the next six months because it lacks 
the money to finance them 
the first reduction will be implemented immediately and will 
double the prices of some food staples salinas said in a nationwide 
television address 
severe economic measures implemented by the government in early 
september including an 86 percent currency devaluation did not 
succeed in reducing the countrys huge deficit said salinas 
independent economists estimate the deficit has since increased 
from 16 percent to 18 percent of the gross national product 
inflation is expected to reach an annual 1500 percent this year 
salinas said the curencys official exchange rate was being 
devalued from 250 intis per dollar to 500 intis per dollar to boost 
exports and bring in badly needed dollars 
the inti traded tuesday on the parallel market a legal 
freemarket currency exchange for 625 to the dollar 
to offset the measures impact on the poor the government 
decreed an increase in the monthly minimum wage from 15000 to 
24000 intis 
sporadic food rioting broke out after the september austerity 
package was announced 
at one point garcia offered to resign but was persuaded by 
leaders of his populist aprista party to stay according to senior 
government officials 
garcia took office in 1985 and gained international attention 
when he defiantly set a ceiling on the countrys foreign debt 
payments equal to 10 percent of export earnings 
he used the money to generate record economic growth of 85 
percent in 1986 and 67 percent in 1987 but peru has exhausted its 
hard currency reserves and the government has said the economy will 
shrink by at least 6 percent this year 
authorities said one policeman was killed three were wounded and 
two were missing tuesday in the raid on the mountain community of 
cotahuasi 335 miles southeast of lima they said rebels of the 
maoistinspired shining path guerrilla movement carried out the raid 
no one was reported injured in the lima attack by the procuba 
tupac amaru revolutionary movement

the dark ominouslooking stealth bomber 
was rolled into the light of day after more than 10 years of 
secrecyshrouded development with the air force secretary declaring 
it essential to the nations defense 
the black and gray boomerangshaped b2 designed and built by 
northrop corp was towed ponderously out of a hangar tuesday to 
cheers and the accompaniment of the stealth fanfare an original 
composition played by an air force band 
we cant afford to be without this program air force 
secretary edward c pete aldridge jr declared to a select 
crowd of about 2000 that included members of congress military 
brass and the b2 labor force 
responding to critics who contend the stealth bomber is an 
expensive unneeded weapons system that could destabilize arms 
control efforts aldridge said the b2 is a key to compelling the 
soviet union to adhere to current and future arms agreements 
this program is essential aldridge told reporters after the 
unveiling at the mojave desert plant where the b1 bomber and space 
shuttle are built its not destabilizing 
he said the mission of the b2 which is designed to slip past 
enemy radar defenses and drop nuclear bombs is to make the soviets 
realize they could not protect their most precious assets such as 
hardened command posts and moveable missiles 
thats the whole idea behind the flexibility of a manned bomber 
force he said 
while the b1b bomber is considered sufficient by the air force 
to meet the current soviet threat aldridge insisted the 
revolutionary technology of the b2 is needed for the future 
the stealth bomber is a subsonic allaltitude flying wing formed 
from nonmetallic composite materials that are intended to let it 
absorb radar transmissions rather than reflect them its shape and 
lack of sharp angles also help make it nearly invisible to radar 
air force officials say it makes about the same impression on a 
radar screen as a bird 
the plane steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than 
with a tail nobody was allowed to see the b2 from the rear 
presumably because revealing the design of its engine exhaust system 
might help enemy detection efforts 
aldridge said even us radar systems cannot track the stealth 
bomber and that the pentagon believes the soviets to be without any 
effective counter to it or a stealth program of their own 
i am not aware of any soviet program like this he said 
the bomber built to accommodate a crew of two or three has not 
yet flown in the weeks ahead it will undergo highspeed taxi tests 
and engine evaluations air force officials declined to say when the 
b2 would take to the air saying it would fly only when it is 
ready 
the budget arm of congress the general accounting office has 
estimated potential program costs for a fleet of 132 stealth bombers 
sought by the air force at 685 billion or about 500 million 
each twice the cost of a b1b 
the union of concerned scientists has called the b2 a costly 
weapons system that could possibly panic the soviets and cause the 
opposite of the desired deterrent effect the air force has disputed 
this assertion contending it is important for the soviets to 
realize a weapon exists that could retaliate against their most 
prized assets 
the program to develop stealth aircraft was initiated by 
thenpresident jimmy carter and sustained in secrecy throughout the 
reagan administration

an outbreak of whooping cough has claimed 
the life of one infant in western new yorks amish community but has 
done little to break down the conservative christian groups 
resistance to inoculation 
during the past three weeks the number of confirmed cases of the 
disease which federal records indicate is fatal in eight of 1000 
cases among infants under age 6 months has risen from six to 33 a 
3monthold infant died oct 31 
the outbreak the second this decade in the community has health 
officials worried about the rest of the 1200 to 1500 amish who 
live in an area about 70 miles south of buffalo a vaccine has 
nearly eliminated whooping cough in the nations general population 
but most of the amish avoid vaccinations and other conventional 
medical treatments 
its a very large concern said mary anne power cattaraugus 
county supervising public health nurse any public health official 
would be concerned about an epidemic in such a large nonvaccinated 
community 
power said she is afraid the peak of the epidemic hasnt 
occurred yet 
the disease hasnt reached neil hershberger 26 or his wife and 
three children but like most amish here hes in no hurry to have 
his children vaccinated 
instead he said we would keep them the children away from 
people that have it 
that philosophy echoes the general stance the plain folk take 
toward the nonamish population whom they refer to as the 
english 
a group formed in the 17th century as an offshoot of the 
mennonites the amish are known for their severely plain clothing 
and avoidance of modern conveniences like electricity telephones 
and motorized vehicles they subsist by farming producing lumber 
and selling homemade goods such as quilts baked goods and cheese 
although friendly and willing to speak most dont want their 
names used out of modesty 
their outlook is im a member of the community and ill talk 
but i shouldnt be boastful or proud explained lee zook an 
amish expert and professor at luther college in decorah iowa 
whooping cough or pertussis is a regular occurrence in the 
community in 1982 there were 216 reported cases but no deaths 
all of the amish interviewed said they remembered having the 
disease as children and since they survived many dont believe it 
is dangerous their comments also reflected the communitys general 
belief in the virtue of selfsufficiency and faith in the power of 
god 
i had it i was only a couple of months old said one young 
amish man with a fiery red beard who along with eight of his 
friends was building a home on property hed just bought it 
wasnt that bad for me the way my mother told me i took some 
homemade remedies i dont know what it was 
in a way i kind of feel if a child is supposed to die why 
dont it die 
another man said of inoculation the way the people feel 
youre not relying on god youre relying on people 
the amish will seek medical treatment when it is clearly needed 
but as a nurse at conewango valley medical center said when they 
do come to us it seems like the disease is progressed so far its 
in the later stages 
the dpt diptheria pertussis tetanus vaccine according to dr 
steven wassilak at the federal centers for disease control has 
reduced the incidence of whooping cough from universal infection 
to about 4000 cases a year since its development in the 1940s 
still outbreaks occur every year already this year one arizona 
child has died in an outbreak in which 268 cases have been verified 
and in idaho there have been 325 reported cases this year 
the vaccine has proven safe for nearly all but wassilak noted 
reports have linked it to brain damage in a few cases 
cattaraugus county health commissioner dr james d garvey says 
the reported sideeffects may contribute to the resistance to 
inoculation among the amish 
i think they know about that he said 
still there are signs that attitudes are changing slowly garvey 
said county health nurses have gone doortodoor and vaccinated 
nearly 40 people during the last epidemic only six children were 
immunized 
i think they see that it can be more serious than they 
thought he said probably because of this one unfortunate 
death 
and hershberger said if he and his wife had an infant now i 
think we would get the shots

if wouldbe kris kringles have a love for 
children a twinkle in their eye and a desire to spread holiday 
cheer santa school teacher dick lewis can teach them the rest 
screaming kids shinkickers hecklers lewis said we 
teach them to deal with everything 
everything from the proper way to wear their santa hats to how to 
chortle like a pro said lewis who trains santas for western 
temporary services 
retirees character actors and a 19yearold college student 
donned red velveteen suits and ersatz beards at the john wanamaker 
department store and got the howtos of hohohoing from lewis on 
tuesday three days before the start of the christmas shopping 
season 
a santa himself before he joined western lewis has an eye for 
the compassion and demeanor that makes a good claus 
we want people with a sincere desire to make children happy at 
christmas time he said 
despite the professional almost productionline approach to 
training santas and the commercialism of the departmentstore 
kringles lewis advised his 10 students to remember their 
responsibility to uphold the spirit of the holiday 
these days and times there are going to be a lot of children 
who are not going to have a happy holiday lewis said at that 
point in time we need to be that special moment 
the temporary help company trains and employs 2500 to 3000 
santas each year for department stores promotional and community 
events throughout the country 
tuesdays training program which lasted less than an hour but 
usually runs longer gives the basics of being santa 
how to dress the part cap tassle always in front beard hooked 
around the top of the head so it doesnt slip two pairs of white 
gloves to be washed each day 
how to laugh in santas deep voice without scaring the child no 
loud hohohos but a low chortle coming from the stomach 
how to deal with difficult questions little girls often ask for 
a little brother lewis said and some kids are going to ask for a 
bed one child in pittsburgh asked for daddy to stop beating 
me he said 
a reminder to protect the shins when kids come flying up to the 
chair but always say ouch when they tug on the beard 
and one of the cardinal rules always stay in character no 
matter what happens you each one of you are the real santa 
there were also tips from st nicks like larry dowd who after 30 
years as a santa no longer needs artificial padding to play the role 
i think i fill the suit out more he said when asked if hed 
become a better claus over the years i used to use a pillow 
the kids however havent changed at all which is why dowd will 
come in before his regular night job supervising a custodial crew 
and work a sixhour shift talking with as many as 200 children 
the kids really light up your life said dowd 50 thats 
the part of christmas i really like 
dowd and another claus ned holbrook agreed santas are born not 
made 
i just think that you either have the natural training to be 
one or you dont said holbrook a character actor from 
philadelphia 
but holbrook who said he prepares for being santa as he would 
for a dramatic role is sometimes caught offguard such as the time 
a retarded woman sat on his lap and asked him to bring back her dead 
father 
she gave him a kiss after his best attempt to deal with her wish 
now thats faith he said

scientists are reconsidering whether to 
try to determine the fate of two california gray whales freed from 
the ice off alaskas northern coast last month after a threeweek 
international effort 
officials decided against attaching radio transmitters to the 
whales in part because many did not want to find out in case the 
mammals died soon after the 1 million rescue effort they were 
battered and bleeding when freed and had to navigate 200 miles of 
iceclogged waters to get to open seas 
but now scientists are considering distributing posters of the 
whales to california tour boat operators in hopes that it will help 
someone spot the animals said jim harvey a whale expert at the 
national marine mammal laboratory in seattle 
the main benefit would be to satisfy public curiosity about the 
fate of the whales harvey said tuesday 
but he said any knowledge gained might be useful in determining 
whether to undertake similar rescue efforts in the future and 
whether techniques developed in barrow were effective 
scientists have found no trace of the whales since a soviet 
icebreaker carved an escape path late last month 
harvey emphasized that no decision has been taken yet and that 
the chances of spotting the whales are slim in any event 
scientists were able to photograph only the whales heads as they 
surfaced to breathe in holes cut in the ice off the coast near 
barrow last month but in open water usually only a whales back 
and tail can be seen when it surfaces 
they would just about have to swim up to a boat and stick their 
heads out of the water to be identified harvey said 
the whales also may not go as far south as california where tour 
boats take people out to view whales 
ron morris a national marine fisheries service biologist who 
coordinated the rescue effort said some of the endangered gray 
whales stop near vancouver bc and san francisco rather than 
going all the way to breeding grounds off baja california harvey 
said young whales in particular like the two that were freed often 
dont make the full migration 
assuming the whales made it to open seas it could take them some 
time to reach tourboat territory with an average migration speed 
of 3 mph morris estimated they are still somewhere in the gulf of 
alaska off the states southern coast 
morris and harvey remained optimistic that the whales are still 
alive despite the beating they suffered because the animals can lose 
a significant amount of blood and survive 
i dont see why they wouldnt make it morris said i still 
tend to be optimistic

raymond dart a pioneering 
anthropologist whose oncecontroversial discovery of a link between 
man and ape is now widely accepted died after a threeweek illness 
he was 95 
dart died of a brain hemorrhage tuesday at a clinic near 
johannesburg said a colleague from the university of the 
witwatersrand professor phillip tobias 
dart became widely known in 1925 when he publicized his claim 
that a skull found in south africas cape province came from an 
apelike prehuman form of man that he called australopithecus 
for decades his theory was viewed skeptically by most of his 
professional peers some critics said the skull was that of a 
chimpanzee and dart was denounced by religious groups who objected 
to the theory of evolution 
but later work by dart and discoveries by other 
paleoanthropologists in africa eventually confirmed his theories 
dart is the grand old man of fossilman research donald 
ortner curator of physical anthropology at the smithsonian 
institution in washington said a few years ago his early 
observations on the evolutionary significance of 
australopithecusafricanus were highly controversial at the time he 
made them but since then have been generally accepted 
dart was born feb 4 1893 in brisbane australia and graduated 
from the sydney university medical school in 1917 in 1923 he was 
hired as professor of anatomy at the university of the witwatersrand 
in johannesburg where he taught until 1958 for 18 years he was 
dean of the universitys medical school 
the skull that brought him notoriety was recovered from a 
limestone cave at taung on the edge of the kalahari desert after 
weeks of examination dart concluded that it belonged to a child of 
an aperelated species that had moved further in a human direction 
than previously known species 
tobias an internationally recognized anatomist wrote in 1983 
darts appreciation and interpretation of the hominoidlike traits 
of astralopithecus represent the single most important breakthrough 
in paleoanthropology of the 20th century next to which all the 
other african discoveries represented a mere fillingin

about 20 turkeys that survived a 
slaughterhousebound truck wreck have been adopted and animal 
rights advocates are looking for homes for 20 others that gained a 
thanksgiving reprieve because of the crash 
people adopting the turkeys are just being nice enough to let 
them live out their lives said pamela nielsen of the animal 
rights group creature comfort adding that a turkey can live to be 8 
to 10 years old its a compassionate time of year 
eleven other birds that lived through the crash will play the 
traditional role of main course thursday those birds apparently 
already had been pledged when the adoption idea was proposed ms 
nielsen said 
following fridays crash which occurred on the way to a waco 
slaughterhouse the humane society took 51 turkeys from that 
shipment to the skyline alcohol and drug treatment center east of 
austin 
the center had planned to feed its 60 residents and donate 
remaining birds to the needy said kay tillman assistant 
managerdirector of the center 
were a nonprofit organization ms tillman said we were 
delighted to be offered 50 turkeys that wouldnt have just provided 
for thanksgiving it would have provided for christmas and all next 
year 
but ms nielsen and other animal rights activists gained the 
reprieve for most of the birds 
they seemed to feel as strongly about their cause as we do 
about ours ms tillman said 
were in the business of helping people she said theyre 
in the business of saving animals if anyone is that dedicated to 
anything you might as well help them 
ms nielsen said she hoped the public would donate food and 
useful items to the treatment center to make up for the lost poultry 
people who have offered homes to 20 birds generally have farms 
with other animals ms nielsen said she said shes confident none 
of the turkeys will be eaten because the adopting parties were 
contacted through vegetarians and animal rights advocates

the main us alliance of orthodox rabbis 
reportedly has split with the orthodox religious parties in israel 
that have been calling for a change in the legal definition of who 
is a jew 
in a telegram sent tuesday to israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir the rabbinical council of america said it supports removal 
of this issue from the political agenda the new york times 
reported today 
the council a moderate orthodox group said it was acting to 
preserve the unity and support of the american jewish community with 
and for israel 
the council says is represents about 1000 orthodox rabbis or 90 
percent of those with major congregations across the country it is 
the first orthodox group to state that the attempt to legally define 
jewishness by israel should be dropped 
israels orthodox parties hold the balance of power in the 
formation of a government in the knesset israels parliament and 
have pressed for a change in the law of return the law now grants 
all jews immediate israeli citizenship 
the religious parties want it changed to say that the only 
converts to judaism eligible for israeli citizenship must be 
converted according to orthodox religious law 
the telegram signed by the councils president rabbi max 
schreier and its executive vice president rabbi binyamin walfish 
said that they support the primacy of orthodox conversions but that 
standards for conversion belong in the hands of the rabbinate and 
not in the secular knesset 
the councils position puts it in conflict with the lubavitcher 
hasidim of brooklyn whose grand rabbi menachem m schneerson has 
been a force behind the effort to change the israeli law 
a study last year by the council of jewish federations found that 
9 percent of americas 5 million to 6 million jews identify 
themselves as orthodox 34 percent as conservative and 30 percent as 
reform twentyseven percent expressed no affiliation

outlining its legislative program for the coming 
year the government announced new moves against the ira that will 
include making candidates in northern ireland sign an oath 
renouncing violence 
the program comprising 16 proposed bills was read out by queen 
elizabeth ii on tuesday at the traditional opening of parliament in 
the house of lords the unelected upper chamber 
the speech also spelled out government plans to sell off the 
stateowned water and electricity utilities denounced by the 
opposition labor party the sales are the biggest and most 
controversial of prime minister margaret thatchers massive program 
of selling off stateowned assets to private enterprise and will 
raise an estimated 55 billion 
the program detailed in the queens speech is the tenth written 
by mrs thatchers conservative government 
one proposed bill would give authorities wide powers to probe and 
seize suspected irish republican army funds 
the government is determined never to give in to the 
terrorist mrs thatcher declared in the house of commons later 
tuesday launching a sixday debate on the legislative program 
despite protests from the opposition and from proira or moderate 
catholic groups in northern ireland most of the new measures are 
virtually certain of passage by the 650member lower chamber where 
mrs thatcher has a 101seat margin over all the other parties 
combined 
under the proposed measures state investigators will be able to 
demand from banks details of accounts through which the ira is 
suspected of moving cash from legitimate businesses or racketeering 
under the proposed measures all northern ireland election 
candidates will have to sign an oath rejecting violence 
other politicians or members of the public will be able to sue 
those who dont sign and get them banned from office 
officials said despite the law providing for the proposed 
nonviolence pledge which is aimed at members of the outlawed 
iras legal political front sinn fein candidates can say what 
they like during election campaigns 
further repression the increasing erosion of our few remaining 
civil liberties and british efforts to marginalize sinn fein are not 
the way to resolve the conflict said sinn fein spokesman danny 
morrison 
the new measure follows a ban this fall on broadcast interviews 
with members of the ira and 10 other militant catholic and 
protestant groups in northern ireland 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to end british rule in 
predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite it with the 95 
percent catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule

mayor edward i koch barely looked at former miss 
america bess myerson his former close political ally and said 
almost as little during his testimony at her divorcefixing 
conspiracy trial 
miss myersons attorney got koch to concede however that a 
previous sworn statement he made was inaccurate because he had 
forgotten about one conversation with an aide 
koch was unusually subdued and smiled little during most of his 
testimony tuesday in a packed federal courtroom 
koch appointed miss myerson as city cultural affairs commissioner 
in 1983 she resigned in 1987 after a report commissioned by koch 
accused her of serious misconduct in the hiring of a judges 
daughter as her personal assistant 
miss myerson 64 her lover carl andy capasso 43 and 
former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 75 are on trial 
for an alleged scheme to fix support payments in capassos divorce 
miss myerson is accused of giving a city job to the judges 
daughter sukhreet gabel to influence mrs gabel who later slashed 
capassos temporary alimony and child support payments 
koch barely glanced at miss myerson as he testified for the 
prosecution but miss myerson stared intently at her former boss 
from the defense table 
kochs testimony centered on a letter he received from miss 
myerson on oct 19 1983 explaining the hiring of sukhreet gabel 
in the letter written the day after a new york post report about 
ms gabels hiring miss myerson contended that nothing improper was 
done and that most of the decisions in the divorce case were already 
made when miss gabel was hired 
the only information that i had about ms gabels hiring was 
the post article and the letter said koch 
myerson lawyer frederick hafetz grilled the mayor about when a 
top aide herbert rickman told him about miss gabels hiring 
koch testified that his first recollection of discussing the 
subject with rickman was in 1986 
but hafetz pointed out that in a sworn statement to prosecutors 
in september 1987 koch said he had not discussed the gabel hiring 
with rickman before june 1987 
when hafetz asked koch if his statements last year were false 
incorrect inaccurate or misleading koch replied i am saying 
they were inaccurate 
to the best of my recollection koch said later now or at 
any time i had two conversations with herb rickman on this matter 
the first was in 1986 he said the second in 1987 when the 
mayors commission made its report on miss myerson he said he had 
forgotten about the 1986 conversation when he made the statement to 
prosecutors in 1987 
rickman testified earlier in the trial that he had gone to see 
koch in 1983 to angrily denounce the post article which quoted a 
myerson aide as saying rickman had recommended ms gabel as a job 
candidate 
the myerson aide has admitted misleading the post reporter 
koch however said he did not recall the 1983 conversation with 
rickman although he added it couldve occurred i just have no 
recollection 
last year koch said he no longer considers miss myerson a 
friend but under questioning by assistant us attorney david 
lawrence the mayor said he had and has a high regard for miss 
myerson whom he described as very important in the mayoral race 
i won in 1977

a retired navy firefighter says he was 
unable to break through an intense fire that shot up his houses 
only staircase killing his two children a niece and two nephews 
samuel todaro and his wife eleanor fled the fire unharmed 
tuesday but said they had no chance of saving the five children 
from the fatal inferno that trapped them in upstairs bedrooms of the 
wooden frame house 
we heard a big pop and then we saw it we looked over and we 
saw this glow through our bedroom door said todaro who was 
asleep with his wife in a downstairs room we ran out and started 
yelling at the kids 
it doesnt seem like it happened it seems like theyre still 
here but theyre not mrs todaro said

a lawyer seeking to determine the fate of 
db cooper claims to have found part of the parachute the legendary 
hijacker used to escape from a jetliner 17 years ago friday with a 
200000 ransom 
richard tosaw of ceres calif said a diver he hired discovered 
an 18inchwide pilot parachute monday in the columbia river 
about 5 miles west of vancouver which lies across the river from 
portland ore 
the parachute which deploys a divers main parachute was found 
about a mile upstream from the spot where 5800 of coopers ransom 
washed up in 1980 he said 
the 63yearold attorney said the discovery indicates that cooper 
probably landed in the river and died tosaw said 
everybodys got to be somewhere and that guy is in the river 
he said 
but the man who packed coopers parachute said tuesday he doubts 
the pilot parachute came from the hijacker 
i think it is publicity said earl cossey of woodinville 
wash near seattle 
im kind of suspicious every year about db coopers 
anniversary they seem to find something why dont they find 
something in july cossey said he said the parachute sounds like 
it is of an earlier generation than the one he packed for the 
hijacker 
cooper used the name of dan cooper when he boarded a 
seattlebound northwest air lines 727 in portland on nov 24 1971 
the day before thanksgiving news accounts initially called him db 
cooper though and the moniker stuck 
after takeoff cooper displayed what an attendant said looked 
like dynamite and demanded four parachutes and 200000 which he 
picked up in seattle after the plane took off for reno nev 
cooper jumped out and hasnt been seen or heard from since 
tosaw who has written a book titled db cooper dead or 
alive said he believes coopers body is trapped on one of the 
jetties of telephone poles built into the river about every 
halfmile to prevent shore erosion the pilot parachute was found 
behind one such jetty in about 20 feet of water he said 
curtis rainey 33 the diver who made the discovery planned to 
show the pilot parachute to cossey over thanksgiving 
cossey a licensed parachute rigger whom northwest hired to 
provide gear for cooper said pilot parachutes dont bear any 
identifying marks or registration numbers unlike the main parachute 
there are probably a million of those pilot parachutes in the 
world he said from his home 
john eyer assistant in charge of the seattle fbi office said 
tosaw hadnt informed the agency of the discovery 
tosaw began looking for cooper seven years ago and said he always 
times his searches to coincide with the hijackings anniversary he 
said he will resume the hunt next year 
id like to fish him out of there on thanksgiving day he 
said

the countrys fifthlargest turkey 
processor and distributor is recalling thousands of its family 
tradition turkeys from seven northeast states after three grocers 
discovered spoiled giblets and necks in some birds 
no illnesses have been reported and the us agriculture 
department has been notified norbest inc spokesman mike korologos 
said by telephone from the companys salt lake city headquarters 
tuesday 
the turkeys which carry the number p2487 on the metal package 
closures were processed under a packaging agreement with a columbia 
city ind plant korologos said they were distributed to stores 
in rhode island massachusetts vermont maine connecticut new 
hampshire and in pittsburgh in pennsylvania he said 
bennett s berman executive vice president of the meat division 
of roger williams foods in cranston a norbest distributor said he 
had distributed about 900 boxes of turkeys each containing two to 
four birds to mostly small stores where we could put our fingers 
right on it 
i have recovered 90 percent of them he said estimating 
the rest would be recovered today 
he said one store apparently had sold several boxes of birds to 
someone for a raffle or similar event and those were being tracked 
down 
berman said a grocer complained about a bad bird saturday but he 
did not become concerned immediately because we get these calls 
every year at thanksgiving and christmas when the birds jam 
grocery shelves and often are improperly refrigerated 
when a grocer found a bad box of turkeys however berman said he 
immediately notified norbest on monday and began recalling the 
birds which are being shipped to a bostonarea cold storage 
warehouse for federal inspection 
korologos said the turkeys being recalled which weigh from 6 to 
20 pounds each amount to less than 02 percent of norbests total 
production 
norbest does not forsee any serious health problems but 
ordered the removal to avoid the remote possibility of illness to 
consumers he said consumers who purchased the turkeys should 
return them to the place of purchase for a refund korologos said

running said 5yearold sumita whose father uncle and

bullets hit him 
a bullet hit the girl in the left arm sumita whose family does

six andean condors are 
napping and munching on beef and chopped rats as they await release 
into the wild in an experiment aimed at saving their california 
condor cousins from extinction 
it will be a credit to humankind if we can preserve the animals 
of the earth and the condor is but one animal facing dire 
straits said jeff opdycke a us fish and wildlife service 
official who toured the andean condor release site with reporters 
tuesday 
of thousands of california condors that once soared in the early 
1800s only 28 of the vulturelike carrioneating birds remain 
alive with 912foot wingspans they are north americas largest 
bird 
all the survivors are in captive breeding programs at the los 
angeles zoo and san diego wild animal park 
in five to 10 years after enough of them have produced offspring 
in captivity some of the young birds will be reintroduced into the 
wild in another attempt to avoid extinction 
to learn the best way to release the california condors and 
assure their survival researchers are using young andean condors 
donated by various zoos as standins for their more endangered 
relatives one thousand to 2000 andean condors remain in the wilds 
of south america 
these are surrogates said joseph dowhan condor recovery 
coordinator for the fish and wildlife service were going to test 
release techniques release sites and train people 
seven of the andean birds will be freed in december and january 
into the 53000acre sespe condor sanctuary 50 miles northwest of 
downtown los angeles 
along with up to 10 others to be freed late next year they will 
be rounded up when the 440000 study is done in two or three years 
then released permanently in their native colombia 
about a dozen reporters were allowed to observe three of the 
birds on tuesday in a tour led by officials of the fish and wildlife 
service the us forest service national audubon society and los 
angeles zoo 
the three young female condors all about five months old and 
weighing 19 to 21 pounds sat in the shade napping in the 
netenclosed half of their 35by16foot roosting box which sits 
atop sawedoff telephone poles 10 feet above the ground to protect 
them from black bears and coyotes 
biologists sneak into the cage at night to deliver meals of calf 
meat ground horse meat and chopped rats said mike wallace the los 
angeles zoos curator of birds 
the condors displayed tuesday will be released in january along 
with a fourth bird that had not yet arrived 
scientists hope that once released the birds will stay in the 
sanctuary and away from areas where wild california condors died 
from what officials believe was lead poisoning they were poisoned 
by eating the carcasses of coyotes that were trapped and shot or 
the remains of wounded deer that died after escaping hunters 
scientists said 
wallace said others probably were shot and some may have been 
killed by colliding with power lines 
development along californias coast and san joaquin valley also 
gradually destroyed much condor habitat researchers believe 
so far only one california condor chick has been hatched in 
captivity that is the sevenmonthold moloko who resides at the 
san diego wild animal park dowhan hopes one to five more chicks 
will hatch next year 
four of the last five wild breeding pairs of california condors 
vanished in 19841985 in 1986 the fish and wildlife service made a 
controversial decision to round up the last six wild birds to 
prevent their demise 
so far attempts to save the condors have cost about 20 million

the government has barred distribution of the 
december issue of harpers magazine because it contains sensitive 
excerpts from a book by former intelligence agent anthony cavendish 
the distributors said today 
the government warned the distributors comag that issue of the 
uspublished magazine would breach a high court order barring two 
london newspapers from publishing material about cavendishs work in 
east bloc countries in the late 1950s and early 1960s 
at this time we have agreed not to distribute the december 
issue a spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity 
cavendish a 61yearold merchant banker worked for britains 
mi6 agency which gathers foreign intelligence 
he abandoned a twoyear battle to publish his memoirs inside 
intelligence after the government threatened legal action but he 
sent 500 privately printed copies to friends as christmas presents 
last year 
prime minister margaret thatchers government obtained an interim 
injunction jan 2 against the observer and the sunday times 
newspapers after arguing that cavendish broke a formal vow never to 
reveal details of his intelligence work and that publication would 
damage national security 
cavendish wrote that harold wilson may have abruptly resigned as 
labor party prime minister in march 1976 because the soviet kgb had 
acquired embarrassing information about him 
wilson stepped down less than midway through his governments 
normal fiveyear term of office the 72yearold politician now 
lord wilson was twice prime minister from 1964 to 1970 and from

says 
juoza kungys 73 of clifton in northern new jersey will be 
allowed to remain in the united states as a permanent resident alien

lied to us officials when he entered the country after world war 
ii the department said 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise signed the consent 
order here last week and the justice department made it public 
tuesday 
government lawyers have said that in 1941 kungys as a member of 
a military organization known as the sauliai helped force more than 
2000 jewish men women and children to undress and enter a ditch 
where they were shot 
the government permitted kungys to stay because he would probably 
have been allowed to remain due to future litigation said neal 
sher director of the justice departments special investigations 
office sher said kungys would still be eligible for extradition to

college students rolled 10pound frozen 
butterballs at plastic pins in a holiday tournament that gave new 
meaning to the term bowling a turkey 
more than 50 students at kearney state college participated 
monday night in the bowling championship in a dormitory hallway 
sponsors said foul fowls were more common than turkeys a real 
bowling term for three strikes in a row 
there are no holes in the turkey to put your fingers said 
melissa fitch a sophomore miss fitch said she averages 150 on a 
real bowling alley but managed to knock down only 16 pins in the 
turkey competition 
i think its hilarious she said ive never seen anything 
like it 
the rules and scoring during the 52person tourney established by 
the dormitorys resident assistants were generally the same as those 
used in real bowling 
turkey must stay within taped boundaries or it is considered a 
gutter turkey one sign said the cry of gutter turkey was 
heard throughout the night 
some bowlers grasped the turkey by the net cover or the plastic 
handle to propel the bird toward the toy pins others used two hands 
to push it down the lane gina christensen a freshman hiked her 
ball footballstyle 
tom upthagrove a freshman said students needed a break from 
their studies 
it gives us something to talk about it cheers us up he said 
resident assistant brad krutsinger said winners of the finals 
scheduled later this week will have the option of keeping a turkey 
as a prize 
but he said the birds may be mangled by then and probably will be 
donated to the local humane society for use as cat food

guerrillas fired a rocket at two 
police jeeps but missed and demolished a butchers shop police 
reported 
a press officer at belfast police headquarters said the 
sovietmade rpg7 antitank rocket just missed a crowded pub when it 
was fired tuesday night in castlewellan 25 miles south of belfast 
no one was injured 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but 
suspicion fell on the irish republican army the mainly roman 
catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in predominantly 
protestant northern ireland and unite it with the 95 percent 
catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule 
the press officer said on condition of anonymity that the rocket 
went through the window of the shop and through two walls at the

the mall if the people distributing them contact him he said he 
also would pay for an ad

stay up no effort was made to remove it elliott said 
at newpark and southland merchants were allowed to display 
posters inside the stores but could not put them in the windows 
facing the shopping center 
we have a policy that we cannot attach anything to the common 
areas said newpark mall marketing director lisa shepherd a

a mild earthquake shook southern quebec early 
today causing slight damage but no injuries officials said 
the epicenter of the quake which measured 49 on the richter 
scale was 90 miles north of quebec city john adams of the 
geological survey of canada said preliminary measurements by the 
us geological survey in golden colo put the magnitude of the 
quake at 45 on the richter scale 
the 411 am jolt was felt in quebec city and over a broad area 
including bagotville troisrivieres chicoutimi and lac stjean 
adams said 
some unconfirmed damage has been reported in lac stjean 
adams said but it would be slight in the nature of cracks 
showing in walls glasses or china falling off shelves that sort of 
thing 
there were some reports of people thinking a snowblower had been 
turned on outside their home or their furnace had blown up but most 
residents between quebec city and chicoutimi slept through the 
unexpected quake 
earthquakes are very rare in the region which is considered 
relatively stable adams said this one really caught us by 
surprise he said 
the richter scale is an openended gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage

americans searching for us prisoners 
of war in communist laos today had several hundred thai children 
float tiny foam boats with messages across the mekong river to laos 
a spokesman said 
dr amos townsend a member of the group said unfavorable winds 
made it unlikely many of the 600 small craft would reach the laotian 
bank but he said the message would get across the mekong river 
divides thailand and laos 
each boat six inches in diameter carried a written note that 
read this boat represents one of about 600 americans who are 
still unaccounted for in laos may this effort appease the spirits 
of those who have died and help bring back to their families those 
who are still living 
the us state department lists 547 americans as missing in laos 
from the indochina war 
townsend said in a telephone interview the group was hoping to 
publicize a 24million reward for the return of any live american 
pow in indochina but he said the boats did not carry information 
about the monetary reward 
the launch coincided with the ancient thai loy krathong 
festival celebrated on the full moon each november thais set 
banana leaf boats on bodies of water and offer prayers to the water 
spirits 
townsend and three other americans are based in the northeastern 
province of nakhon phanom bordering laos where the craft were 
launched and where they hope to establish a longterm presence 
and gather information on americans they believe are still being 
held 
two other americans were recently imprisoned for 41 days after 
entering laos illegally to advertise the same reward which has been 
offered by several us congressmen and private individuals 
donna long and james copp both from north carolina were freed 
after a us veterans group paid 1500 and canceled a protest 
planned near the laotian embassy in washington to demand their 
release 
laos has repeatedly denied it holds any americans the recent 
foray by the two americans prompted criticism from the us state 
department which wants to resolve the issue of missing americans 
through official contacts with the laotian government 
more than 2380 americans are still listed as missing in action 
or mia in laos vietnam and cambodia from the indochina war which 
ended in 1975 with communist victories in those countries 
in recent months cooperation has increased between the united 
states and the governments of laos and vietnam in an effort to 
resolve the issue

the soviet supreme court has rehabilitated leon 
trotskys son sergei sedov who was killed in josef stalins purges 
even though he rejected his fathers beliefs 
the courts action came after sedovs daughter yulia akselrod 
who immigrated to the united states in 1979 wrote president mikhail 
s gorbachev seeking to clear her fathers name 
the government newspaper izvestia reported monday that charges 
are dropped against sedov who it said was shot to death in 1937 
the terse twosentence reference to sedov partially answered 
mrs akselrods questions about the circumstances of her fathers 
death she said in september that she did not know when or how her 
father died 
izvestia said sedov was sentenced in 1935 but was killed two 
years later 
trotsky once a leader of the revolution was expelled from the 
soviet union by stalin in 1929 after losing a power struggle 
following the death of soviet founder vladimir i lenin in 1924 
stalin advocated communism in one country while trotsky 
believed in worldwide revolution later in the purges of the 1930s 
stalin hunted down real and imagined followers of trotsky and had 
them imprisoned or killed 
mrs akselrod said she and her family were still being punished 
for their lineage she said her father had been politically and 
personally estranged from trotsky 
until gorbachev mentioned trotsky in a speech last year his name 
had been taboo 
mrs akselrod said the soviet government should fully clear 
trotskys name and document his true role in the revolution 
but despite gorbachevs policy of glasnost or more openness on 
some issues officials have so far taken the stance that trotskys 
views were wrong and his full rehabilitation soon is unlikely 
after being branded a traitor trotsky left the country with his 
wife natalia sedova and their oldest son lyova who avidly backed 
his father he was assassinated in mexico in 1940 allegedly by a 
mexican communist party member loyal to stalin 
sedov who stayed behind in the soviet union took his mothers 
name to avoid persecution and thought he was safe mrs akselrod 
said her father was sent to siberia about three months before she 
was born

who fail to verify documents or fail to fire employees who dont 
produce documentation 
the quakers who employ 450 people have disobeyed the 
documentation provision while deciding on a legal course cary said 
we find ourselves ordered by the government to cast out those 
we have tried for so long to help he said the effort of a 
parent to feed his or her children is criminalized the demand that 
we fire those we cannot document is repugnant to us

a member of the politburo said today he 
saw no obstacle in principle to the formation of opposition 
political parties now that movement toward more pluralism has become 
unstoppable 
imre pozsgay who is also minister of state in the communist 
government spoke hours before the policysetting party central 
committee was to name a new premier to succeed party leader karoly 
grosz parliament still has to approve the candidate when it meets 
in session thursday 
the new premier will face a difficult task over the next two 
years presiding over extensive economic and political reforms 
before elections in 1990 when a new constitution is due to be 
adopted parliament is to pass a series of laws designed to 
introduce market forces into the economy and to restructure 
political institutions this may pave the way for a multiparty 
system 
pozsgay a leading reformer brought to the politburo when grosz 
took over as party leader in may told a news conference today i 
personally see no obstacles in principle to the existence of a 
multiparty system 
there has developed a genuine need for pluralism also a 
movement on the part of society itself that is unstoppable he 
said 
it would destabilize the country and lead to a potential 
catastrophe if the leadership tried to stall this effort he 
said 
in december parliament is due to adopt legislation regulating 
the establishment of independent groups associations and unions 
the new laws accept a multiparty system in principle however 
government leaders say further legislation is necessary to determine 
the establishment and function of parties those laws are not 
expected before 1990 
dozens of independent groups and movements have sprung up over 
the past year many with highly political platforms until last 
week however none had gone so far as to declare themselves a party 
on friday the independent smallholders party which headed a 
coalition government before the communists assumed power in 1948 
announced that it was resuming its activites hungarian news media 
gave no publicity to the move in sharp contrast with its new policy 
of openness 
pozsgay said the government would not exert repressive measures 
against the new party but he added that until the legal framework 
for the establishment of parties has been created the government 
would not provide publicity for it 
pozsgay is to present to parliament what he called the 
governments package plan for democracy a report on reforming 
the system of political institutions 
the model of socialism as applied until now was not 
effective pozsgay said it was an impediment to social progress 
and economic growth hungary must find a way to become a 
socialist country with pluralism he said 
reform legislation now being considered includes the laws on 
assembly and association to be passed in december and laws on press 
freedom the right to strike and electoral reform he said 
pozsgay said hungarys 106 million citizens should be given a 
direct voice in decision making possibly through referendum the 
powers of the judiciary also should be strengthened by establishing 
constitutional courts he said

the judge in the irancontra case will hold 
closed hearings on oliver l norths objections to deleting 
sensitive references from secret documents that prosecutors want to 
use as evidence against him 
north a former white house aide is charged with conspiring to 
illegally divert usiran arms sales profits to the nicaraguan 
antigovernment contra rebels 
us district judge gerhard a gesell on tuesday ordered closed 
hearings to begin nov 30 and continue thereafter daytoday as 
long as necessary to review the deletions from 350 classified 
documents proposed by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
walsh wants to delete the names of countries foreign officials 
and us agents stationed abroad to protect secret diplomatic and 
intelligence initiatives 
the government has agreed to allow walsh to use the documents as 
evidence in a public trial provided the sensitive information is 
deleted 
the judge said north should be prepared to explain why a 
proposed redaction deletion is relevant and material for his 
defense 
gesell made no mention in his brief order of norths proposal to 
introduce into evidence 40000 pages of classified material at a 
hearing on monday the judge seemed to indicate he would grant 
walshs motion to bar north from using any of the material saying 
he had no intention of scheduling hearings on norths proposals 
the independent prosecutor argued in court papers that norths 
list of documents should be rejected as legally insufficient 
he contended that the former national security council aide 
listed many of the documents simply to frighten the government to 
drop the charges to prevent disclosing some of the nations most 
wellkept intelligence and foreignpolicy secrets 
in his order scheduling the hearings on the prosecutions 
documents gesell said he had reviewed many of the papers 
numerous redactions appear designed to excise the identity of 
countries mentioned and communications with named individuals 
including officials of such countries and united states agents in 
the field the judge said 
almost without exception north objects to these categories of 
redactions 
the prosecution exhibits include between 1000 and 2000 pages of 
classified material 
the classified information procedures act provides for 
substitution of information with a written statement of facts if 
north convinces the judge that some of the material walsh wants to 
delete from the exhibits is necessary for his defense 
gesell directed walsh to devise an alternative system to denoting 
countries and officials with numbers and letters saying this 
masking technique appears unduly cumbersome and likely to prevent 
easy reading of the text 
no date has been set for norths trial separate trials have been 
ordered for former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord 
marlin fitzwater president reagans spokesman said tuesday the 
white house role currently is to review classified information 
that has been designated by the prosecution and by the defense for 
possible use in the trial 
asked to comment on suggestions by gesell that reagan should 
consider exercising his constitutional authority to thwart norths 
trial if the president feels national security would be compromised 
fitzwater replied we dont have any direct role 
reagan for months has said he would not discuss with reporters 
the option of granting a pardon to north on monday when asked 
whether he was drawing near a decision on a possible pardon he 
replied no no and i dont think it would be any time to make 
such a decision while its still before the courts 
when pressed during a news briefing to say whether a pardon was 
being considered fitzwater said repeatedly we arent discussing 
pardons

president reagan believes the 
criminal justice system should resolve whether former aide oliver 
north violated the law in the irancontra affair and he has no 
intention of trying to stop norths trial reagans spokesman says 
spokesman marlin fitzwater in statements that seemed to rule out 
a presidential pardon in advance of norths trial said tuesday the 
white house role currently is merely to review classified 
information that has been designated by the prosecution and by the 
defense for possible use in the trial 
asked to comment on suggestions by us district judge gerhard 
gesell that reagan should consider exercising his constitutional 
authority to thwart norths trial if reagan feels national security 
would be compromised fitzwater replied we dont have any direct 
role 
reagan for months has said he would not discuss with reporters 
the option of granting a pardon to north and has said it would be 
inappropriate to comment while the legal process was under way 
on monday when asked whether he was drawing near a decision on a 
possible pardon the president said much the same thing no no 
he replied and i dont think it ould be any time to make such a 
decision while its still before the courts 
but when pressed during a white house news briefing to say 
whether a pardon was being considered fitzwater said repeatedly 
we arent discussing pardons 
fitzwater reiterated that on previous occasions the white 
house has said that reagans position was that he believes the 
legal process should be allowed to take its course 
reagan often has sought to minimize the impact of the worst 
foreign policy scandal to beset his administration the brouhaha 
resulting from the clandestine sale of us arms to iran and the 
subsequent diversion of proceeds to nicaraguan rebels fighting the 
sandinista regime in managua 
north is charged with conspiring to defraud the government in 
connection with these transactions which resulted at least in part 
from attempts by the administration in 1985 and 1986 to win the 
release of americans held hostage in lebanon by proiranian groups 
gesell on tuesday ordered closed hearings to begin nov 30 on 
norths objections to deleting sensitive references from secret 
documents that prosecutors want to use as evidence against him 
the hearings gesell said will continue as long as necessary to 
review the deletions from 350 classified documents proposed by 
independent counsel lawrence e wals 
walsh wants to delete the names of countries foreign officials 
and us agents stationed abroad to protect secrets diplomatic and 
intelligence initiatives 
gesell had said monday that if norths trial proceeded as 
scheduled a large amount of sensitive information probably would be 
revealed in this public setting he said the court would likely 
consider any request by the president on the witholding of certain 
documents and evidence 
fitzwater said the administration so far has not sought to 
invoke executive privilege to protect such information he also said 
that we have declassified or reviewed and declined to 
declassify some 40000 pages of documents that have been provided 
by both sides in the case 
reagan has shown little inclination to grant a pardon and he has 
less than 60 days in office the president last march said he still 
thought that north his former national security council staff 
deputy is a hero 
he said he did not think that either north or former national 
security council adviser john poindexter would be convicted saying 
i just have to believe that theyre going to be found innocent 
because i dont think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any 
crime 
thenchief of staff howard baker subsequently told reporters that 
a pretrial or preverdict pardon for north was highly unlikely 
such a decision could end up in the hands of presidentelect 
george bush 
during a dec 5 1987 interview with british broadcast 
personality david frost bush said he believed that history would 
judge north as a hero because the marine lieutenant colonel 
believed passionately in something 
ollie stood up there took the heat and the american people in 
every bar in chicago and every bowling alley in texas and every 
little home said hey this guy believes in something and i can 
identify with it

former president chun doohwan saying 
hes ashamed of human rights abuses and corruption during his rule 
told the nation today he is surrendering 24 million and going into 
internal exile 
but opposition leaders demanded a thorough investigation into 
corruption under chun and said he must account for billions of 
dollars they contend was misappropriated they doubted the apology 
would be sufficient 
i am pained and ashamed of my past i have no intention at all 
to make an excuse chun looking tired and strained said in a 
nationally televised 30minute address 
i have to bear full responsibility for the past seven years 
which is branded by the people as an era of authoritarianism and 
misdeeds although i tried to do my best in my way chun said 
my dear people i am really sorry said the former general 
who took power with military backing in 1980 
he made a special apology for the military suppression of a 1980 
uprising by students and citizens in the southern city of kwangju 
that left about 200 people dead he described the incident as a 
tragedy 
chun said he was turning over his property to the government 
including his seoul house two golf club memberships and 33 
million in cash he also said he would return about 20 million in 
political funds 
millions of koreans watched the live midmorning broadcast people 
flocked around tv sets in shops and offices and traffic was light 
as people stayed home to see chuns apology 
chuna and his wife lee soonja left their home after the speech 
to go into exile at an undisclosed rural location in a traditional 
gesture of apology mrs lee wept while her husband sat stonefaced 
in the car that took them away 
the couple spent the first day of exile in a remote buddhist 
temple in eastern south korea newspapers said they would stay in a 
nearby village for a while but would move occasionally for security 
reasons radical groups have vowed to punish chun 
about 50 radical students armed with firebombs and steel rods 
tried to rush chuns home after the speech but they were stopped by 
some of the 5000 riot police ringing the area chun had already 
left 
arrest chun doohwan protesters yelled as police dispersed 
them 
radical students and dissidents called for daily protests to 
demand chuns arrest dissident groups said the apology was an empty 
gesture and denounced president roh taewoo for trying to protect 
his predecessor 
seoul newspapers reported today that roh plans to pardon chun in 
the next few days and reshuffle the government to remove supporters 
of the former president officials declined comment 
roh another former general and close ally of chun is trying to 
defuse mounting public anger against the former president without 
damaging himself and the government he took over from chun some 
opposition groups are calling for rohs removal contending he is a 
front for military rule 
many observers doubt chuns apology will defuse the crisis and 
roh is expected to face more problems in coming weeks roh took 
office as chuns sevenyear term ended in february he had won a 
presidential election by a plurality but not a majority as the 
opposition vote was split by two candidates kim daejung and kim 
youngsam 
chun asked for forgiveness but said he was ready to accept the 
peoples judgment he asked the nation to allow him to stay in south 
korea indicating he did not want to be exiled overseas 
i deeply repent my sins im ready to face any sufferings 
and will not shirk responsibility for the results of my deeds he 
said 
chun has denied any personal corruption but some of his 
relatives and associates have been convicted or charged with 
embezzlement and other crimes 
he apologized for the forced dismissal of government officials 
and journalists when he took power the deaths of opposition 
supporters who were sent to harsh reeducation camps and corruption 
and embezzlement by some of his relatives and associates 
kim daejung told reporters opposition leaders would call for 
appointment of a special prosecutor to expose corruption under the 
chun government 
he said chuns apology was personally sincere but did not go 
far enough he charged that billions of dollars were misappropriated 
under chun and called for a full accounting 
chun said in his apology that he had overseen collection of 
political funds but was turning over all money under his control to 
the government he said the opposition would not believe that he did 
not have any more money 
kim youngsam said he pitied chun but that further investigation 
was necessary the truth must be clearly disclosed

four blacks moved into primary runoffs in a 
campaign to elect the first black member of the dallas county 
commission in more than a century 
a federal court ordered tuesdays election in a legal dispute 
that began in 1978 when the us justice department said the 
countywide election process diluted black voter strength in the 
county which is about 55 percent black 
the change from atlarge voting to five districts gave black 
voters a majority in at least two of the districts in this county 
the site of one of the most famous voter registration struggles of 
the civil rights movement 
a black has not served on the commission since reconstruction 
weve been trying for 20 years to get a county commission that 
represents everyone and tuesday seems to be that day said civil 
rights activist jl chestnut 
as a result of tuesdays balloting two blacks will be in a 
runoff for one district and will face white republican opposition in 
the general election 
two whites made it into runoffs with black candidates in black 
districts whites will advance to the general election in two other 
districts 
runoffs are set for dec 13 and the general election is scheduled 
for dec 27 
more than 30 federal observers monitored the voting while in 
washington us supreme court justice anthony kennedy rejected a 
bid by the county school board for a review of the district plan 
the number of black registered voters in the county has swelled 
from 300 to more than 20000 since enactment of the voting rights 
act in 1965 the selmatomontgomery voting rights march that year 
and the other bitter civil rights struggles in selma in the 1960s

three soldiers were killed and 126 people wounded 
in azerbaijan when riots triggered by a territorial dispute with 
armenia swept through two southern soviet cities an azerbaijani 
official said today 
musa mamedov chief of the information department of the 
azerbaijan foreign ministry said the violence occurred in the 
azerbaijan cities of nakhichevan and kirovabad with the arrival of 
interior ministry troops on tuesday 
three soldiers were killed perhaps by stones perhaps by 
sticks mamedov said in a telephone interview from azerbaijans 
capital baku a total of 126 people in the two cities were 
injured 
he said a state of emergency was proclaimed in the two cities 
it was the first official report of the death of soldiers or 
policemen in azerbaijan or armenia since an ethnic dispute broke out 
in february over nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian region of 
azerbaijan whose legislature has demanded unification with armenia 
staterun baku radio monitored in london said an unspecified 
number of people also were injured in nakhichevan the 
administrative center of an enclave of azerbaijani territory that 
borders iran 
the radio said crime and looting had been on the increase since 
monday and peoples lives were in danger it said some police had 
not been fulfilling their duties but that the citys leadership 
is taking immediate measures 
mamedov said it was not known if ethnic armenians who live in 
nakhichevan and kirovabad were among those injured many armenians 
live in kirovabad so its possible they were among the victims 
he said 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
told a news briefing the situation in baku was difficult he 
said there had been a disturbance in kirovabad and that there were 
casualties but did not elaborate 
in february antiarmenian riots shook another azerbaijan city 
sumgait and soviet officials said 32 people among them 26 
armenians were killed armenians claim the death toll was much 
higher 
tens of thousands of armenians massed tuesday night in yerevan 
their capital and voted to form selfdefense squads as initial 
news of the unrest in azerbaijan became known in the city 
in baku thousands of azerbaijanis were reported gathered in the 
main square today as roundtheclock antiarmenian protests there 
entered a fifth day a reporter with official azerbaijan television 
estimated the number of protesters at 800000 almost half of bakus 
population of 17 million 
the giant protests on lenin square were caused by news from 
nagornokarabakh that armenians were trying to increase the armenian 
population of the shusha district 
settlers were reportedly taken to the area a week ago in official 
trucks and began building barracks with materials supplied by the 
armenian government according to a correspondent of the official 
azerbaijan news agency azerinform who spoke by telephone on 
condition of anonymity 
baku radio reported that indignant residents of the 
azerbaijani capital were holding nonstop rallies and demanding the 
imposition of law and order and an end to the building project 
in nagornokarabakh 
an editor for azerinform who identified himself only as perets 
said 100000 people mostly students were in lenin square this 
afternoon but that their numbers were expected to swell to over 1 
million after work let out 
the armenian supreme soviet or parliament broke off its session 
tuesday night because of increased tensions in the caucasus region 
the legislature which has approved the annexation of 
nagornokarabakh had been scheduled to discuss the issue again 
tens of thousands of armenians gathered on yerevans opera square 
after the supreme soviet halted its session and approved the 
creation of selfdefense squads in areas of armenia where 
azerbaijanis live rafael popoyan an armenian activist said by 
telephone from yerevan 
about 300000 azerbaijanis who are traditionally moslem live in 
the largely christian republic of armenia whose population is 35 
million 
popoyan said the decision to create the selfdefense groups was 
taken by the karabakh committee an independent group fighting for 
armenian reunification with nagornokarabakh and then read to the 
crowd in opera square the demonstrators also voted to continue a 
protest strike in yerevan that began friday popoyan said 
he said the situation in the city remained tense with many 
armenians staying off the job and crowds of protesters gathering 
again in opera square 
both the legislatures of nagornokarabakh and armenia itself have 
voted for the regions annexation by armenia but azerbaijan has 
rejected the transfer of sovereignty 
in july the supreme soviet presidium the nations top executive 
body rejected any change in status for nagornokarabakh the 
kremlin opted instead for a longterm economic and social 
development plan for the region

american factory orders surged 24 percent last month for large 
manufactured items the government reported today but the increase 
came from a 411 percent jump in demand for military equipment 
mostly new warships 
the commerce department said that excluding the military order 
category orders for durable goods fell 02 percent the second 
consecutive monthly drop 
the key category of nondefense capital goods a measure of 
business expansion plans also fell for the second straight month 
it was down 26 percent to 34 billion following a 102 percent 
drop in september the largest since january 1986 
durable goods are defined as big items ranging from refrigerators 
to tanks and aircraft that are expected to last at least three 
years orders are an important barometer of manufacturing strength 
but economists discount the military and transportation categories 
because they fluctuate sharply from month to month 
the weak dollar fell further in new york in morning trading in 
reaction to the durable goods report evidently reflecting pessimism 
about the ability of us manufacturers to compete well in world 
markets without a cheaper currency 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 
about 4 points to the 2082 level and in the bond market prices 
were little changed 
other unsettling economic news dominated the attention of 
financial markets tuesday leaving the united states facing higher 
consumer prices a weaker dollar more expensive oil and its biggest 
budget deficit since march 
the labor department said tuesday that sharp increases for fall 
and winter clothing last month put consumer price inflation back 
around 5 percent annually despite the smallest monthly increase in 
food costs since february 
consumer prices rose 04 percent in october or at an annual 
rate of 51 percent vs 41 percent in september with more than 
half the gain coming from a 18 percent boost in apparel prices and 
sharp increases in auto insurance and financing charges 
other inflation news came from the conference of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries in vienna austria where iran gave 
conflicting signals on whether a priceboosting pact was possible 
the iranians incited trading frenzies in the oil pits at the new 
york mercantile exchange where prices zoomed collapsed and jumped 
back up again in one of the wildest days in months west texas 
intermediate the benchmark crude oil ended up 88 cents per barrel 
to 1386 
none of these events helped the dollar which continued declining 
in value against foreign currencies not only because they raised 
inflation fears but also because of increasing anxiety that the bush 
administration will do little to stem staggering budget and trade 
deficits 
the dollar fell in new york trading from 12203 yen to 12131 yen 
and from 1728 west german marks to 1718 in other markets stocks 
were slightly higher and bond prices slipped 
heightening concern about budget deficit was a treasury 
department report showing the federal government spent 274 billion 
more than it took in last month the largest deficit since march 
that level was down 109 percent from a year earlier but the 
decline was more than accounted for by temporary factors or onetime 
accounting adjustments 
the reagan administration is projecting the budget deficit in 
fiscal 1989 will shrink to 1455 billion down from 1551 billion 
in the year ended sept 30 the congressional budget office projects 
a 148 billion deficit 
but most private economists are projecting a 1989 deficit little 
improved and perhaps worse than 1988

dolphins he told the associated press in cairo i couldnt find 
anything in one month

importance 
bush said the national security adviser has to have direct 
access day and night i will be one who takes a keen interest in 
these matters i have a lot of ideas they need to be tempered by 
his experience and judgment 
scowcroft said he agrees with bush that the future holds for 
the united states tremendous challenges and also opportunities im 
looking forward to helping him cope successfully with the challenges 
and to take full advantage of the opportunities 
asked about changes instituted at the national security counsel 
after the irancontra affair scowcroft said i am very pleased i 
think that gen colin powell and secretary frank carlucci before 
him have left the nsc staff in really excellent condition and it 
will be a joy to assume responsibility for the system the way it is 
operating now 
as he had tuesday bush deflected questions concerning reports 
that he was planning to name former sen john tower as his defense 
secretary he complained that speculation on various appointments 
merely raises potential appointees hopes which then can be dashed 
if it doesnt work out 
asked if he would soon put tower out of his misery one way or 
the other he replied im asking you to do that 
tower the former chairman of the senate armed services 
committee was most recently in the public eye as chairman of 
president reagans commission to look into the irancontra affair 
scowcroft was one of the two other members along with former 
secretary of state edmund muskie 
bush was asked about scowcrofts reputation for caution in 
dealing with the soviets 
do i share the caution he has sometimes signaled the answer is 
yes bush said that doesnt mean there wont be forward 
progress 
bush noted his dec 7 meeting with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and said i will have an opportunity to make that very 
clear to mr gorbachev what i wont be able to make clear to him 
is heres our detailed arms control formulation 
the presidentelect praised powell the outgoing national 
security adviser as an outstanding adviser to the president of 
the united states hes won the confidence of the president of the 
capitol and of all of us for whom hes worked 
the vice president said he did not now what powells future would 
hold 
in answer to reporters questions scowcroft said 
theres no question that there are serious problems in the 
defense budget it is substantially underfunded and secretary 
carlucci has already taken some very courageous steps in the 
direction of readjusting the defense program more has to be done 
on asking us allies to bear more of the defense load its 
of course especially important for the united states at this 
particular time but i think its also important to approach this 
general issue cooperatively with our allies not combatively 
it was too soon to say whether the start talks with the soviets 
would resume on schedule in the new year 
it would be very premature to say whether he would retain 
bushs national security aide donald gregg or whom he might name 
to the national security staff 
scowcroft also served as an arms control adviser to president 
jimmy carter and who headed a special commission in 1983 that 
studied basing of the mx missile 
scowcroft served as a deputy to henry kissinger when kissinger 
served both as secretary of state and national security adviser 
during the nixon and ford administrations 
when kissinger surrendered the national security post in 1975 
scowcroft was named to fill the job 
a 1947 graduate of west point he became an officer in the air 
force he served as a professor of russian history and political 
science at both west point and the air force academy in the early 
1970s he served as president nixons military assistant

carlos salinas de gortari for a getacquainted session both he and 
salinas who takes office dec 1 called the meeting a first step 
toward improved usmexican relations 
over a sixcourse lunch that included roasted pheasant and gilded 
chocolate truffles bush and salinas discussed drugs immigration 
trade and mexicos staggering 102 billion international debt aides 
said 
i am absolutely confident after this initial visit that were 
both committed to improving a bilateral relationship that is 
essential in my view as far as the united states of america is 
concerned bush said in brief remarks after talks that lasted two 
hours 
salinas using similarly upbeat diplomatic language that 
disclosed few specifics called the session a positive 
respectful cordial dialogue which i am certain will do a great deal 
to improve the relations between mexico and the united states 
bush thanked salinas for greeting him in his adopted hometown 
salinas speaking through a translator invited bush to visit him 
next time in mexico city 
the vice president in remarks applied to both mexico and canada 
pledged to never neglect our own friends in this hemisphere 
in an address earlier tuesday to a meeting of republican 
governors in point clear ala bush congratulated canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney for a spectacular win in mondays 
national elections that retained a house of commons majority for 
mulroneys conservative party 
bush called the election a ringing endorsement not only for the 
prime minister but for the recently negotiated uscanadian 
freetrade pact whose fate had become a campaign issue 
bush also told the republican governors association he would name 
negotiators for budget talks with congress on the first day of my 
presidency suggesting a possible intention to sidestep the usual

temple university has formally recognized a 
student group that promotes white pride entitling the organization 
to a faculty adviser the use of university facilities and 1000 a 
year in support 
temple spokeswoman kathy gosliner said tuesday that officials 
recognized the white student union after reviewing its application 
with a lawyer 
it has nothing to do with whether we agree with what they 
believe she said we adhere strongly to principles of free 
speech 
michael spletzer a 22yearold senior and architecture major 
said he formed the group to balance what he called the 
prominority stance taken by temple with its minority 
scholarships affirmative action program and educational philosophy 
there has never been a voice for the rights and feelings of 
whites on campus spletzer said he said he is is not a white 
supremacist 
the rights of white americans are being stepped on all over 
he added 
spletzer said the group has 89 members ms gosliner said said 
she did not know how many people are in the white student union but 
four people signed the application for recognition she said the 
group must be open to all students 
recognition entitles organizations to the use of certain 
university facilities a faculty adviser the right to be considered 
for office space and 1000 a year for student activities said 
another temple spokesman george ingram 
temple naacp president vaughn goodwin expressed concern about the 
formation of the group 
for one race to come out and say racial pride of others is just 
talk is indirectly indoctrinating racism said goodwin a 
19yearold junior majoring in public relations 
goodwin said he if wsu activities suggest racism we will take 
direct action against the group

confessed twa hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi today contested evidence against him claiming a taped 
conversation between beirut airport authorities and the seized plane 
were from another hijacking 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem accused of murder and air piracy 
in the june 1985 hijacking interrupted testimony to say the 
arabiclanguage conversation introduced as evidence was not an 
exchange between him and the beirut control tower 
i think i recognize now that the last part of the tape concerns 
another hijacking that had nothing to do with twa hamadi told the 
court he did not say what hijacking he believed the tape referred 
to 
alen mousa the lebanese who translated the taped conversation 
for west german authorities was testifying when hamadi interrupted 
him mousa told the court he could not be sure if any of the voices 
on the tape belonged to hamadi 
hamadis defense attorneys made a motion for further examination 
of the tape 
during the 17day hijacking ordeal us navy diver richard 
stethem was killed and 39 americans were held hostage aboard twa 
flight 847 seized en route from athens to rome and diverted to 
beirut and algiers 
hamadi has admitted he and an accomplice hijacked the plane but 
he denied killing stethem his alleged accomplice hassan ezzeddine 
remains at large 
on tuesday houston businessman allyn conwell told the court he 
was so terrorized that i was virtually immobile while on board 
the seized plane he said he feared the captors planned to shoot him 
and other americans who were taken to hiding places in beirut 
four american servicemen were removed from the plane by 
hezbollah a radical shiite moslem group backed by iran while 
conwells group was in the custody of amal a shiite militia that 
collaborated with the hijackers 
conwell said he learned from members of amal whom he described 
as less extreme than the two hijackers that hamadi and his 
accomplice wanted to bring all of the hostages back on board and 
blow up the plane 
i was under the impression that amal absolutely did not approve 
of the hijacking and the murder of stethem conwell testified i 
think they acted to the best of their ability in a chaotic 
situation 
conwell said members of amal told him the original hijackers 
were getting very upset over the lack of progress in negotiations 
for the release of the hostages 
i was told the intention was to return all the hostages to the 
plane and blow it up conwell said 
he said amal officials indicated to him that the two hijackers 
were from hezbollah hamadi has denied being a member of that group 
also tuesday another former american hostage testified that 
hamadi when told an american serviceman aboard the plane was 
suffering chest pains responded let him die 
sue ellen herzberg also told the court that she felt degraded 
to an animal state during the hijacking

boys family left vietnam illegally by boat after their efforts for 
official emigration clearance failed they set out in may hoping to 
reach the arkansas town of el dorado where tong had settled and 
raised a family after fleeing saigon in 1975

word said tong

larouche and six associates are charged with conspiracy to 
defraud those who loaned the political organization money while 
larouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the internal 
revenue service by failing to pay taxes 
under crossexamination tate admitted he went to a halloween 
party of former larouche staffers in 1986 where he did an imitation 
of larouche giving orders while tate said the leader was under 
the influence of alcohol 
under direct examination from prosecutor john markham tate said 
he quit the larouche organization four years ago because the 
movement had contempt for decent ordinary humanity 
i had witnessed mr larouche lie to the membership again and 
again tate testified i had seen revolting actions 
i had seen members of the organization insulted and 
humiliated he said 
tate said the organization harassed political figures from 
liberals to conservatives and larouche followers assumed false 
identities to gain information on their enemies 
in earlier testimony tate said a 12member security staff played 
maid and butler to larouche catering to every personal need 
during the years larouche declared no taxable income 
according to a federal grand jury larouche conspired to defraud 
the irs by not filing tax returns since 1979 and by failing to 
declare the cost of personal services as income the grand jury also 
charged larouche and six codefendants with conspiring to defraud 
those who loaned the larouche movement money by resolving not to 
pay them back 
tate quoted chief larouche fundraiser william wertz as telling 
staffers there was no such thing as a loan and money given as 
loans should not be repaid barring a political downside or a 
threatened lawsuit tate said those remarks caused him to quit 
larouches organization in 1984 
tate said the security staff had roundtheclock shifts playing 
maid and butler to larouche and his wife helga whether they 
were at their residences in new york city their 40acre estate in 
the horse country of leesburg va hotels or their home of mainz 
west germany 
chores included serving food cleaning walking mrs larouches 
dog caring for her horses maintaining larouches fleet of 
limousines and grocery shopping he said 
tate described wertz as someone whose steeltough discipline 
brought internal dissension among larouche staffers wertz ordered a 
military style daily roll call and exhorted the staff to take the 
beachhead and capture the bridges the witness said 
sometimes tate testified wertz quoted world war ii hero gen 
george patton and played the soundtrack of the movie patton 
starring george c scott 
but tate said that larouche backed wertz all the way credited 
him for the movements fundraising success and told staffers 
wertz reports directly to me 
larouche and his associates are building their defense with two 
cornerstones they insist that they planned to repay the more than 
30 million in loans they received but had to divert their money to 
defend the movement against attacks from the government and news 
media 
and larouche contends he filed no tax returns because he had no 
income 
the codefendants are wertz chief larouche legal adviser edward 
spannaus and four fundraisers michael billington dennis small 
paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein

life to something new overdue and welcome a taxpayers bill of 
rights 
under the bill of rights many taxpayers no longer will be hit 
with additional taxes or penalties if they relied on erroneous

the bill permits the taxpayers to sue the irs for wrongful 
treatment and if succesful to collect damages and reimbursement 
for legal and accounting fees

journalworld lawrence kan on education cheating 
education officials in california have uncovered incidents dating 
to 1985 in which school personnel in 45 public elementary schools 
changed answers on standardized state tests that measure a schools 
progress in reading writing and mathematics 
state officials said the apparent motive was to raise the 
schools overall score which could entitle it to more state funds 
 
we cant be naive enough to believe that california is the only 
state where such finagling has occurred 
how many other areas have had similar situations which have 
encouraged the kind of educational mediocrity leading to a growing 
number of illiterates and illprepared graduates

the chattanooga tenn times on the national rifle association 
vote 
the national rifle association is widely viewed as the original 
unstoppable force in us politics mostly we suppose because it 
has rarely run into an immovable object 
at least not until recently when the maryland electorate 
asserted itself and rejected attempts to repeal a recently enacted 
handgun control law 
polls have consistently shown that a majority of americans 
approve of a form of gun control including registration 
nevertheless the nra has had remarkable success in defeating all 
but bare minimum regulations 
its job has been made easier of course by picking up the votes 
of lawmakers especially those who receive nra campaign 
contributions 
perhaps the outcome in maryland will persuade legislators in 
other states and on capitol hill that a sound common sense law does 
not have to be trashed just because it draws fire from the nra

statesmanjournal salem ore on skinheads and racism 
portland and all of oregon must speak out fervently and 
forcefully against the unprovoked beating death of a young ethiopian 
man recently in portland 
the obvious racial motive behind this brutal murder should shock 
all fairminded people 
witnesses have told police that the killers wore clothing 
resembling the trademark garb of a white racist group known as 
skinheads 
skinheads also have been linked to two other slayings nationwide 
and a multitude of criminal acts against blacks asians jews and 
homosexuals 
these assaults and other racial incidents around the nation are 
occurring in part as a result of the overall racial climate in this 
nation 
our police departments cant control the problem alone 
individual citizens must enlist in this war against racism and 
hatred 
if we allow this insidious virus to spread we all must suffer 
the eventual consequences of these vile assaults on minorities in 
our neighborhoods

ever since election day the stock market has been reading bad 
news on the lips of george bush and prices have jiggled downward 
 
the presidentelect talked flexible freeze and sang dont 
worry be happy to slide past michael dukakis but he never got 
around to explaining just how his economic policy would differ from 
that which he called voodoo eight years ago and which pushed the 
nation to the economic brink 
bush has promised to make deficitreduction a high priority and 
he said he will soon meet with congressional leaders to come up with 
an acceptable package 
optimists suppose that bush and congress soon will come to a 
sudden agreement whereby the new president will offer a selection of 
brutal budget cuts at the exact same time that congressional leaders 
propose general increase in taxes 
realists suppose that neither bush nor congress has the will to 
do any such thing pessimists suppose that the faceoff will 
continue while the economy slides deeper and deeper into the voodoo

the news tribune woodbridge nj on congress attempt to 
regulate commercials during childrens television programming 
congress recently voted to limit commercials on programs 
aimed at children ads most of which promote toys would have 
been limited to 105 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per 
hour during the week 
president reagan basing his decision on the free speech 
provision of the first amendment vetoed the bill congress vowed to 
send a tougher bill to president bush next year 
as much as we appreciate the intent of congress we agree 
with the president 
the ban on cigarette advertising was based on objective 
evidence that even an occasional smoke is a health hazard but the 
notion that a certain amount of toy advertising is better than any 
other amount is subjective and selective and would set an unhealthy 
precedent

one of the onceburning issues of the nowburnedout presidential 
campaign was the need for affordable child care options for working 
mothers 
democratic and republican candidates proposed plans to help the 
women of america return to the workforce after time off to have a 
baby but it appears a comprehensive federal child care act is far 
from reality 
republicans claim democratic proposals are too expensive 
democrats claim republican proposals reach too few 
of course now that the election is over the burning need for 
child care has flamed out on capitol hill with the increasing 
concern over the burgeoning federal deficit nearly everyone in 
washington agrees finding dollars to pay for any type of child care 
program will be difficult 
for 15 million women who stay home because they cannot find 
adequate affordable child care the issue still burns like 1000

los angeles herald examiner on the reaganthatcher meeting 
they were the international odd couple she the brilliant 
workaholic who always seems to know more than any of the 
experts he a friendly avuncular guy who often leads with his 
heart instead of his head 
yet prime minister margaret thatcher and president ronald reagan 
were kindred spirits both fighting the good fight for democracy and 
prosperity 
last week as the visiting prime minister said farewell to the 
president before he leaves office they couldnt seem to compliment 
each other enough 
but all this selfcongratulation and warm talk is distorting 
whats happening around the world 
in the soviet union for example the man who we can do business 
with seems to be less eager to play at democratizing these days and 
more interested in consolidating and fortifying his power likewise 
the warm winds of change in china have turned a bit chilly this 
season 
ron and maggie certainly have had an influence on the world but 
this globe is far too complex a place to believe two westerners 
alone can change the face of it

just recently came news of a twoyear study concluding that 
young americans who do not attend college have a high chance of 
facing deadend jobs with poverty level pay or no jobs at all 
yet according to testimony before a state legislative committee 
welfare officials advised one single parent to quit the university 
of wisconsinparkside where she is a freshman and learn auto 
mechanics 
this rule is completely upside down workfare ought to encourage 
college attendance 
sure officials should monitor attendance closely to make sure 
that welfare recipients are genuinely working toward degrees but 
punishing them for going to college is an inanity begging for a

the mayor has asked the state to review 
the police departments investigation of a landlady accused of 
killing her elderly tenants and burying seven bodies in the yard of 
her victorian boardinghouse 
after finding the first body and interviewing dorothea montalvo 
puente 59 police released her citing a lack of evidence she was 
arrested five days later in los angeles following a search in 
california nevada and mexico 
officers then flew her back to sacramento aboard a plane 
chartered by a tv station which interviewed her en route 
i want to see if any of our policies or procedures need to be 
tightened up mayor anne rudin said tuesday there are obviously 
some gaps especially the two major gaps 
police chief john kearns agreed to the review by the state 
commission on peace officer standards and training 
i think its a positive step not a negative one we are a 
public agency open to scrutiny he said 
meanwhile sacramento county coroner charles simmons said one of 
the seven bodies was that of a woman 50 to 60 years old and was 
the only one found on the grounds of the boardinghouse that 
sustained obvious physical trauma 
it was missing the feet and hands and head simmons said 
we dont know if the mutilation occurred before or after death 
puente who ran the twostory home has been charged with one 
count of murder in the death of alvaro bert montoya a mentally 
handicapped transient and former tenant missing for months from 
puentes home 
prosecutors were considering additional counts said police 
spokesman sgt bob burns she has denied the murder charge 
simmons who announced that his office has completed autopsies on 
the seven bodies said none of the victims matched montoyas 
description 
but some of them were very decomposed he said only one of 
the bodies has been identified and the cause of their deaths is 
unknown 
james beede a toxicologist with the coroners office said 
authorities were hunting for evidence of poison as a cause of death 
but declined to provide specifics 
police believe the victims were tenants of the boardinghouse and 
may have been killed for their social security benefits 
the sole body identified is that of 55yearold benjamin fink 
described by his family as a chronic alcoholic and transient who 
moved into puentes home earlier this year 
according to documents filed in municipal court another boarder 
told police that fink disappeared after he became drunk and 
dorothea told him that she would take him upstairs and make him 
feel better

the number of poor people in the 
european economic community has grown to 44 million or 14 percent 
of its population the eec commission reported wednesday 
the people it considers poor earn less than half the average per 
capita income of the 12 countries in which they live it said in a 
report 
but it warns the figure of 44 million is imprecise since poverty 
is not just a matter of income the commission said it lacks enough 
data about other factors such as housing and education to make a 
fair eecwide comparison 
it attributed the increasing number of poor to growing 
unemployment underemployment and unstable and underpaid work as 
well as the increase in single parent families 
in all the elderly form the largest group among the poor the 
report said 
in the 198589 period the eec contributes a modest 35 million 
to 91 projects in all eec nations aimed at alleviating conditions

renewed violence in western sudan 
apparently by armed chadian bandits has killed more than 133 people 
in one week and burned to the ground 37 villages the staterun 
sudan news agency reported today 
suna said the incidents occurred last week in the wadi saleh area 
of darfur 450 miles west of the capital khartoum 
darfurs governor tigani sysi did not specify what caused the 
violence nor who was involved and only attributed the trouble in 
his region to foreign intervention and the continuation of the 
chad conflict suna said in a report from el fasher darfurs 
regional capital 
sysi was speaking at a rally attended by prime minister sadek 
elmahdi 
sudanese leaders have complained bitterly of the spillover of the 
war between neighboring libya and chad 
the leaders say that soldiers from the two states have sought a 
safe haven from the fighting in sudan and have committed robberies 
while in the country 
armed robbers have killed more than 3000 civilians and at least 
100 policemen in the region since 1984 according to official 
figures 
suna quoted sisy as saying two tribal chiefs were killed in the 
wadi saleh incident which he said was the work of foreign armed 
bandits 
their aim is to occupy rich fertile lands in wadi salem 
this is the first reported incidence of violence in at least 
three months 
until october 2000 followers of acheikh ibn omar a chadian 
rebel leader were believed to be hiding somewhere in sudan 
at the time sysi said there were 32 different bandit gangs in 
western sudan responsible for most of the armed robberies police 
have captured from the foreign outlaws kalashnikov rifles mortars 
and rocketpropelled grenades 
he had said leaders of four gangs were killed and six other 
leaders captured during a crackdown in july he said seven of 1000 
gangsters held in northern darfur prisons were convicted of armed 
robbery and condemned to death 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi officially declared the 
prolonged war with chad ended in may and resumed diplomatic 
relations last month with the chadian government of hissene habre

medical care during pregnancy helps increase the 
birth weights of black babies more than whites and can narrow the 
wide gap between the races in the frequency of dangerously 
undersized infants a study concludes 
the authors of the report suggested paying 100 rewards to every 
pregnant woman regardless of race who seeks prenatal care 
we found that among women who received adequate prenatal 
care their risk of giving birth to low birth weight infants was 
greatly reduced but the reduction was greater in blacks than in 
whites said dr merton bernfield of stanford university 
coauthor of the study 
blacks have twice the risk of whites of weighing less than 5 
pounds at birth and this disparity between the races is increasing 
such small often premature babies are 40 times more likely than 
normalsize infants to die during the first month of life 
the latest study directed by jann l murray a medical student 
at the university of california san francisco was published in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine it tried to determine 
what role prenatal care can play in reducing lowweight births 
the researchers reviewed data on more than 31000 children born 
to largely middleclass mothers who belonged to the 
kaiserpermanente health maintenance organization in california 
even though all the women had access to prenatal care blacks 
used it less extensively than whites they were also twice as likely 
to have lowweight babies 
the researchers calculated that the difference in the use of 
prenatal care accounted for less than 15 percent of the difference 
in the incidence of low birth weight 
however they found that the rates of low birth weight decreased 
as the level of prenatal care rose and increasing levels of care 
were linked with a greater reduction among black infants than among 
whites 
black women who received adequate prenatal care were four times 
less likely than those with inadequate care to have low birth weight 
babies in whites there was a twofold difference between these two 
groups 
the researchers suggested 100 incentives for women who seek care 
during the first trimester of pregnancy such a program would cost 
the kaiser program 4 million annually but they said this could be 
offset by a reduction in the number of lowweight babies whose care 
costs the program 8 million each year

live in nursing homes since medicare began paying flat fees for 
their care a study says 
the report based on the records of one hospital shows that 
hospitalization for hip fractures has been cut by 40 percent since 
the start of the new payment system in 1984 
the findings suggest the overall quality of care for these 
patients may have deteriorated the researchers wrote 
under the new system medicare pays flat fees to hospitals for 
specific illnesses no matter how long patients stay this gives 
hospitals an incentive to treat patients more efficiently however 
critics say it also may pressure them to send patients home before 
they are well 
the new study found that the proportion of hip fracture patients 
remaining in nursing homes one year after their hospitalization rose 
from 9 percent to 33 percent since the start of the new program 
this increase is alarming and represents the most important 
finding of this study wrote dr john f fitzgerald and colleagues 
from indiana university school of medicine 
they said this suggests that since the start of the new payment 
system patients are less likely to recover enough to live on their 
own and instead become longterm residents of nursing homes 
the study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine was based on a review of 331 people treated from 1981 to 
1986 at a large community hospital in the midwest it was not 
identified 
they said that since the start of the new payment system 
hospitalization for hip fractures decreased from 22 days to 13 
days 
the proportion of patients who could walk at all when discharged 
dropped from 56 percent to 40 percent 
the distance patients could walk when discharged fell from 93 
feet to 38 feet 
the proportion discharged directly to nursing homes rose from 38 
percent to 60 percent

this seaside tourist town described 
by george bush as his familys anchor to windward is proud of 
the local boy who made good but concerned about the crowds hell 
attract as president 
there are mixed feelings about it i think its apprehension 
and excitement says town manager jane duncan echoing fears that 
kennebunkports emergence as an internationally recognized dateline 
could worsen the traffic jams that already clog the area during the 
summer 
born in massachusetts and reared in connecticut bush launched 
his business and political careers in texas and moved on to 
washington as congressman and vice president but this picturesque 
town of 4500 along the coast of southern maine is a place his 
family has always regarded as home bush arrived wednesday for a 
fiveday thanksgiving vacation 
they come up here to relax they love the area mrs bush tends 
the flowers and he likes to go out in the boat said robert 
dennis the chairman of the republican town committee and bushs 
neighbor across the road 
except for the period bush spent overseas during world war ii he 
has returned each year since childhood to vacation at the 35 
million family compound at walkers point named for his maternal 
grandfather 
in recent years he has spent about three weeks each summer at 
kennebunkport relaxing on the golf course or tennis court or 
fishing for bluefish and mackerel from his speedboat earning a 
reputation for operating the 28foot craft at breakneck speeds 
it remains to be seen how much time bush will spend over the next 
four years in kennebunkport a republican stronghold which supported 
him over michael dukakis on election day by a vote of 1584 to 580 
bush whose family roots here go back to the turn of the century 
has remained a familiar figure on the local scene attending church 
in town addressing memorial day ceremonies and speaking at the high 
school commencement he and his wife occasionally shop in dock 
square stores or patronize local restaurants 
tourists have been coming to kennebunkport and neighboring towns 
for more than a century drawn by sandy beaches and by the stark 
beauty of the surf pounding against rocks along other stretches of 
the coast 
home to a fleet of fishing draggers and lobster boats 
kennebunkport has experienced its biggest growth during the past 
decade when commercial development and housing subdivisions kicked 
off a real estate boom that sent prices soaring 
this year bushs presence is proclaimed on some of the 
bestselling tshirts being sold in downtown shops 
one shirt emblazoned with head to the beaches of bush and 
kennebunkport features a caricature of bush wearing sunglasses 
and a tanktop swim suit as he lounges on a beach chair wit a drink 
in his hand 
i think it was probably our most popular design said john 
fay whose atlantic screen print co is putting out a winter version 
that shows bush on crosscountry skis 
as vice president bush has sought to minimize any disruptions 
caused by his presence while townspeople have respected his privacy 
i dont want to inconvenience our neighbors i dont want to do 
anything to change the charm of this place that has been our anchor 
to windward for so many years bush told reporters in 
kennebunkport earlier this year 
when asked whether security considerations may prompt secret 
service agents to drive lobster fishermen from the horseshoeshaped 
cove outside the compound bush said he would stay away from his 
beloved retreat before he would allow such a restriction 
opinions vary on the impact of bushs future presence on the 
town whose most famous residents up to now include novelists 
kenneth roberts known for his historical sagas and booth 
tarkington creator of the penrod series 
tom haydock like many other merchants sees little change in the 
offing saying that dock square is so overrun with tourists there is 
no way traffic snarls and parking problems could get much worse 
i think its great that a hometown boy is going to become 
president we still think of george as a local boy said haydock 
proprietor of a handicrafts shop 
attracting more tourists during the spring and fall would be 
applauded by operators of the upscale clothing and jewelry shops 
that fan out from the downtown section 
however town clerk charles gould says merchants have promoted 
the town beyond its capacity to handle it besides the likelihood 
of additional tourist traffic he talks of having to line up 
accommodations for a sizable white house staff and press corps 
susan savell executive director of the local chamber of 
commerce says shes confident the town can handle the additional 
traffic but must adopt creative solutions that could include 
shuttle buses or a trolley system

youre never too old to quit smoking say 
researchers who found that even people in their 70s significantly 
reduce their risk of heart attack and death when they kick the habit 
their study disputes the notion that old people have already 
suffered too much damage from smoking to benefit from quitting 
they found that over six years the death rate of older folks who 
continued to smoke was 70 percent higher than that of people who had 
recently quit 
the study was based on people who already had clogged heart 
arteries a condition that affects an estimated 39 million 
americans over age 54 other research is under way to see if older 
people with healthy hearts also live longer if they stop smoking 
the message is that its never too late to quit said bonnie 
hermanson older people with heart disease have just as much 
benefit from quitting as younger people do 
the study conducted by hermanson and colleagues from the 
university of washington and the mayo clinic was published in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine it was based on men and 
women over age 54 who took part in the coronary artery surgery 
study or cass a major review of coronary bypass surgery 
cigarette smoking is considered to be the chief avoidable cause 
of death in the united states according to the national centers for 
disease control smoking was responsible for 320515 deaths in 1984 
about onethird of them were smokingrelated fatal heart attacks 
strokes and cardiac arrest 
there is some feeling that its too late for older people to 
quit because they have had too much damage over the years said 
hermanson however there is very little data dealing with elderly 
people most smoking studies are done on those who are middle aged 
or younger 
dr john h holbrook of the university of utah said the new study 
shows the advantage of quitting in people whose heart disease has 
been carefully documented 
no matter how old you are no matter how long youve smoked 
theres a benefit to quitting he said and as far as heart 
attack is concerned the benefits begin to accrue within a few 
months 
the risk of lung cancer another major hazard of smoking also 
drops when people stop smoking although the reduction is not as 
fast as the fall in heart attacks 
the latest study was based on a comparison of 807 people who had 
quit smoking within the previous year and 1086 people who continued 
to smoke during six years of followup 210 of the quitters and 391 
of the continuing smokers died 
the differences cannot be blamed on more severe heart disease 
among those who continued to smoke in fact the quitters were 
actually sicker than the smokers the researchers said 
dr bernard j gersh a coauthor of the study at the mayo 
clinic said the lower death rate among the quitters resulted 
largely from fewer heart attacks 
among the studys conclusions 
after the researchers adjusted their findings for severity of 
heart disease those who continued to smoke had a 70 percent higher 
risk of death 
thirtyeight percent of the smokers died during the sixyear 
period compared with 28 percent of the quitters 
among those over age 70 50 percent of the quitters died during 
the followup compared with 68 percent of the smokers 
the greatest difference in survival was among those with 
moderate degrees of heart disease 
the benefits of quitting were similar for men and for women 
the advantages of giving up smoking that were seen in older 
people were virtually the same as those in middleage people 
on the basis of these results the researchers wrote we 
believe that it is worthwhile for physicians to encourage their 
elderly patients with coronary artery disease to quit smoking as 
strongly as they do their younger patients

charles e kelly wrote in a may 19 1986 memo that this 
inspector performed an onsite inspection that day but has since 
admitted he did not visit the site said richard winters allegheny 
county assistant police superintendent 
kellys office was responsible for inspecting the tank at 
ashlands floreffe terminal that collapsed south of pittsburgh on 
jan 2 spilling more than 700000 gallons of fuel into the

leo and his ailing partner nemo two performing 
dolphins that spent a year in a hotel swimming pool in cairo were 
spirited to sanctuary in france early wednesday slipping through a 
legal net 
the dolphins were whisked out of egypt on a special predawn 
flight and convalescing in a pool at marineland cote dazur in 
antibes pending the outcome of a legal decision 
theyre in very very good spirits theyre eating extremely 
well eating high quality herring said dr david taylor a 
veterinarian who accompanied them on the flight out and if all 
goes well i expect each of them to be plump and have double chins 
by christmas 
nemo is suffering from pneumonia liver trouble and skin 
problems taylor said in a telephone interview he has scars under 
his arm pits or flippers from improper transport in the past 
taylor added 
both animals had grown lethargic after a year of swimming in 
circles in the pool of cairos meridien hotel 
the dolphins were brought to the meridien a year ago to perform 
in the main pool for guests during the winter season but then they 
became stranded 
the hotel said it could not continue to house the dolphins but 
their owner the international dolphin show co headed by bruno 
lienhardt of switzerland has said it had nowhere to take them 
meridien hotel general manager edouard speck has said the hotel 
is taking the dolphins owners to court to decide their fate and a 
hearing was scheduled for sunday in cairo 
speck said wednesday that four days ago the hotel obtained 
permission from the agriculture ministry for the dolphins to leave 
on wednesday the hotel was informed of a court injunction 
canceling the departure order but meanwhile they were already out 
of the country speck said 
while the hotel says its dolphin contract expired may 31 
lienhardt claims the deal runs through may 1989 he said the 
meridien told him in april to get rid of the dolphins so the pool 
would be free for summer guests 
i traveled everywhere to find a suitable pool for the 
dolphins lienhardt said from cairo i couldnt find anything in 
one month 
taylor said travel plans for the dolphins on air france were 
changed when he learned of the injunction 
we decided we would have to dissemble taylor said we 
busily found another small excellent airliner in egypt 
the dolphins were put aboard a boeing 707 of the egyptian airline 
zas at 5 am two ambulances met the plane in nice and transported 
the animals to nearby antibes 
it was a very smooth fast operation taylor said 
lienhardt arrived at the meridien tuesday night and started 
making a lot of noise and shouting about us kidnapping his 
dolphins speck said 
he doubted the egyptian government would try to bring the 
dolphins back 
its a fait accompli and the government knows there is no good 
pool for them here speck said 
what counts at the bottom of the pile is the animals welfare 
said taylor who is a specialist on exotic animals with the 
international zoo veterinary group based in lightwater outside 
london 
he foresaw a gloomy fate for the dolphins had they not made the 
predawn getaway 
while lawyers argued the animals would have continued to stay 
in a place of great risk he said 
leo born in 1979 and nemo born in 1980 were trained as 
performing dolphins lienhardts company also brought two seals 
neptune and luca to the meridien a year ago luca died from 
neglect according to speck and three months ago the hotel got 
court approval to transfer neptune to the cairo zoo 
when the dolphins are fit i may well say for the first time 
in eight years let them have the experience of females taylor 
said that would be part of their psychological redevelopment

orders to us factories for durable goods 
excluding military equipment slipped in october for the second 
consecutive month the government said wednesday but economists 
werent unduly concerned about the weakness 
the commerce department said total orders including the biggest 
gain in military goods since june rose 24 percent last month to a 
seasonally adjusted 1221 billion 
however excluding the defense category which swings widely from 
month to month orders fell 02 percent in october and 25 percent 
in september 
nevertheless economists werent overly worried pointing to the 
steady increase in the backlog of unfilled orders which rose 08 
percent to 4357 billion in october after increasing 03 percent in 
september and 12 percent in august 
the backlogs will keep the manufacturing sector humming 
well into next year said cynthia latta an economist with data 
resources inc a forecasting firm in lexington mass the idea 
that growth is slowing is correct but it certainly doesnt 
portend a recession 
other economic indicators including employment retail sales 
consumer prices and industrial production portray a robust if 
somewhat inflationary economy in october 
the report on orders for durable goods big ticket items 
ranging from bicycles to battleships is the first hint of softness 
from the point of view of those worried that the economy is 
overheating its a favorable development ms latta said 
the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business expansion plans also fell for the second month it was 
down 26 percent last month to 340 billion following a 102 
percent drop in september the largest since january 1986 
capital spending has been one of the strongest sectors of the 
economy this year because manufacturers spent heavily to increase 
production for booming export markets 
you can see some of the edge coming off the fast rates of 
growth in capital spending but it still remains healthy said 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers he said manufacturers in his organization expect 
reasonably good business through the first half of 1989 
the 24 percent increase in october orders followed a decline of 
29 percent in september and a rise of 52 percent in august 
defense orders totaled 104 billion up 411 percent from 
september the department attributed much of the gain to orders for 
new ships 
transportation equipment boosted by gains at auto plants as well 
as shipbuilding rose 89 percent in october to 344 billion 
almost rebounding from a 91 percent drop in september 
excluding transportation orders rose a scant 01 percent in 
october and fell 04 percent in september 
in other categories last month orders for primary metals 
including steel fell 06 percent following a 59 percent rise 
orders in the machinery category that includes computers fell 36 
percent electrical machinery was up 18 percent 
shipments of durable goods rose 05 percent last month to 1187 
billion following a 02 percent rise in september

owen was convicted in barcelona last april of carrying four 
pounds of cocaine from chile into spain beneath the false bottom of 
a suitcase he was on a freelance photo assignment for a travel

the drugs were there and the man who arranged the assignment jorge 
barahona of washington later admitted in a us court that he had 
planted the drugs in the suitcase without owens knowledge 
thenattorney general edwin meese presented barahonas confession to 
spanish authorities as well as other evidence he said established 
owens innocence but to no avail 
after spending 19 months in a spanish jail owen was transferred 
to a loretto pa prison nov 8 under terms of a treaty that

united nations draft convention on the rights of the child 
museveni also said he had suggested the national aids control 
committee introduce legislation to protect anyone under the age of 
21 from contracting the disease through sex abuse by adults 
we should make it a severely punishable crime for any adult to 
seduce into illegitimate sexual activities anyoby below 21 
museveni said according to the new vision 
he said minors also should not engage in illegitimate sexual 
relationships 
if they want sex they should get married museveni said

the body of greek heiress 
christina onassis was put on a flight to greece today after a judge 
ruled that an exhumation would not be necessary to determine the 
cause of death the judges aides said 
federal judge alberto piotti authorized release of the body about 
2 pm as a group of ms onassis family and friends waited with the 
casket at ezeiza international airport 
aides to piotti said authorization was granted because forensic 
experts said autopsy evidence was sufficient to determine the cause 
of death 
ms onassis housekeeper heleni syros was required to stay 
behind to help in the investigation of the death ms syros 
apparently was the first to discover ms onassis body saturday 
the private news agency diarios y noticias said judges gave final 
authorization after interior minister enrique nosiglia said delaying 
the process might cause diplomatic problems 
ms onassis body was put on a swissair jet to be flown to 
switzerland and then greece for burial on the island of skorpios in 
the ionian sea 
a preliminary coroners report said the cause of death was acute 
pulmonary edema or buildup of fluid in her lungs it did not say 
what caused the accumulation of fluid 
the director of clinica del sol hospital which initially 
received the body said ms onassis 37 apparently suffered a heart 
attack but forensic experts and police investigators have worked 
since an autopsy was conducted last saturday afternoon to determine 
the exact cause 
the complete coroners report is expected in about two weeks the 
newspaper la nacion reported this morning it is expected to clear 
up details such as precisely where ms onassis died and at what 
time uncertainties that raised questions about whether she died of 
natural causes 
on tuesday federal judge albert piotti said he would allow the 
release of the body before final results were in hand if medical 
examiners told him they had enough material to establish the cause 
of death 
we dont intend to impose bureaucratic obstacles to the 
delivery of the body to relatives but beforehand we must rule out

the american farm bureau federation says it 
fears federal agents are waiting with bated breath to corral 
farmers who hire undocumented aliens when immigration sanctions 
against employers take effect dec 1 
but a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service 
says those worries are unfounded and that the agency will be 
evenhanded in enforcing the employer sanctions against farmers 
nevertheless a labor specialist at the us department of 
agriculture acknowledged that some farmers are afraid of an ins 
crackdown 
most employers including farmers of nonperishable crops dairy 
farmers and cattlemen have been barred from hiring undocumented 
workers since june 1987 and have been subject to fines on the first 
offense since this past june but perishablecrop farmers won a 
reprieve from full sanctions until dec 1 under the 1986 immigration 
reform and control act 
on the eve of the sanctions officials of the american farm 
bureau the nations largest farm organization say they believe the 
decks are now clear for the ins to target agriculture they also 
complain the law is tightening up the farm labor market which could 
lead to shortages come next years harvests 
any farmer starting dec 1 who knowingly hires an undocumented 
worker ought to have his head examined because hes more than likely 
to get caught said chuck fields an assistant director of 
national affairs for the american farm bureau 
the ins is waiting with bated breath to get some farmers 
theyre waiting in line to pounce on the farmers and were warning 
farmers that they should not take the risk of employing anyone 
illegally fields said 
fields said the ins fought giving farmers the extra time but 
we beat their hides on that and they never liked that 
texas farm bureau spokesman vernie glasson said the ins with its 
ranks boosted by the legislation is obligated to carry out the law 
and i fully expect theyll carry it out to their fullest 
ins spokesman verne jervis said the agency has no reason to treat 
farmers any differently than other businesses and our approach to 
employer sanctions is a very reasonable one were not interested in 
collecting fines were interested in compliance 
al french labor specialist at the us department of 
agriculture said emotions among farmers range from fear to 
complacency some he said believe it will be impossible to enforce 
the regulations 
we can expect constant steady enforcement activity on the part 
of the ins french said 
french said it is too early to tell whether farmers will face 
labor shortages because of the law which included a provision that 
allowed aliens who had worked in perisable us agriculture to seek 
amnesty through nov 30 under the special agricultural worker saw 
program the ins said more than 1 million aliens have sought 
amnesty but it is unknown how many will continue to work in the 
fields and how many will seek other jobs 
french said early indicators of whether there will be shortages 
will come during december vegetable harvests in southern california 
and florida 
fields said his organization expects to see more and more 
shortages developing in more and more places americans wont do 
this work they just wont do it its seasonal and theres no 
future in these jobs 
glasson said there could be crucial labor shortages for the dairy 
industry in northeast texas and spot shortages in livestock 
statewide

president pw botha today 
commuted the death sentences of the sharpeville six the justice 
ministry said the sentences for the group of blacks had provoked 
worldwide protests 
the sharpeville six five men and a women will serve prison 
terms ranging from 18 to 25 years the ministry said 
botha also commuted the death sentences of four white policemen 
and three black men all of whom had been sentenced to hang for 
murder they were given prison terms ranging from 15 to 25 years 
two of the policemen were convicted of killing a township youth 
in the eastern cape province after severely beating him the other 
two were convicted of carrying out hired killings of two suspected 
drug dealers in the soweto township outside johannesburg 
the presidents decision on the sharpeville six came hours after 
the appeal court in bloemfontein the nations highest court 
unanimously rejected an appeal to reopen the trial of the 
sharpeville six 
the justice ministry gave no reason for bothas decision and 
jack viviers a spokesman for botha refused comment 
botha previously had turned down a clemency request but said he 
would reconsider the matter as a human being once the judicial 
process was completed 
the sharpeville six were convicted of murder in connection with 
the september 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor in 
sharpeville a township south of johannesburg 
no evidence was presented that the six contributed physically to 
the death of the councilor kuzwayo dlamini instead they were 
convicted under the doctrine of common purpose which held them 
responsible because they allegedly were active participants in the 
mob that killed dlamini in riots caused by a rent increase 
antiapartheid groups in south africa international human rights 
organizations and numerous foreign governments have urged botha to 
grant clemency 
appeals for clemency for the six have come from among others 
the united states canada japan britain and most other european 
countries and the united nations virtually all prominent 
antiapartheid and liberal leaders in south africa have urged 
clemency including archbishop desmond tutu 
before the reprieve was announced prakash diar lawyer for the 
six the appeal court decision was a bit disappointing but not 
unexpected he said a clemency petition would be submitted to botha 
within a few weeks 
defense lawyers had asked that the trial be reopened to hear 
evidence from a state witness who said police coerced him into 
giving false testimony against two defendants 
in todays unanimous ruling a fivejudge panel of the appeal 
court rejected the application the panel said the trial judge 
willem human acted properly and at no time was presented with an 
affidavit by the witness asserting that he had given false evidence 
shortly before the appeal court heard oral arguments in 
september botha told a television interviewer i cannot interfere 
with the judicial system in south africa unless it is completed and 
only when it is completed will i as a human being deal with this 
matter on merit 
some of bothas critics have accused him of hypocrisy noting 
that he ordered a halt to prosecution of south african soldiers 
about to go on trial for murder in southwest africa also known as 
namibia 
the sharpeville six are francis mokgesi 31 reid mokoena 24 
oupa moses diniso 32 duma joshua khumlao 28 reginald sefatsa 
32 and theresa ramashamola 27 
violence against black officials who cooperate with the whiteled 
governments segregated political structures is considered by many 
blacks to be a consequence of apartheid 
the sharpeville six were convicted of murder in 1985 and have 
spent 1076 days on death row 
the riots in sharpeville and neighboring townships in september 
1984 marked the start of more than two years of nationwide black 
unrest 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

political foes of former president chun 
doohwan said wednesday they want a full investigation of his time 
in office not just his insufficient apology for corruption and 
abuse of power 
radical students held campus and street protests after chuns 
televised apology from his home wednesday morning about 50 tried to 
rush the house armed with firebombs an steel rods 
the 56yearold former general who seized power in 1980 and left 
office in february said he would surrender 24 million and go into 
rural exile a traditional form of penance for korean leaders 
opposition leader kim daejung said he felt chun was personally 
sincere in the apology but it fell short of public expectations 
he and others said it was not enough 
on television chun said in a grim voice my dear people i am 
really sorry i have to bear full responsibility for the past seven 
years which is branded by the people as an era of authoritarianism 
and misdeeds although i tried to do my best in my way 
looking tired and strained he apologized for corruption and and 
other scandals and offered to surrender his personal property 
including a 14 million house two golf club memberships and 33 
million in cash chun also said he would return the equivalent of 
about 20 million in political funds 
he and his wife lee soonja left their home after the speech 
for rural exile 
they spent the first day at a remote buddhist temple in eastern 
south korea news reports said the couple would stay in a nearby 
village for a time but would have to move periodically because of 
threats by radical groups to punish chun 
government sources not identified were quoted in newspaper 
reports as saying president roh taewoo was expected to issue a 
statement soon asking the nation to forgive his predecessor they 
also were quoted as saying roh wanted to meet with opposition 
leaders 
kim daejung said the national assembly should appoint a special 
prosecutor to investigate allegations about chun his family and 
associates kim is president of the party for peace and democracy 
the main political opposition 
he said chun should appear before investigating committees and 
make public in a manner convincing to the people how he acquired 
and spent political funds which kim said amounted to billions of 
dollars 
another opposition leader kim youngsam joined the call for a 
special prosecutor the truth must be clearly disclosed regardless 
of such an apology he said 
contrasting views of chuns apology came from a young woman who 
is an office clerk and an elderly one working as a street vendor 
he looked pitiful and we may forgive him said kim unknyong 
26 i think we have done enough and it is good for the nation to 
close the case now 
the peddler said i hate him i dont trust whatever he says 
the figure he is talking about is something astronomical which 
we can only dream of 
some of the 5000 police ringing the neighborhood of chuns home 
drove the attacking students away the chuns already had left 
about 200 students at seoul national university fought riot 
police for an hour with firebombs and rocks demanding the former 
president be arrested on corruption and othe charges 
peaceful street marches were reported in kwangju and taejon 
chun asked for forgiveness in his television speech but said he 
would accept the peoples judgment he asked to be allowed to remain 
in south korea 
i deeply repent my sins he said im ready to face any 
sufferings and will not shirk responsibility for the results of my 
deeds 
he denied sending money out of the country 
i dont have a piece of land or a penny abroad chun 
declared if i have any undeclared wealth abroad i will take any 
punishment 
the former president has denied personal corruption but some of 
his relatives and associates have been convicted of or charged with 
embezzlement and other crimes 
he apologized for the dismissal of government officials and 
journalists when he seized power the deaths of opposition 
supporters sent to internment camps and the corruption of people 
associated with him 
chun made a special apology for the bloody suppression of a 1980 
uprising in the southern city of kwangju about 200 people were 
killed and more than 800 injured by official count but other 
estimates put the casualties much higher

the thanksgiving turkey served at the 
albert sonneman ranch this year first served as a living insecticide 
arta sonneman said her family began raising turkeys four or five 
years ago when grasshoppers were a major problem the turkeys did 
such a good job removing the grasshoppers from the family garden 
that fewer turkeys were bought this year because theyve eliminated 
most of the grasshoppers 
thats really why we started raising them she said 
last year she said her husband albert counted 115

border residents who celebrated 
halloween instead of day of the dead are putting turkey on the table 
thursday in another example of what some mexicans call cultural 
penetration from the north 
and next month santa claus and his reindeer virtually unknown 
two decades ago in mexico will be seen in the most remote villages 
the infiltration of the american traditions has raised the ire of 
some residents who fear their own culture is eroding 
last weekend a college student stood on a platform in a park 
with a bullhorn exhorting crowds to fight cultural penetration 
why do we celebrate halloween instead of day of the dead why 
do we allow ourselves to be shaped this way by the north 
americans he shouted to some murmurs of approval from the crowd 
we are abandoning our own traditions 
juarez mayor jaime bermudez said american and mexican traditions 
intermingle theres a lot of american influence here and the 
other way around the only thing that separates us is a river 
mexican traditions will be kept intact were not going to lose 
them and what about the tacos they eat over in el paso and the 
enchiladas 
even as families stock up on turkey and stuffing theyre not 
honoring the pilgrims bermudez said 
plenty of them buy turkey because its very cheap this time of 
year its not that theyre celebrating the holiday they might not 
even know its significance 
that apparently is true in a story about possible turkey 
shortages the leading newspaper in juarez el diario explained 
thanksgiving with a new twist 
eating turkey on this day is a us tradition that goes back 
centuries to when a large group of immigrant families were on the 
point of starving to death miraculously they found a flock of 
these birds which saved their lives

a transport union leader and five 
others were arrested wednesday on the third day of a drivers strike 
that has disrupted one of the countrys main forms of land 
transportation police said 
the drivers of jeepneys privately owned passenger vehicles 
operated through government franchises are demanding lower prices 
for spare parts and the suspension of a stateordered reduction in 
fares 
president corazon aquino on tuesday rejected their demands and 
instructed police to make sure that jeepney drivers who want to 
ply their usual routes are not prevented from doing so and to 
protect the passengers 
police said an undetermined number of drivers stayed off the job 
in the capital wednesday although more came to work than on monday 
when the strike stranded thousands of commuters in manila 
on monday service on about 80 percent of the 445 passenger jeep 
routes in the capital was disrupted by the strike 
on wednesday reporters said there were fewer jeeps than normal 
operating in manilas central districts of santa mesa and quiapo 
but no serious delays for commuters 
reporters in cebu the countrys second major metropolitan area 
about 350 miles southeast of manila said jeep drivers were on 
strike on several routes in the northern part of the city 
schools in manila were closed wednesday because of the strike 
police said deogracias espiritu secretarygeneral of a drivers 
association known as piston was arrested before dawn wednesday he 
was charged with inciting sedition by leading strikers who made 
inflammatory remarks in public such as calls to fight the 
government to the last 
in manilas cubao district strikers urged jeep drivers to join 
the walkout police reported some jeeps that did not join were 
stoned 
five striking workers were arrested on charges of harassing 
fellow drivers police added 
strikers said 14 other strikers were arrested in manilas 
northern suburbs of caloocan city and navotas police in the two 
suburbs said they had not received any reports of the arrests 
union members told reporters wednesday that their leaders would 
meet later at an undisclosed location to decide whether to continue 
the strike 
strikes are not illegal in the philippines but police say those 
arrested were harassing nonstriking drivers and commuters 
a presidential decree last week forced the minimum fare to drop 
to about 3 cents for a 2mile ride down from the previous official 
rate of about 4 cents the drivers had in fact been charging about 5 
cents 
piston is affiliated with the may first movement a leftist labor 
confederation the military claims is infiltrated by communists the 
group denies the allegation

heavily taxed swedes will keep more of 
their paychecks under the first major tax reform since the welfare 
state was created 50 years ago the finance minister said wednesday 
the package planned for legislation in 1990 would simplify 
income tax and close loopholes that have been exploited by the rich 
at the expense of the worker said the minister kjellolof feldt 
the program calls for sharp reductions in income tax which is 72 
percent on the highest tax brackets and some overtime payments but 
it foresees higher revenues from tax on earnings from investments 
and profits by limiting deductions 
feldt portrayed the reform as a return to the longheld goal of 
leveling incomes and redistributing wealth more equally he said the 
tax system had become cumbersome and distorted by a quiltwork of 
revisions which shrewd taxpayers had learned to manipulate 
even though sweden has higher taxes than most other countries 
a lot of people call sweden a tax paradise because it is so easy to 
evade taxes he said 
it was the largest tax overhaul since the social democrats came 
to power in 1932 governing all but six years since then 
the reason the system has begun to rot is that its been in 
existence for too long it worked well in the beginning feldt 
said 
but a new world with new institutions new markets and a new 
moral when it comes to paying taxes had outdated it 
the plan was applauded by labor and won cautious approval from 
business as the stock market eased upward by 06 percent 
something has to be done the taxation of capital today is a 
joke said stig malm swedish trade union confederation chief 
stock analyst tommy cunzelius of nordbanken bank told the 
associated press the proposal was welcomed for providing a very 
strict and easy tax base that you can count on 
prime minister ingvar carlsson said the reform would safeguard 
welfare programs that have eliminated poverty and illiteracy in 
sweden 
feldt said incomes under 26600 would be taxed at an average 30 
percent higher incomes would be taxed progressively from 45 
percent to a maximum of 60 percent 
today an average wage earner grosses about 20000 and gets to 
keep about half of it 
the smorgasbord of tax rates on capital gains and investment 
profits will be abolished and all income will be taxed at a uniform 
rate regardless of its source feldt said 
corporate taxes also will be reduced from 52 percent to about 30 
percent that will mean it will become more profitable to invest 
and less profitable to try find loopholes feldt said 
the reform was to stop widespread tax planning in which highly 
paid accountants worked out loans and investments that their clients 
use as tax writeoffs 
tax planning was starkly illustrated in the case of a swedish 
real estate dealer who spent 14 million for two paintings in new 
york last month a swedish newspaper said the dealer had reported to 
the tax authorities that he had zero income for the two previous 
years

talk of a hightech radar system that 
snaps a picture of the license plates of speeding cars and then 
allows connecticut police to send tickets in the mail is just that 
talk say police 
rumors that state police were using the devices in 18 locations 
around the state prompted a waterburybased insurance agency to send 
out hundreds of letters to its clients last month warning them to 
slow down 
its absolutely not true said sgt robert slattery a state 
police spokesman if we had that we would publicize it we dont 
sneak up on the public with something like that 
slattery said that although such a device is used in other states 
and in germany it could not be used in connecticut 
the way the law was written the owners arent responsible for 
speeding like they are for evading responsibility slattery said 
however richard bozzuto of bsd insurance in waterbury a former 
state senator said he heard from a very good source that the 
radar devices were going to be set up at 18 locations on state roads 
on oct 6 bozzuto sent 400 to 500 letters to clients warning 
them that the devices will operate 24 hours at day take a 
photograph of your car and send the infraction notice directly to 
your home via us mail 
we sent it to clients to warn them insurance rates are 
certainly dependent on driving records bozzuto said the more 
violations and convictions the higher the rates are 
joseph santaniello a state department of transportation traffic 
engineer said the department does have monitoring devices in 25 
places across the state the department compiles the data for 
federal funding programs under which the average speed for 50 
percent of the vehicles must be 55 mph or less 
santantiello said the devices are not used as law enforcement 
tools

the rightwing rivals of her populist pakistan peoples party to 
subvert the will of the people 
selecting any other party to form a government would be highly 
dangerous and plunge pakistan into a deep crisis she said 
after a twohour meeting tuesday with president ghulam ishaq 
khan she quoted him as saying he would make his choice after the 
national assembly chooses a speaker dec 5 indicating which party 
had the most support 
at the news conference wednesday ms bhutto declared that even 
a single day is too long to wait she claims to have enough 
support in smaller parties to form a majority coalition but has 
offered no evidence of such alliances 
as soon as were called upon to form the government we will 
present proof of our majority said ms bhutto who would be the 
first woman to lead an islamic nation 
she accused the alliance of coercion blackmail and misuse of 
public funds and claimed the purpose of ishaq khans delay is 
simply to give them a longer time to use official money to 
subvert the will of the people 
alliance leader nawaz sharif was chosen by zia to lead a 
provincial caretaker government in populous punjab gen zia 
dismissed his civilian national government may 29 and established 
caretaker administrations at the federal and provincial levels until 
the election could be held 
zia overthrew ms bhuttos father prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto in 1977 and bhutto was hanged in 1979 after being convicted 
of complicity in a murder conspiracy zia was killed in a plane 
crash aug 17 
sharif also met with ishaq khan on tuesday and insisted he still 
has a chance to form a coalition government his alliance would need 
64 seats from smaller parties but ms bhutto could achieve a 
majority with only 26 
ishaq khan was reported to have held meetings wednesday with 
leaders of smaller parties including the ethnic mohajir qami 
movement which represents moslem refugees from india and won 13 
seats both ms bhutto and sharif have been courting the party

its business as usual in state prison systems as thousands of 
inmates around the nation go home for thanksgiving only a few 
states have no furlough provisions and several are expanding or 
adopting such programs 
its normal business john perry spokesman for vermonts 
department of corrections said of prison furloughs in its inmate 
population of 840 about 75 will go home for thanksgiving 
up to 1000 inmates in north carolina 500 in alabama 500 in new 
york and 300 in oregon are set to spend thanksgiving outside prison 
walls 
the numbers are smaller in other systems but the trend is toward 
release despite the presidentialcampaign controversy stirred by 
presidentelect george bush and last week the canceling of 
thanksgiving furloughs for 21 maryland inmates because of adverse 
publicity 
while some officials concede inmates can abuse such programs 
many insist furloughs are an effective way to relieve prison 
overcrowding and prepare inmates for life outside prison most 
states allow only minimumsecurity prisoners to leave on furlough 
and many exclude convicted sex offenders 
during the presidential campaign bush repeatedly attacked his 
democratic opponent massachusetts gov michael dukakis over his 
states furlough program the bush campaign often cited the case of 
convicted murderer willie horton who raped a woman in maryland 
while on a weekend furlough the massachusetts program was changed 
in april to make firstdegree murderers serving life sentences 
ineligible for furloughs 
furloughs have proven to be productive on a national scale 
said tom powers who became warden of the north dakota state 
penitentiary in september he is allowing 15 prisoners to go home 
for thanksgiving in a new program he calls extremely 
conservative 
the kansas department of correction is developing regulations for 
furloughs under a law passed this year 
in the few states that have no such programs including nevada 
california illinois and michigan prisoners generally are not 
allowed out even for family funerals unless they are in handcuffs or 
leg irons 
we have no furlough program for anybody to go out overnight 
what we have is emergency releases with inmates in restraints for 
funerals to go to a relatives deathbed or something like that and 
thats it said nevada prison director george sumner 
leo lalonde a spokesman for the michigan department of 
corrections said his state has a similar policy we dont have 
anything for thanksgiving or even christmas although we do have the 
highest rate of suicide around christmas 
two states that grant furloughs missouri and arkansas shy away 
from holidays 
we feel like it puts the inmate in a situation where there is 
more temptation said david white arkansas correction department 
spokesman 
when the whole society is partying its awful hard not to 
party yourself said dale riley a spokesman for the missouri 
department of corrections and human resources which quit holiday 
furloughs three years ago after three prisoners were arrested one 
weekend for assault and disorderly conduct we just felt it was 
best not to have them out 
in north carolina prisoners can go home for up to 48 hours in 
the custody of a relative or can get a day off under a community 
volunteer program in the custody of someone such as a minister 
david guth a spokesman for the north carolina department of 
correction said he had no figures for thanksgiving day but on nov 
20 for example 1368 prisoners were on home or community release 
out of a prison population of 17916 rapists and murders are not 
automatically excluded he said but only those in minimumsecurity 
facilities are eligible for furlough 
do we furlough people that are in for murder yes said james 
flateau spokesman for the department of correctional services in 
new york where 8177 inmates got furloughs last year probably a 
dozen people convicted of murder are furloughed each year 
in alabama passes are granted based on the trustworthiness of 
the inmate said debbie herbert a spokeswoman for the department 
of corrections 
the furlough program in louisiana however has been suspended 
for study because a trusty working in the governors mansion has 
been accused of murder while on a weekend pass in august 
in maine with a prison population of 577 there are 20 inmates 
going home for thanksgiving 
in the 20 years the program has been in effect one inmate ran a 
roadblock and killed a policeman and another inmate committed a 
crime said warden martin magnusson of the maine state prison 
if you have 2000 successes and you have one that isnt a 
success thats the one you hear about magnusson said 
marylands patuxent institution a rehabilitative 
maximumsecurity prison canceled thanksgiving furloughs this week 
for 21 inmates after criticism of furloughs granted to convicted 
triplemurderer robert daly angell 
the inmates really protect the program said ed ligtenberg 
associate warden at the south dakota penitentiary where 18 
minimumsecurity inmates are going home for thanksgiving its 
good for the inmates because it gradually reintegrates them to the 
outside

iraq and iran will free 150 disabled 
prisoners of war thursday the first batch of prisoners they agreed 
to repatriate early this month 
diplomatic sources said the exchange was delayed by prisoners on 
both sides balking at going back to their respective countries 
red cross officials said a dc9 plane will fly from tehran 
carrying 110 iraqi pows it will fly back to tehran with 41 iranian 
pows 
the plane hired by the red cross will shuttle between tehran and 
baghdad for 10 days to repatriate up to 1115 iraqis and 411 
iranians all sick or wounded according to a memorandum of 
understanding signed by both iraq and iran with the red cross 
red cross representative paul henri morard told the associated 
press that all preparations for the exchange have been completed 
iraq has set up special camps to process the arriving prisoners 
before they go home 
morard who arrived from geneva to supervise the operation said 
the red cross finished its medical checks and had identified all the 
pows who will be repatriated 
he also said that the red cross has asked each pow if he wishes 
to be repatriated or not in line with the geneva conventions on the 
treatment of pows morard refused to say whether any declined 
repatriation saying those prisoners will be processed last 
but the diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said some prisoners have asked to leave for an unidentified western 
country also some of the iranian prisoners want to join the 
mujahedeen khalq the iraqbased opposition group that seeks to 
overthrow the government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the sources 
said 
morard said the red cross has already registered 50182 iraqi 
pows and 19284 iranians but the total number of pows estimated by 
both countries is about 100000 
he said the red cross has repatriated 765 iraqi sick and wounded 
pows and 613 iranians since 1981 
the red cross official said the dc9 will fly the shortest route 
between tehran and baghdad despite the aug 20 gulf war ceasefire 
many planes avoided flying directly over the joint border 
the operation will be supervised by 17 members of the red cross 
staff in baghdad and 18 in tehran it is being paid for by an 
unidentified western nation

congress has enacted a new tax deduction with 
no place on the tax return to claim it 
the change affects workers who continue to receive regular 
paychecks while serving as jurors and turn their jury pay over to 
their employers 
the jury pay still must be reported as taxable income but before 
the 1986 tax overhaul a person who itemized deductions could simply 
deduct the surrendered jury pay as a miscellaneous expense and be 
none the worse but the 1986 law permits only miscellaneous 
deductions that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income 
that meant that most jurors who were required by employers to 
surrender jury pay in return for having their regular paychecks 
continue would have to pay tax on income they didnt keep 
congress discovered the inequity earlier this year and corrected 
it as part of a big miscellaneous tax bill but by the time 
president reagan signed the bill into law on nov 11 the new tax 
forms already were being printed without any way to account for 
the jurypay problem 
our taxforms people are looking at it but we still arent 
sure how it will be handled irs spokesman paul nirdlinger said 
wednesday adding that experts feel the provision affects very few 
taxpayers 
the best bet he said is that affected taxpayers will be allowed 
to write in the surrendered jury pay on form 1040 line 30

miklos nemeth a harvardtrained 
economist was chosen wednesday to head hungarys communist 
government as it embarks on tough political and economic reforms 
likely to include unpopular austerity measures 
the 40yearold nemeth a member of the ruling communist party 
politburo will be the youngest hungarian premier since 1956 he was 
chosen to succeed karoly grosz who said he would step down to focus 
on his position as party chief 
nemeths appointment is to be approved by parliament thursday 
approval is expected 
announcing the appointment party central committee secretary 
gyoergy fejti said the government might introduce referendums on 
unspecified issues in the next few years 
such a reform could give hungarians a direct voice in 
decisionmaking the only east bloc country to have attempted such a 
move is poland 
there should be the possibility for citizens to make decisions 
directly fejti told a news conference he said citizens 
themselves could initiate such referendums but emphasized that 
parliament would have the final say on passing any new laws 
nemeth an advocate of market reform who spent a year studying at 
harvard university will have the task of overseeing extensive 
economic and political change 
he is expected to guide the country into a period of austerity 
certain to irritate hungarians many of whom have grown accustomed 
to driving into neighboring austria on shopping sprees for western 
goods 
before 1990 when a new constitution is to be adopted parliament 
is to pass a series of laws designed to introduce market forces into 
the economy and to restructure political institutions 
nemeth came to the ruling politburo with the younger more 
reformoriented leadership that accompanied grosz when he replaced 
janos kadar as party chief in a major reshuffle in may 
a graduate of budapests prestigious karl marx university of 
economics and later a lecturer there nemeth first entered the upper 
echelons of power in june 1987 when he was named secretary for 
economics on the communist partys policysetting central committee 
nemeth has warned that neglecting deeper trade ties with the 
european economic community could hamper the countrys development 
last month parliament adopted legislation to ease restrictions 
on foreign ownership and joint ventures and further the flow of 
foreign capital into hungary 
like grosz nemeth advocates a socialist marketstyle economy 
blending state ownership with private initiative and substantially 
cutting subsidies to lossmaking heavy industry 
in a ninepage article in the november issue of the monthly 
social review nemeth cited as a model for hungarys future the 
example of large us oil corporations leasing gas stations to 
family operators 
in the article widely seen as an informal program for his 
government nemeth also praised the mcdonalds hamburger chain as an 
example of combining largescale management with individual service 
and initiative 
the premierdesignate seems undeterred by the prospect of as many 
as 100000 people unemployed by 1990 if the austerity program is 
fully impelemented 
he may however be hampered in implementing reforms both by 
conservatives in the communist party and by popular discontent 
grappling with doubledigit inflation the east blocs first 
personal income tax and a fall in real incomes hungarians 
increasingly are demanding more say in how their country is run 
in december parliament is due to adopt legislation regulating 
the establishment of independent groups associations and unions 
the new laws accept a multiparty system in principle 
government leaders say further legislation is necessary to 
determine the establishment and function of opposition parties 
those laws are not expected before 1990 
also appointed wednesday was politburo member reszo nyers who 
was given the newly created post of minister of state for the 
economy 
nyers selection completes a comeback in hungarian politics the 
father of hungarys pioneering economic reforms in the 1960s nyers 
was dropped from the politburo in 1974 when reforms were curbed

the cornerstone of prime minister margaret 
thatchers capitalist revolution faces one of its biggest gambles 
yet as the nations water supply heads for the stock exchange 
oil gas the telephone service and a host of other industries 
nationalized by past labor party governments have gone on sale since 
he tories came to office in 1979 
the sale of english and welsh water supplies is a bold venture to 
be unveiled thursday in parliament it shows the thatcher 
government far from flagging after nearly 10 years in power is 
pursuing its free market doctrines with undiminished zeal 
privatization of water and electricity were highlights of the 
1989 legislative program announced tuesday 
the water will be ready for sale within a year and electricity 
sometime in 1990 
although electricity is by far the larger undertaking with 
expected revenue of 36 billion for the government it is water that 
has attracted the most controversy 
it is the most basic resource the government has chosen to sell 
consumer groups worry that prices will rise and that once subject 
to the profit motive water purity will decline 
it is risky because water is not generally seen as a growth 
industry water authorities are 94 billion in debt which the 
government may have to write off 
the victorian water and drainage infrastructure is crumbling in 
many areas and billions are needed for repairs and to bring water up 
to the exacting new standards of purity set by the european economic 
community 
privatizations have raised nearly 40 billion for the treasury 
and enabled it to slash taxes and reach its present budget surplus 
but in the case of water comments the leftleaning guardian 
whether a private sector solution will be able to raise standards 
while trying to extract increasing returns for its shareholders 
remains hugely questionable 
no figure has been set on water privatization analysts expect it 
to raise 9 billion to 125 billion for the government 
the government first unveiled the water selloff in 1986 but 
backed off under fierce opposition from farmers and consumer groups 
under revised legislation the 10 water authorities which supply 
threequarters of the water needs of england and wales will become 
private companies quoted on the stock market 
another 29 semiprivate companies supplying the remaining quarter 
also will be floated on the stock market if they wish scotland and 
northern ireland are governed by separate legislation and are not 
included in the project 
the 10 authorities presently responsible for all waterrelated 
issues from sewerage to land draining and river management will 
become responsible only for drains and water supply 
a national rivers authority will be set up to take charge of all 
other waterrelated activity including monitoring purity and 
setting prices 
judith rees a geographer at the london school of economics who 
has written a study of water privatization estimated in an 
interview that the average household water bill now 180 a year 
would double within a decade 
michael howard the government minister charged with steering the 
200clause privatization bill through parliament says the priced 
could go down because we shall have all those incentives to higher 
efficiency and lower costs which come from private sector 
operations

brent scowcroft is a seasoned and pragmatic 
washington insider having served as national security adviser in 
the ford white house and on the panel appointed by president reagan 
to investigate the irancontra affair 
presidentelect george bush named scowcroft on wednesday as his 
national security adviser a choice that suggests his administration 
plans a cautious course in foreign policy over the past three 
years the retired air force lieutenant general has publicly opposed 
some key reagan initiatives 
bush spelled out a lowprofile role for scowcroft making it 
clear that another pragmatist already nominated to his cabinet 
secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii will be the chief 
spokesman on foreign policy matters 
scowcroft 63 will serve as an honest broker bush said 
because of his tremendous experience obviously he will convey to 
me unvarnished his own view on policy matters of tremendous 
importance 
scowcroft played much the same role for president ford he began 
his white house career as military assistant to president nixon in 
197273 then deputy to national security adviser henry a kissinger 
from 197375 and national security adviser from 197577 
before his appointment on wednesday scowcroft was a foreign 
policy adviser to the bush campaign and vice chairman of kissingers 
consulting firm 
scowcroft was born in ogden utah graduated from west point in 
1947 and rose through the air force ranks to lieutenant general on 
the way he picked up masters and doctoral degrees in international 
affairs from columbia university a mormon he is married and has 
one daughter 
scowcrofts appointment drew quick praise from sens claiborne 
pell dri chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
and richard lugar rind who was chairman when the republicans 
controlled the senate 
i think its an excellent appointment said pell ive 
worked with brent scowcroft for years and i think hell do a fine 
job 
lugar called scowcroft an extremely able and experienced public 
servant whose comprehensive knowledge of defense and arms control 
has engendered substantial confidence in congress throughout the 
years 
scowcroft shares bushs publicly stated caution about moving too 
quickly toward arms deals with the soviets 
he has taken several stands over the past few years that put him 
at odds with reagan criticizing the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty and urging the administration to use the star wars 
antimissile program as a bargaining chip to get the soviets 
agreement to sharply reduce their arsenal of offensive missiles 
i think it is highly unlikely to expect any farreaching 
reductions or changes in the soviet system if they have to look over 
their shoulder at the unknown prospects of a defense for which they 
may need these warheads scowcroft said in april 1985 
in september 1987 he criticized another pillar of the 
presidents foreign policy saying the united states would derive 
little benefit from the inf treaty which eliminates superpower 
ballistic missiles with ranges of 300 to 3400 miles reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev signed the pact at their washington 
summit last december and the senate ratified it last spring 
the united states and its nato partners since the early 1950s 
have relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to perserve the peace 
in europe scowcroft said eliminating part of the nuclear 
deterrent without redressing the soviet edge in such weapons as 
tanks and artillery could undermine the western alliance he said a 
position also taken by kissinger 
scowcroft also criticized an offer made by reagan at the 1986 
summit in reykjavik iceland to eliminate all ballistic missiles 
within 10 years saying his vision no matter how grand it may 
be is flawed and unrecognizable at least in one step 
on other issues scowcroft has said 
the war powers act passed after the vietnam war is deeply 
flawed and to the layman seems unconstitutional the law 
requires congressional approval to keep us troops in a war zone 
the united states should emphasize increasing its own exports 
not controlling imports to end foreign trade imbalance 
the philippine people support keeping us military bases in 
their country he directed a study on the issue for the nonpartisan 
council on foreign relations 
that study was one of several blueribbon panels on which 
scowcroft has served 
besides his role on the tower commission that investigated the 
irancontra affair scowcroft also served on a panel that advised 
president carter on arms control issues and on reaganappointed 
advisory commissions on military procurement and on basing the mx 
missile

rampaging mobs killed three soldiers injured at 
least 126 people and sacked government buildings and trains in the 
worst flareup of ethnic violence in the soviet south since early 
spring official sources said wednesday 
an open confrontation had developed between the republics of 
azerbaijan and armenia the consequences of which can be 
unpredictably tragic according to the official bakinsky rabochi 
newspaper of azerbaijan 
azerbaijani officials declared a state of emergency in the cities 
of nakichevan near the iranian border and kirovabad and 
authorities were urgently trying to restore order said musa 
mamedov chief of information for the republics foreign ministry 
three soldiers were killed perhaps by stones perhaps by 
sticks he said in a telephone interview 
official baku radio said hooligan elements attacked social and 
administrative buildings as a result of the disruption of law and 
order 126 people were wounded in kirovabad and three military 
personnel were killed 
it was the first official report of soldiers being killed in the 
caucasus region since violence erupted in february 
lives also were in danger in baku where crimes and looting was 
increasing said the baku radio report monitored in london 
hundreds of thousands of people were protesting in the streets of 
baku and the armenian capital yerevan 
arpenay popoyan wife of armenian activist rafael popoyan said 
in a telephone interview from yerevan that at least 500000 people 
had gathered in the citys opera square during the day and at night 
the crowd marched to the central committee of the armenian communist 
party 
practically the whole city went out to the square all the 
adults and the students thats the number there were she said 
the crowd demanded that a session of the armenian supreme soviet 
interrupted tuesday because of the sharp increase in tensions be 
reconvened 
the supreme soviet which in the past backed activists demands 
for annexation of the nagornokarabakh region from azerbaijan had 
not yet gotten to that item when its work was interrupted mrs 
popoyan said a general strike in yerevan would last until the 
session was reconvened 
popoyan said armenians decided at a meeting late tuesday to form 
selfdefense squads in areas of their republic where 
azerbaijanis live but there were no reports of violence in armenia 
calls to baku did not go through wednesday night 
bakinsky rabochi reported wednesday that bus travel between the 
two republics had been cut off and that no one was being allowed 
into azerbaijan from armenia carrying building materials in their 
cars 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
said the siuation in baku was difficult and that there had been 
casualties in kirovabad but he did not elaborate 
the two republics are in conflict about control over the 
predominantly armenian region of nagornokarabakh in azerbaijan 
residents have been agitating since february to have it annexed by 
armenia but azerbaijan officials and kremlin leaders have rejected 
the demand 
instead moscow has ordered a comprehensive social and economic 
development plan for the area 
at least 32 people were killed in three days of rioting in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait at the end of february and march that 
followed massive protests in nagornokarabakh and armenia armenia 
is predominantly christian and azerbaijan is predominantly moslem 
azerbaijanis say hundreds of thousands of people took to the 
streets beginning five days ago to protest what they say is an 
armenian effort to send settlers to nagornokarabakh to strengthen 
the ethnic armenian majority there 
they said armenian settlers were taken last week to the shusha 
area of nagornokarabakh in official trucks and began building 
barracks with materials supplied by the armenian government 
bakinsky rabochi complained that azerbaijanis in nagornokarabakh 
were not being permitted to work and were deprived of food and 
medical supplies 
armenian activist hovik vassilian reported that kirovabad was 
surrounded by azerbaijanis who were not permitting armenians to 
flee he said in a telephone interview from the armenian capital of 
yerevan that calls to the city would not go through 
armenian tv showed footage wednesday night of a train headed for 
armenia that was surrounded and attacked by a mob near nakhichevan 
vassilian said 
passengers were taken off the train and transported by bus to 
armenia but the engineers were hurt and not a window or door was 
left unbroken vassilian said the train was damaged tuesday and 
finally arrived in yerevan on wednesday he said 
baku radio said there had been injuries in nakhichevan as well 
as in kirovabad but did not say how many 
it said measures are being taken to maintain legality and 
safety of citizens in kirovabad and nakhichevan 
an editor for the azerbaijani news agency azerinform said 100000 
people mostly students were in bakus lenin square on wednesday 
but that their numbers were expected to swell after work

confessed twa hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi interrupted testimony wednesday to protest that a tape on 
which arabicspeaking voices threaten to kill hostages was from a 
different hijacking 
the taped exchange between beirut airport authorities and 
hijackers speaking from a seized plane was used as evidence against 
the lebanese shiite moslem accused of murder and air piracy in the 
june 1985 hijacking 
i think i recognize now that the last part of the tape concerns 
another hijacking that had nothing to do with twa hamadi told the 
court he did not say what air piracy he believed the tape referred 
to 
alen mousa the lebanese who translated the taped conversation 
for west german authorities was testifying when hamadi interrupted 
him mousa told the court he could not positively identify any of 
the voices as hamadis but said the two men spoke arabic with 
beirut accents 
on the tape which was played for the court the voices were 
heard threatening to kill hostages unless the plane was refueled 
immediately 
one of the hijackers was heard telling the control tower he would 
blow up the plane if the demand was not met 
hamadis attorneys made a motion for further examination of the 
tape 
during the 17day hijacking ordeal us navy diver richard 
stethem was killed and 39 americans were held hostage aboard twa 
flight 847 seized en route from athens to rome and diverted to 
beirut and algiers 
hamadi has admitted he and an accomplice hijacked the plane but 
he denied killing stethem his alleged accomplice hassan ezzeddine 
remains at large 
earlier wednesday a west german police official testified that 
hamadi told west german investigators he was a member of hezbollah 
a proiranian shiite moslem organization believed to be holding 
foreign hostages in lebanon 
bernhard giese an fbi investigator who also testified wednesday 
said hamadi told interrogators he had often worked under the command 
of his older brother abdulhadi hamadi the beirut security chief 
for hezbollah 
mohammed hamadi admitted being a member of hezbollah and said 
that he had taken part in many battles in lebanon giese told the 
court 
asked by chief judge heiner mueckenberger if he had any comment 
hamadi said the statement he gave to west german interrogators was 
made under duress hamadi has denied in court that he was a member 
of hezbollah 
giese told the court however that hamadi made the initial 
statement freely 
there was no pressure the interrogation was made in a relaxed 
atmosphere the fbi agent said 
on tuesday houston businessman allyn conwell told the court he 
was so terrorized that i was virtually immobile while on board 
the plane he said he feared the captors planned to shoot him and 
other americans who were taken to hiding places in beirut 
four american servicemen were removed from the plane by members 
of hezbollah while conwells group was taken away by amal another 
shiite militia that collaborated with the hijackers

israels two chief rabbis on wednesday 
criticized us jewish groups for making a big fuss over a 
proposed change in the legal definition of who is a jew 
at a rare joint news conference the two orthodox rabbis stressed 
they had no desire to cause a division with adherents of the reform 
and conservative streams of judaism which predominate in north 
america 
the proposed who is a jew law would accept only orthodox 
conversions in israel and north american jewish delegates who met 
with the rabbis and israeli leaders this week complained the 
proposal causes feelings of anguish among reform and conservative 
jews 
but the chief rabbis argued the changes were designed to affect 
only israel where virtually all jews are orthodox and would 
directly touch only a few nonorthodox converts who wish to 
immigrate to israel each year 
because of such a marginal problem they shouldnt have made 
such a big fuss said avraham shapira chief rabbi of the 
askhenazim or european jews orthodox conservative and reform 
we are one jewish people 
rabbi mordechai eliahu who represents sephardim those jews 
from middle eastern countries called for a halt to public 
squabbling over the proposed legislation 
i would like to appeal to all these people and say pleas dont 
make problems for the jewish people he said 
eliahu attacked canadian and us jews who threatened to curtail 
political and financial support for israel if the changes are 
adopted 
those who give money to the land of israel are doing themselves 
a favor and i think its shameful for them to say that for this 
reason or that reason they will or will not contribute said 
eliahu 
israeli officials said they feared passage of the who is a 
jew law could cost israel 100 million a year jews in the 
diaspora contribute 400 million to 500 million a year 
the north american delegation met wednesday with heads of the 
ultraorthodox augudat israel a religious party that has led the 
campaign for the legislative change 
rabbi menachem porush an agudat parliament member said he 
assured the delegates the law would not affect foreign communities 
only israel 
but walter hess executive vice president of the united israel 
appeal in canada said no progress at all was made toward 
bridging the gap 
we emphasized that from a diaspora point of view it is the 
delegitimization of american jewry he said in an interview on 
israel radio 
another ultraorthodox political leader rabbi avraham ravitz of 
the small torah flag party criticized us jewish leaders for 
interfering in israels internal affairs 
every jewish group that has enough money to spend a weekend in 
a hotel calls themselves leaders of american jewry he told israel 
radio no one voted for this leadership 
also wednesday a group of 38 highranking reserve officers sent 
a letter to prime minister yitzhak shamir urging him not to form a 
coalition with three ultraorthodox religious parties 
the officers said a government with religious parties would have 
a demoralizing effect on soldiers since many ultraorthodox students 
are exempt from army service 
their voters dont fulfill their primary defense obligations 
but they will give orders to the israel defense forces over how to 
fight and with whom to fight said meir zorea a reserve general 
they have no right to do this 
shamir needs the three ultraorthodox parties which control 13 
seats to form a governing majority in the 120seat parliament 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc won 40 seats in the nov 1 election

scheduled dec 11 vote on a nonbinding referendum in sardinia that 
questions the presence of a us military base on that island 
a second part of the referendum scheduled to go before the 
voters in april also asks sardinians if they want the island to be 
declared a nuclearfree zone the court said it would decide by the 
end of march whether voting could be held on the second part of the 
referendum 
the court on tuesday suspended the december vote ruling it first 
must decide whether it is constitutional to allow sardinian citizens 
to vote on issues that are beyond their control 
the first part of the referendum asks sardinians if they are 
against the presence of foreign military bases not approved by 
parliament that service nuclearpowered vessels or those carrying 
nuclear arms 
the only foreign base that fits the description is the us 
facility at la maddalena in northeastern sardinia which provides 
minor maintenance and supplies to nuclear submarines and other small 
craft 
the italoamerican bilateral agreement which consented to the 
construction of the base in 1972 was never ratified by italys 
parliament the agreement as well as information gathered in 
radioactivity monitoring and evacuation plans are all classified 
information 
spokesmen at the us embassy in rome refused to comment on

president reagan is vetoing 
compromise legislation that for the first time would have imposed 
restrictions on lobbying by former cabinet officers members of 
congress and their senior staff members the white house announced 
today 
chief presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater announcing 
reagans decision to allow a friday midnight signing deadline to 
pass without action said the administration concluded provisions in 
the bill affecting executive branch employees would have discouraged 
people from working for the government 
the president recognizes that this disapproval may not be good 
politics but it is good government fitzwater said 
these laws should be fair impartial easily understood and 
should not erect barriers to public service he said fitzwater 
called the bill overreaching and said it was sloppily put 
together 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee also supported the presidents veto of the measure 
no doubt the presidents choice will be criticized but he made 
the right choice said rostenkowski 
saying he shares the goal of assuring that government employees 
act only in the best interest of the public rostenkowski added 
that congress found itself in the position of accepting this bill 
or no bill at all 
but he said former policymakers should not have to consult a 
united states attorney before making a lunch date 
reagans pocket veto came nearly a month after the president 
exercised his same constitutional prerogative to kill a bill aimed 
at protecting socalled whistleblowers federal employees who 
report wrongdoing and mismanagement in their agencies 
in the earlier case reagan said the bill while 
wellintentioned would have had the effect of making it virtually 
impossible for the heads of federal departments and agencies to 
discipline employees 
in advance of reagans announcement presidentelect george bush 
had told reporters in washington today that if the president killed 
the bill he would push for some similar kind of legislation early 
in his administration 
i am going to have an ethics bill bush said before departing 
for a thanksgiving vacation at his retreat in kennebunkport maine 
and itll be a strong one itll be a fair one 
bush also said however that while the ethics bill amounted to a 
very good start there were some problems with certain 
provisions of the legislation 
there were some changes in it that i guess nobodys really 
happy with the vice president said 
rep barney frank dmass took vehement exception tuesday to 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwaters assertions that the 
postgovernment restrictions act could have the effect of 
prohibiting a former president from calling an incumbent 
president 
reacting to this description offered by fitzwater on monday 
frank said the presidential spokesmans complaints about the bill 
were rooted in flat lies 
for his part fitzwater backed away tuesday from his earlier 
suggestion that reagan might withhold his signature from the 
legislation because of strong opposition from cabinet officials 
fitzwater actually has declined all along to predict whether 
reagan would exercise his constitutional right of pocket veto by 
letting a 10ay deadline pass without his signature the bill will 
die unless reagan signs it before 1201 am est saturday 
the bill was passed 3477 in the house and by voice vote in the 
senate in late october 
under the legislation cabinet members and their top deputies 
would be prohibited from lobbying their agency for one year after 
leaving and top executive branch staff could not lobby their agency 
for a year without approval from the office of government ethics 
besides saying initially that the bill would in effect rule out 
consultations between presidents and former presidents fitzwater 
also said that george bush as a former vice president wouldnt be 
allowed to call the us park service to get a camping permit 
bush has not said publicly whether he recommends reagan sign the 
legislation but the washington post reported in todays editions 
citing unnamed white house sources that the presidentelect urged 
reagan to sign the measure 
sheila tate bushs spokeswoman could not be reached for comment 
tuesday night 
frank in a telephone interview with the associated press 
maintained that fitzwater was overstating the bills draconian 
effects on members of the executive branch 
frank called fitzwaters interpretation one of the flat lies 
being stated about the legislation 
in the first place the bill only prevents you from doing this 
lobbying if you are doing it for pay the congressman said if 
jimmy carter wanted to talk to ronald reagan about any issue 
theres absolutely nothing that prevents that secondly the bill 
only applies for a year after leaving office and again only if 
compensation is involved 
of the statement about the impact the bill would have on bush 
frank said that too is a lie the bill specifically allows you 
to do any lobbying for yourself or for your own business 
in fact if george bush went back to his texas oil company 
he could lobby for it the restrictions only apply if youre doing 
it for compensation and for other people 
fitzwater could not be reached for comment on franks statements 
the rhetorical crossfire between fitzwater and frank happened as 
reagan continued his thanksgiving week vacation combining light 
paperwork with horseback riding and chores at rancho del cielo in 
the santa ynez mountains not far from here 
fitzwater said the president was reviewing various position 
papers on the congressionally passed legislation but said we 
dont know what reagans decision will be 
one of the principal questions for reagan is whether to accept 
the harsher restrictions on postgovernment activities by executive 
branch employees in exchange for gaining for the first time some 
restrictions on revolvingdoor lobbying by former members of 
congress and members of their staffs 
although fitzwater had emphasized on monday what concerns had 
been raised about the bill he told reporters tuesday there are 
those who have strong views for it 
some members of the administration including interior secretary 
donald hodel have complained that the legislation would discourage 
people from working for the government because of a fear that they 
might run afoul of the legislation in their future jobs it includes 
criminal sanctions including fines of up to 250000 and a 
fiveyear prison term for violations 
last month ann mcbride senior vice president of the common 
cause citizens lobby said that congressional passage of this 
legislation strengthens revolving door restrictions on executive 
branch officials and ends a doublestandard by covering members of 
congress and senior congressional staffs for the first time

ron bolen director of the department of motor vehicles safety 
and enforcement division said 248 revocation notices were mailed as 
of tuesday and 12 more were to be sent before the end of the week

southeast of charleston

counties were not available 
officials in kanawha county the states largest said they have

than half the states 55 county offices were closed for deer season 
west virginias dropout rate was 174 percent last year down 
from 27 percent a decade ago but mcneel said it is still too high 
the first revocation notications to four male and two female 
students were sent sept 29 bolen said only three students have 
asked for hearings to appeal the revocations bolen said

spanish colonists probably did hold a dinner of 
thanks 23 years before the pilgrims thanksgiving of 1621 but the 
dinner on what is now texas soil is historically insignificant a 
historian says 
it makes about as much difference as the fact that leif erikson 
sighted america five centuries before columbus said jim cyphers 
a historian and analyst at the massachusetts archives the 
tradition of 1598 didnt go anywhere but that that took place in 
1621 did 
in terms of the intellectual and social organization of the 
country the roots of thanksgiving come from here and not from new 
spain cyphers said 
members of the mission trail association in el paso texas say 
the first thanksgiving was held on april 30 1598 during a journey 
by juan de onate and 400 followers from what is now southern 
chihuahua state mexico to presentday northern new mexico 
capt gaspar perez de villagra kept an account of the 
twomonthlong journey to the rio grande and through the el paso 
mountain pass by the 130 men 270 women and children and 7000 head 
of cattle the last two weeks of the journey were spent trekking 
through the chihuahuan desert and the expedition ran out of water 
five days before reaching the river 
after 10 days of hunting fishing and recuperating we built a 
great bonfire and roasted the meat and fish and then all sat down 
to a repast the like of which we had never enjoyed before 
villagra wrote we were happy that our trials were over as happy 
as were the passengers in the ark when they saw the dove returning 
with the olive branch in his beak bringing tidings that the deluge 
had subsided 
the amatuer and professional historians that make up the mission 
trail association say they arent trying to rewrite history they 
just want to give the spanish colonists their due and plan to 
recreate the dinner next april 30 
the people in massachusetts are probably not going to like the 
idea said sheldon hall a mayflower descendant and president of 
the group 
its going to create a lot of talk its going to create a big 
historical correction he said

a man accused of diverting 34 million from a 
credit union created for lowincome people lived in affluence with 
chartered jets limousines and a 5000amonth rented house 
published reports said 
lawrence e king jr 44 chief executive of the failed franklin 
federal credit union in omaha was ordered by a federal judge 
tuesday to turn over most of his property to a courtappointed 
receiver while a 34 million lawsuit against king is pending in us 
district court 
the national credit union administration filed the lawsuit last 
week accusing king of diverting funds from franklin for personal 
and business use through a long series of fraudulent dishonest 
and illegal acts 
the lawsuit said king kept secret a second set of financial 
records to hide the existence of about 34 million in certificates 
of deposit 
king allegedly used the money to pay for chartered jets jewelry 
clothing flowers and other expenses unrelated to the credit union 
the lawsuit said 
king who has declined requests for interviews has proclaimed 
his innocence his lawyer said king used his own money to support 
his lifestyle 
us district judge william cambridge empowered lawyer keith i 
frederick to take possession of kings stocks bonds bank deposits 
jewelry and all real estate except his catering business and his 
home overlooking the missouri river 
the properties sought by the credit union administration are in 
danger of being lost removed or materially injured according to 
the order signed by cambridge 
frederick was empowered to reclaim furniture and other belongings 
that king sold or removed recently from his rented home in 
washington he also was instructed to take possession of kings 
jewelry including a gold watch valued at 65000 a 9000 gold 
ring and a set of black pearl cuff links tie tac and shirt studs 
valued at 1000 
kings attorney william e morrow jr said the receivership 
issue hinders resolution of the lawsuit 
i dont think there is very much property for the receiver to 
get his hands on morrow said 
king was an active republican working with the partys citizens 
for america and the national black republican council and singing 
the national anthem at the 1984 gop convention in dallas 
last summer he orchestrated a party at the gop convention in new 
orleans for 1000 people under the auspices of the council on 
minority americans a group he heads caterers estimated the party 
cost 100000 
reports published by the omaha worldherald this week said king 
drove a new mercedes with a retail price of 69300 in washington 
he often stayed at a 5000amonth rented house just off embassy 
row next to the venezuelan embassy the newspaper said 
king is described by friends as a philanthropic person he 
has served with a variety of civic organizations such as boys and 
girls clubs ymca campfire girls head start and the salvation army 
all this comes as a surprise to us said wida stephenson a

britain announced wednesday it plans random 
anonymous aids tests using blood samples collected at the nations 
hospitals and health clinics 
health secretary kenneth clarke said the aim was to determine the 
spread of the fatal disease not to identify those individuals 
carrying the aids virus 
starting in a few months doctors will be able to screen blood 
given by any person attending a hospital or clinic for tests he 
said 
the only details kept about those screened will be sex age the 
area where they live and whether the test was done in a hospital 
casualty department or clinic he said 
clarke said the government saw no legal or ethical objections to 
testing blood samples taken properly in the first place for 
another purpose from a patient no longer identifiable 
a health department spokeswoman who requested anonymity said the 
united states has been testing in this fashion at selected 
hospitals for some time 
the medical research council will select within three months the 
groups of people and regions of the country in which anonymous 
screening will take place likely candidates could be emergency 
victims patients undergoing general surgery pregnant women and 
those attending drug and sexual disease clinics the health 
department said 
the spokeswoman said anyone who has any reason to suspect or 
fear they were contaminated with the aids virus can say to their 
doctor can i have a test 
she said a health department committee that examined the 
proposals for anonymous screening had consulted civil liberty 
groups homosexual rights groups medical professional and legal 
bodies and members of the public 
the terence higgins trust which helps aids victims objected 
that anonymous screening cannot show how the virus has been 
transmitted and is therefore useless in the planning of prevention 
efforts

the nations largest meatpacker in a landmark 
move that could lead to better working conditions throughout 
americas most hazardous major industry agreed wednesday to 
redesign jobs in its 15 plants to curtail crippling muscle and nerve 
ailments 
ibp inc is committed to the threeyear program as part of an 
accord with the occupational safety and health administration and 
the united food and commercial workers union settling 57 million 
in proposed fines by the government 
the terms call for ibp formerly known as iowa beef processors 
to pay a reduced fine of 975000 while establishing a model job 
redesign program at its 2800worker flagship plant in dakota city 
neb to address repetitive trauma disorders such as tendinitis and 
carpal tunnel syndrome 
the ailments involve an inflamation of muscle and nerve tissues 
around joints eventually rendering them incapable of movement the 
most common cause is repeated hand wrist and arm motions 
sometimes as many as 1000 of them an hour associated with cutting 
meat 
cumulative trauma workrelated disorders are the leading health 
problem among packinghouse workers who have an injury rate four 
times the national average and nearly double the rate among 
construction workers 
this settlement is an important victory for job safety and can 
serve as a model approach for reducing injuries and illnesses in one 
of americas most hazardous industries said labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin 
we expect these steps to serve as an industrywide blueprint 
and to provide other industries with valuable information for 
handling their own cumulative trauma disorders she said 
osha officials and labor leaders called ibps recognition of the 
repetitive motion disorders as an occupational illness a major 
milestone in a nearly threeyearlong effort to address the problem 
following a series of congressional hearings and osha 
investigations largely initiated by the ufcw and the aflcios food 
and allied service trades fast department the government assessed 
ibp fines of 26 million and 31 million over the last two years 
for violations at the dakota city plant 
the most important thing here is not the us government 
collecting a fine said william wynn the president of the union 
which includes 100000 packinghouse workers nationwide in its 
membership 
despite past differences whats important is that were 
sitting down and trying to develop something that will make it ibp 
a safer place to work he said 
just last month osha fined another meatpacker john morrell amp 
co 433 million for ignoring what the agency said were hazards at 
its plant in sioux falls sd similar to those found at ibps 
dakota city plant 
but the agency said the conditions at morrell were much worse 
with more than 800 of its 2000 workers at sioux falls sustaining 
what the agency called serious and disabling repetitive motion 
injuries between may of 1987 and the same month this year 
among other charges osha accused morrell of making dozens of 
workers return to jobs immediately after undergoing surgery to 
correct the injuries even though safety experts recommended they 
take at least 30 to 60 days off for the wounds to heal 
morrell has sought to stop oshas enforcement activities in 
federal court saying the agency was practicing guilt by 
headlines to single it out 
like morrell ibp also had bitterly contested the osha fines 
accusing the agency of using them to intimidate companies 
unless they accept alice in wonderland theories of workplace 
safety 
maurice mcgill ibps executive vice president said wednesday 
his company still disagrees with oshas regulatory philosophy the 
past three years of targeting large companies for inspections and 
assessing them stiff fines to set an example 
but mcgill acknowledged that ibp until recently had focused more 
of its job safety efforts on curbing more typical injuries such as 
knife cuts 
very little is understood about cumulative trauma disorders 
he said there are a number of people in this world who style 
themselves as ergonomists and know all the answers but the answers 
are not quite as easy as this 
under the accord the dakota city plant will hire a pair of 
ergonomists people who specialize in designing jobs to fit workers 
and begin implementing the changes such as the use of better

supporters of the canadaus free trade agreement 
foresee dramatic growth as the two countries move toward greater 
economic integration but changes will not be visible immediately 
there wont be anything that will happen on the second of 
january prime minister brian mulroney cautioned after winning the 
parliamentary majority he needs to move forward on the agreement 
it was signed by mulroney and president reagan in january and is 
designed to have a gradual effect notably in the reduction of all 
remaining tariffs between the two countries over a 10year period 
eighty percent of trade between the neighbors already each 
others biggest trading partner currently is tariff free 
the jan 1 deadline the canadian parliament will try to meet 
after it returns dec 12 is the date foreseen for the first annual 
round of tariff cuts 
that date could be postponed if enabling legislation cannot be 
completed in time in ottawa the us congress already has approved 
all measures needed by the united states 
some tariffs will be eliminated immediately others will be 
lowered at a rate of 20 percent a year for five years and some at a 
rate of 10 percent a year for 10 years 
supporters say explaining uscanadian trade as being 80 percent 
tariff free already is misleading because much potential trade 
simply doesnt occur because of barriers 
they say the agreement stimulates trade to levels previously 
unimaginable as businesses on both sides of the border look to an 
expanded market 
the economic council of canada has forecast the national economy 
will be 25 percent bigger by 1998 than it would without the 
agreement 
some adjustment will occur as tariffprotected canadian 
industries close or modify production affecting some jobs 
supporters of the agreement describe it as a modest price for the 
new jobs that will be created as the economy expands a net gain of 
as many as 250000 in the first 10 years 
mulroney promised tuesday that top priority for existing 
government programs like retraining will be covering anyone 
unemployed as a result of the trade agreement 
were seeking to do anything we can to cushion any blows that 
come from this commercial agreement he said 
joseph dcruz a business professor at the university of toronto 
said there will be little immediate impact on jobs or trade flows in 
the first phase 
in a telephone interview he predicted disputes over steel will 
be the first visible area as canadian producers look to the trade 
agreement for protection from what has been seen here as us 
harassment 
the trade agreement also dismantles many investment barriers 
eases the flow of some services and establishes a canadaus trade 
commission to settle disputes 
much remains to be defined in negotiations that will be spread 
over the next five to seven years including key questions about 
what constitutes subsidies 
impact is expected to be greatest eventually in the automotive 
industry agriculture and energy

a governors task force on wednesday 
recommended 17 changes in the states bus safety standards 
including a new emergency exit six months after 27 people died in a 
church bus crash 
also among the governors task force on bus safety 
recommendations were a requirement that privately owned buses meet 
federal safety standards and that the state set standards for 
bidding on surplus school buses 
we must prevent forever the possibility of another tragedy such 
as the one that happened in carrollton said gov wallace 
wilkinson who appointed the task force i believe that the 
proposed standards will result in the saving of lives of children 
on may 14 a bus bought by a church as surplus from a school 
district was carrying people home from an outing it collided with 
a pickup truck on a highway killing 24 children and three adults 
if the task force recommendations had been in place before the 
carrollton crash wilkinson said i think its fair to say that 
some lives would have been saved 
state transportation secretary milo d bryant who chaired the 
task force said the administration wants to make sure kentucky 
takes the lead in the nation in school bus safety we owe it to 
our children 
most of the task force recommendations will be implemented by the 
governor or by the state transportation cabinet officials said 
some recommendations such as one requiring bus drivers to receive 
more training and meet minimum federal medical requirements for 
motor carriers may require action by the general assembly 
according to the report 
a major recommendation of the task force is that an extra 
emergency exit on the left side be required after nov 1 1990 
for all but the smallest class of buses the argument for leftside 
exits is that a bus in an accident could roll onto its right side 
blocking exit on that side 
in the carrollton crash the front door was blocked by flames 
from the punctured fuel tank leaving only the rear exit forty 
people escaped 
transportation specialists of the state department of education 
opposed the recommendation saying a leftside door would weaken a 
bus structurally 
but bryant was unmoved 
if we can put men on the moon i think these people can design 
a bus that is structurally sound bryant said 
among other recommended changes the task force also decided to 
seek the repositioning of fuel tanks to make them less vulnerable to 
puncture which caused the fire aboard the church bus 
the task force also recommended asking bus chassis manufacturers 
to redesign fuel systems proven to be a fire hazard on 
gasolinepowered buses and to ask the national highway 
transportation safety administration and the state department of 
education to study again the possible use of seat belts or other 
passive restraints on school buses 
other recommendations included installing popout windows on 
buses seating 16 or more passengers doubling to four the number of 
bus evacuation drills for public school students and establishing 
new seatingcapacity standards to reduce crowding and make emergency 
exits more accessible

harold washington was remembered as a mayor of 
vision and strength and a liberal in the best sense at a 
memorial service wednesday one year after a massive heart attack 
felled the citys first black executive 
some 3100 people attended a tribute to him at a theater in the 
downtown loop hearing former democratic presidential contender 
jesse jackson writer studs terkel television talk show host oprah 
winfrey and us rep john conyers talk of their regard for 
washington 
we miss your presence your strength of mind your iron will 
and your vision jackson said 
you challenged us to fairness he said you fought for an 
ethics ordinance to remove the sleaze from government to do 
justice to love mercy 
washington 65 died the day before thanksgiving 1987 seven 
months into his second term the jovial articulate mayor slumped 
over his city hall desk just an hour after attending a midmorning 
groundbreaking ceremony for a housing project 
he was rushed to northwestern memorial hospital and two hours 
later was pronounced dead leaving the shocked city without its 
charismatic and voluble leader 
the selection of alderman eugene sawyer a softspoken former 
schoolteacher as acting mayor by the city council came a week after 
washingtons death and followed raucous meetings among sparring 
factions of the council 
at least four democratic candidates have expressed intentions to 
oust sawyer in next years election which is expected to be decided 
by the primary in heavily democratic chicago 
at the service pulitzerprize winning author terkel paid tribute 
to washingtons unifying vision he saw the block as part of a 
neighborhood he saw the neighborhood as part of a city 
he saw the city as part of a country he saw the country was 
part of a world they were inseparable and thats what made him a 
mayor with the possibility of being the best 
certainly he was the most literate mayor chicago ever had 
added terkel who cited washingtons wellknown penchant for reading 
winfrey noted washingtons easygoing and affable style as well 
as his contributions to social progress and civil rights 
if we truly want to let the world know and this city know 
that his life meant something to us we must in our own lives 
through our own action carry out his doctrine she said 
mary ella smith washingtons longtime companion paid a tearful 
tribute to him as a man who throughout his life was always 
chipping and picking away at some form of inequity and injustice 
always trying to help those who did not have sufficient resources to 
help themselves 
she was joined in her praise by sawyer and conyers dmich a 
close friend of washington who called him a liberal in the best 
sense he took his job seriously as a representative of his 
constitutents 
many of those attending the morning service one of three planned 
for the day were schoolchildren 
letha robinson 10 a fourth grader at robert healy school said 
of washington he liked the white people and black people no 
matter what color they were he said theyre still people

twins who share a heart and liver cannot be separated 
the final concensus of experts at the university of maryland 
medical system is that the twins cannot be separated hospital

congressional democrats raised new legal and 
fairness concerns wednesday about a federal communications 
commission proposal to replace profit regulation of telephone 
companies with caps on prices 
a report by the democratic staff of the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee says the fccs proposal fails to 
assure that rates for regulated phone service will be just and 
reasonable as required by the communications act 
the fcc has proposed to change the way it regulates american 
telephone amp telegraph co and the regional bell phone companies by 
lifting limits on the profits they can earn and instead set a 
ceiling on rates the price cap would limit rate increases to three 
percentage points less than annual inflation 
the agency estimated the plan which would be optional for the 
phone companies could save consumers 16 billion over four years 
if all the companies participated longdistance bills would be 
about onehalf of a percentage point lower annually than they would 
be under traditional profit regulation the fcc said 
but the report by the staff of the panel headed by rep edward j 
markey dmass said congress intended that rate regulation of 
dominant carriers phone companies controlling major portions 
of the business in a market be based on the costs of providing 
service 
as currently structured the price cap scheme will permit 
carriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs 
the report said there is no assurance that rates would remain 
even within a zone of reasonableness 
fcc spokesman john kamp said the commission had not received the 
report but the question of the commissions authority to move to 
a pricecap plan has been explored in detail throughout this 
proceeding and we have concluded to date that there is no legal 
impediment to commission action he added we will consider 
carefully any new legal issues contained in this report 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick who has long wanted to loosen 
telephone regulation with a system of price caps has been pushing 
for a final vote on the plan at the commissions dec 2 meeting 
despite strong indications from democrats on capitol hill that 
action taken before congress returns would intensify the bad 
relations between the fcc and lawmakers 
i will not rush this issue to judgment but i also wont delay 
it beyond the time at which its ripe for decision patrick said 
last week 
patrick who left earlier this week to spend the thanksgiving 
holiday in california could not be reached for comment on the 
report or whether he would put the pricecap issue on the 
commissions dec 2 agenda commission sources said a decision would 
be made friday when the fcc must announce the items that will be on 
that agenda 
sources close to patrick say he is not wedded to considering a 
pricecap proposal at the dec 2 meeting and would be content to put 
it off until january he said last week however its something i 
want considered in my lifetime at the commission 
though he is not expected to leave immediately many doubt that 
patrick will remain as fcc chairman for more than the first few 
months of the bush administration they speculate that bush will 
want a new fcc chairman to repair the agencys tattered relations 
with congress 
the biggest problem for patrick right now is getting a second 
vote for his proposal with two vacancies on the commission he sits 
on the panel with two democrats and both have indicated concerns 
about the plan

a group suing the government on behalf of the 
homeless said wednesday that federal agencies are refusing to hand 
over vacant properties for housing despite a judges order to do so 
the national coalition for the homeless said it has identified 
federal buildings ranging from military barracks to office 
buildings on land in 10 states that could be used for sheltering 
the homeless 
us district judge oliver gasch ruled on sept 30 that the 
government cannot sell surplus real estate until it has complied 
with a law requiring it to make vacant property available for the 
homeless 
according to the coalition property in virginia oregon 
illinois oklahoma california minnesota arizona pennsylvania 
rhode island massachusetts and the district of columbia could be 
used to give the homeless a place to live 
winter is upon us yet in the almost two months since the court 
ruled the administration has taken absolutely no action to make 
property available the group said in a prepared statement 
the groups report provided no estimate of how many homeless 
people could be served by handing over this property 
arthur goldberg an attorney for the government in the case said 
he did not want to comment on anything to do with the lawsuit 
at a hearing last week the judge complained that the government 
agencies have not moved quickly enough to make the housing available 
as winter approaches

provided by the coalition the thing youve got to do with 
bureaucrats is crack the whip and see to it they do the job

presidentelect george bush who has 
said repeatedly he wants a team of new faces picked yet another 
veteran of past administrations wednesday in naming retired air 
force lt gen brent scowcroft to be his national security adviser 
scowcroft who held the same job in the administration of 
president ford was also an adviser to presidents nixon and carter 
and headed commissions for president reagan he has made and will 
continue to make important contributions to the design of us 
foreign policy bush said 
bush mixed his announcement with warm praise for reagans current 
national security adviser colin powell who he said had turned in 
an outstanding performance powell called his successor a 
superb choice in a statement released in santa barbara calif 
where he was accompanying the vacationing reagan 
there was also praise from both republican and democratic 
senators an excellent appointment said claiborne pell dri 
chairman of the foreign relations committee scowcroft is 
extremely able and experienced said richard lugar rind who 
was chairman when the republicans controlled the senate an 
excellent choice said sam nunn dga chairman of the armed 
services committee 
the vice president made the announcement his sixth highlevel 
selection in washington before he and his wife flew to their 
oceanside family compound here for a fiveday thanksgiving vacation 
at a welcoming rally in kennebunkport bush greeted several 
thousand residents telling them barbara and i want to be good 
neighbors it was his first time back here since early august 
before the republican national convention 
referring to his helicopter landing on the grounds of st anns 
episcopal church where his family worships bush boasted im 
wondering what my old man would say if he could see his little boy 
now 
it was a reference to his late father sen prescott bush the 
vice president recalled he had been come to the family vacation home 
in every one of his 64 years except one during world war ii 
he reiterated a campaign pledge to permit lobstermen to continue 
working their traps in the cove beside his house despite security 
concerns of the secret service 
he told residents he shared their concern with a recent boost in 
local property taxes vowed to drive his speedboat slowly in the 
river that runs through town and promised to try not to hold up 
traffic 
earlier in washington the vice president described scowcroft 
63 as a trusted friend with whom he had worked in various 
capacities in the past both as vice president and as cia director 
im going to count on him to coordinate the development of my 
national security policy bush said 
however another major link in working on that policy his 
choice for defense secretary remained missing 
despite widespread speculation that he will name former senate 
armed services committee chairman john tower of texas bush declined 
to confirm that in a questionandanswer session with reporters at 
the old executive office building 
he would only say that he wanted somebody to manage the 
pentagon who could institute the reforms that i talked about 
during the campaign 
asked if he regretted that the delay on the appointment appeared 
to leave tower twisting in the wind bush said that yes he was 
sorry on a human basis 
but he added 
i understand the insatiable curiosity about whos going to be 
staffing this administration i understand it but im less tense 
about it than i used to be 
bush announced previously that he would nominate his campaign 
chairman and longtime friend former treasury secretary james a 
baker iii as secretary of state and would retain three recent 
reagan appointees attorney general dick thornburgh education 
secretary lauro f cavazos and treasury secretary nicholas brady 
he also said monday he would nominate bakers former deputy 
richard darman to the cabinetlevel post of budget director he 
said then that in all likelihood there would be no more cabinet 
holdovers 
scowcroft who appeared alongside bush on wednesday headed a 
special commission in 1983 that studied basing of the mx missile 
more recently he was a member of the commission headed by tower 
that studied the irancontra arms affair for the administration the 
commission found fault with white house management of the national 
security council but had little to say about any bush role 
asked about changes at the national security council after the 
irancontra affair scowcroft said i am very pleased i think 
that gen powell and secretary frank carlucci before him have left 
the nsc staff in really excellent condition and it will be a joy to 
assume responsibility for the system the way it is operating now 
as for defense he said the military budget is substantially 
underfunded he praised carlucci the outgoing defense secretary 
for having already taken some very courageous steps in the 
direction of readjusting the defense program more has to be done 
a 1947 graduate of the us military academy at west point 
scowcroft served as a professor of russian history and political 
science at both west point and the air force academy 
he was nixons military assistant in the early 1970s then was 
deputy to henry kissinger when kissinger served both as secretary of 
state and national security adviser during the nixon and ford 
administrations 
when kissinger gave up the national security post in 1975 it 
went to scowcroft 
bush has voiced annoyance over leaks about prospective cabinet 
appointees and scheduled wednesdays announcement himself without 
giving aides advance notice 
in fact many reporters who regularly cover bush had already gone 
to maine after being told by transition officials that bush planned 
no public appearances before the town rally 
i think weve demonstrated that things can be announced without 
leaks bush said grinning

a police officer and a county affirmative 
action director have been charged with giving drug dealers 
information about police undercover operations in exchange for 
cocaine and marijuana officials said wednesday 
haverstraw officials had even considered promoting the 16year 
police veteran victor nieves 46 of monroe from community affairs 
and youth officer to detective and putting him in charge of finding 
out why the undercover operations were failing 
these actions could have led to the deaths of police 
officers said rockland county district attorney kenneth gribetz 
this could have led literally to acts of murder of police officers 
who were engaged in undercover activities 
nieves was arrested tuesday night along with luis del pilar 40 
of west haverstraw rocklands affirmative action director their 
activities were uncovered by courtordered wiretaps in the course of 
a sixmonth probe authorities said 
both were charged with hindering prosecution and criminal 
facilitation and were being held on 10000 bond after arraignment 
tuesday night 
authorities said the men supplied dealers with the time and 
location of the execution of search warrants and arrest warrants by 
the rockland county narcotic task force they also performed 
licenseplate checks on vehicles being used by undercover officers 
and illegally used the new york state police information network to 
try to identify and verify the vehicles driven by undercover 
officers authorities said 
del pilar is accused of using his official capacity to gain 
access to personnel files to learn identities of undercover officers 
gribetz said over the past few years law enforcement officials 
had become increasingly concerned over the lack of success of 
undercover operations in haverstraw north of new york city 
the wiretaps were placed on the phone of luis jerez 39 of 
pomona described by gribetz as a largescale street dealer 
the other wiretaps were placed in the offices of the juvenile aid 
bureau in the haverstraw police department 
in five weeks jerez received 2500 calls said gribetz 
it became very clear that nieves and del pilar were 
supplying critical information to jerez said gribetz 
jerez was held in lieu of 1 million in arapahoe county jail in 
arapahoe colo after he was arrested at his girlfriends home in 
aurora colo 
he was charged with selling cocaine and conspiracy 
gribetz said he hoped the arrests would allow law enforcement 
officials to make a dent in narcotic trafficking in the area 
gribetz would not say whether any other officials may have been 
involved but said the investigation was continuing 
both nieves one of four hispanics on the 26member force and 
del pilar were considered role models for the hispanic community 
which accounts for about half haverstraws population of 10000 
people said mayor frank haera 
the kids in this town are going to be so disappointed said 
carmen lopez president of la flor the latin american feminine 
league of rockland he nieves is their idol its like kennedy 
dying 
police chief michael holland described nieves as an excellent 
police officer 
victor was an officer we trusted theres tremendous upset in 
the force and in the town holland said

the head of a temple university group that 
advocates white pride says the organization isnt racist but 
was formed to balance the prominority stance taken by school 
officials 
im not against anybody i dont hate anybody said michael 
spletzer leader of the white student union i think we have one 
of the richest cultures in the world but as soon as anything about 
rights for whites comes up its called racism 
a flier promoting the 89member wsu says whites are the only 
major segment of the population that is not encouraged to take pride 
in its heritage and in the achievements of its ancestors it 
encourages people to be white and proud 
spletzer 22 pointed to other temple student groups such as the 
africanamerican student league or the society of black accountants 
or the society of black engineers as examples of organizations that 
use racial designations 
spletzer also said he was disillusioned by temples special 
scholarships for minorities affirmative action programs and the 
educational philosophy 
temple spokeswoman kathy gosliner said tuesday that university 
officials decided to recognize the wsu after reviewing the groups 
application with a lawyer another spokesman said official 
recognition entitles student organizations to use certain university 
facilities a faculty adviser consideration for university office 
space and 1000 annual support for student activities 
the schools chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people will take direct action against 
the wsu if they determine it to be racist said chapter president 
vaughn goodwin 
for one race to come out and say racial pride of others is just 
talk is indirectly indoctrinating racism he said 
gosliner said she did not know whether similar groups had formed 
at other schools

police on wednesday banned all mass 
gatherings in kosovo after five days of huge public demonstrations 
against serbian meddling in the affairs of the restive southern 
province 
in skopje about 15000 macedonians demonstrated outside the 
greek consulate about alleged discrimination against the macedonian 
minority in neighboring northern greece 
the kosovo protests were inspired by the forced resignations from 
the provincial communist party politburo of two members representing 
the ethnic albanian majority kacusa jasari and azem vlasi serbias 
communist party had pressured for the resignations 
kosovo which borders albania is a province of the serbian 
republic but has considerable autonomy serbia has been seeking 
greater control 
since the resignations crowds of up to 100000 have demonstrated 
for the reinstatement of jasari and vlasi 
a statement by the serbian leadership carried by belgrade radio 
wednesday said the protests were inspired by ethnic albanian 
nationalists and separatists ninety percent of kosovos 
population is ethnic albanian 
rahman morina kosovos interior minister said wednesday that 
extraordinary circumstances have taken place which threaten public 
order the official yugoslav news agency tanjug reported 
all those failing to comply with the ban on demonstrations 
will be subject to all legal and other measures tanjug said 
without elaboration 
no demonstrations were reported tuesday or early wednesday from 
pristina the provincial capital 240 miles south of belgrade 
communist party leaders in kosovo have promised to review the 
resignations of jasari and vlasi at a meeting tentatively scheduled 
for this week 
observers said protests may resume unless they are reinstated so 
the ban on gatherings might be preemptive 
slobodan milosevic the serbian party leader pressed for the 
resignations as part of his campaign for greater control of the 
province 
kosovo won broad autonomy in the 1974 constitution which 
milosevic wants changed to protect the serb and montenegrin 
minorities in kosovo from alleged harassment by the ethnic albanian 
majority 
the protest in skopje was a chapter in the decadeslong dispute 
over territory and population in macedonia now divided among 
yugoslavia bulgaria and greece 
officials in greece and yugoslavia frequently argue over what 
yugoslavia says is a large macedonian presence in northern greece 
wednesdays protest was organized by the student union of the 
university in skopje capital of macedonia 
yugoslavias everpresent ethnic problems have become worse since 
an economic crisis and inflation now running at 236 percent 
annually began cutting into living standards the nation has a 
foreign debt of 21 billion 
marketoriented reforms have been introduced to restructure the 
statedominated economy

the judge in the irancontra case wednesday 
gave oliver l north until dec 19 to specify any additional 
government secrets the former presidential aide would disclose in 
his defense at trial 
us district gerhard a gesells order applies to testimony 
about foreign policy secrets norths lawyers expect to elicit during 
courtroom questioning of government officials called as witnesses in 
the case 
it also referred to any documents in norths possession that he 
did not obtain from prosecutors during pretrial discovery several 
hundred thousand pages of secret material were turned over to north 
and of that he served notice he wished to use about 40000 pages 
at trial 
gesell ordered that the list shall be particularized and 
directed only to those documents or other information he considers 
relevant and material to his defense 
norths notice should be accompanied by the underlying 
classified documents and by separate written summaries of any other 
testimonial information the judge said 
gesell ruled that norths lawyers would not have to show the list 
to independent counsel lawrence e walsh thereby preventing 
prosecutors from getting a preview of defense strategy 
the order was issued two days after gesell delivered a pointed 
warning from the bench that he would have very little control 
over the testimony of current or former officials acquainted with 
highsecurity matters 
gesell warned that secret intelligence or diplomatic initiatives 
could be divulged at norths trial which he predicted might get 
under way in late january unless president reagan intervenes to 
prevent the case from going forward 
reagan could invoke the classified information procedures act to 
block secret information from being introduced as evidence 
provoking dismissal of some or all of the charges against north 
in his comments from the bench the judge appealed to the reagan 
administration to focus on the problems posed by disclosure of such 
secrets at a public trial 
gesell had warned that he would be forced to give norths lawyers 
wide latitude to crossexamine many of these witnesses about 
their involvement in sensitive events other than events relevant 
under the indictment 
the former presidential aide and retired marine lieutenant 
colonel is charged with conspiring with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and two arms dealers to illegally divert 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
gesell has yet to rule on the prosecutors motion to strike 
norths nov 14 filing and bar him from introducing any of the 
secret documents into evidence 
in a motion to bar defense use of any of the 40000 pages of 
material walsh accused north of trying to provoke a dismissal 
of the case by threatening to disclose some of our nations most 
valuable secrets wants to disclose when the case goes to trial 
in wednesdays order gesell said that after the additional 
notice is filed dec 19 all classified documents and other 
classified testimonial information the defense presently reasonably 
expects to disclose at trial will have been covered by some form of 
notice 
under the classified information procedures act the judge must 
determine if any of the secret material is relevant to the case and 
admissable as evidence 
if the government is unwilling to allow disclosure of evidence 
that gesell finds is important to norths case he could dismiss 
some of the charges

at least 315 palestinians have been killed in the uprising that 
began nearly a year ago in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
which israel captured from jordan and egypt in 1967 eleven israelis 
have beem slain 
the leftist organization peace now urged israel to negotiate with 
the palestine liberation organization it was time a large national 
group had challenged the governments decision to spurn the plo 
declaration of a palestinian state 
residents of the west bank and gaza closed stores wednesday

leaders called the strike to protest dozens of deportations by 
israel since the uprising began dec 8 1987 among the 15 million 
palestinians who live in the occupied lands

uprising

nearly 60 percent of israelis would prefer a 
joint government of the rival likud and labor parties that excluded 
small extremist factions according to a public opinion survey 
published wednesday 
the leftleaning labor party broke off coalition negotiations 
with the rightwing likud bloc on tuesday but leaders of both 
parties hinted on wednesday that a resumption of contacts was 
possible 
the poll published by the haaretz daily was based on a telephone 
survey of 506 israelis conducted by the private telskar institute 
over two days this week 
it indicated nearly 60 percent wanted an exclusive likudlabor 
government that would change israels electoral system and call new 
elections the paper said it did not give an exact number or a 
margin of error for the survey 
the poll also was carried by the masscirculation maariv daily 
which said most supporters of a joint government were leftwing 
voters who feared extremist religious and antipeace policies could 
be expected from a rightwing cabinet 
prime minister yitzhak shamir the likud leader was charged with 
forming the next government after his party won 40 seats to labors 
39 in the nov 1 parliamentary elections 
aides said tuesday that shamir hoped to build a cabinet by next 
week but negotiations have grown complicated with the seven small 
religious and ultrarightwing factions whose support shamir needs 
to claim a majority in the 120member parliament 
militant parties are vying for control of the housing ministry 
which would enable them to build more jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories 
the religious parties are demanding a who is a jew law that 
would accept only conversions to judaism carried out by orthodox 
rabbis the proposal angered american jewish leaders raising 
concern about a possible erosion of support for israel in the united 
states 
president chaim herzog asked shamir to include labor in a 
broadbased government but labor broke off talks after likud 
refused to concede two out of the three key ministries defense 
foreign affairs and finance 
labor also sought a more clearcut commitment by likud to working 
for a resumption of middle east peace talks 
many saw labors move mainly as a bargaining tactic and signs 
emerged wednesday that leaders of both parties were maneuvering back 
to the negotiating table 
israel radio quoted defense minister yitzhak rabin a labor party 
member as saying his party did not speak of severing contacts but 
only of halting them 
cabinet minister moshe arens who is in charge of likuds 
negotiating strategy said on the radio that the talks could be 
renewed if the other side has the good will and the willingness 
to invest time and effort i think it is possible he said 
industry minister ariel sharon a leading farright member of 
likud was also quoted as saying he hoped contacts with labor would 
be resumed 
maariv quoted shamir as saying he wanted the talks resumed and 
was willing to consider relinquishing the foreign ministry portfolio 
to labor 
israeli newspapers were divided about prospects of a joint 
government 
the last word hasnt been said maariv wrote in an editorial 
even opponents can find some logic to a likudlabor hookup if 
both these parties as a government can prevent the disintegration of 
unity in our people 
other newspapers said prospects of labor and likud getting 
together again appeared slim

millions of rabbits driven by hunger 
heat and drought are swarming across australias arid outback 
devouring all vegetation in their path in one of the worst such 
plagues ever officials said wednesday 
the damage done by the wild rabbits threatens farming and 
livestock 
in addition scientists from the south australian state 
governments animal and plant control commission said they were 
trying to measure the ecological impact of the infestation which 
has ravaged thousands of square miles of the sparsely populated 
interior called the outback 
the plague follows a drought that has lasted for weeks 
farmers said dead and dying rabbits were filling dried river beds 
and water holes news reports said the rabbits were so desperate for 
food and water they were licking plates left by campers 
the quinyambie cattle station several hundred miles north of 
adelaide said it was overrun with rabbits brian cooke the 
commissions senior research officer estimated 24 million rabbits 
invaded the ranch 
but ron hyde manager of the 2800squaremile station on the 
border between the state of south australia and new south wales 
said he thought the estimate was low 
some areas of the ground are virtually moving around here 
there are so many of them he said by radio telephone every 
inch of shade beneath trees and bushes and by fence posts is packed 
with rabbits trying to escape the sun 
cooke said it was the worst plague on record ive never seen 
anything like it he said describing a field trip where thousands 
of rabbits huddled in the shade to escape the 115degree summer heat 
rabbits introduced by the first european settlers 200 years ago 
took to australia because it has no natural predators they became 
one of the worst pests on the island continent 
he said the explosion in rabbit numbers began in a 
155000squaremile mainly pastoral region in far northeast south 
australia and part of new south wales and that the animals were 
moving south where it is cooler 
australias wild rabbit population is estimated to exceed 200 
million or about 13 rabbits for every australian according to the 
governmentfunded bureau of agricultural and resource economics 
rabbits cost australia millions of dollars a year in lost 
agricultural production the bureau said they produce six to seven 
litters a year bearing about five to six offspring each time 
the drought has left rabbits high and dry said cooke 
theyve eaten the place out millions of them are dropping dead 
they have eaten out all the vegetation he said without 
successful regeneration these areas will become increasingly 
treeless with no feed and shelter for stock and wildlife during the 
drought years 
the outback abounds with wildlife such as kangaroos wild horses 
buffalo goanna lizards and dingoes the native australian wild dog 
as well as fragile plants not found outside australia 
commercial shooters are having a field day on the quinyambie 
ranch shooting up to 400 rabbits a night for their skins and for 
use in pet food hyde said two teams of 12 shooters each were 
operating on his property 
even if they shot one million rabbits each it would have 
virtually no impact on the population he said

the transportation department said wednesday it 
plans to require automakers to install shoulder harnesses for 
rearseat passengers in cars beginning with the 1990 model year 
the action was announced only hours after a research group made 
up primarily of trial lawyers criticized the departments highway 
safety agency for not moving quickly enough on the issue 
critics for several years have raised questions about the degree 
of safety provided by the lap belts alone an estimated 150 million 
cars have only lap belts in the rear 
in some types of accidents the laponly configuration actually 
contributed to the severity of some injuries because of the 
jackknifing of bodies upon impact 
many automakers in recent years have begun providing the shoulder 
belts in rear seats because of the mounting criticism and a string 
of court cases that have stemmed from injuries sustained by 
passengers wearing only lap belts 
the proposed regulation which is likely not to become final 
until next year applies only to new cars and does not address the 
question of retrofitting automobiles now on the road 
shoulder harnesses now are required only for frontseat 
occupants some auto manufacturers have offered retrofit kits for 
the rear but the kits are said to be difficult to find through auto 
dealerships and relatively expensive 
the national highway traffic safety administration which is part 
of the transportation department said the new rule starting with 
cars introduced next september will also apply to small trucks 
convertibles vans and utility vehicles a year later

indictment on charges of fraud criminal association and tax evasion 
judge jose maria vazquez honrubia said it would be at least a 
week before heber jentzsch of los angeles sees a second judge about 
setting bail 
he told reporters jentzsch was being sent to carabanchel prison 
outside madrid and said the legal process could take months or even 
years before it reaches trial 
vazquez honrubia said authorities had frozen 176 million in 
bank accounts belonging to officials of the usbased church of 
scientology and the churchs drug rehabilitation program narconon 
there is obvious and evident tax fraud here the judge said 
us embassy spokesman bob meade said gerald finn of boston also 
was jailed pending further investigation and two other americans 
were awaiting expulsion 
meade did not identify the two but court records listed them as 
nancy webcyk and william tucker believed to be husband and wife 
edith buchele a west german residing in los angeles said the 
organization would sue the judge immediately because his orders 
are illegal 
she identified herself at a news conference earlier wednesday as 
chief officer in the churchs office of special affairs 
vazquez honrubia ordered a police raid on an international 
meeting in madrid sunday of members of the organization following a 
ninemonth investigation into complaints by spaniards that they had 
been bilked

in the raid that 11 were jailed pending further investigation or 
indictment 10 were ordered expelled and 50 were released

court filled with documents computers and other equipment

other foreigners ordered expelled included two britons two 
italians one french one swiss one swede and one dane the 
organizations attorney in spain jose luis chamorro said 
spains justice ministry twice refused to grant the organization 
legal status as a religious entity 
mr jentzsch has never been in spain before so how could he 
have committed any crime ms buchele protested 
she said he the judge has listed no facts so far and he has 
not stated any crimes either the action has nothing to do with 
justice but reminds us of the spanish inquisition 
the church of scientology founded in the mid1950s by american 
science fiction author and former us navy officer l ron hubbard

a government bill wednesday for the first time laid 
out a charter for britains shadowy mi5 intelligence agency and 
proposed a complaints tribunal but stopped short of making the 
service accountable to parliament 
critics complained that mi5 remained the only secret service in a 
major western democracy shielded from independent scrutiny 
mi5 was accused in recent years of infringing civil liberties by 
tapping telephones of labor union leaders and antinuclear 
campaigners 
the security services bill provides that mi5 agents will need a 
cabinet ministers warrant to bug a building or break into it an 
independent commissioner will monitor granting of warrants 
the bill also provides for a tribunal of lawyers to hear 
complaints from people who suspect they are targets of unwarranted 
or improper surveillance 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government 
meanwhile underscored its commitment to protecting the secrecy of 
its undercover services by banning distribution in britain of a us 
magazine that published a former agents memoirs 
the december issue of harpers contains excerpts from the memoirs 
of anthony cavendish a former officer of mi6 mi5s sister service 
which the high court banned british newspapers from publishing 
harpers publisher john macarthur called the action government 
tyranny and authoritarianism the domestic news agency press 
association said it quoted him as saying the article contained 
nothing which could conceivably compromise national security 
home secretary douglas hurd said in presenting the bill in the 
house of commons i can see there has been a gap in our 
arrangements the absence of any way in which someone aggrieved 
by an action of the service could have that grievance independently 
investigated 
mi5 will still report in secret only to hurd and mrs thatcher 
not parliament the prime minister and i are accountable said 
hurd to jeers from opposition labor party legislators 
labor deputy leader roy hattersley described the bill as a 
small concession in response to the massive concern about the 
uncontrolled indeed sometimes unlawful operations of the security 
services 
the thatcher government battled unsuccessfully for almost three 
years to suppress spycatcher the memoirs of retired mi5 
operative peter wright 
wright claimed mi5 agents bugged and burgled widely in the 
1970s tried to undermine harold wilsons labor government and 
plotted to assassinate eyptian president gamal abdel nasser 
government officials denied the charter was spawned by the wright 
case hurd said the aim was partly to dispel some concern as well 
as misunderstanding about mi5s rules of operation 
the 79yearold service employs about 2000 people but has never 
has a basis in law until recently no british government would even 
acknowledge its existence 
until now agents have not needed individual warrants for 
breakins operating under what one home office official called a 
general directive from the home secretary 
the bill does not affect mi6 which gathers intelligence in 
foreign countries and comes under the foreign office 
scandals increased pressure for some kind of parliamentary 
control over mi5 similar to that imposed on the us central 
intelligence agency 
in 1985 former mi5 employee cathy massiter charged publicly that 
the agency tapped the telephones of labor union leaders on 
instructions from cabinet ministers as well as phones of leaders of 
the campaign for nuclear disarmament 
she said mi5 agents kept tabs on officers of the national council 
for civil liberties 
the bill stipulates that mi5s job is to protect national 
security particularly against terrorism foreign spies and 
sabotage 
some commentators saw the measure as an attempt to deflect 
charges that the thatcher government is excessively secretive these 
are building up round proposals to reform the catchall official 
secrets act 
the bill to be published shortly will make it a crime only to 
divulge confidential information about defense foreign affairs and 
security as opposed to all information as the present law 
stipulates 
but the measure will reinforce the lifetime gag on secret service 
agents and deny civil servants the defense that they leaked 
information in the public interest

the florida supreme court on wednesday 
ordered the state to withhold certification of a congressional race 
that 10term us rep william chappell jr had lost in a recount to 
a political newcomer 
chappell was seeking to have the state elections canvassing 
commission invalidate nearly 11000 votes cast in his home district 
of flagler county because they were filed late 
the court ordered the delay until noon wednesday to allow time to 
consider the request 
republican craig t james of deland had been certified the winner 
of the 4th congressional district race earlier tuesday james won by 
a recount by 732 votes in results certified by gov bob martinez and 
two cabinet members 
the commission declared james the winner after deciding to accept 
ballot box results from flagler county even though that countys 
elections office did not submit its returns within a sevenday 
deadline following the nov 8 general election 
chappells petition said the canvassing board was barred by law 
from accepting flagler countys results because they were submitted 
nov 17 two days after the deadline 
the florida department of state which oversees elections 
planned to fight chappells request because imposing the sevenday 
deadline would mean disenfranchising the voters of flagler county 
we believe that the statute should not prohibit the people of 
flagler county having the results of their vote count said ken 
rouse general counsel for the department the legislature did not 
intend such a harsh result when it enacted the statute in 1951 
james who also was named by chappells lawsuit called the 
action a travesty 
the votes were legitimate votes james said adding that he 
was not concerned about losing im sure the ultimate result will 
be hell get no relief from the supreme court 
etta peterson supervisor of elections in flagler county called 
for comment was not in her office wednesday afternoon said pat 
crook an office worker 
her office had telephoned the results in time but they were not 
received in the mail until later said secretary of state jim smith 
who sits on the canvassing commission 
martinez smith and agriculture commissioner doyle conner who 
were all named in the petition accepted the flagler county results 
after hearing an opinion from former state chief supreme court 
justice alan sundberg who said flagler county residents should not 
be denied their right to vote

the argument over baltic demands for greater 
autonomy spread across this vast nation wednesday attracting 
official condemnation in two republics and a huge public rally of 
support in a third 
government executive bodies in the ukraine and kazakhstan 
condemned estonias declaration of independence from central 
authority their action seemed to presage an official kremlin rebuff 
activists in the freewheeling southern republic of georgia 
however said up to 300000 people gathered outside the legislature 
demanding that the members condemn proposed amendments to the 
national constitution they claim will strengthen central control 
people demanded they refuse this project or separate from the 
soviet union zviad gamsachurdjia said in a telephone call from 
tbilisi capital of georgia people are supporting estonia 
estonias position 
estonia lithuania and latvia the three baltic republics want 
greater economic political and cultural autonomy as part of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs call for greater local control but 
they say gorbachevs own constitutional amendments eliminate the 
right to secede and strengthen central control rather than lessening 
it 
on nov 16 the estonian legislature approved a declaration of 
sovereignty in all areas except defense and foreign policy along 
with an amendment to the estonian constitution giving the republic 
the right to reject any new soviet law 
that posed a major challenge to gorbachev how to continue his 
reform program while keeping ethnic restiveness under control in 15 
republics considered equal under the constitution 
gamsachurdjia said georgian legislators protested new 
constitutional provisions that end the right to secede and allow 
moscow to declare martial law in the republics he added however 
that the crowd outside found that inadequate 
he said hundreds of people were conducting a hunger strike on the 
steps of the legislature building 
tass the official soviet news agency said officials in the 
ukraine and kazakhstan criticized estonias amendment 
it quoted the executive body of the kazakhstan legislature as 
saying the action contradicts the norms of the soviet 
constitution based on the principles of legislative organization 
and the unity of the country and weakens the economic basis of our 
multinational government 
national soviet media have said the estonian declaration incites 
ethnic unrest and accused populist peoples front organizations in 
the baltics of intimidating members of their legislatures 
a commission of the national supreme soviet found estonias 
legislation in violation of the soviet constitution but there has 
been no final word from moscow on the question 
officials in lithuania and latvia managed to hold legislative 
sessions without allowing a vote on similar proposals advocated by 
the peoples fronts 
legislators in armenia were to consider an amendment on the 
estonian model tuesday but their session was adjourned abruptly 
because of increasing ethnic tensions in the caucasus region 
armenia and neighboring azerbaijan are involved in a territorial 
dispute that has caused riots 
in riga latvia the peoples front issued a call wednesday for a 
mass protest of the legislatures failure to vote on autonomy the 
previous day 
peoples front spokesman janis dinevich said by telephone that 
about 25 officials of the organization met for five hours and 
scheduled the protest for saturday 
people are very bitter that almost 1 million signatures went 
without notice he said 
city officials rejected a request for a demonstration in downtown 
riga and suggested two outlying parks he said but the peoples 
front had appealed to the council of ministers 
he said the group expects about 100000 people at the 
demonstration

many incomeconscious savers and investors have 
had a rude introduction lately to a phenomenon known as takeover 
event risk 
until recently owners of corporate bonds or bond mutual funds 
had just two main perils to consider 
the first was credit risk the chance that an issuing company 
might fall on hard times and find itself unable to pay interest on 
schedule or repay the principal when its bonds matured 
credit risk can be minimized by limiting yourself to bonds of 
topquality companies as measured by their credit ratings and 
reputation or by investing in a mutual fund with a widely 
diversified bond portfolio 
the second big question was market risk the possibility that 
increases in inflation and interest rates would depress the market 
value of all outstanding bonds this concern could be mitigated if 
you bought bonds with a firm intention to hold them to maturity 
when they would be paid off at face value 
now thanks to the spreading popularity of leveraged buyouts 
there is a third hazard to consider 
even if a company is prospering and interestrate conditions are 
benign its bonds can fall suddenly in value if a buyout is proposed 
that would load the business down with new highyield or junk 
bond debt 
in the face of huge new buyout proposals lately for companies 
such as rjr nabisco diversification within the corporate bond 
market wasnt much help most corporate bonds fell amid the growing 
perception of takeover risk 
the investing institutions that dominate the bond market have 
raised loud protests and a few recent bond issuers have attached 
provisions to their offerings providing holders with some protection 
in the event of a buyout 
in the meantime what should individual investors do about this 
situation 
avoiding takeover event risk is relatively simple put your 
money in something other than corporate bonds where a takeover is 
impossible or at least unlikely 
consider event risk and suddenly predictability isnt boring 
any more declared one investment firm in an advertisement this 
week touting securities of federal government agencies 
us treasury securities are safest of all from takeover risk 
just as they are from credit risk for mutual fund investors there 
are numerous funds that limit themselves to government securities 
analysts at standard amp poors corp point out that some types of 
corporate bonds remain unlikely to be threatened by takeovers 
generally safe to buy are the bonds of the nations largest 
corporations examples are ibm exxon and dupont sampp said in its 
weekly publication the outlook 
most banks and regulated utilities while they may become 
involved in other types of mergers are also regarded as improbable 
candidates for leveraged buyouts 
if you want to switch money out of a corporatebond investment to 
something else not affected by buyout risk sampp suggests you might 
want to take action before yearend if your tax circumstances warrant 
doing so 
any loss you realize can be used to offset capital gains you 
might have to report 
beyond that up to 3000 in losses can be written off against 
your other income if your overall loss is greater than 3000 the 
balance is carried forward to future years 
assuming that the markets function the way they are supposed to 
corporate bonds that are most vulnerable to takeover event risk will 
be priced in the future at levels that reflect that risk 
the resulting high yields may prove attractive to investors 
willing to gamble that no buyout will occur but people whose prime 
concern is safety will be advised to stay away

a private research group on wednesday charged 
that the seat belts in a vast majority of cars are poorly designed 
and dont provide full protection unless motorists adjust them to 
fit tighter 
the national highway traffic safety administration meanwhile 
announced it will require shoulder harnesses in the rear seats of 
all cars effective in the 1990 model year starting next september 
both lap and shoulder harnesses are now required for frontseat 
passengers but only lap beats are legally necessary in the rear 
many automakers have provided shoulder belts for all seats anyway 
especially in the wake of adverse court rulings on injury suits 
on the separate design issue the institute for injury reduction 
assailed the window shade feature that allows most belts to 
loosen when a car occupant slowly shifts forward or sideways 
this design used in an estimated 120 million cars including 
virtually all us car models built since the mid1970s often keeps 
the belt resting some distance from the body the institute said 
unless the shoulder restraint is manually tightened with a 
slight tug forward on the belt its effectiveness in a crash may be 
reduced significantly benjamin kelley president of the institute 
told a news conference 
the institute which was formed by a group of trial lawyers 
involved in automobile accident litigation called on the nhtsa to 
eliminate the window shade design or short of that begin a 
campaign to warn motorists about the alleged design flaw 
but us automakers contend there is no flaw at all and the 
highway safety agency agrees 
we have no evidence that windowshade belt designs are 
defective or present a safety problem nhtsa administrator diane 
steed said in a statement responding to the institutes charges 
auto manufacturers adopted the belt design in the mid1970s and 
they defend its use because they said it helps get people to 
accept the belts motorists previously had objected to tightfitting 
belts as being too uncomfortable 
the concept was to make the belts more user friendly so we 
could get the percentages of belt users up said bill peacock a 
spokesman for ford motor co who said the tension reliever or 
window shade system cost ford extra money 
john hartnett a spokesman for general motors corp called the 
seat belt design an effective and comfortable seat belt system it 
encourages belt use 
industry spokesmen as well as nhtsa officials acknowleged that if 
the belts are to provide their best protection they should be worn 
snugly but they suggest the tradeoff in having belts that may be 
slightly loosened is that fewer people will reject the belts 
altogether 
the window shade system is designed on a pendulum principal that 
locks the belt tightly when the car decelerates suddenly as in a 
quick stop or an accident while allowing the user to move normally 
at other times 
kelley argued however that the belts sometimes stay loose after 
the user shifts about 
the belt slackness which people often are not even aware of 
can result in horrendous injuries he said while claiming that 
automakers have the technology available to develop belts that do 
not loosen and still meet motorist acceptance 
kelley cited 1982 tests by nhtsa which compared the expected 
injury in a 30 mph crash when belts have various amounts of slack 
with 1 inch of belt slack a test dummy sustained a head injury 
level of about 50 percent greater than if there were no slack at 
all at 2 inches of slack the injury level was nearly twice as 
severe and with a full extension or nearly 17 inches it was about 
4 times as great 
nhtsa officials acknowledged the test results but noted that in 
all the tests except for the one conducted with a full extension of 
slack the head injury levels remained below what would be 
considered life threatening with up to a 2inch slack there was 
no signficant degradation of safety said barry felrice 
associate adminstrator for rulemaking 
the lawyer group also reiterated its complaint that only lap 
belts are in rear seats of an estimated 150 million cars they 
suggested the belts may in some accidents actually cause serious 
injury because of the jackknifing of passengers without shoulder 
belts 
within hours the nhtsa announced the new requirement for 
shoulder harnesses in the rear 
the national transportation safety board several years ago raised 
a firestorm when it came to a similar conclusion after studying a 
number of accidents since then many manufacturers have put 
shoulderharness belt systems in the rear seats 
according to peacock about onethird of the 1989 ford cars have 
rearseat shoulder belts hartnett said all 1989 gm model cars have 
shoulder belts in both front and rear seats many imports have for 
some time had such belts available for passengers in the rear 
nevertheless complained kelley many older cars continue to have 
laponly belts in rear seats exposing passengers to the danger of 
sustaining serious abdominal or head injuries 
nhtsas steed criticized kelley and the lawyer group for 
suggesting that in some cases passengers might be better off not 
wearing a belt 
no matter where you are sitting or what type of belt you have 
available wearing a belt is better than not wearing one she said

a federal grand jury is investigating whether aer 
lingus the irish airline illegally shipped us aircraft parts to 
iran during a sixyear period according to a broadcast report 
wednesday 
the operation was discovered earlier this year when us customs 
agents in miami seized evidence during an investigation of another 
aircraft firm according to wednesdays cbs evening news 
television report 
since 1981 the airline is suspected of selling millions of 
dollars of parts of c130 planes to iran cbs said 
a justice department source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
told the associated press that there was an investigation under way 
but could not comment on its status 
the parts helped iran keep its c130 fleet built up during years 
of peace with america in good condition for the war with iraq cbs 
said 
selling usmade parts for the planes which are used for many 
purposes including supplying troops and refueling jet fighters in 
flight was made illegal after iran seized us hostages at the 
teheran embassy in 1979 
cbs quoted law enforcement sources as saying the airline made a 
huge profit by ordering parts for its own civilian version of the 
c130 and then illegally shipping them from london to iran until 
1987 
cbs said aer lingus confirmed the investigation but refused to 
comment 
it also said the irish embassy acknowledged that the irish 
ambassador visited the state department last month to express his 
governments concern about the case involving the private airline 
if charged with illegally shipping the parts and then convicted 
aer lingus faces several million dollars in fines 
cbs also reported that although an indictment is expected the 
state department has expressed some reservations about bringing 
charges against the national airline of a close ally

the six blacks saved from execution 
wednesday were convicted of complicity in the 1984 mob murder of a 
black town councilor during antiapartheid riots 
no direct evidence emerged that the sharpeville six as they 
became known directly contributed to the victims death 
government leaders churches and human rights groups around the 
world had appealed for clemency for the five men and one woman 
black leaders warned that the hangings might provoke violence 
the slain councilman was killed during riotings that launched a 
twoyear outbreak of nationwide unrest over south africas system of 
racial segregation and hundreds died before it ended 
last march supreme court justice wj human who issued the 
death sentences three years earlier granted a fourweek stay of 
execution for the six two days before they were to be hanged at dawn 
at pretoria central prison 
he said evidence had surfaced that a key prosecution witness had 
perjured himself during the trial 
but efforts to reopen the trial failed and president pw botha 
who commuted the sentences wednesday was the last hope for the 
condemned six 
human had based his decision on a defense application questioning 
the reliability of testimony by prosecution witness joseph manete 
human cited a may 11 1985 statement in which manete said police 
forced him to identify two of the accused as having been at the 
scene 
human said he was never made aware of that statement and 
therefore did not allow the defense to crossexamine manete on that 
point 
if manetes statement had been available i would have allowed 
cross examination human said 
botha had told black anglican archbishop desmond tutu then that 
he would not intervene in the case and that only the finding of 
significant new evidence could save the six 
both the trial court and the appeal court found no evidence that 
the sharpeville six committed the murder 
if ever there was a case for the state president to exercise 
his discretion and grant clemency this is it said defense 
attorney prakash diar diar in pleading that the lives of the six be 
spared 
the six were convicted in a nonjury trial by white judges under 
the doctrine of common cause that held that they were 
responsible for the sept 3 1984 death of sharpeville deputy mayor 
jacob dlamini because they were found to be part of a mob of 100 
people who stoned and burned him to death at sharpeville 40 miles 
south of johannesburg 
black activists frequently targeted black township councilors 
considering them collaborators with the minority whiteled 
government the sharpeville riots were sparked by the local 
councils decision to raise rents 
president reagan prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
and president richard von weizsaecker of west germany were among 
world leaders who asked botha to stop the hangings 
the governments information ministry held news conferences in 
pretoria and cape town showing reporters videotapes of similar mob 
killings 
referring to appeals for clemency dave steward director of the 
bureau for information told reporters in pretoria earlier in the 
year that more than 700 black south africans were burned to death by 
fellow blacks after antiapartheid violence and protests began in 
1984 
no emergency meetings of the united nations security council 
have been held regarding the hundreds who have been killed by mob 
violence he said then adding there had been no international 
expressions of sympathy for dlamini 
the sharpeville six are mojalefa sefatsa reid mokoena oupa 
diniso duma khumalo francis mokgesi and theresa ramashamola ms 
ramashamola is the only woman ever sentenced to death in south 
africa for what many considered a politically motivated offense

americans flocked to airports train and bus stations or took to 
highways wednesday on their thanksgiving trek to friends and 
families while stayathomes defrosted turkeys and polished 
silverware in readiness for the annual day of feasting fellowship 
and football 
airports from new york to seattle braced for record numbers of 
holiday fliers but reported no problems at midday wednesday 
lastminute travelers if they were lucky enough to get a ticket 
had an unwelcome surprise higher air fares because of the 
elimination of certain discounts 
a blustery storm in the northwest that spread rain and snow from 
western washington to northern california and eastward to nevada 
made driving hazardous but appeared to have little effect on air 
travel in florida tropical storm keith moved out into the atlantic 
ocean before the holiday travel crush began 
the real rush hour will come after high noon when hordes of 
motorists will depart this vale of tears in manhattan and head to 
the hinterlands predicted victor ross spokesman for new york 
citys department of transportation hours before the rush hour 
the roads will be jammed by veritable tidal waves of cars like 
lemmings marching to the sea 
he was right his department declared a gridlock alert 
cautioning drivers to expect delays during the evening rush there 
were tieups of up to two hours on the approaches to some bridge and 
tunnel crossings

president reagan said wednesday he 
was vetoing a bill designed to clamp tighter limits on lobbying by 
former federal employees because it was excessive and 
discriminatory and would hamper the governments ability to 
attract toprate people 
in a threepage memorandum explaining why he would allow a 
billsigning deadline to pass at midnight friday reagan complained 
that the legislation had been cobbled together by congress in 
its waning days and said it would have treated former employees of 
the executive branch far more harshly than former members of 
congress and their senior staffs 
the president said that in withholding his approval of the 
postemployment restrictions act i am well aware that there will 
be criticism 
but i must act on this bill according to my judgment of what is 
best for the country he said in a memorandum of disapproval 
reagan invoked his constitutional authority to use the pocket veto 
to kill legislation by failing to sign legislation within 10 working 
days from the time he received it when congress is not in session 
while this bill would not have affected me or my 
administration it is fundamentally flawed and would have made 
securing good government for america substantially more difficult 
reagan said this bill has good provisions which i support but 
on the whole it is flawed excessive and discriminatory 
reagan said he asked 20 cabinet members and agency heads to 
comment on the compromise legislation which passed the congress by 
an overwhelming margin and not one recommended approval 
he said it unreasonably favors congress with restrictions 
lighter than those that would apply to the executive branch 
reagan remained secluded at his ranch in the santa ynez mountains 
not far from this seaside resort city and had no public appearances 
scheduled until his return to washington on sunday 
the bill for the first time would have barred former members of 
congress from lobbying their former colleagues for a year however 
it would have imposed even stricter revolvingdoor rules on 
executive branch employees who already were covered by rules of the 
1978 ethics in government act 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the bill for 
example would have barred contact by most white house staff and 
executive level agency personnel with any executive in 
government 
the result must be obvious he said instead of extending a 
welcome hand to talented people to spend time in government this 
provision says warning government service may be hazardous to 
your livelihood 
reagans prospective veto of the ethics bill drew fire from house 
and senate sponsors of the measure 
rep barney frank dmass chief sponsor of the house version 
said the presidents intended veto was an appalling act of 
hypocrisy in view of george bushs previous endorsement of even 
tighter lobbying curbs contained in the senate bill 
this is the ultimate triumph of the edwin meese 
ethicsschmethics approach to government in which the rule is that 
whatever makes everyone rich makes them happy frank said in a 
telephone interview from boston 
sen carl levin dmich and sen strom thurmond rsc 
cosponsors of the senate version of the bill said they will resume 
their fight for lobbying restrictions when the new congress convenes 
in january 
levin criticized bush for endorsing the ethics bill during his 
presidential campaign but failing to commit himself publicly when a 
reagan veto was being considered 
said thurmond the american people demand and deserve strict 
ethical standards for government officials we may have lost this 
battle but not the war 
fred wertheimer president of the citizens lobby common cause 
said in washington president reagans veto of the most important 
ethics bill enacted by the 100th congress has sealed the anything 
goes ethics legacy of the reagan administration and is an ominous 
sign about the commitment of the incoming bush administration to 
honest and ethical government 
in advance of reagans announcement democratic sen george 
mitchell of maine said in an interview on cable news network i 
would think that after all that has happened in this administration 
deaver nofziger meese all of the other things that have 
happened in this administration if theres any president that ought 
to be enthusiastic about an ethics bill it ought to be this 
president 
however rep dan rostenkowski dill defended reagans action 
he said congress in its rush to go on record as being against 
corruption passed a piece of legislation that is overly broad 
and one which cannot be understood by the very people whose conduct 
it proscribes 
fitzwater said presidentelect george bush discussed the 
legislation with reagan but the spokesman would not say whether 
bush had recommended the veto 
the vice president expressed his views to the president we 
honored the integrity of those views in a private manner he said 
but he did not recommend approval lets put it that way 
during a news conference wednesday morning in washington bush 
said i am going to have an ethics bill and itll be a strong 
one itll be a fair one 
i think there is some recognition that the bill was a very 
good start he said there were some changes in it that i guess 
nobodys really totally happy with 
the bill was spurred at least in part by the wideranging ethics 
problems experienced by reagan administration officials 
former white house aides michael k deaver and lyn nofziger have 
been convicted of charges relating to lobbying activities they 
carried out after leaving the administration 
asked if concern about the socalled sleaze factor played a role 
in reagans decision fitzwater said i think its fair to say 
that it did have an impact in the sense of making us very keenly 
aware that our objections to this bill needed to be based on the 
merits

an investigators report published 
wednesday says the chairman of a leading private bank stole or 
misused more than 300 million in a widening scandal that has rocked 
the government of premier andreas papandreou 
spyros papadatos temporary commissioner appointed by the 
government this month to investigate reported that chairman george 
koskotas systematically siphoned about 135 million from the bank 
of crete which he passed through his own account 
his report said the 34yearold koskotas also used bank money to 
make loans without collateral and give gifts to soccer clubs 
athletes business associates journalists and friends it did not 
say if any illegalities were involved in the loans and gifts 
totaling 200 million 
the socialist government has been accused of dragging its feet in 
opening the investigation and the ministers of public order and 
justice have been forced to resign 
magazines and leading newspapers accused papandreous son george 
the minister of education of being involved in financial dealings 
with koskotas and using his bank to illegally transfer money out of 
greece the reports also named agamemnon koutsogiorgas who serves 
as minister to the premiers office and senior socialist party 
officials 
however wednesdays report did not accuse any political leaders 
of wrongdoing 
koskotas has reportedly said he fled to rio de janeiro brazil 
fearing for his life he disappeared from greece nov6 while under 
police surveillance 
koskotas was suspended as chairman of the bank of crete last 
month and a government commissioner was appointed to investigate 
the banks financial dealings later koskotas was charged with 
fraud and embezzlement 
greece and brazil do not have mutual extradition agreements but 
the government said a warrant has been issued through interpol the 
international police agency for koskotas arrest 
however spokesman paulo marra of the brazilian federal police 
said his forces were searching for the banker because greece asked 
brazilian authorities to locate but not detain him 
under brazilian law koskotas could be extradited to greece only 
by a special order of brazils supreme court 
the commissioners report said koskotas used bank funds to build 
up a publishing empire including five magazines and three national 
daily papers later he bought a controlling interest in a soccer 
club 
koskotas gained control of the bank in 1984 two years after he 
joined its accounting department

the california supreme court dismissed the 
states first clergy malpractice case wednesday ruling that a 
church cant be held responsible for the suicide of a man who had 
sought counseling 
groups representing more than 6000 churches around the country 
had written to the court in support of the churchs position 
the court unanimously threw out a lawsuit brought by the parents 
of kenneth nally 24 who shot himself to death in 1979 after years 
of counseling at a fundamentalist church and one previous suicide 
attempt 
they were seeking 1 million from the grace community church of 
the valley contending the pastors who counseled him for several 
years knew he was suicidal and should have sent him to a 
psychiatrist and that their method of counseling which allegedly 
stressed sin and guilt worsened his depression and helped cause his 
death 
in a key portion of the ruling the court ruled 52 that a church 
counselor or other nonprofessional counselor has no legal duty to 
refer a patient to a psychiatrist or take other steps to prevent 
suicide 
neither the legislature nor the courts have ever imposed a 
legal obligation on persons to take affirmative steps to prevent the 
suicide of one who is not under the care of a physician in a 
hospital said the opinion by chief justice malcolm lucas 
imposing legal duties on pastoral counselors would be 
impractical and quite possibly unconstitutional since those 
duties would necessarily be intertwined with the religious 
philosophy of the particular denomination lucas said 
nally a former honor student and high school baseball star 
received counseling in 1978 and 1979 from several church counselors 
including pastor richard thomson 
nally took an overdose of antidepressant drugs in 1979 and was 
hospitalized telling two pastors the next day he was sorry he 
hadnt killed himself 
he was released the next week and saw several religious 
counselors as well as a psychologist during the next few weeks the 
court said his parents resisted doctors suggestions that he be 
committed to a mental hospital 
he was found dead in a friends apartment 
im surprised anybody would say they dont have a duty to save 
a boys life once they agree to be a suicide counselor for the 
boy said edward barker a lawyer for the parents 
barker said he didnt know whether the ruling contained any 
federal constitutional issues that could be appealed to the us 
supreme court 
the 10000member grace community church in the los angeles 
suburb of sun valley is the largest protestant church in los angeles 
county and includes on its staff counselors who advise parishioners 
and nonmembers on spiritual and emotional problems teach classes 
and sell books and tapes on biblical counseling the counseling is 
free

south africa said wednesday it 
is ready for a formal signing of a regional peace accord in early 
december though it is still working out aspects of the usbrokered 
pact with cuba and angola 
the plan endorsed by south africa on tuesday calls for 
withdrawal of the more than 50000 cuban troops in angola it also 
provides for south africa to set in motion a process for granting 
independence to southwest africa also known as namibia 
cuba and angola announced acceptance of the proposals last friday 
in his brief statement wednesday foreign minister roelof botha 
gave no specific date for a signing ceremony but said it would be 
held in brazzaville congo which served as site of several rounds 
of the peace talks 
botha said his country was still meeting with angola and cuba in 
new york to work on ways of verifying the proposed cuban pullout and 
related issues 
the plan drafted by negotiators in geneva last week calls for a 
phased withdrawal of the cuban troops they have been supporting 
angolas marxist government in its war with rebels backed by south 
africa and the united states 
no reports surfaced that the plan directly addresses the 
13yearold civil war washington says it will continue to support 
the rebels 
but sources have said the proposal calls for the cubans to 
withdraw over a 27month period the process leading to namibian 
independence would likely begin early next year leading to 
elections in august or september the sources said speaking on 
condition of anonymity

about 95 million gallons of untreated 
sewage flowed into new bedford harbor when the power failed at a 
city sewage treatment plant officials said wednesday 
the sewage spill forced the closing of 500 acres of shellfish 
beds by the state division of fisheries and wildlife officials 
said about 8000 acres of shellfish beds are now off limits due to 
pollution 
the outage began about 830 pm tuesday and lasted 14 hours 
affecting both the facilitys main power line and its emergency 
generator said mayor john k bullard 
we had about 4 hours worth of storage capacity so for about 10 
hours we were discharging directly into buzzards bay he said 
the plant built in 1970 has broken down frequently and is one 
of the major lemons of the waste water treatment business bullard 
said 
the mayor said he has signed a consent decree with state and 
federal authorities to have a second 200 million plant in place by 
1994 
bullard said the states tight finances and the federal 
governments withdrawal from funding waste treatment is jeopardizing 
completion of the new plant

peruvians woke up wednesday to find the price 
of milk tripled the cost of bread and rice doubled and gasoline up 
140 percent in the wake of tough new government austerity measures 
the price leaps followed tuesdays announcement by the 
centerleft government of president alan garcia that it would 
devalue the nations currency by half and impose a host of other 
belttightening measures the program intended to pull the nation 
out of a severe recession was the fourth emergency package adopted 
this year 
opposition politicians said wednesday the new package will not be 
effective in ending the severe food shortages and labor strikes 
stemming from the shrinking economy 
alfonso barrantes the former marxist mayor of lima and one of 
the nations most popular leaders told foreign journalists this 
will be a hard blow to the poor and the middle class sectors of the 
country 
independent analyst alejandro toledo said the centerleft 
government of alan garcia must now pay the bill after financing 
two years of economic growth with government subsidies 
after taking office in july 1985 president alan garcia limited 
payments on the nations foreign debt and used funds peru owed to 
international banks to finance his economic recovery program 
the economy grew by 85 percent in 1986 and 7 percent in 1987 
but peru has exhausted its hard currency reserves and the 
government said the economy will shrink by at least 6 percent this 
year 
a similar austerity package announced in september including an 
86 percent currency devaluation failed to slow inflation but 
prompted widespread street protests and sporadic looting 
for the past month peruvians have waited for hours in lines 
several blocks long to buy daily rations of bread sugar rice and 
other staples 
consumer prices rose 9325 percent since january and the 1988 
annual inflation rate is expected to pass 1200 percent the 
previous highest annual inflation rate was 158 percent in 1985 
finance minister abel salinas who announced the latest program 
said the currency devaluation of 50 percent which will drop the 
value of the inti from 250 to 500 intis to the dollar will restrict 
imports and boost exports 
the price increases pushed milk from 96 intis a pint to 250 rice 
from 60 intis a kilogram 22 pounds to 120 and bread from 380 
intis a roll to 10 a gallon of gasoline rose to 600 intis or 120 
the austerity measures include a wage increase of about 50 
percent for most government workers the purpose of the increase is 
to help workers cope with increased prices 
salinas said the government will eliminate subsidies for basic 
food products in stages over the next six months because it lacks 
the money to finance them

field 
no group immediately claimed responsibility even though the two 
dead civilians were roman catholics suspicion fell on the mainly 
catholic irish republican army 
the ira which wants to end british rule of northern ireland is

legal and medical officials want to establish whether it resulted 
from natural causes such as a heart attack the complete coroners 
report is expected in about two weeks

outgunned and outmanned by international drug 
dealers us drug enforcement administration officials lamented 
wednesday that three of their own may have gone bad but vowed to 
end corruption and continue the war on drugs 
we are not naive we realized that tragic situations like this 
can occur said john zienter agentincharge of the deas office 
here 
it has been an especially rough year for the los angeles dea in 
february agents paul seema 52 and george montoya 34 were shot 
to death and agent jose martinez 25 was wounded during an 
undercover drug operation in pasadena two of the drug dealers were 
killed and a third was wounded 
on tuesday three former los angeles dea agents were charged with 
laundering more than 608000 apparently accumulated while dealing 
in the narcotics trade authorities said 
by wednesday zienter and agents tried to overcome the bad news 
of the previous day by focusing attention on their latest weapon in 
the drug war a colt 9mm submachine gun to help combat drug runners 
automatic weapons 
zienter said the new weapons are necessary because of the 
tremendous danger involved in the narcotics business and enforcing 
narcotics laws 
reporters wanted to know what made three law enforcement officers 
sworn to fight crime allegedly decide to join forces with the 
criminals instead 
it certainly makes good police officers sick zienter said 
former dea agents john jackson 39 of claremont and wayne 
countryman 45 of walnut were arrested tuesday and arraigned on a 
charge of conspiring to defraud the united states by obstructing the 
duties of the internal revenue service 
the third exagent darnell garcia 41 of rancho palos verdes 
remained at large authorities believe he may have fled to madrid 
us attorney robert bonner said the three are charged with 
conspiracy to launder the cash and transferring the funds to 
switzerland they are accused of allegedly hiding unreported income 
by transferring us currency to switzerland between 1984 and 1987 
internal revenue service agent john anderson said the 
investigation uncovered evidence that supported the allegation 
that the three former dea agents were involved in money laundering 
and narcotics trafficking during and following their employment as 
special agents 
the affidavit was filed in support of a search of garcias rancho 
palos verdes home the affidavit stated garcia bought a home in 1987 
for 580000 paid for in full jackson bought one in 1988 for 
750000 the affidavit stated 
the 22page affidavit unsealed wednesday included witness 
statements saying that two narcotics traffickers who are fugitives 
from detroit frequented an apartment that garcia rented in los 
angeles the affidavit also detailed numerous trips to europe in 
which the former agents allegedly bought cashiers checks made 
payable to swiss banks 
bonner and assistant us attorney joyce a karlin refused to 
disclose any details about the source of the money but bonner said 
the corrupting effects of drug trafficking was to blame zienter 
refused to discuss the case

schools chancellor richard green on wednesday 
suspended all eight members of a bronx school board after disclosure 
of an investigation of alleged theft and drug use among its members 
bronx district attorney paul gentile said at a wednesday news 
conference that community board 9 in the bronx was the focal 
point of a grand jury probe into the activities of bronx community 
school boards 
it is far more extensive than has been previously reported 
gentile said of allegations of board wrongdoing he refused to give 
details of specific allegations raised in published reports 
green called the suspension of the members of community board 9 
an unusual step but said it was necessary because of the 
investigation and the recent arrest of a principal who worked in the 
district on drug charges 
i do not by suspending them allege that they are guilty of 
anything he said i would hope the due process works in their 
behalf 
gentile said investigators from his office city police and 
members of the board of educations inspector generals office are 
conducting the probe he said it will cover 
the alleged use and distribution of drugs by school board 
members and their subordinates 
the alleged extortion of money under the guise of fund raising 
for school board members running for reelection 
whether principalships assistant principal jobs and other 
posts under the control of the school board are being sold or if 
the jobs are being awarded on a patronage basis 
how school custodians operate afterschool programs and if they 
have been accepting money to keep schools open illegally or failed 
to report alleged drug parties 
the buying and handling of school equipment specifically 
computers word processors and furniture and whether it ends up in 
the schools or in someones house 
green announced the suspensions at a news conference after he met 
for two hours with the members of community board 9 
he said their suspensions were indefinite but that they could 
appeal to the central board of education and that they probably 
would be eligible to be candidates in at the next school board 
election in may 
suspended board member carmelo saez also addressed the news 
conference and said the suspensions were unfair because they had not 
been accused of wrongdoing he denied that board members had used 
drugs or misappropriated school equipment 
green said he has appointed four trustees to oversee the business 
of community board 9 the trustees are two bronx lawyers and two 
board of education employees 
the village voice in its latest issue released wednesday 
detailed allegations of drug use by several board members at regular 
friday night gatherings at ps 64 over the past two years 
the new york times new york post the daily news and new york 
newsday contained similar charges 
the published reports included accounts of school equipment 
allegedly being sold to support board members drug habits and 
charges that principals jobs were sold for as much as 10000 
the reports also said teachers and district employees were often 
pressured into buying fundraising tickets for board members running 
for reelection 
curtis johnson head of community school board 9 was not in the 
office wednesday and could not be reached for comment 
the citys school system which has some 900000 students has 32 
decentralized school districts the board of education sets 
curriculum and general policy but the districts are responsible for 
daytoday operations 
board members who are elected to their post and are paid a 
modest stipend of about 100 a month are responsible for appointing 
principals assistant principals and district superintendents 
district 9 has about 26000 students in 34 schools in the 
predominately black and hispanic south bronx 
gentile said a grand jury has been investigating the matter for 
some time but no indictments are expected any time soon 
he said since the arrest of ps 53 principal matthew barnwell on 
cocaine charges nov 3 his office has been flooded with calls about 
abuses in the system

president pw botha commuted 
the death sentences wednesday of the sharpeville six who were 
convicted in a 1984 riot that marked the start of two years of 
nationwide unrest 
the attorney for another man whose case is similar to the 
sharpeville six said the justice minister stayed his clients 
execution early thursday just hours before he was to hang 
the justice ministry said the six blacks five men and a woman 
will serve prison terms ranging from 18 to 25 years the death 
sentences in 1985 caused worldwide protest 
bothas announcement came hours after the appeal court in 
bloemfontein the nations highest tribunal unanimously rejected a 
petition to reopen the trial 
the sharpeville six were convicted of murder in connection with 
the september 1984 killing of black town councilor kuzwayo dlamini 
by a mob in sharpeville a township south of johannesburg 
no evidence was presented that they contributed physically to his 
death they were convicted under the common purpose doctrine on 
grounds of being active participants in the mob that killed dlamini 
during rent riots 
jack viviers a spokesman for botha refused comment when reached 
by the associated press and the justice ministry gave no reason for 
the presidents action 
botha also commuted the death sentences of four white policemen 
and three black men all of whom had been sentenced to hang for 
murder convictions the justice ministry said they will serve terms 
ranging from 15 years to 25 years 
prakash diar lawyer for the sharpeville six said i think the 
state president might have underestimated the international pressure 
very important heads of state have personally intervened on 
their behalf and i think that has made a difference diar said he 
named president reagan prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
and chancellor helmut kohl of west germany among those who 
interceded on behalf of the sharpeville six 
i am happy for my clients that the state president has sought 
to reprieve them but i am astonished at the number of years they 
are going to be spending in prison 
diar said after wednesdays court ruling that only bothas 
intervention could save his clients the president turned down a 
previous clemency request but said he would consider the matter 
again as a human being once the judicial process was complete 
hassie mokgesi father of sharpeville six defendant francis 
mokgesi said they should have decided to let the boys come 
home 
antiapartheid groups in south africa international human rights 
organizations and numerous foreign governments had urged botha to 
grant clemency to the sharpeville six 
the us embassy issued a statement saying of botha by 
choosing to commute these death sentences he has acted in the 
interests of south africa as a whole 
in london a spokesman for britains foreign office praised 
bothas decision to commute the death sentences saying it was 
news that we welcome very much 
the sharpeville six are mokgesi 31 reid mokoena 24 oupa 
moses diniso 32 duma joshua khumlao 28 reginald sefatsa 32 and 
theresa ramashamola 27 
the group convicted in 1985 had spent 1076 days on death row 
the riots in sharpeville and neighboring townships marked the 
start of more than two years of nationwide black unrest activists 
frequently targeted township councilors for attack saying they were 
collaborators with the whiteled government and its apartheid 
policies of racial segregation 
two of the policemen who received clemency wednesday leon de 
villiers and patrick goosen were convicted of fatally shooting a 
black youth in the eastern cape province after severely beating him 
the attack took place after an allnight drinking bout by the two 
men and other members of their unit 
the other two policemen johannesburg officers jack lagrange and 
robert van der merwe were convicted of carrying out the hired 
killings of two suspected drug dealers in the soweto township 
outside johannesburg 
attorney roshan dehal said justice minister kobie coetsee granted 
an indefinite stay of execution to his client paul setlaba who was 
scheduled to hang thursday morning the independent south africa 
press association reported 
the 23yearold setlaba a black was convicted of murder with 
two younger defendants under the doctrine of common purpose in a 
1985 killing during a consumer boycott 
the appeal court on wednesday rejected a lastminute appeal by 
setlaba 
the stay came shortly after the un security council urged south 
africa to halt the hanging said united nations spokesman francois 
giuliani in new york he said un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar earlier had made a personal appeal to botha for clemency for 
setlaba 
six other people were scheduled to hang thursday morning 
so far this year 110 people including three whites have been 
hanged in south africa

prime minister margaret thatcher is calling an 
international conference in london in march on the risks to the 
worlds ozone layer from manmade chemicals an official said 
wednesday 
every country in the world will be urged to attend environment 
secretary nicholas ridley told a news conference 
he said the aim of the meeting is to warn developing countries of 
the dangers of producing chlorofluorocarbons known as cfcs 
britain and its partners in the 12nation european economic 
community along with 23 other countries signed the 1987 montreal 
protocol which calls for production of cfcs to be cut by 50 percent 
of the 1986 levels by the end of the century the protocol comes 
into force on new years day 
cfcs are used for propellants in aerosol sprays and in making 
refrigerators firefighting equipment disposable food cartons 
plastic foam for insulation and in chemical cleaners in the computer 
industry 
the united states canada scandinavian countries and the soviet 
union have banned their use as propellants 
some scientists say cfcs are destroying the ozone layer of 
protective gases around the earth which prevents the suns harmful 
ultraviolet rays from reaching the surface the rays are known to 
cause cancer 
cfcs are one of the greenhouse gases which include carbon 
dioxide produced by burning coal and oil and which threaten to 
progressively warm up the atmosphere so as to melt the polar ice 
caps raise sea level and change the climate 
ridley said he will visit china dec 10 to persuade the chinese 
to take part in the meeting 
a clear commitment is needed from all world governments 
including those who have not yet signed the protocol if we are to 
have any chance of preventing further damage to the ozone layer it 
is not enough to set objectives our london conference must show how 
they will be achieved in practice ridley said 
ridley said britain wants the global emission of cfcs to be 
reduced by at least 85 percent as soon as possible 
i am convinced of this urgent need by the latest scientific 
evidence he added 
the londonbased friends of the earth environmental group issued 
a statement hailing the new initiative

a psychiatrist examined accused murderer joel 
steinberg wednesday to prepare for a possible switch from an 
innocent plea to an insanity defense in the beating death of his 
adopted 6yearold daughter sources said 
however legal restrictions on such pleas make it unlikely that 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax will allow the switch 
this far into the monthold trial 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer is charged with seconddegree 
murder in lisa steinbergs death the bruised and battered child was 
removed unconscious from steinbergs apartment on nov 2 1987 she 
died three days later 
he says she fell unconscious after choking on food she had 
vomited and that the bruises on her chest and back resulted from his 
trying to revive her 
steinberg 47 was seen by one of the citys most prominent 
forensic psychiatrists in a room at the state supreme court 
building in the borough of queens the sources said 
steinbergs lawyers ira london and adrian diluzio want the 
psychiatrist whose name was withheld to try to explain the 
defendants flat emotional affect after he allegedly beat the 
child to death 
witnesses including police officers paramedics and st 
vincents hospital doctors and nurses have testified that steinberg 
seemed unconcerned and made inappropriate comments while the child 
lay bruised and comatose 
hedda nussbaum steinbergs longtime livein companion told a 
hospital psychiatrist that steinberg acted strangely and made 
bizarre comments after the child fell unconscious 
the law requires that a defendant notify the court within 30 days 
of indictment if he intends to put forth a defense of mental disease 
or defect

a man who hit a 11 million jackpot on a slot 
machine at caesars palace cant keep the money because he wasnt old 
enough to gamble legally a state agency ruled wednesday 
kirk erickson 19 of royal ark won the money aug 5 but the 
jackpot was denied because he wasnt 21 
erickson appealed to the state gaming control board which upheld 
the decision 
it would be an unreasonable if not absurd result to construe 
the statute to prohibit a person under 21 years of age from 
placing wagers on other games and slot machines but not to prohibit 
this same person from collecting winnings the board said 
the decision has no effect on the 21 million lawsuit ericksons 
family filed against the resort seeking both the jackpot and damages

the air line pilots association said wednesday its 
probe of a delta jetliner crash at dallas in august has prompted it 
to seek an emergency modification in takeoff warning systems of all 
boeing 727 jetliners 
the union which represents commercial jet flight crews said it 
had found a serious deficiency in the lack of an inboard wing 
flap position sensor for the stall warning system on 727s 
salt lake citybound delta flight 1141 crashed and burned while 
taking off from dallasfort worth international airport on aug 31 
killing 14 of the 108 on board the boeing 727 
the national transportation safety board said that while flight 
1141 had no problems as it rolled down the runway it encountered 
almost immediate trouble after liftoff and rolled violently from 
left to right before crashing 
as part of its investigation into the crash the ntsb has studied 
whether the takeoff warning system alarm failed on the delta flight 
the alarm is designed to sound if a pilot has not prepared an 
aircraft properly for takeoff such as leaving wing flaps which 
help give a plane lift in the wrong position 
the alpa on wednesday released a letter to leroy a keith 
manager of the faas aircraft certification division in seattle 
from harold f marthinsen director of alpas accident investigation 
department 
in it marthisen noted that the flap position sensor on a 727 is 
located on the outboard wing flap but not on the inboard flap 
if the outboard flaps were properly extended for takeoff but the 
inboard flaps were still retracted marthisen said the warning alarm 
would not sound 
while the ntsb has yet to explore this possible explanation for 
the accident the air line pilots assocation accident investigators 
feel strongly that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that 
such a condition did exist on the accident aircraft marthisen 
wrote 
even if this was not the cause of the delta accident such an 
occurrence could be the cause of another one he wrote urging the 
faa to issue an emergency directive to correct the b727 stall 
warning system 
dave duff faa spokesman in seattle said the regions aircraft 
certification division has started investigating the factors 
mentioned in the letter 
he said the faa plans no action before ntsb hearings on the delta 
crash begin in dallas on tuesday 
michael benson spokesman for the ntsb in washington dc 
declined comment on the alpa letter but noted that the stall 
warning system will be a subject of the ntsb hearings benson said 
alpa is a party to the hearings and can question witnesses about the 
system 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman jack gamble likewise 
declined comment because the stall warning system will be discussed 
at the ntsb hearing 
in september the faa as a precaution ordered operators of 727s 
to check the takeoff alarms the agency announced oct 20 that in 35 
of approximately 1200 727s examined the alarms either did not work 
or worked improperly

the reagan administration says last summers 
drought took such a large bite out of the economy that it will add 
about 3 billion to the reductions needed in next years federal 
budget deficit 
joseph r wright director of the white houses office of 
management and budget said in an interview tuesday that the 
administration now believes the fiscal 1990 deficit will have to be 
slashed by about 35 billion to comply with federal law 
he said that in the 1990 budget the administration currently is 
writing about 15 billion in reductions probably would come from 
various benefit programs for the sick farmers federal retirees and 
others who automatically qualify for government help 
he said the rest would come from a combination of reductions in 
other federal spending sales of federal assets and increases in 
user fees

the inmates really protect the program said ed ligtenberg 
an associate warden in south dakota where 18 minimumsecurity 
inmates are going home for thanksgiving its good for the inmates 
because it gradually reintegrates them to the outside

to passersby along historic strand 
avenue the buildings of old galveston square look like any of the 
other 19thcentury structures restored a few years ago to boost this 
island citys tourism appeal and yet the windows are dusty the 
suites empty the project unfinished 
jr mcconnell was here 
graffiti on a wall of one of the millionaire developers empty 
buildings reflects the conflicting legacy he left when he 
electrocuted himself in jail in july at age 41 while awaiting trial 
on charges of fraud and embezzlement 
in memory of jr the scrawled words say time was too 
short galveston loves you 
mcconnells penchant for extravagance shows in old galveston 
squares iron statues its marble and brass and the huge sculptured 
trumpet that once greeted guests at the 1984 worlds fair in new 
orleans 
mcconnell seemed to be everywhere on this island during those 
glory years of the oil boom when money was plentiful 
he had arrived in houston in 1979 towing a world war ii surplus 
trailer behind an old camaro because he liked to say i couldnt 
afford a uhaul 
in half a dozen years he built a multimilliondollar development 
empire that included 120 companies and hundreds of apartments 
shopping centers and office buildings in houston galveston and 
elsewhere 
then the empire crashed like the price of west texas crude 
mcconnells bankruptcy in 1986 left behind scores of investors 
who lost their life savings by gambling on his promises and 
believing in his benevolence a publicized willingness to 
underwrite civic projects that may have contributed to his downfall 
he was clearly a very complex character and clearly very 
competent at some things including the ability to sell the same 
pieces of property over and over said hl shrub kempner jr 
a galveston banker and financial consultant 
but he was unusual compared to a lot of the scheme guys in 
that he actually tried to build up some quality projects at the same 
time he bilked people out of their money 
mcconnell placed ads in newspapers promising high returns to 
investors a pledge he kept for a while as his finances eroded he 
could keep the promise no longer but still tried 
he signed bank notes giving him access to millions of dollars 
officials said but left loan officers around the country holding 
identical liens 
our investigation could have gone on for years and years and we 
might never have been able to unravel all of it said us 
attorney henry oncken 
mcconnells bankruptcy filing was disastrous small investors 
lost their savings contractors were forced into bankruptcy and 
banks hoping to recoup their losses found others standing in line 
with titles to the same property 
symbolizing the financial and legal mess was the shell of a 
condominiumhotel part of a 440acre project that mcconnell called 
grand beach which stood rotting in the gulf breeze until a fire 
destroyed it last month 
authorities quickly labeled the fire an arson and the list of 
suspects said fire department investigator rusty kattner runs as 
long as the list of creditors 
it was another mcconnell who inspired the mournful graffiti the 
mcconnell who completed other projects with a flourish the 
millionaire developer who worked closely with preservationists to 
rebuild a historic city and boost tourism 
while acknowledging the majority opinion that he did many 
things illegally peter brink director of the galveston 
historical foundation said of mcconnell i still have a certain 
affection for him 
in the end i think he believed he could pull it off and make it 
work i dont think he was out to swindle a lot of people out of 
their money 
many disagree 
he was a crook and a scam man thats all said galveston 
electrical contractor frank norris who said he was forced into 
bankruptcy after mcconnell failed to pay him 170000 
don hubbel a former city councilman who worked two years as a 
top mcconnell assistant in galveston before the bankruptcy filing 
thinks many of the developers dealings ultimately helped the city 
but says mcconnells benevolence always came with a motive 
he never gave a cent of money unless he saw some way that it 
was going to help jr mcconnell said hubbel 
mcconnell was known for working 16hour days and involving 
himself in every aspect of his real estate projects right down to 
his own inspections of the plumbing and electrical systems 
once facing a deadline for completion of a project he bet a 
work crew 10000 that it couldnt finish in time then showed up 
with a briefcase full of cash and honored the debt hubbel said 
he really knew how to do things he said 
of course we know now that he wasnt using his own money but 
it was all first class

the tape was so old it had outlived the 
machinery to play it but through digital wizardry the magic of 
fred astaires dancing will again enchant television audiences 30 
years after his first tv appearance 
that first special an evening with fred astaire costarring 
dance partner barrie chase was first televised oct 17 1958 on 
nbc it won nine emmy awards astaire died in june 1987 at age 88 
the disney channel is bringing back that show along with two 
other specials seven astaire movies and two documentaries in a 
cable tv tribute called hats off to fred astaire that spans 5 
weeks 
the disney channel will air the special this sunday to be 
followed by another evening with fred astaire from 1959 on dec 
18 and astaire time from 1960 on jan 8 1989 
putting that first show together combined elements of a detective 
drama and a science documentary 
this was probably the oldest color videotape still in 
existence said robert rosen director of the ucla film and 
television archive the tape was good the problem was the 
equipment to run it no longer existed we had to track down a 
technician who had worked on the original equipment 
he had a copy of the specifications and we used that to build 
a machine to play the tape we were then able to transfer the show 
onto stateoftheart digital equipment the picture looks better 
today than it did 30 years ago 
rosen and his technical adviser ed reitan showed the results of 
18 months of work at a luncheon attended by astaires widow robin 
chase musical director david rose choreographer hermes pan and 
producer bud yorkin 
the first images on the tv screens were dark and murky next he 
showed how the tape had been restored for a revival on public 
television the picture looked like an overexposed photograph 
finally he showed the special as it will be broadcast on cable the 
picture was crisp and clear and the colors were bright and sharply 
defined it could have been taped yesterday 
theres nothing like it said chase but its also very 
sad its a little too soon to look at it after freds passing im 
pleased with what ucla did i laugh at the thought of my son seeing 
his mom as she used to be i have a sad and nostalgic feeling of the 
emotion i felt when i was doing this 
asked about astaires dancing she replied i dont think what 
fred had is definable its something that touches all generations 
you could use a lot of platitudes which fred would hate fred was a 
man who set out to do his job as well as he could and he had that 
special magic he had the grace of an animal he never made an 
awkward move 
for the special musical director rose assembled an orchestra 
with 18 strings to create a more graceful sound compatible with 
astaires dancing 
usually for a variety show youd have 10 strings he said 
i didnt want the brass to predominate it takes 50 violins to 
equal the volume of one trumpet in a concert hall 
rose said astaire was a perfectionist but there was no ego he 
didnt try to run the show a lot of big stars are perfectionists 
but they do it in a mean way 
rosen said the astaire show was chosen for restoration because 
our strategy was to restore a program the audiences would fall in 
love with that way they would appreciate the need to preserve these 
old programs 
he said the ucla archive is second only to the library of 
congress in the number of old motion picture films and television 
shows it has 
ginger rogers astaires dance partner in four of the films to be 
shown will introduce the motion pictures the films and dates are

pyramid a pbs special on monday night is 
about some worldfamous monuments dedicated to the notion that you 
can take it with you 
based on david macaulays 1975 book pyramid combines 
location shots of some of egypts greatest wonders with an animated 
cartoon story weaving historical gossip about royal family intrigues 
and speculation on how the tombs were built some of them more than 
4000 years ago 
the show clearly explains the details of construction although 
plot twists in the animation a kind of docudrama historical 
cartoon strip tend to get a little too convoluted 
from 3000 to 1100 bc egypt was ruled by kings called 
pharaohs the egyptians believed that when pharaohs died they became 
gods so their tombs were the largest and most elaborate of all 
the ancient egyptians also considered death the beginning of a 
new life in another world this life would last forever they 
believed if certain precautions were taken including preserving 
corpses by mummification 
a pyramids burial chamber held the mummy and all the objects 
actual and symbolic that would help the persons spirit known as 
the ka survive in the afterlife 
one of the reasons we have such a rich legacy of artifacts and 
information much of it about everyday life is that much of it was 
entombed for use in the next world said macaulay who has 
published 14 other books including his latest the way things 
work 
the show includes a visit to a museum with an exhibit of a 
replica taken from a pyramid of an egyptian cattle dealer he 
wanted to take his business with him said macaulay who serves 
as the shows host and guide and so he did in a model he even 
had some accountants in the model to make sure he wasnt 
shortchanged 
the models were as important as real life they were the real 
thing they werent just models in the minds of the egyptians 
macaulay said in an interview 
macaulay spent several weeks on location in february 1986 we 
were given access to all sorts of things that people are not 
normally given access to he said we had for instance the 
cairo museum to ourselves for three nights running 
the film goes beyond the book by showing the urban sprawl that is 
encroaching on the historical sites there are for example some 
glimpses of pyramids near modern residential neighborhoods of giza 
a suburb of cairo 
you can get shots of them from the desert side and it looks 
like theres nothing around them but if you shoot them from the 
building side you end up with little buildings that are five or six 
stories high in front of these pyramids and for the first time you 
really get a sense of the scale of these pyramids 
the great pyramid at giza is 481 feet high or about the size of a 
40story office building it was built with more than 2 million 
blocks of stone some weighing 15 tons and covers the equivalent of 
seven square blocks of midtown manhattan it stretches 755 feet on 
each of its four sides and is so close to geometric perfection that 
the difference between the longest and shortest side is only 7 
inches 
in the book the pyramid and complex of surrounding temples and 
tombs are imaginary they are however based closely on several of 
the pyramids and temples still standing in egypt 
the shows script was written by marc olshaker who also was 
producer in cooperation with macaulay and a group of five 
egyptologists from the united states and egypt 
pyramid is the third pbs production by unicorn projects 
which also did specials on two previous macaulay books 
cathedral in 1986 and castle in 1983

before launching the space shuttle discovery in 
september nasa issued a 72page press kit to describe the mission 
and its astronauts in meticulous detail for the next launch dec 
1 there is no press kit at all 
the difference is that flight 27 is a military mission flown by 
military men to launch a secret military payload all that nasa and 
the air force will say is that the launch will be between 632 and 
932 am est and that there will be five crew members 
because the air force is in charge of sts27 there is none of 
the hoopla that accompanies other shuttle flights no daily morning 
briefings on the readiness of the ship no launchdayminusone 
series of briefings on crew mission and payload no industry 
representatives handing out fact sheets and literature 
the air force undoubtedly would prefer that no one even see the 
launch but it is difficult to hide the liftoff of something 184 
feet tall trailing fire for 700 feet so instead the air force 
tries to give as few advance details as possible 
the flight of atlantis will be only the third time that a shuttle 
mission is strictly for military pursuits 
although the cargo is secret word leaks out atlantis according 
to reports is carrying an intelligencegathering satellite that 
once in its orbit will fly over 80 percent of the soviet union the 
two earlier military missions both in 1985 put satellites into 
orbit one to eavesdrop and two for communications 
the space act of 1958 which created nasa specified that the 
agency was to develop peaceful uses of space in an open program but 
the military always has had and will continue to have a strong role 
in both nasa and space 
in fact before the 1986 challenger accident halted shuttle 
flights for 32 months nasa was so worried it would lose air force 
business that it got the white house to help work out an agreement 
that the military would use onethird of shuttle cargo space 
nasa also fought air force efforts to reestablish expendable 
rockets as means to get satellites into orbits hoping to keep the 
shuttle the sole launch vehicle in light of the challenger accident 
later it was fortunate that the space agency lost that fight and 
some titan rockets already were on the production line 
in its early day the space agency had no rockets so it 
purchased ballistic missiles from the military and fitted them with 
upper stages the armys redstone and the air forces atlas boosted 
the first americans into space 
the early nasa astronauts were military test pilots and until 
the shuttle came along the navy was called in to retrieve 
astronauts and their ships from the water nasa returned the favor 
by making its breakthroughs in materials electronics and computer 
technology available to the military 
as the shuttle was being developed the air force realized it 
could become a valuable military tool and it imposed some design 
changes among them the size of the cargo bay and an increase in its 
ability to land crossrange 
along the way however some disenchantment developed 
nasas openness was anathema to a service that likes secrets so 
when the air force built a shuttle launch pad at vandenberg afb in 
california it tucked it in among hills the air force also tried 
with some success to limit access to the press site at cape 
canaveral citing safety concerns 
at the time of the challenger accident the reserve of expendable 
launch vehicles had dwindled to a dozen and in congressional 
testimony nasa was arguing strongly for retaining the shuttle as the 
sole launch vehicle 
the air force especially thendeputy air force secretary edward 
c aldridge had been fighting for two years to maintain an 
alternate launch route 
the challenger tragedy with its loss of seven lives turned nasa 
around and its plans now are enthusiastically in favor of a mixed 
fleet in which shuttles will launch what only shuttles can launch 
and leave the rest to expendable launch vehicles the irony is nasa 
must buy its singleuse rockets from the air force

for most of this century one west side landmark 
tended to the sick and suffering and provided for the poor but the 
proud hospital finally faced one ailing patient it couldnt heal 
itself 
this was not the fictional st eligius closing down in the final 
season of televisions st elsewhere but st annes hospital a 
reallife anchor in a struggling neighborhood shutting its doors 
after 85 years 
too little income and too much debt proved to be the formula for 
failure one being repeated increasingly in hospitals nationwide 
most of the people feel theyve been deserted walked out on 
said mary volpe a local resident 
it dampens the spirit of the community said alderman danny 
davis it diminishes the quality of life in our community it 
diminishes the level of hope 
across america big cities and small towns alike are losing 
precious hospitals health care is changing demand for beds is 
down costs are up with fewer paying patients and more reliance on 
government programs that critics say are too stingy the nations 
hospital system has reached a breaking point 
were in a healthcare crisis said earl bird president of 
the metropolitan chicago healthcare council an association of local 
hospitals were not heading for anything were in the throes of 
it 
twice in two years record numbers of hospitals have closed 79 
in 1987 17 of them in texas alone and 71 in 1986 the american 
hospital association says in the first 10 months of this year 
preliminary reports show 75 more hospitals shut their doors 
the causes cross demographic boundaries the closings are evenly 
divided between rural and urban hospitals 
while about 30 percent of all hospitals are losing money twice 
that percentage can show their unstaunched flow of red ink comes 
specifically from rising costs of patient treatment said carol 
mccarthy hospital association president 
that she said is a fragile hospital system 
many cities have experienced the decline according to health 
officials 
new york city saw 34 of its 104 hospitals close in 197686 
unlike cities with too many vacant beds new york has 90 percent 
occupancy rates said ken raske president of the greater new york 
hospital association aids and drug problems he said have 
prolonged hospital stays 
from 1983 to the present 22 of los angeles countys 182 
community hospitals have closed or converted to other kinds of care 
chicago has seen 10 hospitals fold since 1984 seven are in 
areas designated as medically underserved meaning they have high 
infant mortality rates large elderly populations and too few 
doctors last year twothirds of all chicago hospitals lost money 
cities mccarthy said are seeing a domino effect a 
hospital serving the poor closes so people move to another one 
nearby which develops the same problems and often suffers the same 
fate 
eventually youre going to wind up with a medical wasteland 
said kenneth robbins president of the illinois hospital association 
the reasons for this collapse arent all negative americans are 
living longer and improved medicine makes most hospital stays 
shorter or even unnecessary a patient once hospitalized 12 days for 
major abdominal surgery for example could now be out in three 
but theres plenty of fingerpointing over dollars and cents 
hospital officials claim the government has shirked 
responsibility by underfunding medicaid which serves the poor and 
medicare which serves the elderly 
they say medicare problems intensified in 1983 after a new system 
began paying hospitals flat fees according to diagnosis some 
hospitals are also worried by a rule that took effect nov 1 
reducing the amount medicare pays for patients who are hospitalized 
for long periods 
in illinois medicare pays only 89 cents for each dollar of care 
while medicaid pays just 67 cents robbins said state officials 
insist their medicaid share is higher but wont say how much 
for every medicaid patient a hospital sees it simply loses 
more money than if it didnt see the patient at all robbins said 
medicaid also can hinder doctor recruitment robbins said 
because reimbursement is so low a doctor in a poor neighborhood 
would have to see three times as many patients as one in a 
comfortable suburb to earn the same salary 
this actually encourages medicaid mills doctors writing 
bogus bills or packing in large numbers of patients for financial 
gain he said 
adding to this squeeze is charity some 37 million americans have 
no insurance in chicago its 20 percent of the population 
illinois hospitals gave 600 million in free care last year 
but state officials say the fault lies not with the government 
but with the hospitals which operate inefficiently and havent kept 
pace with a changing society 
hospitals like st annes are the steel mills of the hospital 
industry said edward duffy former director of the state 
department of public aid people dont use hospitals like they 
used to 
some say both arguments are valid 
its one of those tragic situations where everybody is right 
and everybody is wrong said dr quentin young professor of 
preventive medicine at the university of illinois 
we have created a twotiered system he said people with 
resources who get the benefits and weaknesses of the system and 20 
percent and growing who are locked out that is the tragic dilemma 
of american health care 
its hit hard in austin chicagos largest neighborhood with 
140000 residents the closing of the blocklong 437bed hospital 
two months ago was one more setback in this predominantly black 
section that has grappled with crime white flight panic peddlers 
and slum landlords now its lost a major employer the hospital 
staff once numbered 650 
some people also worry the loss will hurt those who need medical 
help the most but postpone seeking it until the last minute 
poor people do not take time out for preventive health 
services said jacquelin reed chairwoman of the west side health 
coalition if you dont have any medical insurance you wait until 
you have to go to the emergency room 
the remaining neighborhood hospital 2 miles away provides no 
obstetric care and austin has higher than average rates of sexually 
transmitted diseases and an infant mortality rate twice the national 
average 
what doomed st annes is what has destroyed others 
when it closed about 70 percent of its patients were medicaid 
recipients 20 percent more were medicare 
losses were running about 500000 a month had st annes 
remained open they probably would have reached 12 million this 
year said kate stuckmann chief operating officer 
cutbacks in staff and beds the hospital had 120 open when it 
closed werent enough and as doctors left the city they referred 
patients to suburban hospitals 
it was a sad end to a hospital that served valiantly in times of 
tragedy including a 1958 fire that killed 92 children and three 
nuns at our lady of angels school 
even now two months after the closing this community is in a 
state of shock said cynthia williams director of the austin 
peoples action center we basically dont know what to do if an 
accident occurs austin is in crisis

in this tranquil farm town folks are 
accustomed to life without a movie house now theyll have to cope 
without a more precious commodity a hospital 
white hall hospital a main street fixture for nearly eight 
decades is out of business a gone fishing sign is tacked above 
the entrance 
everybodys scared to death said businessman jim ballard 
what if a kid is run over or someone has a heart attack youre 
pretty much left alone its a great loss 
its like youre losing your identity said dr ludwig dech 
a silverhaired physician who was on white halls staff 30 years 
who in the medical community is going to locate where you dont 
have a hospital 
white hall has joined the growing list of farm towns that have 
struggled throughout this decade losing people businesses and 
finally a lifeanddeath resource the hospital 
the question is not whether hospitals will close but which 
ones are going to close whos going to make the decision and 
whats going to be left said robert van hook executive director 
of the national rural health association 
the number of rural hospital closings has jumped from seven in 
1983 to 40 in 1987 van hook said forty percent of last years 
closings he said were in texas arkansas and louisiana 
from 1981 to 1986 admissions to rural community hospitals fell 
24 percent from 84 million to 64 million the american hospital 
association says 
in 1986 the group reports occupancy averaged 55 percent it was 
less than 40 percent among hospitals in texas and those with fewer 
than 50 beds 
the whole system is going into shock said glenn klein a 
consultant hired this year as white halls administrator theres 
not enough money in the system to cover the people 
he should know white hall hospital averaged 40 percent occupancy 
and lost almost 500000 last year it provided 911000 in care for 
which it wasnt reimbursed 
whats ailing americas rural hospitals is similar to whats 
crippling urban ones declining demand and money but in small 
towns the major obstacle seems to be medicare which serves the 
elderly a large chunk of rural hospital patients 
under federal rules rural hospitals receive less per medicare 
patient than urban ones the ruralurban difference is on average 
3637 percent van hook said 
medicare pays by diagnosis so a city hospital treating a stroke 
victim would receive 4055 while a rural hospital would receive 
2990 said tim size executive director of the rural wisconsin 
hospital cooperative 
the dual scale established in 1983 assumes treatment costs are 
lower in smalltown hospitals although rural hospitals are somewhat 
cheaper van hook acknowledged the difference shrivels as cases 
become more complex and the patient load drops 
being underpaid each of the last six years its taken its 
toll van hook said you cant buy new equipment you cant 
raises nurses salaries you cant make the improvements 
the white hall area like many that have witnessed the steady 
exodus of their young people has a larg elderly population almost 
one in five greene county residents is 65 or older nearly 10 
percent of all county residents receive public aid 
those factors helped sink the 30bed hospital last year 85 
percent of hospital patients were medicare or medicaid recipients or 
indigent klein said 
when your reimbursement is primarily medicare and medicaid you 
have a rope around your neck klein said explaining that white 
hall last year received 49 cents for every dollar of services 
provided 
the rural health association filed suit in washington earlier 
this month claiming the dualscale differential was too large and 
rural hospitals were being forced to subsidize medicare 
a similar suit was filed in february by 28 rural missouri 
hospitals which alleged the federal system was arbitrary 
capricious and discriminatory said jerry sill legal counsel for 
the missouri hospital association 
already the loss of rural hospitals has people worried about 
treatment delays 
when you have to have to go 506070 miles things get very 
difficult if youre about to deliver a baby if youre bleeding 
or if somethings wrong you dont need an hour or twohour 
ride van hook said 
and when a small town loses its hospital it also loses doctors 
and nurses and struggles to replace them hampered by having less 
money to offer and fewer amenities we dont have opera every 
saturday night van hook said we often dont have theater many 
times we dont even have mcdonalds 
to combat their financial problems rural hospitals are 
diversifying some in iowa are offering adult day care or turning 
cafeterias into catering services 
for the 3000 residents of white hall there wasnt time to 
diversify 
we did not realize the need to change until it was too late 
klein said noting that local hospitals have been losing patients 
for years to regional hospitals with more services and specialists 
still the hospital didnt give up easily 
in the late 1970s it remodeled to meet government standards a 
few years ago it recruited three doctors klein said reopened an 
obstetrics unit at their request and purchased a building three 
miles away in roodhouse for a clinic 
we guaranteed them a good living klein said we helped 
them in recruiting their patients people thought this would be 
something they could use to build and expand on 
but the doctors notified the hospital board in december they had 
decided to stop delivering babies it was almost a stab in the 
back klein said 
two of the doctors still have hours at the roodhouse clinic the 
remaining doctor working fulltime in white hall said it would be 
too stressful to handle deliveries alone and be on call 24 hours a 
day 
even then the hospital kept trying it cut staff it reduced 
inventory it failed 
this not only affects us emotionally and sentimentally said 
bob moulton hospital board president it also affects us 
economically we lost a payroll of 864000 
that will hurt main street but the impact could go well beyond 
the town no longer has a medical center to stabilize emergency 
patients the nearest hospital is 10 miles away but the ambulances 
making the trip are staffed by county medical technicians untrained 
in such critical tasks as inserting intravenous tubes 
ten miles without primary care services are darn dangerous 
miles klein said the nearest trauma center is 27 miles distant 
and klein said a 40minute ride is potentially fatal for an accident 
or heart attack victim 
when white hall closed in early september and filed chapter 7 
bankruptcy klein said many couldnt believe it 
the community for many years had a waitandsee attitude the 
community could have saved the hospital and kept it open he said 
but there was no point in doing that we didnt have the 
patients

measure of care to give an infant with an uncertain future 
im very careful to let people know im not practicing 
medicine says meeker the hospitals theologically trained 
clinical ethicist also i am not making the decisions the 
physician and the patient they are the decision makers thats the 
only ethical way 
meeker 43 is one of the few ethicists in the country employed 
full time at a hospital a rarity in a group that is itself small 
officials at the american hospital association estimate only 100150 
clinical ethicists are working in any capacity in the united states 
meekers work brings him up against such poignant dilemmas as 
that posed by an 83yearold woman who after her second bout with a 
serious illness told doctors i would just as soon that you allow 
me to die because my chances of recovery are so slim 
can we ethically allow her to die yes meeker said 
he also works often in the hospitals neonatal care unit 
advising doctors to go to great lengths to save the lives of 
desperately ill newborns even though adults in similar conditions 
might be considered hopeless 
when in doubt go all out he said for newborn infants 
its a vast area of doubt our data base is very inadequate so not 
to proceed aggressively is irresponsible 
meeker said in one case the family of an 80yearold woman 
suffering from acute dementia was horrified at the process by which 
she was artificially fed the woman was restrained at all times to 
keep her from pulling the feeding tube from her nose 
so meeker agreed with the familys decision to remove the tube 
hastening the womans death but giving dignity to her final days 
he noted a decline in what he calls issues of physician truth 
telling 
not too long ago physicians would routinely not tell their 
patients theyre dying or they have cancer he said many 
physicians acting out of that model are protecting themselves not 
the patient the second reason that weve gotten away from that has 
been the discovery that people can deal much more easily with 
the truth than with illusion 
concerning a patient who tested positive for aids but refused to 
tell his wife meeker said the patient was persuaded that he had a 
moral obligation to tell her however if he hadnt the physician 
would have been ethically bound to do so meeker said adding 
confidentiality is not an absolute right its a very strong 
right but for very compelling reasons it can be overruled and a 
very compelling reason would be that someone elses life was in 
jeopardy 
meeker said he acts as a facilitator prodding physicians and 
patients to consider all necessary and available information before 
making a decision 
he also provides a few guideposts that any decision must first 
and foremost benefit the patient that it is wrong to take the life 
of the innocent that suicide is wrong and that life is a great 
good but its not the greatest good 
rev kevin orourke director of the center for health care 
ethics based at st louis university medical center said most 
hospitals refer such questions to ethics committees composed of 
doctors nurses and clergymen and other professionals 
only a few very few hospitals have positions such as 
meekers orourke said 
to have an ethics person on staff means that you have a 
continuing educational program the progressive hospitals are moving 
toward that orourke said 
at st johns an 800bed hospital operated by the sisters of 
mercy meeker said my job is integral to the sisters of mercy 
mission to their commitment to really serve the sick and the poor 
meeker a catholic and a harvard honors graduate with a masters 
of divinity from yale and a masters in bioethics from georgetown 
university had been a counsellor at the hospital since 1983 
he said the hospital last year retained him in his present post 
as someone who had both clinical knowledge and a grounding in 
ethics and theology 
he said he approaches his duties with an eastern sensibility that 
he developed as an undergraduate he wrote his honors thesis on 
gandhi and later as a teacher in india 
ethics is a very selfconscious process you dont accept 
something just because its always been that way he said i am 
profoundly a buddhistchristian i think that the structure of 
reality is process the structure of reality is change and growth 
the buddhist tradition is founded on that

year after year enterprising americans and other 
bright folks around the world rediscover old truths and put them 
back to work 
in business for example american companies are learning the 
rudimentary truth that survival in a service society demands 
service or to put it another way that the customer wont come back 
unless the business provides 
the lesson has been known of course from the beginning of 
economic society and the proof was everywhere in the sound 
companies that didnt forget and prospered and the poor companies 
that forgot and went bankrupt 
now in a service society many companies that allegedly provide 
service are learning the hard way that the public expects them to 
follow through not just in their advertising brochures but in 
customer satisfaction 
manufacturers have been learning a lesson too remember quality 
a massive segment of us manufacturing tended to forget that a 
deterioration of product quality eventually would show up in the 
bottom line 
twenty years ago for example some of americas biggest 
manufacturers including carmakers decided that quality was too 
costly on highspeed production lines they sent out imperfect 
products and depended on a secondary industry to repair those 
defects the concept failed 
instead of accepting imperfect cars that were sold with repair 
guarantees americans opted for foreign cars that were made properly 
the first time detroit recovered but not before it had permanently 
lost much of its market 
the string of lessons learned forgotten and relearned goes on 
and on 
in todays credit society some people may have forgotten that 
credit has to be repaid in social welfare areas theres a 
reawakening of the realization that a persons responsibility for 
himself can be assigned to nobody else 
it took a crisis in social security to make people aware that 
they must pump more money into the fund if they expected to take it 
out later and some seers claim that 30 years from now it will take 
another crisis to remind them 
in health insurance benefits it is becoming increasingly clear 
that the more money provided to workers in corporate and union plans 
the higher becomes the cost of medical care offsetting that route 
to painless good health 
and in politics people are face to face with their own creation 
a mammoth government they allowed to evolve allegedly to serve but 
which instead is sopping up tax money at a rate beyond their means 
this latter conflict which can be matched throughout history is 
once again the big issue in washington with a presidentelect 
promising no new taxes while an intellectual elite insists that 
taxes must be raised 
the latest tax drama has a somewhat different script new actors 
and a fresh presentation but it is the same old story government 
cannot provide services expected of it for the revenues offered 
without cutting somewhere 
right now an outpouring of papers and statements urging a tax 
increase is emerging from all corners of the country and their 
authors are running into a presidentelect who has promised to avoid 
doing that very thing 
president reagan wanted to do that same thing but he didnt 
succeed taxes were raised throughout his term bit by bit the tax 
reform passed early in his term was completely undone by the end of 
his second term 
if george bush succeeds well that indeed might be something

romeo and juliet has been reworked for 
a new feature film in which shakespeares stirring prose not to 
mention the basic ins and outs of acting is wasted on 108 of its 
actors 
however armando acosta isnt complaining the expatriate 
american is directing over 108 cats and a lone human british actor 
john hurt in an updated version of the classic love story of a 
couple torn by feuding families 
romeo and juliet acostas first feature film takes the 
unusual cast from cologne to ghent to venice and ultimately to new 
york all dialogue between the cats will be voicedover by such 
actors as rex harrison vanessa redgrave and david bowie 
the cats wont mouthmove said acosta 
there is a close line to the original he said in an 
interview on the set as he petted maria a white angora who plays 
juliet 
shakespeare of course did not write his play for felines nor 
for a new york setting nor a transvestite tramp played by hurt but 
then shakespeare was not the only one to lose something on the way 
to acostas romeo and juliet 
his romeo the ultimate romantic is played by daddy a gray 
persian who was neutered before his first scene it was a fate that 
befell all other tomcats in a bid to prevent chaos on the set 
acostas film scheduled for release in 1989 depicts the 
travails of a venetian kind of class quality cat and the new york 
street quality cat said acosta 
to get the venetian clan to the new world acosta relies on hurt 
who plays a venetian bag lady devoted to her cats who are 
threatened with extinction in venice they are saved by hurt who 
freights them off to new york where they end up feuding with the 
local felines 
it is a very unique idea said hurt decked out in rags and a 
wig during a break in shooting on the gothic canals of ghent 
acostas adopted hometown was chosen for some venice canal scenes 
for logistical reasons 
changing his sex for a role is not all that unusual a challenge 
for hurt in the the elephant man he won critical acclaim for 
his portrayal of john merrick a 19th century englishman who was 
stricken with a disfiguring disease which left him barely 
recognizable 
chosing a male for a womans role is to keep this strange and 
bizarre quality about the movie said acosta 
he hopes the scenes of cats on dark canals massive car junk 
yards coney island hot dog stands and spooky deserted service 
tunnels will similarly add to the films bizarre atmosphere 
we do very little rehearsing spontaneity is the beauty he 
said in contrast to the phony animal movies where you can see 
they are performing in a forced way 
but relying on chance requires filming hundreds of hours of 
footage which takes a healthy bite out of the films 3 million to 
5 million budget 
it will be a monumental editing task he said 
a key scenic shot he said will be 108 cats crossing ghents st 
micheals bridge at dawn against a backdrop of gothic scenery how 
it will look on the screen will depend on the mood of the cats 
whether they cross in a bunch a trickle or whatever said acosta 
caring for his stars is no mean task he said they need vast 
quantities of food vast quantities of work vast quantities of 
love 
the extras have been lodged in a vacant discotheque in this west 
belgian city during shooting at cologne they stayed at a circus 
warehouse all cats went through a fortnight of quarantine before 
being allowed on the set 
while on the road the cats travel with the production team and 
stay in the same hotels acosta shares his room with maria who is 
fussy about her diet she likes chicken but only the breast he 
said 
during shooting huge nets are cast around the scenes to avoid 
any of the actors and actresses from wandering off to check out the 
locals 
making romeo and juliet has been a passion for acosta for 
over two decades after working with such directors as john huston 
and blake edwards romeo and juliet is his first feature film 
once the film has been cut to two hours soviet composer sergei 
prokofievs version of romeo and juliet will be added the 
script has been adapted by british shakespearean actor victor 
spinetti 
the difficulty with the script spinetti said was blending such 
things as cats and cars with shakespeares classic verse 
some cats talk about cars so you have to try to get this into 
the script without the audience jolting out of their seats of 
course you cannot rewrite something like the balcony scene he 
said 
in the end said acosta the play remains a simple 
oldfashioned love story and yes she does die at the end if you 
want to know

tiny footprints recently led 
wildlife officials to a baby rhinoceros the first calf born to a 
herd transplanted to this swampy area from another part of nepal to 
preserve them 
we had initially not expected a baby so soon here when we put 
the rhinos for the first time in this jungle said krisha man 
shrestha the jubilant warden of royal bardia wildlife reserve 
we came to know about the new arrival when we first saw the 
footprints of the baby rhino we followed the tracks and found the 
mother and the baby in good health 
thirteen rhinoceroses have been transported to the bardia reserve 
since 1986 from the chitwan sanctuary 220 dusty miles to the east 
because naturalists feared it was too risky to leave the endangered 
animals in just one area where a single epidemic could wipe them 
out the move was made with the assistance of the world wildlife 
fund 
the reserve 406 miles southwest of katmandu nepals capital is 
similar to chitwan with its tropical lowland and thick highland 
forest 
in the first year we took only four because we felt 
translocating animals of this size was a logistics nightmare said 
hemant raj mishra a noted nepalese naturalist it the 
translocation has never been done before in asia 
the rhinos previously had been found only in the chitwan valley 
75 miles southwest of katmandu in nepals southern plains and in 
kaziranga in the east indian state of assam kiziranga now has the 
most 1000 to 1200 of the onehorned rhinos the second largest 
of the five species of rhinos 
rhino horns remain in great demand in asia and the middle east 
where they are carved into dagger handles or ground to dust to be 
sold as an aphrodesiac consequently wanton hunting and poaching 
had depleted their number to about 100 in the chitwan area 
in 1967 an aerial survey by the united nations food and 
agriculture organization estimated that only 90 to 108 rhions 
remained in chitwan and only 5 percent of the females had calves 
an indication their number was declining 
nepalese officials implemented strict measures to protect the 
animals and their numbers increased to between 350 and 370 in 1986 
officials also found 70 percent of the females had calves a sign of 
healthy growth in the population 
the king mahendra trust for nature conservation a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to preserving natural heritage of nepal had 
conducted research works on the habit and habitat of rhinoceroses in 
collaboration with smithsonian institute in washington dc 
the american and nepalese experts monitored individual rhinos 
movement with radio collaring 
the people involved in the preparation of the operation rhino 
to translocate the huge animals used dart guns with immobilizing 
drugs to capture and cage them 
the cages then were lifted by a crane onto trucks a drive of 
more than 20 hours took the convoy to the bardia district 
when the trucks reached their destination experts brought in 
elephants to make the rhinos feel at home 
when the cages were opened however the rhinos charged and the 
elephants fled 
our elephants had never seen rhinos before said a villager

new religions that have proliferated in america 
in the last two decades arent fading away as they had been widely 
expected to do but instead are growing and multiplying 
this is the finding of research by the rev j gordon melton of 
santa barbara calif director of the institute for the study of 
american religions 
nonconventional religion in the united states has flourished 
for a generation continues to grow and is transforming america 
religiously into a radically pluralistic culture he says 
the anticult movementhas had no measureable affect on the 
development of the unconventional religions which in the last 
decade have continued to grow consolidate gains and expand 
an authority on the countrys increasingly wide religious 
spectrum and editor of the encyclopedia of american religions 
melton says scholarly assumptions had been that new religions soon 
would die out 
but that simply has proved not to be the case he says either 
nowadays when theyve cropped up profusely or in the past 
he says fresh data collected on 835 new religions formed since 
1940 most of them in the last 20 years only 125 now are defunct 
while most have shown a decadebydecade growth 
in a paper presented at a meeting of the american academy of 
religion in chicago last weekend he said 
while some groups have experienced ups and downs mosthave 
shown a pattern of continued highlevel recruitment of new members 
net growth and geographical spread 
melton a united methodist over the last year surveyed us 
religion groups for a new edition of the religion encyclopedia to be 
published in december it describes 1586 us faiths old and new 
he said there have been numerous false assumptions about new 
religions that have attained the status of truisms including 
these 
that new religions often called cults mainly emerge in 
periods of social turmoil 
that they are transitory depending on some charismatic leader 
and usually break up and gradually die out after the leader dies 
that they are deviant weird and largely irrelevant religions 
on the margins of culture 
actually he said most of them are offshoots of older religions 
such as hinduism buddhism islam theosophy spiritualism 
adventism christian science mormons or others 
most of those groups we refer to as cults are simply 
representative of these older religious traditions which are 
rapidly diffusing through the western nations he said 
the most common misassumption melton said has been that the new 
religions were less than genuine and simply a passing phenomenon 
that would disappear under social and legal pressure 
the opposite seems to be the case he said as new 
nonconventional religions continue to emerge the older groups have 
shown an amazing staying power 
he said the past framework for studying cults has viewed them 
as small ephemeral disconnected and essentially ahistorical 
groups which exist on the margin of society deviating from its 
normative central core 
however he said the survey shows a decade by decade growth in 
the number of additional religious groups and no rapid delcine of 
older groups 
while a few nonconventional religions do in fact come and go 
quickly and while most pass through unstable phases especially in 
their first generation the great majority which survive the first 
decade continue to become stable organizations and longterm factors 
in the religious ecology of their communities 
as for the idea that the groups gradually disappear after the 
death of their charismatic leaders melton this hasnt generally 
been the case 
citing cases of various groups whose founderleader had died 
such as scientology the way international hare krishnas alamo 
christian foundation and international buddhist meditation center 
melton said 
each group passed through a brief period of 
mourningcompletely absent were any signs of significant internal 
turmoil and noteworthy problems with a transition of authority 
he said another widely held misassumption was that new religions 
grew out of social turmoil such as in the l960s 
in fact he said the exact opposite seems to be the case 
citing figures from his survey he said the marked rise in new 
religions began in the 1950s but increased in each decade since 
then up to the present 
he said immigration also has increased moslems buddhists and 
hindus in america not counted among new religions but the new 
religions often derive from the older asian traditions 
while the new groups may have little impact themselves he said 
that combined with the immigration influx they are participating 
in the reorientation of american religious life away from an 
exclusively judeochristian format

scores of government and private experts are 
poring over computer printouts and maybe a crystal ball or two as 
they prepare for the agriculture departments 65th annual 
agricultural outlook conference this week 
these experts will outline their 1989 forecasts for farmers 
consumers and world traders but the experts usually hedge their 
predictions just in case 
a year ago for example none foresaw the devastating drought 
that swept across much of the nation in the spring of 1988 or the 
economic grief it caused for hardpressed farmers trying to recover 
from earlier financial troubles 
for others whose crops escaped severe damage from summer heat and 
drought the year turned out profitably as market prices of wheat 
feed grains and soybeans climbed in response to reduced supplies 
this weeks conference which begins on tuesday and concludes at 
midday thursday will attract hundreds of onlookers 
they will represent both the public and private sectors 
including information specialists market analysts lobbyists 
consultants advisers congressional staffers and others whose 
livelihoods depend on uptodate accurate information 
nearly all will be watching for new signs or projections that may 
direct their paths in 1989 any indication of trends ending 
beginning or continuing 
the usdas role in national statistics and economics goes back to 
its official beginnings during the civil war gradually as congress 
expanded the departments functions and authority expert 
information became a precious commodity in itself to be made public 
and distributed widely 
in 1922 under the guidance of agriculture secretary henry c 
wallace whose son henry a wallace would one day also become 
secretary of agriculture the department began a world survey of 
agricultural conditions 
a new bureau of agricultural economics was created and a 
movement got under way to make available to farmers the results of 
economic research to aid them in planning production and marketing 
for the coming year says one usda history 
the first outlook conference was held april 2021 1923 it was 
so popular that another was held on july 1112 the same year 
early emphasis at the conferences was pretty heavy on crops 
and the outlook for planting usda historian doug bowers said in a 
telephone interview and the repeat of meetings in july was only a 
oneshot deal he said 
annual outlook conferences were held thereafter mostly in the 
fall when farmers began looking ahead to the following springs 
planting and other work 
the fall scheduling held until the late 1960s and early 1970s 
bowers said at that time the outlook meetings were shifted to 
february 
that worked out better for some economic numbers but didnt 
help farmers very much bowers said it didnt last long 
beginning in the early 1970s when the soviet union roared to 
life as a big buyer of us grain the annual conferences have 
included a heavy agenda of discussion on world trade and its 
importance to the united states 
other topical changes were made to include talks papers panel 
discussions and thick reports on human nutrition rural poverty 
housing food stamps federal inspection of food products 
transportation environmental issues and family finances 
in recent years farm credit exports water quality 
conservation and trade negotiations have been high on the list 
meantime conference workshops and sessions still include the 
latest outlooks for farm commodities the crops and livestock 
products that are the main stem of the agricultural economy 
this years conference format follows pretty much the scheduling 
of recent years with some of the most important material on tap the 
opening day 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng who has said he will 
retire with the reagan administration in january will open the 
conference 
wayne d angell member of the board of governors of the federal 
reserve system will offer a general economic outlook for 1989 he 
will be followed by james r donald chairman of the usdas world 
agricultural outlook board with a look at the us and world 
agricultural situation 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg will talk about 
prospects for agricultural trade 
on the final day of the conference experts will discuss the 
significance of this years drought on 1989 operations including 
the droughts impact on us policies and programs 
the farm credit system and the restructuring of farmers home 
administration loans also will be on the thursday morning program 
along with us trade repesentative clayton yeutter who will 
discuss trade negotiations and other trade issues

1700s it was not a bright spot in terms of the human condition it 
was a time of ignorance and for kunta it was an especially bad time 
we pick up the story seven years after he arrived in this 
country and four years after you last saw me in the role in roots 
we start with the whipping scene and use the film from the original 
show 
burton added for me kunta was always a proud brave strong 
african warrior and when we first see him in this show that flame 
is all but gone spiritually and emotionally hes in pain and for 
me to portray that im in pain i have a strong identification with 
this character there are some areas in our lives where we just 
overlap 
in the movie kunta who is hungering for freedom becomes 
involved with the underground railroad smuggling slaves out of the 
south fiddler is reluctant to jeopardize the privileges he has 
spent a lifetime earning yet becomes kuntas fellow worker on the 
railroad 
roots the gift set at christmastime 1775 also stars avery 
brooks as a free man of color shaun cassidy as a secret 
southern abolitionist running the railroad kate mulgrew as a 
runaway slave catcher and john mcmartin and michael learned as 
cassidys slaveowning parents 
burton in some ways sees himself as a modernday kunta kinte the 
free man of africa 
there is a direct thread between kunta and geordi and i am in 
the middle he said if i were playing my own life story id be 
playing a kunta of the 80s i have a great life i have the most 
charmed existence in this life this year has been the most 
rewarding financially for me in 12 years as an actor im doing 
star trek i did roots the gift and im doing my pbs series 
reading rainbow 
in the current season of star trek burtons character has 
been promoted from helmsmannavigator to chief engineer 
geordi will have more authority and more responsibility he 
said this will give him more physical presence last year they 
had to introduce a new cast so the focus went to captain picard 
data and riker geordi never had that particular expertise to 
contribute it was important to find his niche 
we came up with this promotion and it solves a lot of problems 
i now have a better working schedule for one thing the first two 
days of each shooting schedule are bridge days and since im rarely 
on the bridge now i have those days off 
burton said he doubts that he will have much time during next 
years hiatus except to work on reading rainbow the writers 
strike last summer has pushed the production schedule back 
he is not signed for any future projects but has his eye on a 
feature film being prepared by george lucas on the black tuskegee 
airmen of world war ii 
the projects been kicking around for 12 years he said i 
hope that when it finally comes up itll coincide with my hiatus i 
really want to be in on this its a terrific story of the black 
pilots nobody wanted they were put into their own fighter squadron 
and had the best kill ratio in the war then they were completely 
ignored by the country they served

your chances of finding a cheap air fare are a 
lot smaller today than they were a day earlier 
the nations biggest airlines said tuesday they are going through 
with previouslydisclosed plans to boost most of their lowest 
discount air fares and eliminate the cheap fares that can be booked 
a few days before a flight 
the changes announced last week would revamp the popular 
advancepurchase maxsaver fares used by most vacation travelers 
they would also drop the socalled junk fares available four to 
seven days before a flight which are used mainly by business 
travelers 
the changes went into effect at midnight tuesday 
carriers adopting the changes include united airlines american 
airlines northwest airlines trans world airlines inc and delta 
air lines 
under the maxsaver changes fares for longer flights generally 
will be raised while those for shorter hauls will mostly be reduced 
that means roughly twothirds of the fares will go up while the 
remainder will fall 
the new formula based on flight mileage replaces the airlines 
past practice of setting fares according to competition on 
individual routes 
the changes in maxsaver fares generally range from a 20 
reduction to a 40 increase on a roundtrip ticket 
we have been heavily inundated with phone calls said david 
perelman president of dms travel inc in midtown manhattan 
he noted that the demise of the lastminute junk fares means for 
example that a passenger flying from newark nj to kansas city 
mo would pay 296 round trip if he booked tuesday on a threeday 
advance basis but as of wednesday the cheapest roundtrip fare for 
the same trip will be 757 perelman said 
there are some exceptions to the changes american airlines for 
example said it wont go along with them in those cities where it 
competes with midway airlines a smaller carrier that didnt match 
the changes 
similarly texas air corp subsidiary eastern airlines doesnt 
plan to make the changes in the highly competitive market linking 
the northeast and florida delta will put off making the revisions 
in that market as long as eastern does said delta spokesman jim 
lundy in atlanta 
but a substantial majority of discount fares will be adjusted 
the changes were initiated by continental airlines and quickly 
matched by the other big carriers which were emboldened by strong 
recent growth in passenger traffic 
continental another texas air subsidiary customarily has been a 
pacesetter in cutting fares but the stronger traffic has spurred it 
to switch directions 
the airline used to slash fares to attract more passengers and 
its moves quickly were mimicked by the other big carriers in an 
effort to remain competitive now continentals improving traffic 
has made it a leader in fare hikes rather than cuts at least for 
the moment 
airline analysts stress that the big test of the airlines 
strength will come in january and february when passenger traffic 
is seasonally weak

a survey about workplace sex harassment suggests 
90 percent of big corporations get complaints from female employees 
and that the problem is costing the average major company 67 
million a year in expenses 
at the same time the survey released tuesday suggested most 
corporate employers neglect easy and inexpensive methods for 
eradicating sexual harassment and relatively few complaints are 
lodged 
women are still not complaining early enough because its not 
safe to complain said freada klein a management consultant who 
analyzed the survey conducted by working woman magazine and 
published in its december edition harassment tends to escalate if 
its not stopped promptly 
among other significant findings the survey found more than a 
third of the 160 companies that responded had been sued by victims 
a quarter had been sued repeatedly and twothirds of complaints are 
made against immediate supervisors and upper management 
in addition major companies spend an average of 67 million a 
year in sexharassment related costs ms klein said the figure was 
calculated based on costs of absenteeism low productivity and 
employee turnover 
in 1987 a record 32 million was paid by one company k mart 
corp to settle a single sexual harassment case 
working woman called the survey the first scientific sampling of 
sex harassment at major us companies 
it said the results offer important lessons about the high cost 
companies pay for ignoring the problem and provide a sobering look 
at how widespread legal problems concerning sexual harassment have 
become 
the survey said the overwhelming number of incidents were 
reported by women complaining about unwanted attention from men 
a law banning sexual discrimination is part of the 1964 civil 
rights act but was not enforced or defined until the equal 
employment opportunity commission published guidelines to help 
companies conform to the law in 1980 
the commission said sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual 
advance request for sexual favors and other verbal or physical 
conduct of a sexual nature that is connnected to employment 
decisions or that establishes an intimidating hostile or offensive 
working environment 
this is no longer the stereotypical old boss chasing the pretty 
young secretary around the desk said anne mollegen smith working 
woman editor in chief if companies dont deal with it better 
this is a financial time bomb for american business 
the survey suggested many companies are responding to the 
problem at least partly because they fear the adverse publicity and 
litigation costs associated with harassment complaints two out of 
10 offenders are eventually discharged and others are given verbal 
or written warnings the survey found 
personnel human resources and equal opportunity officers who 
represent 33 million employees at 160 of the nations 1000 biggest 
corporations responded to the magazines 49question survey

antoni noles wasnt that happy three years 
ago when tobacco company rj reynolds industries inc bought 
nabisco brands inc his employer at the factory that makes animal 
crackers oreos and other cookies and crackers 
smoking and cookiemaking dont really mix said noles a 
batter mixer from ridgewood with 18 years at the company 
for noles history is repeating itself with the 20 billionplus 
auction of rjr nabisco inc which could result in the sale of 
assets such as the cookie plant to pay for debt incurred by the 
eventual purchaser 
you dont know where youre going to go from here noles said 
echoing many of the workers interviewed tuesday morning at the 
plants gates ed nesbihal said he was taking the bidding battle one 
day at a time he said thats what happens when youre at the 
bottom of the ladder and you got money men at the top 
many at the plant have put in long stints nesbihal has spent 15 
years most recently as a grounds maintenance man 
nesbihal said employees at fair lawn generally were happy having 
weather the buyout by reynolds cost cutting that reduced the 
1400strong workforce at the plant to about 800 and the continuing 
threat of layoffs because of modernization 
we enjoy working here but its not up to us whether we stay 
he said 
it could be up to one of three groups that may have to sell 
assets 
the bidders are senior rjr nabisco managers backed by shearson 
lehman hutton inc and salomon inc kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
backed by drexel burnham lambert inc and merrill lynch co and 
first boston corp and resource holdings inc the bids all exceed 
21 billion 
art scala of haskill who works in the plants maintenance stock 
room said he hoped a new owner would take into account the welfare 
of the company and its people not just money 
the plant one of nine nabisco cookie and cracker factories was 
built in 1959 less than 20 miles from new york city in affluent 
bergen county the plants prominent nabisco sign looms over a busy 
roadway and baking odors fill the air 
the plant may be one of nabiscos more secure operations because 
it makes some of its best known products ritz crackers oreo 
cookies and fig newtons 
it also is the worlds only source of barnums animals crackers 
producing 50 million boxes a year or 7 million cookies a day said 
nabisco spokeswoman caroline fee at corporate offices in parsippany 
nabisco has about 100 manufacturing facilities worldwide with 
about onethird of them in the united states about half its 47000 
employees work overseas ms fee said 
noles said money has become a concern of many workers who feel 
uncertainty because of the wall street bidding war 
everybody is mostly saving everything they can he said 
noles said that after the reynolds purchase in 1985 management told 
plant workers that it would be the last change in ownership 
we dont know who to believe he said 
not all who stopped outside the plants gates were troubled by 
the financial developments involving nabisco 
weve been producing said carl vetter a mixer who lives in 
butler we dont see em he said referring to the companys 
owners

a lackadaisical approach to developing 
high definition television could have a ripple effect that would 
doom several other key us high technology industries according to 
a trade group 
the technologies are so closely linked that failing to 
aggressively pursue the high definition tv market which experts 
predict will total 40 billion within 20 years could devastate the 
us share of the personal computer semiconductor and automated 
manufacturing equipment markets according to an economic impact 
study released tuesday by the american electronics association 
hdtv will provide the very lifeblood for existing and future 
technologies said pat hill hubbard vice president of the 
industry group nonparticipation means a loss of both broad 
technological knowhow and an expanded potential for skilled 
electronics employment 
nations that take the lead in the emerging field will claim 
leadership in research and development design and manufacturing 
she said 
the japanese have spent 700 million on high definition 
television technology in the last 20 years compared to the very 
little spent by us companies said aea spokesman john hatch 
the result of the research is a television picture with the 
quality of a 35 millimeter photographic slide will be marketed for 
between 3000 and 5000 by 1991 at the latest hatch said 
we feel we have 5 to 10 years to catch up with the japanese 
market penetration because of the high costand the inability for 
it to be shown on regular tvs said hatch 
the japanese high definition television uses a different 
broadcasting standard than the us standard and so will likely be 
available initially only on cable videotape recorders and 
satellite he said 
although the startup costs are high and profits will be low or 
nonexistent for up to 10 years the group called for cooperation in 
the field by industry government and academia in order to preserve 
us competitiveness 
its a case of putting up a pretty hefty investment and not 
getting anything back for 5 to 10 years said hatch us 
companies are not used to that so its going to take a different 
mindset 
hubbard called the report a working document that is subject 
to refinement but she said the trends were clear 
the us share of the personal computer market would drop from 70 
percent currently to 35 percent by the year 2010 if us firms 
obtain less than 10 percent of the high definition television 
market the report said to maintain its 70 percent market share 
the us must claim 50 percent of the new television market the 
report said 
similarly the us share of the worlds automated manufacturing 
equipment market could drop from the current 35 percent to 28 
percent unless the united states holds 30 percent of the new 
television market 
and the united states semiconductor market share would drop from 
41 percent to 21 percent by 2010 if the us fails to capture more 
than 10 percent of the emerging market 
the aea represents 3500 high technology firms throughout the 
country

the embattled government of president alan 
garcia devalued perus currency by 50 percent and imposed other 
severe austerity measures to meet the countrys worsening economic 
crisis 
economy minister abel salinas announced the measures in a 
nationwide television address tuesday 
salinas said the government would eliminate subsidies for basic 
food products in stages over the next six months because it did not 
have the money to finance them 
the first reduction would be implemented immediately and would 
double the prices of some food staples salinas said he said the 
measures are aimed at fighting inflation expected to reach 1500 
percent annually this year 
salinas said severe economic measures implemented in early 
september which included an 86percent currency devaualtion had 
not succeeded in reducing the countrys huge deficit 
independent economists estimate the deficit has since increased 
from 16 percent to 18 percent of the gross national product 
salinas said the curencys official exchange rate was being 
devalued from 250 intis per dollar to 500 intis per dollar to boost 
exports and bring in badly needed dollars 
the inti traded tuesday on the parallel market a legal 
freemarket currency exchange for 625 to the dollar 
to offset the measures impact on the poor the government 
decreed an increase in the monthly minimum wage from 15000 to 
24000 intis 
sporadic food rioting broke out after the september austerity 
package was announced and rumors of a military coup have since 
circulated 
at one point garcia offerd to resign but was persuaded to stay 
by leaders of his populist aprista party according to senior 
government officials 
garcia took office in 1985 gaining international attention when 
he defiantly set a ceiling on the countrys foreign debt payments 
equal to 10 percent of export earnings 
he used the money to generate record economic growth of 85 
percent in 1986 and 67 percent in 1987 but peru has exhausted its 
hard currency reserves and the government has said the economy will 
shrink by at least 6 percent this year

a state lawmaker says he wants to give a 
whole new meaning to the term floating craps game by legalizing 
ferryboat gambling on lake michigan and lake superior 
state sen joseph andrea said tuesday he would reintroduce a 
measure to allow the gambling and he said the odds of it passing 
are good 
the democrat from the lake michigan port city of kenosha said his 
proposal would apply as soon as a ferry was 1000 feet or more away 
from wisconsins lakeshores 
there now is only one ferry operation on the lakes it runs on 
lake michigan between ludington mich and two rivers wis 
ferryboat gambling would bring in waves of tourists to 
wisconsin andrea said the additional tourist trade would be a 
real boon to local businesses and to the state treasury 
in wisconsin allowing ferryboat gambling would require a 
constitutional amendment which would have to clear two successive 
sessions of the legislature and a statewide referendum 
voters last year approved amendments permitting a state lottery 
and parimutuel gambling those proposals had passed successive 
sessions of the legislature which begins a new session in january 
the state lottery began operation in september but plans for 
parimutuel betting are still being worked out 
andrea lamented that a ferryboat gambling proposal several years 
ago sank when a 5936 vote shipped it to committee and it never 
reemerged

britains real gross domestic product measured by 
the output of goods and services rose 14 percent in the third 
quarter from the previous three months and was up 5 percent from the 
same period a year ago the government said wednesday 
the central statistics office said its outputbased index of gdp 
which uses a 1985 base of 100 rose to a seasonally adjusted 1143 
in the third quarter from 1128 in the second quarter and 1089 in 
the third quarter of 1987 
because the figures are rounded off the percentage changes 
provided by the office often differ from those worked out from the 
indexes 
service and distribution businesses grew especially strongly in 
the third quarter with energy output falling as a result of the 
fire on the piper alpha oil platform in the north sea in july the 
office said 
the outputbased gdp is considered the most reliable guide to 
shortterm movements in the economy 
britain also calculates gdp based on expenditure and income data 
and publishes an average estimate of the three gdp measures which 
is considered the best guide to longterm movements in the economy

closing date for applications for the 2 billion shares being

dealings in the shares are due to commence simultaneously in

privatization is a process whereby ownership of a company held by 
the government is transferred to the public 
the share price was at the bottom end of market expectations that 
ranged from 125 pence to 140 pence or 256 
analysts said the government was likely to set a low price to 
ensure a successful sale for the first privatization since the 
governments troubled sale of its remaining stake in british 
petroleum plc which coincided with the 1987 stock crash 
the market price of existing bp shares fell below the offering 
price of the new shares killing the incentive for investors to buy 
the newly issued stock which was left in the hands of underwriters 
there has been an excellent response to the share offer 
roadshows in the uk and around the world said paul richards a 
director at the london investment firm samuel montagu amp co ltd 
advisers to the government on the sale 
the offer has been fully underwritten and we are confident of a 
successful sale 
the british steel sale also precedes some of the biggest and most 
complex privatization attempts to date as the government moves to 
sell off britains water and electricity industries beginning late 
next year 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government has 
sold off billions of pounds worth of state assets since she came 
into power in 1979 her aim in selling off such companies as jaguar 
plc british gas plc and british airways plc has been to promote 
capitalism and share ownership 
the british steel shares will be payable in two installments a 
first payment of 60 pence 110 a share will be made on 
application and an additional 65 pence 119 a share paid by 
september 1989 there is a minimum size application of 400 shares 
british steel has forecast pretax profit for the current year 
ending april 1989 of at least 550 million pounds or 101 billion 
up 31 percent from last year 
about 23 percent of the shares will be offered to the british 
public and to british steel employees and pensioners british 
institutional investors will initially be offered 44 percent of the 
shares the remaining 33 percent of the shares are to be offered in 
the united states canada japan and continental europe

chrysler corp has received orders 
for 60 percent more dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim cars than the 
company will be able to build a chrysler executive says 
production of the new fourdoor sedans began a month ago at 
chryslers newark del plant and the cars are sold out for the 
model year chrysler motors corp chairman bennett bidwell said in 
an interview tuesday 
maybe the last time i was able to say it with some finality was 
with minivans thats kind of a nice feeling said bidwell who 
was named chairman of chryslers carmaking arm nov 10 
chrysler began the recent popularity wave of minivans with the 
introduction of the dodge caravan and plymouth voyager in 1983 more 
than half of the vehicles sold in the united states are made by 
chrysler 
our only problems with spirit and acclaim today would relate 
to production volumes bidwell said 
the delaware plant had been shut down for 16 weeks while the 
company completed 205 million in renovations 
on the dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim weve got fleet orders 
on the order of magnitude of 40000 he said weve got dealer 
orders over and above that for about 160000 
but chrysler will be able to build less than 125000 he said 
bidwell also talked about the companys joint venture with 
mitsubishi motors corp incentives and the possibility of chrysler 
going to private ownership or being a takeover target 
chrysler and mitsubishi began producing cars at their 
diamondstar motors plant in normal ill on sept 1 production 
will be split for now half and half between plymouth laser and 
mitsubishi eclipse 
bidwell said that mix may change depending on dealer demand and 
since chrysler has a larger dealership network than mitsubishis it 
stands to sell more of the cars 
we wont hit any real kind of a stride until may he said 
well be building something on the order of 20000 plymouth 
lasers 
despite the apparent success of the spiritacclaim and the laser 
chrysler still faces some rough financial roads bidwell said 
i think if we had these two vehicles from diamondstar and the 
newark plants available in volume production today we would be 
able to hold and perhaps even further improve market share he 
said 
however with the discontinuation of some of the companys older 
models were in a little bit of a transition over the next four 
or five months when were going to have to struggle a little 
bit 
chryslers thirdquarter earnings this year fell 543 percent 
compared with the third quarter of last year through the first nine 
months of the year the companys earnings were down 344 percent 
this year from the same period last year 
one of the reasons is incentives 
chrysler has used the enticements to lure car buyers into 
showrooms and to move excess stock from dealership inventory lots 
they took their toll on profits 
now said bidwell we dont anticipate leading an incentive 
parade 
bidwell discounted rumors that the company may go to private 
ownership or be in the bulls eye of a takeover target 
anybody would be crazy to take on that kind of debt load and 
still turn around and face the capital expenditure requirements that 
youve got to do to stay in business in this business

the european economic community 
commission said wednesday 44 million people in the eec or 14 
percent of the eecs population are considered poor 
they earn less than half the average per capita income of the 
country in which they live the eec said in a report 
it said the increase in poverty was due to growing 
unemployment underemployment and unstable and underpaid work as 
well as the increase in single parent families 
but the report warns that the figure of 44 million is imprecise 
as poverty is not only a matter of income other factors include 
quality of housing lack of education access to public services and 
the quality of the work environment 
the commission said it lacks enough data about these factors to 
make a fair eecwide comparison and thus uses only income as a 
measure of poverty 
based on income only the number of poor has risen in recent 
years in all 12 eec nations said the report it gave no figures 
in all eec nations old people form the largest group among the 
poor said the report 
in the 198589 period the eec contributes a modest 29 million 
european currency units 35 million to 91 projects in all eec 
nations aimed at alleviating conditions for the unemployed single 
parents migrants and refugees and urban poor 
the list is topped by spain where eec funds aid 16 social 
projects 
britain is second with 15 projects followed by portugal 10 
ireland and italy both 9 france 7 belgium denmark and greece 
6 each luxembourg 3 west germany 2 and the netrherlands 1

burlington northern inc which includes the 
nations largest rail system is under investigation by the 
securities and exchange commission for possible insider trading 
company officials say 
don pope of the holding company said tuesday the informal 
routine investigation began shortly after an announcement june 2 
that burlington northern was splitting in two 
the probe was sparked by an abnormally high trading volume 
before the move especially on may 17 and 23 he said 
pope said corporate attorneys told him that although they dont 
know the focus of the investigation they have no indications 
that any burlington northern officer is a subject of the probe 
burlington northern railroad separated from energy timber and 
real estate operations which were spun off into a new concern 
burlington resources 
on july 7 in accordance with an earlier announcement 20 million 
common shares representing 13 percent of burlington resources were 
sold at 2550 a share the remaining 87 percent of the shares are 
to be distributed to burlington northern shareholders dec 31 
analysts said the move was intended to boost the value of 
burlington northern stock and make a takeover bid less likely 
burlington northern chairman richard m bresler has said the 
split was arranged partly because companies in one line of business 
had become preferred over conglomerates 
the objective here is to enhance shareholder value by creating 
two very viable companies one in transportation and one in 
resources he told the new york times on june 3 
illegal insider trading could result in civil action by the sec 
criminal charges brought by the justice department or both 
burlington northern is cooperating in the probe and has hired the 
washington dc law firm of fried frank harris shriver amp 
jacobson which represented former wall street megaspeculator ivan 
boesky in a record 100 million insider trading settlement with the 
sec he added 
on may 23 burlington northern inc was listed as the 13th most 
active stock on the new york stock exchange with 734900 shares 
traded and closed at 57875 down 2375 
on may 17 the stock missed the most active list with a volume of 
273800 shares and closed at 6225 down 1625 
on june 2 when the spinoff was announced volume was about 27 
million shares as the stock rose 175 to close at 69125 
sec investigators have requested information on the events 
leading up to the announcement pope said 
in addition james schropp of fried frank said investigators 
requested the names of all burlington northern officials who were 
involved in the deal and questioned william pontius vice president 
of glacier park co the main real estate subsidiary 
pontius was not accused of any wrongdoing but was asked about 
people outside the company who might have been involved in trading 
schropp said 
it was felt that mr pontius could shed light on that 
question he said without elaborating

search of financial records at blinder robinson amp co and police 
revealed a craps table and slot machine were seized from the penny 
stock brokerage firm 
the companys staff of 150 were allowed to resume normal 
operations on tuesday and internal revenue service agents at the 
end of the day finished examining thousands of documents concerning 
16 companies and 53 investors 
irs and securities and exchange commission agents entered 
blinders office saturday morning on a warrant issued by the us 
attorneys office in denver and they have refused to comment on the 
raid blinder executives said the warrant was based on an affidavit 
from an irs agent in las vegas nev 
no charges have been filed against blinder robinson and the 
companys name did not appear on the search warrant 
police revealed tuesday that they seized the expensive casino 
craps table and nickel slot machine from brokerage owner meyer 
blinders 10th floor penthouse office during the weekend raid 
while blinder officials describe them as collectors items 
possession of the gambling devices could mean added trouble for the 
pennystock magnate 
blinder faces an investigation of a possible misdemeanor 
violation of colorados gambling laws and deeper scrutiny from the

yeah its real bigtime gambling a whole nickel slot 
machine he said i dont know what right they have to take that 
because it wasnt covered in the search warrant they took that out 
of mr blinders personal den 
arthur said that while it is not against the law to own a craps 
table possession of a slot machine manufactured after 1950 is 
illegal the machine seized in blinders penthouse was made in 1973

grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher 
today on the chicago board of trade on speculation that the united 
states and the soviet union were preparing to sign a new longterm 
grain sales agreement 
the previous 5year agreement expired on sept 30 and the lack of 
a new pact has had a depressing effect on the grain markets 
especially on wheat prices 
analysts said todays early rally was prompted by a news 
services report that us officials would travel to moscow on 
monday to sign a 2year agreement covering wheat and corn sales to 
the soviets 
one of the sticking points in the negotiations has been a soviet 
demand that an agreement include wheat subsidies under the 
agriculture departments export enhancement program said ted mao 
grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
technicalanalysts said the grain markets were due for a rally 
after hitting the bottom of a price cycle on monday 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 416 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents higher with december at 264 a bushel oats were 
cent to 2 cents higher with december at 210 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with january at 753 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were moderately higher of the brothel and 
the days during which a customer could have been exposed 
russell reed of the nevada brothel industry said owners want to 
keep their houses as free of sexually transmitted diseases as 
possible but fear the notification rule might cause unfounded public 
concern 
prostitutes in nevadas three dozen brothels have been tested 
weekly for aids and other sexually transmitted diseases for about 
two years none has tested positive for the aids virus

oil prices shot up again today after fluctuating 
wildly on tuesday in response to conflicting reports from vienna 
where opec ministers are trying to negotiate a new production 
agreement 
in the first two hours of trading today prices fluctuated 
between 34 cents and 74 cents higher at 11 am est the january 
contract was trading at 1430 a barrel up 44 cents in brisk 
trading 
prices started drooping on word that the opec ministers had 
postponed until thursday a full meeting of the cartel analysts 
said the ministers have been meeting in small groups since monday 
and were scheduled to convene in full session later today 
analysts said the market was remaining optimistic that the opec 
meeting would produce some type of agreement to limit oil output 
the current excess on world markets have kept prices weak 
the market opened stronger on followthrough volume from 
yesterday said andrew lebow senior broker and analyst with 
edampf man international futures inc its basically optimistic 
that opec is going to come up with an agreement however the 
meeting has been postponed so there is a little uneasiness 
analysts said volume on the new york mercantile exchange was 
heavier than normal in the first hour of trading but had tapered 
off the exchange is scheduled to close earlier than normal today in 
advance of the thanksgiving day holiday and will be closed on friday 
on tuesday the january contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude closed 88 cents higher at 1386 a 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange the contract had traded 
as high as 1440 a barrel during the day 
other contract months also finished sharply higher 
futures prices for refined products also soared on tuesday the 
december contract for unleaded gasoline settled 101 cents higher at 
4533 cents a gallon contracts for next july and august closed 199 
cents higher 
heating oil for december closed the day up 197 cents at 4544 
cents a gallon other contract months also rose with next 
septembers contract up 240 cents 
the 13member organization of petroleum exporting countries is 
trying to reach an agreement to limit output and raise world crude 
prices but iran and iraq have been unable to settle a dispute over 
how much iraq should be allowed to produce a key hurdle to any 
accord 
analysts said iran oil minister gholamreza aghazadehs remark 
that i think we can reach an agreement ignited an early buying 
frenzy as many investors and analysts were talking of a possible 
impasse at the vienna meeting which continued today 
it just goes to show how volatile this market is that prices 
could go up more than 1 on just a little optimism from iran said 
peter beutel an analyst with elders futures inc 
but in a reversal late in the day aghazadeh said he would 
never concede to quota parity 
that remark sent crude prices tumbling more than 1 off their 
highs in the final hour of trading but prices rebounded before the 
close 
virtually all the action particularly these sharp reversals can 
be traced to the statements of irans oil minister said bob 
baker analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
opecs current production system gives iran a quota of 24 
million barrels of oil a day compared with 15 million for iraq 
with which it fought a bitter 8year war but iraq has ignored its 
quota saying it will not participate until it is given parity with 
iran which has refused 
analysts cite three reasons for irans intransigence 
historically it has been a higher volume producer than iraq and 
wants to maintain its no 2 position behind saudi arabia in the 
cartel 
iran claims its internal needs are higher since its population 
is triple that of iraq 
it claims it has more oil reserves than iraq one of the 
criteria used by opec to set its quotas 
although iraq is producing more than 24 million barrels of oil a 
day and has said it will continue analysts have predicted some kind 
of an agreement beyond strict parity is possible

a picture of a simple yellow house in brooklyn 
hangs in the plush manhattan offices of entrepreneur sanford i 
weill who grew up on the homes second floor 
the 55yearold weill also recalls his struggles to pay the 
milkman and the diaper service as a young career man who married 
straight out of college 
such memories provide the inspiration that propels this wall 
street dealmaker who having built and sold one financial empire is 
trying to work another miracle 
weill says the pending merger of his commercial credit inc with 
primerica corp headed by his old friend gerald tsai jr is as 
much of a challenge as starting out more than 30 years ago 
when i started i was really scraping and when we decided to get 
into business we he and his wife joan put all of our money into 
it except 1000 said weill i think doing something like this 
merger gives us the opportunity to do that again 
that first business was carter berlind potoma amp weill which 
grew steadily through mergers and became what is today the giant 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
it was only the first big success for weill whose initial job 
out of cornell university was as a messenger in a brokerage firm he 
moved on to become a quote boy and later a stockbroker before 
going into business himself 
he sold shearson to american express for nearly 1 billion in 
stock in 1981 shortly after that weill joined american express and 
became president there he played a major role in the companys 
attempt to turn around its troubled firemans fund a large property 
and liability insurer he left american express in 1985 
he participated in but dropped out of bidding for ef hutton 
inc which was eventually purchased by his former firm shearson 
lehman 
in 1986 weill lost an attempt to acquire bankamerica corp but 
later in the year he joined baltimorebased commercial credit after 
reaching an agreement with control data corp to spin off its 
subsidiary in a public stock offering 
analysts say the commercial creditprimerica transaction marks 
the reemergence of weill as a major force in financial services 
some say weill is determined to build commercial credit into a giant 
rivaling american express with interests in a wide range of 
consumer credit and retail brokerage services 
weill says he entered the market now for the fun and challenge of 
the turbulent times in the financial industry which is still trying 
to right itself after the shock of last years stock market crash 
i think im going to have a lot of fun weill said i like 
to keep busy and work with bright people he said adding that 
the best time to do something not necessarily for the immediate 
results is when theres some sort of turmoil in the marketplace 
weill also scoffs at reports that he left american express 
because he was not selected chief executive officer 
the person was younger than i am and had different talents and 
different abilities weill said we just had a different 
philosophy about management style and we agreed to disagree 
he says he doesnt look at the incident as a failure 
i thought it was great to be president of american express 
i grew up in brooklyn in this house he said pointing to the 
photograph of his modest boyhood home 
its absolutely true that i was disappointed or i wouldnt have 
left american express but it doesnt say any place that life has to 
be a bowl of cherries he said 
those who know weill are watching his latest moves with interest 
sandy weill has had an extremely successful career and he seems 
to be capping it off with a very interesting and exciting 
transaction said jeffrey lane president of shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
normally one judges the ability to succeed based on past 
performance and given sandys past one should assume the odds are 
in his favor lane said the task is certainly daunting 
and his record is outstanding 
anthony pearcebatten securities analyst with legg mason wood 
walker inc in baltimore describes weill as fairly conservative 
who doesnt over pay for anything a detail man and one who 
keeps an eye on the big picture in the industry 
looking at weills decision to leave american express and his 
failure to buy bankamerica and ef hutton pearcebatten said 
they speak well of the man he is not driven to buy something at 
any price and clearly he is not someone who spends a lot of time 
in the headlines 
i get the sense that price comes before pride 
commercial credit agreed to acquire primerica in a cashandstock 
deal valued at 165 billion along with primerica comes the 
struggling brokerage firm smith barney harris upham amp co 
the revival of smith barney a midsized investment bank 
specializing in retail brokerage and municipal finance is 
considered key to the future success of commercial credit frank 
zarb a prominent wall street figure who served as energy czar under 
president gerald ford was recently named to head the brokerage 
pearcebatten says some on wall street are skeptical about 
weills chances for success noting that commercial credits stock 
has weakened sharply since the deal was announced 
the simple way to put it and i dont suggest this is the way 
i think is that if tsai couldnt run it why should we believe 
weill can pearcebatten said i think there are a lot of 
reasons but thats some of the conventional wisdom 
and the management has an unusually strong incentive to get the 
stock price up because they have a stock option package with the 
stock going down their potential wealth is materially affected and 
while thats distressing its nice to know theyre in the same 
boat 
weill says the merger is probably his biggest challenge ever 
i wouldnt say it scares me as much as when i was beginning 
he mused if i made a mistake then it would have been the end of 
the career

higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade on reports that 
announcement of a new longterm ussoviet grain deal was imminent 
one financial news service reported that us officials would fly 
to moscow to sign a 2year pact on monday the agreement was rumored 
in the grain markets to be an extension of the 5year contract that 
expired on sept 30 guaranteeing soviet purchases of 9 million 
metric tons of us grain each year 
a new agreement has been widely expected but speculation about 
the timing of the announcement has increased the volatility of the 
grain markets in the past six weeks analysts said 
but with most forwardlooking market players already fairly well 
convinced that an agreement was at hand wednesdays price movement 
tended to reflect disappointment over the lack of other largescale 
grain sales on the horizon 
as for the timing of an announcement about a soviet grain deal 
it makes no difference if its friday monday wednesday its 
just around the corner said katharina zimmer grain market 
analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc 
at the close of trading wheat was 2 cents lower to 4 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 417 a

opec oil ministers canceled a formal 
session of their winter meeting wednesday as they grappled behind 
the scenes again in an attempt to break a deadlock between iran and 
iraq over production quotas 
petroleum markets remained cautiously optimistic about the 
chances for the cartel reaching an agreement to limit its output 
however as prices rose for a second day although prices again swung 
wildly 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries 
recessed its formal talks after a brief session monday opting 
instead for small private meetings the full plenary session was 
rescheduled for thursday 
were working towards an agreement said opec president 
rilwanu lukman who is nigerias oil minister 
he said the ministers were still trying to resolve the dispute 
between iran and iraq that has stalled an overall agreement iraq 
which fought iran in an 8year war that ended in august has been 
seeking a production quota equal to irans but its former foe has 
adamantly opposed parity 
lukman met for lunch with oil ministers hisham nazer of saudi 
arabia issam abdul raheem alchalabi of iraq and ginandjar 
kartasasmita of indonesia 
afterward alchalabi quipped were always near an agreement 
but how near i cannot tell 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude ended the day at 1397 a barrel up 
11 cents after trading as much as 74 cents above tuesdays close 
the price had soared more than 140 on tuesday before finishing up 
88 cents 
oil brokers said trading was relatively light wednesday in 
advance of a fourday thanksgiving day holiday 
the oil ministers are trying to fashion a new production 
agreement that would reduce the world oil glut and help raise crude 
prices 
there is an arrangement in the works but i dont know when 
the work is going to be completed said mana saeed otaiba 
petroleum minister for the united arab emirates during a stroll in 
the chilly vienna weather 
i think we have to finish before the end of the week theres 
no reason to stay longer he said 
in addition to settling the dispute between iran and iraq the 
ministers also are trying to decide how much oil the cartel as a 
whole should produce to keep prices at a profitable level 
although several opec members have stepped up their production 
oil revenue has declined because of the slump in prices which have 
been running about 25 percent below opecs goal of 18 a barrel 
julien mpouho epigat gabons minister of hydrocarbons said 
opec members were focusing on two possible ceilings for total output 
185 million barrels a day and 19 million barrels 
mpouho epigat said an accord that held production to 185 
million barrels would result in prices ranging between 15 and 18 a 
barrel 
otaiba also said that a cap of 185 million barrels a day for 
total production is what they are talking about 
but lukman when asked about such a ceiling said sounds 
good but its not necessarily the right one number 
the new production accord would replace a 2yearold agreement 
that set a ceiling of 15 million a barrels a day for 12 of opecs 
members iraq was not included because it refused to abide by a 
quota that was less than irans 
despite that agreement opecs members are estimated to be 
producing more than 20 million barrels a day 
iraq argues it needs a quota as big as irans because it needs 
revenue to rebuild an economy shattered by their long war 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh has repeatedy told 
reporters he would never agree to parity with iraq 
aghazadeh offered to allow iraq export parity which would 
give the two countries the same total for overseas sales he said 
the more populous iran should retain a bigger overall quota because 
of its higher internal demand for oil 
aghazadeh said irans share of total opec output be maintained at 
the current level of 135 percent second after saudi arabias 256 
percent iraqs share is third at 117 percent

financier bennett lebow intensified efforts 
wednesday to buy prime computer inc releasing a letter aimed at 
assuring its management he has no hidden agenda in the 970 million 
hostile takeover attempt by his much smaller computer business mai 
basic four inc 
contrary to speculation from certain quarters about mai basic 
fours intentions the only motive for mai basic fours tender offer 
for prime shares is to acquire prime lebow wrote to prime 
president anthony craig 
the combination of mai basic four and prime will produce a 
powerful competitor in the rapidly maturing computer industry 
lebow wrote 
we firmly believe the combined companies will be far more 
successful than either of us can be alone and a prompt consummation 
of our acquisition will best serve the interests of our respective 
stockholders employees customers and suppliers he wrote 
natickbased prime is second to international business machines 
corp in the field of computeraided design and manufacturing 
systems in february it acquired computervision inc for 435 
million 
mai basic a small concern based in tustin calif owns 41 
percent of primes 485 million shares outstanding and is offering 
20 a share for the rest in a tender offer to shareholders the 
offer valued at 970 million was made nov 15 
in new york stock exchange trading prime closed unchanged 
wednesday at 16 a share mai basic fell 62 cents a share to 825 
there has been some speculation that lebow undertook the takeover 
attempt to induce prime to buy his company instead in what is 
commonly called a pac man defense of acquiring the suitor 
prime officials had no comment on the letter said spokesman 
richard eckels however their intent to resist lebow was 
demonstrated forcefully tuesday when the company sued mai basic on 
grounds that its takeover offer was illegal and flawed 
the suit filed in us district court alleged improprieties in 
the tender offer including failure to disclose the uncertain nature 
of its financing and that some owners of mai basic have been 
investigated by the securities and exchange commission for allegedly 
overstating the firms income 
the suit also alleges full disclosure was not made of the role in 
the tender offer played by drexel burnham lambert inc which has 
been sued by the sec on urelated securities fraud charges 
mai basic said in response that the suit is groundless and the 
company was disappointed that prime has resorted to this legal 
smokescreen apparently before the prime board has made a decision 
about the merits of our offer 
prime has asked shareholders to wait until the companys board of 
directors announces its recommendation on the offer which is 
expected by nov 29 
prime also announced tuesday it has delayed until at least dec 
13 the activation of its shareholder rights poisonpill defense 
which is designed to make an unwelcome takeover prohibitively 
expensive 
mai basic has filed suit in chancery court in delaware where 
prime is incorporated seeking to block the defense

zenith electronics corp urged owners of 
its 27 million shares wednesday against siding with dissidents bent 
on dismantling the last major us television manufacturer 
in a letter zenith chairman jerry k pearlman acknowledged that 
the chicagoarea company has had some rough times in the past 
several years rough for all of us shareholders and also for our 
employees 
but pearlman said the mutinous investor group brookhurst partners 
has no experience whatsoever in our business 
to suppose that they could come in and consummate a transaction 
in the best interests of shareholders more quickly than zeniths 
experienced management and board is in our opinion absurd 
pearlman said in the letter 
zenith shareholders have until dec 4 to return signed consent 
forms to brookhurst partners indicating their support for 
brookhursts plan the limited partnership led by new york 
stockmarket speculators herbert b abelow and nicholas l ihasz 
has proposed to reduce the size of zeniths board of directors to 
six from 10 dumping pearlman in the process and to have three of 
its own people named to the board 
the brookhurst bloc would be committed to selling zeniths 
foundering consumer electronics division or failing that to 
selling the entire company which also manufactures highly regarded 
personal computers 
brookhurst has said its proposals would become effective if they 
receive the backing of a majority of zenith shareholders 
on wednesday brookhurst would have no response to zeniths 
letter said spokesman william jenks in new york 
in trading on the new york stock exchange zenith rose 62 cents 
a share to 1762 on wednesday 
brookhurst zeniths largest shareholder has accumulated 61 
percent of zeniths stock since the partnership was formed in the 
spring 
zenith has contended in a pending lawsuit in us district court 
in chicago that abelow and ihasz are interested only in boosting the 
value of zeniths stock so they can sell their shares at a profit 
thus zenith claims that brookhurst is defrauding other 
shareholders with its consent solicitation 
zenith also contends that brookhursts public statements and 
letters to shareholders have contained specific misstatements of 
facts 
brookhurst has denied any wrongdoing 
zenith has posted multimilliondollar losses for each of the past 
three years but the company reported a 3 million profit for the 
third quarter of 1988 in contrast to a loss of 251 million a year 
earlier and has said it expects to show a pretax profit for the 
year for the first time since 1984 
the struggle for zenith is being watched closely by washington 
silicon valley and foreign capitals because of what it could mean 
for the future of the united states in high technology 
zenith is only the worlds 13th largest color tv maker but some 
analysts are asking that if zenith cannot make it in televisions 
what american company can

in midnovember compared with the same period last year but the

the seven automakers said they sold 259725 vehicles during the 
nov 1120 period this year compared with 282177 during the same

year 
car sales rose 37 percent this year over midnovember last year 
and truck sales were up 33 percent 
despite the gains analyst donald descenza of nomura securities 
inc of new york was pessimistic about the industrys performance 
this year he said there was no endofmodelyear blowout 
incentive programs like last year when buyers planning to purchase 
a new car in october or november moved up their plans and hit the 
showrooms in september 
youd have a tremendous burst in sales in august and september 
and a counterbalancing weakness in october and november he said 
but that didnt happen in 1988 and sales figures for october and 
november of this year should be much higher than figures from the 
same time last year 
the fact is that they werent up much at all and youd have 
expected them to be he said the fact that it isnt way ahead 
of last years pace is surprising 
among the big three car makers general motors corp showed the 
only gain in midnovember this year compared with the same time 
last year rising 64 percent on a daily rate during the period 
this year gm sold 76291 cars compared with the 80628 cars it sold

the government has doubled food prices and 
devalued perus currency 50 percent in a further effort to combat 
rampant inflation and boost exports 
the program announced late tuesday by finance minister abel 
salinas was the fourth emergency economic package this year aimed 
at pulling peru from a sharp recession 
it included wage increases of about 50 percent for most peruvian 
workers 
a similar package of sweeping austerity measures announced in 
september failed to slow inflation it did spark widespread street 
protests and some sporadic looting 
economists and opposition politicians labeled the new package 
contradictory and said it would not end a severe food shortage or 
the wave of strikes stemming from the recession 
for a month housewives and others have been forced to wait for 
hours in lines of several blocks to buy daily rations of such basic 
food stuffs as bread sugar and rice 
salinas said the program continues government efforts to phase 
out subsidies of food and consumer and industrial goods and thus 
reduce the nations burgeoning deficit considered the major cause 
of inflation 
consumer prices have soared 9325 percent since january and are 
expected to surpass 1200 percent for the year the previous highest 
annual inflation rate was 1583 percent in 1985 
salinas said a currency devaluation of 50 percent dropping the 
value of the peruvian inti from 250 to 500 intis to the us dollar 
would restrict imports and serve as an incentive to manufacturers to 
boost exports 
independent analyst alejandro toledo said the centerleft 
government of alan garcia must now pay the bill after financing 
two previous years of growth with government subsidies 
on taking office in july 1985 garcia limited payments on the 
nations foreign debt and used money owed international banks to 
finance an economic recovery program 
the economy grew 85 percent in 1986 and 7 percent in 1987 but 
the governments dollar reserves ran out a year ago and the economy 
fell into a recession this year

not view as an indication of underlying economic strength

renewed fears of tight supplies ignited an explosion in copper 
futures prices wednesday on new yorks commodity exchange as hedgers 
and speculators bought heavily ahead of the thanksgiving weekend 
driving prices to record highs 
on other markets rumors of a ussoviet grainsales agreement 
supported grain and soybean futures while prices of sugar crude 
oil precious metals livestock meat and stockindex futures all 
advanced 
wednesdays 8 percent rise in the price of copper for december 
delivery along with tuesdays 6 percent gain appeared to end a 
threeweek period of consolidation and seemed to signal that the 
restless market was again on the upswing analysts said 
copper settled 4 cents to 118 cents higher on the commodity 
exchange with december at 1546 a pound and the spot november 
contract at 160 a pound an alltime high for comex copper 
coppers longterm bullish factors include dwindling onhand 
supplies expanding consumption and declining production in several 
key countries including peru where a miners strike is in its sixth 
week 
but fresh developments had been scarce until wednesday when the 
comex reported a 24 percent decline during the past week in its 
warehouse stocks of copper to a recordlow 5957 short tons 
the decline of nearly 1900 tons shocked traders who had become 
accustomed to weekly offtake figures between 500 and 1000 tons 
said bette raptopoulos an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
suddenly now youre seeing a sharp decline to under 6000 tons 
and that spells lack of availability she said 
analysts said the market expected both the comex and the london 
metal exchange to report further drops in warehouse stocks next week 
fred demler metals economist with drexel burnham lambert inc in 
new york said copper production in peru the worlds sixthlargest 
producer was down 17 percent through the first three quarters of 
this year while production in both zambia and zaire was down 20 
percent and chilean shipments declined 7 percent 
so these production problems are persisting and likely to 
disrupt output over the next two quarters he said 
prices of most grain and soybean futures advanced on the chicago 
board of trade amid reports that announcement of a new longterm 
ussoviet grain deal was imminent 
but with most forwardlooking market players already fairly well 
convinced that an agreement was at hand wednesdays price movement 
was dampened by disappointment over the lack of other largescale 
grain sales on the horizon 
as for the timing of an announcement about a soviet grain deal 
it makes no difference if its friday monday wednesday its 
just around the corner said katharina zimmer grain market 
analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc 
wheat settled 1 cent lower to 5 cents higher with december at 
418 a bushel corn was cent lower to cent higher with december

december at 212 a bushel soybeans were unchanged to 4 cents 
higher with january at 755 a bushel

yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange on bullish fundamental and 
technical factors analysts said 
the active march contract topped the key resistance point of 11 
cents a pound in intraday trading 
sugar settled 25 cent to 29 cent higher with the active march 
contract at 1094 cents a pound 
energy futures prices gyrated with each new development from the 
opec meeting in vienna but ended mixed on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 16 cents 
higher with january at 1397 a barrel heating oil was 28 cent to

pillsbury co stock climbed wednesday after 
the company reportedly indicated for the first time since becoming 
the takeover target of britains grand metropolitan plc that it may 
sell itself and its burger king corp unit as separate companies 
the possible defense tactic was included in a securities and 
exchange commission filing the wall street journal reported 
wednesday 
in trading on the new york stock exchange pillsbury stock rose 
112 a share to 57 
if burger king and the company were sold as separate entities 
in the future although no decision has been made to sell burger 
king or the company in the future there would be additional 
potential buyers and substantially greater values could be realized 
for stockholders the sec filing said 
but the filing also said pillsbury directors believe now isnt 
the right time to sell partly because smith only took over in 
august and partly because greater values could be realized in the 
future as a result of the restructuring efforts presently under 
way 
pillsbury is resisting the 523 billion hostile takeover bid 
from grand met a british distilling gambling and specialty 
products conglomerate 
on monday pillsbury announced it was delaying the planned 
spinoff of its burger king subsidiary by 2 weeks 
pillsburys board of directors pushed the date of the spinoff 
back to dec 19 from dec 2 at the request of the delaware court 
that is hearing grand mets challenge of the plan smith said monday 
the proposed spinoff which would make burger king a separate 
publicly traded concern held by current pillsbury shareholders is a 
key element in the companys attempts to thwart grand mets bid 
a hearing on the grand met challenge is scheduled for monday 
before chancellor william allen in delaware chancery court 
grand met is seeking court orders to overturn the spinoff as well 
as an antitakeover provision in pillsburys bylaws grand met also 
has said it might have to lower its 60 a share offer if the spinoff 
occurred because the new burger king would present a huge tax 
liability 
grand met said monday more than 72 million shares of pillsbury 
common stock representing about 846 percent of outstanding shares 
have been tendered and not withdrawn 
pillsburys board of directors has rejected grand mets offer as 
inadequate and urged shareholders not to tender their stock 
at a weekend meeting the pillsbury board affirmed smiths 
decision to decline a personal meeting with grand met chairman allen 
sheppard pillsbury said monday sheppard renewed the plea in a 
letter to pillsbury on tuesday but pillsbury did not comment on its 
strategy

fresh from victory in california consumer 
activist ralph nader brought his campaign to overhaul the insurance 
industry to the nations insurance capital wednesday calling the 
industry fat lazy wasteful and inefficient 
appearing with nader at a news conference was harvey rosenfield 
the 36yearold author of california proposition 103 
the groundbreaking initiative passed earlier this month rolls 
back auto and property casualty premium rates repeals the 
industrys exemption from state antitrust laws and imposes numerous 
other changes opposed by the insurance industry 
were here to make sure the connecticut insurance companies 
hear the message of the california voters nader told reporters 
in anticipation of naders remarks connecticuts insurance 
companies responded in a united voice calling naders suggested 
solution to high insurance rates a prescription for chaos and 
disaster 
cutting insurance rates without cutting the costs responsible 
for these rates is a transparent attempt to prescribe snake oil 
remedies for hard realities said john h blair president of the 
insurance association of connecticut 
nader said insurance companies have underestimated the level of 
outrage felt by ratepayers over rapidly increasing premiums in 
connecticut he said auto insurance premiums on passenger cars rose 
466 percent from 1984 to 1988 
he blamed the increase on a lack of competition state laws that 
exempt insurance companies from antitrust laws and inefficiencies 
such as bloated middle management staffs and high executive salaries 
its like ford motor co was in 1979 fat lazy wasteful and 
inefficient he said 
nader said that through consumer pressure insurance companies 
can be made more efficient more accountable and more concerned 
with what he described as their original mission loss prevention 
through greater emphasis on safety as a result he said their 
rates will drop 
nader saved his strongest criticism for hartfordbased aetna life 
amp casualty co which he said is more aggressive and more cruel 
than any other insurance company 
he pointed to the companys ad campaign against lawsuit abuse 
in which the company uses the slogan enough is enough 
he described the ads appearing now in newspapers in denver new 
orleans st louis and rochester ny as collective jury 
tampering in an effort to reduce the amount jurors would award in 
lawsuits 
plaintiffs lawyers and district attorneys in colorado have made 
similar charges recently claiming the ads are misleading and 
possibly in violation of state laws against deceptive trade 
practices 
jason wright a spokesman for aetna said the company will not be 
intimidated into dropping the ads which he der trial system that 
peo discuss the dirty little secret of our trial system that 
people can sue at the drop of a hat over basically anything 
wright also dismissed naders call for consumer revolt in 
connecticut saying auto insurance premium rates have not increased 
as dramatically in connecticut as they have in california 
wright predicted that insurance companies will succeed in their 
efforts to challenge proposition 103 in court 
he said aetnas auto insurance divisin in california has lost 12 
million in the past four years because of skyrocketing loss 
costs including 5 million last year 
prop 103 rolls back california auto premium rates to 20 percent 
below their november 1987 levels among other changes it also ends 
the system in which rates are set according to where drivers live 
rather than their driving record 
if you can tell me how you can cut prices by 20 percent there 
id be amazed wright said it doesnt make sense

financial markets downshifted into the thanksgiving weekend with 
mixed results influenced by weakness in auto sales sluggish orders 
for other big usmade products and the uncertain outcome of an 
opec meeting 
domestic automakers said wednesday they sold 35 percent more 
cars and light trucks during midnovember than they did during the 
same period last year when sales were unusually depressed 
the fact is that they werent up much at all and youd have 
expected them to be said donald descenza who follows the auto 
industry for nomura securities inc of new york 
another suggestion of economic weakness came from washington 
where the government said orders to us factories for durable goods 
slipped in october for the second straight month after discounting 
orders for military equipment 
the commerce department said total orders including the biggest 
gain in military goods since june rose 24 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 1221 billion excluding the defense category which 
swings widely from month to month orders fell 02 percent in 
october and 25 percent in september 
additional economic uncertainty arose overseas in vienna 
austria where ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries have been trying to reach a compromise for limiting output 
and raising world prices 
speculation they could agree on a formula boosted prices for the 
second straight day on the new york mercantile exchange where oil 
contracts closed up 11 cents at 1397 a barrel 
none of this news helped the dollar which has been under severe 
pressure since the election of george bush to succeed ronald reagan 
as president there is widespread concern that bush will do little 
to ease the large us budget and trade deficits that many 
economists see as longterm threats 
the dollar fell against all key currencies traders said the only 
obstacles to further weakening were thin preholiday dealings and 
the worry that central banks would intervene to halt the dollars 
slide 
on wall street bond prices were mixed but stocks had a better 
day the dow jones industrial average rose 1458 points to 209228 
and advancing issues outnumbered declines by about a 7to4 margin 
on the new york stock exchange although trading was the lightest in 
nearly three months

petroleum markets remained cautiously optimistic 
in the face of continued uncertainty over whether opec will reach an 
agreement to curtail oil production 
on the new york mercantile exchange wednesday the january 
contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude closed at 1397 a barrel up 11 cents from tuesdays 
settlement price the contract had traded as much as 74 cents 
higher other contract months also rose 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries apparently 
remained deadlocked wednesday in its efforts to reach a new 
agreement on reducing the cartels output and boost world crude 
prices 
the ministers from the 13nation cartel meeting in vienna 
austria postponed until thursday a planned formal meeting scheduled 
for wednesday but continued to meet in small informal groups 
analysts said oil prices opened sharply higher in brisk trading 
but then began to backtrack after the announcement that the opec 
ministers had postponed their plenary session for the second time 
since monday 
minutes before the early thanksgiving eve closing at about 1 pm 
est a wave of frenzied selling drove prices sharply off their 
highs analysts said 
nevertheless the market closed with a positive bias said 
mike mcdermott an analyst with benchmark futures inc 
investors think there is going to be an agreement but theyre 
not sure so they dont want to have an outright position going 
into the long weekend he said the us oil markets will remain 
closed until monday 
in other futures trading the prices of refined crude products 
finished the day mixed with unleaded gasoline down sharply and 
heating oil up 
the december contract for unleaded gasoline fell 087 cent a 
gallon to 4446 cents after rising more than a penny on tuesday 
analysts said the drop was in response to an american petroleum 
institute report showing gasoline stocks rose 65 million barrels 
last week 
bob baker an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc said 
the higher gasoline supply reflected sharply higher imports and 
weaker consumer demand 
there had been talk of unseasonably high demand for gasoline 
baker said in fact we have not had that kind of change gasoline 
consumption trends are moderate and the market is selling off 
because of the adjustment 
heating oil for december rose 028 cent to 4572 cents a gallon 
pulled up by the higher crude prices analysts said 
despite the thanksgiving day holiday analysts said some trading 
would continue thursday and friday through the london international 
petroleum exchange 
analysts said they expect opec either to reach some kind of 
agreement by friday or adjourn the meeting 
a couple of ministers have said they will return home by the 
end of this week baker said so most probably the time for a 
solution is friday they cant see staying around if they dont have 
an agreement by then
