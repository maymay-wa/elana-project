a filipino general claims former 
first lady imelda marcos and the us government secretly supported 
a coup attempt last december that was put down with the help of 
american jets 
brig gen alejandro galido made the allegations in a sworn 
statement released wednesday by the department of justice galido 
said he was aware of plans for the dec 19 coup attempt and 
reported the conspiracy to chief of staff gen renato de villa 
it was not known why the government released the statement but 
it followed disclosures earlier this week that businessmen and 
others had supported the coup attempt one businessman was arrested 
the statement is part of a government investigation into the 
coup attempt and galido has been described by government officials 
quoted in newspaper reports as a government spy 
there was no indication in galidos statement why us planes 
intervened in the coup if the united states secretly supported it 
galido said a us air force colonel harold magelo told him in 
july that us intelligence supports the overthrow of president 
corazon aquino 
galido said magelo who identified himself as a member of the 
defense intelligence agency promised to deliver shipments of 
firearms ammunition antitank missiles and other weapons 
he also said us ambassador nicholas platt held a party at his 
home in august during which conspirators received written 
instructions from brig gen edgardo abenina who was held at a 
military camp for involvement in a coup attempt in 1987 
the latest attempt was launched shortly after midnight on dec 
1 when thousands of mutineers attacked military and media 
facilities seized aircraft at villamor air base and staged air 
strikes on the presidential palace 
us f4 phantom jets from clark air base flew air cover in 
support of government forces and prevented the mutineers from 
continuing their air strikes at least 113 people were killed and 
more than 600 injured before rebels surrendered their last 
stronghold dec 9 
platt is in the united states on vacation spokeswoman vicky 
middleton said a statement would be issued later 
mrs aquinos spokesman adolfo azcuna said the government 
would not comment on galidos statement until a presidential 
commission established to investigate the coup attempt submits its 
final report 
galido also said mrs marcos supported the conspiracy and 
promised to pay about 475000 to the coup plotters if she could 
return to the philippines 
mrs marcos fled the country in 1986 after her husband 
president ferdinand marcos was ousted in a popular uprising 
marcos died in hawaii in september and mrs marcos went on trial 
in new york city tuesday on racketeering charges 
galido said he spoke with mrs marcos several times by telephone 
before marcos death and she urged him to press ahead with the 
plans so the former president could die in his homeland

abortion rights activists held a candlelight 
vigil late wednesday outside the idaho capitol promising to 
continue to fight a bill establishing the most restrictive abortion 
law in any state 
this issue is not over for us the rev james hulett of 
freedom means choice told more than 400 supporters on the eve of an 
expected final state senate vote on the bill which would send it 
to democratic gov cecil andrus 
we do not want government interfering in our private 
decisions hulett said 
but while prochoice advocates still hoped the bill would be 
defeated antiabortion activists pressed their case with andrus 
whom they see as the final link between them and the law 
both sides agreed that the bill which would ban more than 90 
percent of the 1500 abortions performed annually in idaho would 
probably pass thursday most people have made up their minds 
said kerry uhlenkott president of right to life of idaho we 
feel pretty confident 
in maryland an antiabortion filibuster in the state senate 
entered its seventh day as both sides in the battle over an 
abortion bill appeared locked into positions that left little room 
for compromise 
idaho antiabortion forces stepped up the pressure on andrus to 
sign the bill flooding his office with more than 2500 calls in 
the past several days 
the governor has declined to say what he will do when the bill 
reaches his desk but earlier this week reaffirmed his opposition 
to abortion except in the case of rape incest and to protect the 
life of the mother 
patterned on a national right to life model that has been 
rejected by other states as too restrictive the bill makes 
abortion illegal except in the cases of nonstatutory rape reported 
within seven days incest if the victim is under 18 years old 
severe fetal deformity and a threat to the life or physical health 
of the mother 
some constitutional experts including one who opposes abortion 
have warned that the bill is so restrictive it will never withstand 
the scrutiny of the us supreme court costing the state hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to defend 
that contention has been brushed aside by the bills authors 
who maintain it was carefully drafted to push the high court to the 
point of overturning its 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing 
abortion 
we know it will be struck down in the lower courts mrs 
uhlenkott said thats what we want the supreme court justices 
have invited us to challenge roe vs wade

the film coming to america the subject 
of a lawsuit by columnist art buchwald is at least 17 million in 
the red although it grossed 125 million paramount pictures says 
preliminary accounting of the 1988 eddie murphy comedy was 
released tuesday as part of buchwalds lawsuit against the studio 
which claimed the movie was based on a concept he created 
a superior court judge ruled in january that buchwald and 
partner alain bernheim are entitled to 250000 plus 19 percent of 
the films net profits 
under accounting by paramount which is appealing the decision 
the film has no net profits 
buchwald says he is entitled to be paid under a contract he 
signed with paramount paramount says similarities between 
buchwalds idea and the actual film were only coincidental 
pierce odonnell an attorney representing buchwald called 
paramounts financial report misleading 
the net profit system in hollywood is a scam he said the 
only question is whether its legal 
odonnell could not dispute however that the film was still 
showing a deficit according to his accounting though coming to 
america is 112 million short of turning a net profit 
paramount said that as of last dec 31 the film has brought the 
studio 125 million in gross receipts which includes film rentals 
pay television deals and videocassette sales the studio deducted 
42 million in distribution fees leaving 83 million 
the studio then claimed an additional 36 million in 
distribution expenses leaving 47 million murphy and director 
john landis who were compensated based on a percentage of the 
films gross receipts were paid 11 million combined reducing the 
films take to 36 million 
from that 36 million paramount deducted the cost of making the 
film estimated at 48 million and interest expense of between 5 
million and 6 million placing the net loss between 17 million 
and 18 million 
when some partners make profits and others are told they have 
an 18 million loss something is rotten in hollywood odonnell 
said 
said paramount attorney chuck diamond the numbers speak for 
themselves were 1718 million away from breaking even

the communistdominated legislature 
wednesday elected a new president and nominated a new prime 
minister key demands of prodemocracy protesters 
but a government official said a draft constitutional amendment 
and a new election law under consideration by the legislature will 
contain no mention of opposition parties and the issue was still 
in the cooking pot 
the new leaders are relatively unknown politicians and there was 
no immediate comment from the nations halfdozen opposition groups 
but in the past the opposition has accused the leadership of 
shuffling communist party and government posts as a cosmetic 
gesture and of stalling on providing legal guarantees for free and 
democratic elections 
the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the proposed constitutional ammendment will state that 
mongolians may only join parties that correspond to the national 
interest and solidarity 
opposition activists said in preliminary talks with the 
government both sides had agreed that the constitution would permit 
a citizen to freely choose which party he will belong to 
the 370seat legislature the great peoples hural began its 
annual session wednesday and elected as president punsaomaabiin 
ochirbat a minister of economic relations and supply since 1988 
the government official said ochirbat had initiated a policy 
over the past few years of seeking ties with countries outside the 
soviet bloc mongolia wedged between the soviet union and china 
has been a soviet satellite since 1921 
ochirbat replaces jambyn batmonh 64 who resigned last week as 
communist party chief and this week as president 
opposition parties held a rally tuesday to demand that batmonh 
stay on as president they described him as an honest man who could 
be trusted to lead mongolia until direct elections were held for a 
new president 
ochirbat 61 is a former teacher who spent the past two years 
in czechoslovakia editing the world marxist review he was not in 
the country when most of the large prodemocracy demonstrations 
were held 
he had previously served as chairman of the trade union 
congress but was ousted in 1982 by mongolias former hardline 
communist leader 
the legislature also accepted the resignation of prime minister 
dumaagiyn sodman and nominated as his successor sharavyn 
gunjaadorg 54 minister of agricuture

activists say arrests and other forms of 
intimidation have left cubas human rights movement more 
demoralized than at any time in years 
in one recent sevenday period 11 rights activists were 
arrested and the homes of two others were the scene of mass protest 
demonstrations by government supporters 
most of those arrested had expressed support for a usled 
resolution on cuba approved march 6 by the un human rights 
commission in geneva 
official anxiety is on the increase as a result of cubas 
growing international isolation and concern that steady economic 
decline could quicken 
the government seems intent on not allowing rights activists to 
cultivate possible supporters 
president fidel castro has sworn not to emulate the reforms 
being carried out in eastern europe and the soviet union 
schoolchildren have been taught to chant socialism or death 
the new national slogan that sums up castros determination to 
stick to his marxist path 
castro has always maintained that the revolutions human rights 
record is second to none pointing to advances in education health 
services and employment opportunities 
cubas children may have the highest literacy rate and lowest 
infant mortality rate in the third world castro says he believes 
a return to capitalism could wipe out these gains 
castro claims cuban dissidents are few in number and are less 
interested in promoting political freedom than in creating 
conditions for a us invasion of the island 
rights groups ridicule that suggestion 
on the morning of march 5 a meeting of rights activists was 
held at the home of sebastian arcos a movement leader according 
to official claims hundreds of outraged neighbors gathered outside 
to protest the meeting 
arcos brother gustavo says hes convinced the government 
organized the demonstration citing a similar incident at his own 
home three days later when rights activists again convened 
when a crowd of progovernment demonstrators formed at noon 
outside in protest gustavo arcos found his telephone suddenly no 
longer worked 
although the demonstrators insisted the protest was spontaneous 
gustavo arcos pointed to the instant deployment of television 
equipment and a loudspeaker suggesting the facilities had been 
prespositioned the demonstration lasted into the evening and 
featured raised fists revolutionary chants and throwing stones at 
arcos apartment windows were broken 
the cuban media approvingly called the demonstrations acts of 
repudiation 
gustavo arcos says the government now sees itself as isolated 
and vulnerable their policy is to maintain constant tension 
the rules of the game have changed they are not going to 
permit any more dissidents he said 
gustavo arcos a onetime castro confidant has spent 12 years 
in prison since the revolution began he and his allies recall with 
nostalgia the period in 1988 when they were allowed to operate with 
a minimum of harassment 
two days after the demonstration outside his home police 
arrested two wellknown rights militants samuel martinez lara and 
tania diaz castro as part of a crackdown that led to the arrests 
of six others the same day 
martinez lara is president of the pro human rights party and had 
been set free just 17 days earlier after 10 months detention 
after his rearrest the government took into custody three lay 
catholic rights militants 
the state department view is that repression in cuba has 
worsened significantly since a un human rights delegation 
visited the island in september 1988 
department figures show more than 60 activists were arrested and 
detained since then cuba insists the detentions are not based on 
political activities 
in the midst of the crackdown this month the un human rights 
commission approved by 1712 a ussponsored proposal calling 
attention to cubas rights situation 
castro reacted angrily to the resolution particularly to the 
support shown by four former warsaw pact allies hungary 
czechoslovakia poland and bulgaria 
afterward castro asked whats left of socialism what can be 
left with that repugnant conduct

twenty years have changed the eden hotel 
which called itself the oldest and favorite shop in town serving 
the best nepalese hash now it caters to cleanshaven trekkers 
the ready availablility of hashish at the eden and nearby 
establishments and the bearded longhaired westerners who bought 
it earned jhochhen road the nickname freak street 
although the hashish and flower children are gone a generation 
later along with the eden posters saying let us take you 
higher jhochhen road is still known as freak street 
nepal has outlawed the sale of drugs and the eden now serves a 
credible approximation of european cuisine to western tourists who 
happen by about 150000 visit nepal each year 
hippies have given way to trippies says the insight guide to 
nepal and there is rarely a whiff of illicit smoke and not a 
bare breast to be seen in public 
many trekkers prefer thamel a district for budget travelers 
about a mile to the north where such amenities as private baths 
and hot water are easier to find than on freak street 
times have changed but the old ones linger in many minds 
chaitanya lal srestha a doctor who uses the initials wf for 
world famous before his name remembers the visitors of the late 
1960s and early 1970s 
so many of them came to me for cures he said in an 
interview at his clinic a tiny illventilated alcove lined with 
herbs in glass bottles i was famous on freak street because i 
used the ayurvedic system of medicine which does not have any side 
effects unlike the western allopathic system 
the tourists had many problems he said they werent very 
clean and their lives were odd they often fell sick 
few tourists visit srestha now he spends much of his time 
visiting friends on freak street a stooping man in his 50s who 
shambles from restaurants to shops reflecting with their owners on 
more affluent days 
nhuchhe narayan manandhar who owns a freak street hotel called 
the sayami lodge said i remember the groups of tourists who 
used to gather on the street and smoke chillums 
chillums are clay pipes usually filled with hashish or 
marijuana 
manandhar a dourfaced man of middle years said he still was 
wary of western tourists 
i dont give out my rooms to a single person he said 
stay with someone and its ok less chances of trouble 
some years ago a german checked in alone and died because of 
too many drugs he said in a mixture of nepali and english we 
didnt know until the next morning i still think if there was 
someone with him in the room he could have been saved 
rooms at the sayami lodge cost about 2 a night making it among 
the cheapest in the city a few minutes from manandhars are sights 
that include the old palace with its wooden lattice windows and 
ornate carvings and durbar square in an area of at least 50 hindu 
temples 
you cant see many freaks now manandhar said waving toward 
the narrow cobbled street crowded with lowbudget travel agencies 
restaurants secondhand bookshops and stores selling 
mountaineering equipment 
dipendra purush dhakal nepals director of tourism said 
todays tourist spends more money and stays in katmandu three days 
during a trip to nepal that averages 12 days 
that means most visitors go to other places he said the 
hippies didnt go anywhere outside katmandu and didnt spend much 
money 
two reasons the hippies have disappeared are the 1972 ban on the 
sale of narcotics and the requirement that a western visitor who 
stays in nepal more than 30 days buy 10 worth of the local 
currency for each of those days 
only two shops still have address boards proclaiming freak 
street the scores of others have reverted to the original 
jhochhen which means a line of houses

two volumes of letters from simone de beauvoir to 
her lifetime companion jeanpaul sartre provide graphic details 
on the famous couples private life and critics say the french 
feminist philosopher emerges as predatory opportunistic and macho 
lettres a sartre letters to sartre published in 
february by gallimard along with de beauvoirs journal de 
guerre war journal recount in the most minute detail the 
daily routine of the author of the second sex the bible of 
feminists around the world 
the letters are responses to sartres own letters to de 
beauvoir which were published in 1983 as lettres au castor 
the title sartres favorite term of endearment for de beauvoir 
beaver 
her correspondence was thought to have been lost until the 
couples adopted daughter sylvie le bon de beauvoir found the 
letters by chance in a closet still wrapped in their original 
envelopes addressed to monsieur sartre or soldier sartre 
some french critics wish the letters had stayed in the closet 
this asphyxiating outpouring is a crime against the castor 
wrote marianne alphant in the daily liberation 
what do the letters teach us she asks that the pioneer 
of feminism only liked women she could dominate that this austere 
muse was as moody and jealous as a simple housewife that the 
novelist so thrilled with her little inventions was only a master 
recycler 
the letters also prove alphant wrote that de beauvoirs 
successful autobiography la force dage was rigged and full 
of falsifications 
other critics were less harsh josyane savigneau of le monde 
argued that the letters show how the couple respected the 
contract of transparency complete honesty at all costs 
which became their credo in 1929 and endured until sartres death 
in 1980 
in the letters de beauvoir details her love affairs with a male 
student of sartres and with some of her own women students 
including louise vedrine and nathalie sorokine 
hoping to add a little spice to sartres dull life as a 
german prisoner of war in 193940 she provides graphic and 
sometimes sordid details about what her lovers wore what they 
said how they behaved in bed and even how they smelled 
in bed vedrine throws herself passionately in my arms these 
sensual swoonings seem so terribly organic de beauvoir wrote 
when i wake up i feel like a fat sated man because i avoid 
caresses i think only about breakfast and about my work 
de beauvoir wrote that sex was a chore yet she was fascinated 
with brothels prostitutes and other forms of low life that her 
buttonedup bourgeois upbringing had made taboo 
at times she comes across as downright conniving if wanda 
says anything about me be sure to tell me so i can know if my 
charm offensive is working she wrote 
for alphant de beauvoirs behavior towards women was predator 
and macho linked to an ambiguous desire to play the role of the 
man 
but she was equally aggressive with men something extremely 
pleasant has happened to me something i never expected i slept 
with the little bost three days ago naturally i was the one to 
suggest it she wrote to sartre in 1938 bosts first name was 
not given 
im very fond of him we spend idyllic days and passionate 
nights together the relationship is something precious and 
strong but superficial too and easy just an agreeable 
fulfillment of relations that had always been pleasant 
nonetheless the overriding theme in the letters is de 
beauvoirs undying love and respect for sartre she addresses him 
as my dear little being and she loves everything about him 
from his little arm and little lip to his little 
roundneck pullover sweaters and little face 
when im with you nothing seems so terrible as leaving you 
yet faraway the least little fear is unbearable i love you 
passionately im empty and unhappy without you i love you 
with something tragic and with complete abandonment she wrote 
le bon de beauvoir justified publishing the letters she said 
the whole truth regardless of how shocking or unsettling is 
better than myths and part truths 
isnt it preferable to say everything in order to reveal the 
truth and avoid by the force of first person narrative all the 
cliches myths lies and allow the real person in all its 
entirety to emerge le bon de beauvoir wrote in the preface 
readers may be surprised to learn how little de beauvoir worried 
about or even thought about world war ii she was too busy rushing 
from one left bank cafe to another meeting friends and lovers 
analyzing their relationships and writing it all in letters to 
sartre all in the name of honesty 
from a distance this was a grand task alphant concluded 
up close it looks more like a hamster running on a wheel

it takes a lot of hard work for 
teenagers to get their entries just right for the annual rotten 
sneaker contest 
ive run them through barbed wire dragged them on the 
pavement while i was riding my bike wore them without socks and 
wore them when i was with my uncle whos a plumber said 
14yearold russell mcdonald of toronto 
his sneakers were among more than 30 varieties of athletic shoes 
entered in the 15th annual contest tuesday 
attention to detail is important because the judges set high 
standards 
we look for the most miserable looking broken down horrible 
smelling beat up things imaginable said dr herbert lapidus a 
contest judge 
the judges rate the sneakers in eight categories lapidus said 
smell is the most important then they gauge how decrepit the parts 
of the sneaker are the sole laces grommets toes heels and 
overall nastiness 
it started 15 years ago in montpelier as a small contest to 
promote a local athletic store it has grown in the last three 
years into an international competition 
mayor ann cummings a judge said the contest was a fun break 
from cabin fever on a snowy first day of spring 
a good thing about it is it doesnt require any talent 
cummings said everybodys got a fair chance

a high school biology teacher received a love 
bite from an amorous 175pound male dolphin 
chuckles the only amazon river dolphin in captivity in north 
america was in his reproductive stage when he bit the finger of 
zoo volunteer nancy sakach while apprently trying to pull her into 
his tank pittsburgh zoo officials said 
ms sakach 32 received several stitches on her finger but did 
not harbor ill feelings toward the dolphin his natural instincts 
had just taken over she said 
it was play time and i was brushing chuckles with a sponge 
brush she said i wasnt really shocked when he bit me because 
you know that getting bitten is a possibility when youre dealing 
with dolphins in the reproductive stage 
chuckles whos been at the zoo 22 years has gotten into 
trouble with women before he has brushed up against women in the 
tank as a show of affection but the biting incident friday marked 
the first time he tried to pull someone in said paul leger acting 
zoo director 
were not really sure how dolphins can tell the difference 
between men and women but we think it has something to do with the 
ability to detect different hormones he said 
ms sakach said all is forgiven hes still my buddy and i 
expect to be back working with him in a couple of weeks

her struggle back from cocaine and alcohol 
addiction began with a disgusted look in the mirror and the 
realization im sick and tired of being sick and tired 
with the help of a college scholarship for recovering addicts 
the 37yearold has pulled herself from those depths and in may 
will receive a bachelors degree in fine arts and mass 
communications 
nobody was more ready to get sober than i was said the 
scholarship winner who uses the pseudonym annie this is just 
what i needed to get back on track since coming back to school 
ive blossomed 
annie is one of five recovering addicts or alcoholics who 
receive up to 1000 a year to pursue a degree at the university of 
south florida in tampa or its branch campuses 
in its second year the anonymous scholarship so called 
because it assures annonymity for those involved was the idea of 
a recovering alcoholic 
people in recovery programs like alcoholics anonymous are 
taught to pass on their sobriety this was the donors way said 
lester aldheizer a development officer at the sarasota campus 
he began helping other recovering alcoholics finance their 
education on an individual basis ms aldheizer said in a 
telephone interview he then came to us and asked to make it a 
formal scholarship program 
spokesmen at the new york headquarters of alcoholics anonymous 
and the national council on alcoholism said they were unaware of 
any other scholarship programs specifically for recovering 
alcoholics or drug addicts 
scholarship candidates must be fulltime degreeseeking 
students who have been sober at least two years and participate in 
a 12step recovery program such as alcoholics anonymous or 
narcotics anonymous like the anonymous benefactor they also must 
be from the sarasotamanatee county area 
recipients have to maintain a 25 gradepoint average and 
provide documentation that they are staying clean and sober 
six people got scholarships the first year and five were 
renewed the sixth did not meet the requirements ms aldheizer 
said refusing to elaborate 
anonymity is critical to recovering people she said 
their addiction is a very touchy subject even when people apply 
for the scholarship and are not accepted all their documentation 
is destroyed 
but it may seem that a college campus brimming with partying 
young people would be one of the worst places for a recovering 
addict however pete fazio a financial aid counselor at sarasota 
says its not a problem 
theyre quite a bit older because theyve already done quite a 
bit of living said fazio 
annie for example is 15 years older than most of her 
classmates and thats roughly number of years she spent addicted 
to cocaine and alcohol 
you hate yourself for what youre doing to yourself and how 
youre living she said in a telephone interview i was 
partying i was drinking every night and so were all the people i 
hung around with 
its a real ugly cycle that destroys your selfesteem getting 
sober and getting an education is all part of getting that 
selfesteem back 
annie worked as a secretary after giving up on her education 
after two years in a community college the hardest part of going 
back to school she said was coping with the difference in age and 
feelings of inferiority 
it can be very threatening annie said here you are an 
alcoholic you feel like a failure in life anyway then you start 
to look around and the students are all 18 and 19 its not the way 
life is supposed to go 
but she said supportive students and faculty have helped her 
succeed her grade average has hovered above 35 for the past two 
years and she has begun to speak about the dangers of substance 
abuse to campus groups 
her plans are to get a job and someday donate to the scholarship 
i want to show people that its not as hopeless as it seems 
she said

when you talk about recycling paper in the world 
trade center youre talking about saving forests its landlord 
says 
nearly 100000 trees a year could be saved in a new recycling 
program for the giant office complex according to stephen berger 
executive director of the port authority of new york and new 
jersey which operates the center 
initially 10000 of the 60000 people in its offices will be 
asked to recycle paper at their own desks berger said tuesday 
the program ultimately could involve every desk worker in the two 
110story towers and the five other buildings of the trade center 
the center generates 65 tons of garbage every day of which 
about 37 tons is wastepaper berger said 
if 60 percent of that wastepaper were recycled we could 
recapture 225 tons of paper a day he said thats more than 
10 times our current total 
according to one estimate it would be equivalent to a daily

a tangle of problems awaits president bushs 
proposal to send 800 million to bolster new democracies in panama 
and nicaragua and threatens to delay the measure past the 
presidents easter deadline 
bush met with congressional leaders tuesday to press for quick 
action on the package deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger argued on capitol hill that it is crucial to the 
survival of the new democratic governments of panamanian president 
guillermo endara and nicaraguas presidentelect violeta chamorro 
early success is going to be fundamental to whether mr 
endara and mrs chamorro are going to make it eagleburger told 
the senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations 
bush said the aid not only would demonstrate tangible benefits 
of democracy but would turn up the heat on cubas fidel castro 
the hemispheres lone communist holdout 
id like to see him shift from that highly militarized island 
and let democracy have a chance he told lawmakers at a white 
house meeting i think if we are helpful to nicaragua and panama 
it will simply increase the pressure in that marvelous island of 
cuba for change 
eagleburger sought to reassure senators by saying the 500 
million for panama is a oneshot economic infusion that wont 
likely be repeated and that nicaraguas 300 million in aid wont 
flow until leftist president daniel ortega fully turns over power 
to mrs chamorro 
but he seemed to acknowledge the tough job ahead and several 
senators pointed to a thicket of potential problems that could 
delay the package beyond april 5 when congress recesses for easter 
the most immediate problem is how to pay for the package the 
administration is negotiating with congress on its proposal to cut 
pentagon spending to free money for the aid bill sen robert 
kasten rwis said he believed those talks would be completed in 
the next two days 
sen patrick leahy dvt the appropriations subcommittee 
chairman said it was almost certain that some lawmakers would seek 
to cut us military aid to el salvador to signal displeasure over 
that governments failure to bring to justice the killers of six 
jesuit priests 
nicaragua still must find a way to reintegrate the contra 
rebels who have fought the government for the past decade into 
peaceful society the us government says 15000 contra fighters 
and 45000 family members need to be repatriated and most are in 
honduras 
eagleburger acknowledged that suspicions are deep on both sides 
and that all the rebels are unlikely to lay down their weapons and 
move back by mrs chamorros april 25 inauguration the package 
includes about 42 million for contra repatriation and anticontra 
lawmakers likely will want to debate that issue 
leahy accused the administration of having its priorities wrong 
suggesting he might seek to divert some money to help bolster 
fledgling democracies in eastern europe nicaragua and panama are 
of slight economic security and foreign policy importance 
compared with europe he contended 
other amendments also await the bill including a kastenleahy 
proposal to offer 400 million in housing loan guarantees to israel 
to build homes for soviet jews moving there under the soviet 
unions relaxed emigration policies 
eagleburger seemed to soften the administrations position on 
that proposal saying it would support the idea on the assumption 
that we can obtain adequate assurances with regard to those funds 
on israels plans for settlements in the occupied territories the 
statement was less categorical than recent statements by bush and 
by secretary of state james a baker iii 
in addition as the first mustpass legislation to come along in 
this years congressional session the panamanicaragua bill will 
become a popular target for pet projects of lawmakers dozens of 
members already have indicated an interest in offering amendments 
it seems to me we have to establish the emergency nature of 
this in a stronger way kasten said right now there is not 
enough of an emergency nature to this total package

the state senate on wednesday overwhelmingly 
approved an expansion of new yorks shield law that would protect 
virtually any information gathered by reporters or photographers 
the bill ensures that reporters notes unused video or audio 
tapes and newsroom files cant be subpoenaed unless its proven the 
information is necessary to a criminal case and couldnt be 
obtained elsewhere 
the bill which passed the senate 475 and was approved by the 
state assembly two months ago is expected to be signed by gov 
mario cuomo 
the bills sponsor republican sen roy goodman said it would 
prevent the press from being hauled into court on fishing 
expeditions by defense attorneys 
it will recognize particularly in criminal cases that the 
press should not be made to be an investigative arm of the 
government goodman said 
state sen emanuel gold a democrat who led opposition to the 
proposal said the press has as much an obligation to participate 
in trials as any other citizen he likened the subpoena of notes to 
jury duty 
i dont think theres a newspaper in the world that doesnt 
preach in favor of good citizenship gold said it seems in 
some situations the newspapers cant be bothered by the 
requirements of good citizenship 
state law only protects information obtained by reporters in 
confidence the legislation approved wednesday puts the force of 
law behind a 1988 state court of appeals decision that found 
nonconfidential information would have to be disclosed if it is 
relevant and the reporter is the only available source 
the same bill failed by two votes in the final day of the 1989 
legislative session gold who filibustered on the legislation in 
the morning hours following an allnight session complained 
goodman had tried to shove the bill down our throats 
i think there was some misinformation about what it did last 
year and when it got to the floor it was late and people didnt 
focus on it goodman said 
wednesdays 90minute debate which ended before 3 pm 
contained some bitter charges against the press gold said 
reporters are a powerful source of fear at the state capitol 
after opposing the bill last year gold said he was questioned 
by reporters in a nasty disgusting tone about his position 
i said are you asking me now as a reporter or a lobbyist 
because if youre asking me as a lobbyist you dont belong on the 
floor right now gold said 
but goodman said the legislation was a root privilege for the 
press 
any attempt to dent this shield that we in 1970 placed 
legislatively around reporters would have a serious and 
chilling effect on the ability of the press to gather 
information he said

country music stars emmylou harris and 
ricky skaggs say a bill that would require warning labels on music 
encouraging sex suicide or violence would have a chilling effect 
on songwriters 
you might succeed in eliminating some of this trash out there 
but it also is going to have to inhibit the good stuff ms 
harris head of the country music foundation told the state senate 
judiciary committee tuesday i think wed be paying a really 
terrible price 
skaggs president of the country music association predicted 
the labeling would spread to books 
if we allow this to happen in music we can already see the 
door open for books he said if we allow this to happen we 
dont realize what were going to stop 
the bills sponsor sen leonard dunavant said the proposed 
fluorescent yellow warning labels would not constitute censorship 
and likened them to the rating system for films 
he agreed however to postpone action on the bill for a week to 
await an attorney generals opinion on its constitutionality

tom scholz leader of the rock group 
boston did not breach a contract with cbs records when the group 
failed to deliver a record album a federal jury has ruled 
ending a sevenyear court battle the us district court jury 
also ruled tuesday that cbs records did not engage in a conspiracy 
against scholz when it tried to stop other record companies from 
signing him 
cbs records sued the entire band in 1983 charging it with 
failing to deliver the requisite number of albums under a 1976 
contract charges against other band members were dismissed 
the bands first two albums released in the 1970s boston 
and dont look back went platinum 
cbs expected a third album by 1981 despite promises by scholz 
to cbs executives and rock magazines that the third album was 
imminent no record was made cbs suspended scholzs royalties in 
1983 then sued 
lawyers for both sides said the jury apparently believed 
scholzs argument that the delay in producing the third album was 
rooted in the creative process 
i feel great said scholz the groups founder the jury 
somehow picked up that i didnt care about the money

angolas president jose eduardo dos santos 
getting into the peacemaking spirit in southern africa is offering 
the united states a ninepoint proposal for a ceasefire and talks 
with usarmed rebels 
the plan given to secretary of state james a baker iii on 
tuesday as he and other dignitaries attended namibias independence 
party has not been made public 
but sources who provided information about the document on 
condition they not be identified said it called for direct 
contacts with a view to achieving a ceasefire and mechanisms of 
direct negotiations 
until now the sovietbacked government has insisted that a 
ceasefire could only occur once the unita rebel group accepted 
certain preconditions the new proposal appears to soften the 
demand for preconditions 
in windhoek namibia a us official said dos santos appeared 
more inclined toward an early ceasefire than three months ago 
but the proposal which is loosely based on a peace plan dos 
santos outlined earlier this year appears to have some of the same 
problems that caused unita to reject it in the past 
the plan does not allow for incorporation of the organization in 
angolas political life instead it envisages the right of 
citizens to participate in political and social life 
the proposal also calls for the recognition of the legitimacy 
of the government and the state a proviso that unita also has 
rejected as a precondition for talks the rebels want the 
government to be determined by elections in which unita can 
participate as a group 
the angolan plan also calls for 
the neutrality and the positive attitude of thirdparty 
governments this appears to be a reference to ending arms 
supplies by the united states and the soviet union 
special and adequate treatment of unita leader jonas 
savimbis case savimbi has rejected past angolan demands that he 
go into exile 
a ceasefire negotiated last june by zaires president mobutu 
sese seko broke down last summer the angolan government attacked 
inside unita territory in february and fighting has been stalemated 
around the town of mavinga in recent weeks 
meanwhile cuba warned it would retaliate against unita for an 
attack on a cuban supply column in angola last week the rebels say 
the cuban troops were escorting a resupply unit of the angolan 
government 
in a statement issued here tuesday the cuban government said 
one soldier was killed and six were wounded in the march 17 attack 
this new aggression against cuban troops will not be left without 
punishment it said 
us officials say cuba is complying with an agreement to 
withdraw its troops from angola by next year

the bush administration was wrong to place so 
much importance on capturing gen manuel antonio noriega after us 
troops invaded panama cia director william webster says 
actually noriega was not a factor from the time the first 
paratrooper landed in panama webster said tuesday night during a 
questionandanswer session with students at american university 
websters remarks seem to criticize president bush who made the 
arrest of the military leader the focal point of the invasion of 
panama in december noriega already had been indicted on federal 
drug trafficking charges in florida 
but webster said noriega ceased to be an issue once the united 
states invasion had begun and he effectively had been removed from 
power 
i think we made a mistake in overemphasizing the importance of 
noriega the intelligence official said 
in an oval office address after the invasion bush said as 
president i have no higher obligation than to safeguard the lives 
of american citizens and that is why i directed our armed forces 
to protect the lives of american citizens in panama and to bring 
general noriega to justice in the united states 
when noriega evaded capture the united states eventually put a 
1 million reward on his head in addition to wanting him out of 
power in panama the us government wanted him jailed to face the 
drug charges 
webster said that because noriega had experience in 
intelligence keeping track of him was not easy he changed 
locations and cars and had people watching the spies who were 
watching him the cia director said 
despite that webster said we had very good intelligence 
about noriega 
but noriega slipped through the us grasp when he hurried to an 
appointment his trackers hadnt counted on 
its remarkable we had him in focus seven times on the day of 
the invasion and it was only his decision to have a dalliance with 
a lady of the street we should have predicted it webster said 
after a few days on the run noriega turned up at the vatican 
embassy in panama city where he was sheltered for days until a 
deal was worked out to allow his transfer to us custody 
noriega now is in a federal prison near miami awaiting trial 
websters remarks tuesday are the second time in recent weeks he 
has publicly disagreed with others in the administration 
he and defense secretary dick cheney have been carrying on a 
public debate over what future military threat the soviet union 
poses since the warsaw pact has become impotent with the removal of 
communist governments in eastern europe 
webster has argued that the threat is significantly diminished 
while cheney contends the united states still needs to maintain a 
strong military to meet a possible challenge from the east 
on tuesday webster described cheney as a friend with whom he 
has breakfast once a week and said the disagreement was largely 
generated because of the budget process we are going through

long periods of moderate stress common in 
daily life can trigger potentially hazardous disruptions in the 
hearts blood supply a new study shows 
the research is the latest effort to understand what happens 
during silent ischemia painless moments when the heart needs more 
blood than its arteries can supply 
as many as 3 million to 4 million americans have these episodes 
without knowing it heart specialists are debating just what to do 
about them and even whether the spells are truly dangerous 
at a meeting tuesday of the american college of cardiologists a 
boston team presented evidence that the heart rate may gradually 
increase for a halfhour before the heart becomes ischemic or 
deprived of oxygencarrying blood 
twentyone persons heart rates were monitored by portable 
recording devices as they went about their daily routine even at 
their most rapid their hearts often did not beat remarkably fast 
it is not necessarily how strongly you turn on your 
cardiovascular system its how long said dr andrew selwyn the 
studys senior author from brigham and womens hospital 
in the study silent ischemia occurred when the subjects heart 
rates rose from an average of 74 to 95 beats per minute but 
threequarters of this increase took place over periods up to a 
halfhour before the ischemia 
when ischemia causes pain it is known as angina people can 
take a variety of drugs to ease this condition some experts 
believe that silent ischemia is just as hazardous as the painful 
variety and give their patients the same medicines 
the boston study suggests such medication may not have the same 
effect on all kinds of silent ischemia it found that drugs called 
beta blockers worked well controlling ischemia that occurred during 
moderate and high heart rates but nitrates worked best at low 
rates 
the idea that silent ischemia should be identified and treated 
is based in part on studies showing that people with this condition 
are especially prone to heart attacks and deaths but some question 
whether this is true for the majority of essentially healthy people 
with silent ischemia 
dr arshed a quyyumi of the national heart lung and blood 
institute in bethesda md contended that although silent ischemia 
is a danger sign in people with severe heart disease it means 
little for those with mild or moderate disease 
he presented data based on 20 months of followup research on 81 
patients with mostly mild heart disease those with silent ischemia 
did just as well as people with no signs of blood shortage to their 
hearts 
in the vast majority of people with coronary disease who are 
at low to moderate risk silent ischemia means nothing quyyumi 
said 
however he conceded that his view is not shared by most 
researchers studying silent ischemia 
dr peter f cohn of the state university of new york at stony 
brook averred that the question of whether silent ischemia means 
anything has been answered 
the controversy is not whether silent ischemis is important 
cohn said it is what we should do about it

a teachers union is fighting back against 
students who attack or threaten their instructors obtaining court 
orders to prevent hostile youths from evoking further terror in the 
classroom 
in a school district where no student has been expelled in 25 
years madison teachers inc has obtained two injunctions 
prohibiting middle school students from having any contact with 
teachers they threatened to kill a third injunction is pending 
against a pupil who kicked a teacher in the ribs 
we dont do it unless theres a battery or threat of death 
said john matthews the unions executive director weve been 
concerned about the rapid escalation of behavior problems at middle 
schools and high schools in madison in the last 2 years 
the unions effort has been criticized by a juvenile court judge 
as a wasted step in helping troublesome students but is attracting 
national attention among educators who are concerned that not 
enough is being done to protect teachers from being shot hit or 
stabbed 
im fairly sympathetic if the administration doesnt take 
firm and absolute action then youll see more teachers taking 
actions to protect themselves id do the same said state school 
superintendent herbert grover 
matthews said the union which represents 1850 teachers was 
forced to take matters to court because the school administration 
had done little to curb classroom violence and protect teachers 
from pupils with behavioral or drug problems 
in one case that resulted in an injunction a 14yearold boy 
threatened to kill an eighthgrade science teacher after the 
instructor ordered the youth to the principals office for 
disrupting class 
dane county circuit judge robert pekowsky granted an injunction 
prohibiting the boy from having any contact with the teacher 
disrupting his class or going within 100 feet of the teachers 
house 
the pupil could face juvenile detention for violating any part 
of the judges order 
the school districts current policy allows administrators to 
notify police when a student is involved in an assault pupils can 
be suspended for a maximum of three days for such acts 
no student in the 22000student district has been expelled in 
the last 25 years partly because the districts expulsion policy 
was complicated and riddled with loopholes said shirley baum 
assistant superintendent of secondary education 
next month the school board will consider a revised expulsion 
policy that is not overburdened by technical procedure she 
said 
i dont see a particular problem with what theyre doing 
ms baum said of the union but i dont think its a matter of 
the administration doing nothing were basically an education 
group not a police force 
but milwaukee county circuit judge christopher foley an expert 
on state childrens law said there are better ways to deal with 
violent students 
ive never heard of this and in all honesty im not thrilled 
with a policy of filing harassment injunctions against students 
he said 
foley said students who assault or threaten teachers should be 
taken to court but officials should seek delinquency proceedings 
which would protect the teacher while also assuring the youth 
receives needed services or counseling 
but educators defended the wisconsin unions actions 
we view this as unique and it sounds like a good way to get at 
the problem and an orderly way of putting out the message said 
howard carroll a spokesman for the national education association 
a washingtonbased consortium of teachers unions 
grover said the unions policy was one of several tools teachers 
may use in the future to protect themselves on the job 
i think it increasingly will be one of the weapons used to 
bring sanity to the teaching environment grover said

a new bill is targeting foreign corporations 
that roll up big profits on us operations but pay little or no 
income tax to the federal government 
when we look at our own tax code it is abundantly clear that 
our own law provides better tax treatment for foreigners doing 
business in the united states than it does for our own citizens 
said rep robert matsui dcalif a sponsor of the bill 
under legislation introduced tuesday foreign companies and some 
foreign investors would be hit for at least 200 million a year in 
additional taxes house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
another sponsor along with rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman 
of the house ways and means committee said the actual take could 
be far higher 
submission of the bill came a month after the internal revenue 
service confirmed it was investigating whether foreign companies 
underpaid us taxes by billions of dollars in the 1980s 
the bill would 
expand the irs authority to investigate whether foreign 
companies have manipulated us tax laws in dealings with their 
american subsidiaries and operating arms for example a foreign 
automaker could artificially inflate the price of parts coming into 
the united states so as to show little or no profit on the sale of 
the completed car 
a 1989 law strengthened the hand of the irs by requiring 
increased reporting and better record keeping by foreign companies 
but it does not apply to pastyear taxes the bill would allow the 
tax agency to use the stricter rules in investigating pastyear 
problems 
tax the capital gains realized when a foreigner sells stock in 
a us corporation the tax would not apply to residents of 
countries with which the united states has treaties prohibiting 
such taxation individual americans and us corporations already 
must pay taxes on such gains 
it is critical that we ensure that foreignowned companies are 
not underpaying their taxes thereby gaining a competitive 
advantage over american companies that are paying their fair share 
of taxes rostenkowski said at a news conference 
the irs says more than half of 36800 foreign companies that 
filed tax returns in 1986 reported no taxable income 
foreigncontrolled corporations reported 542 billion in receipts 
and 15 billion in net income and paid 3 billion in us income 
taxes in 1986 
gephardt said foreign automobile manufacturers had 77 billion 
in sales and paid less than 12 million in tax no wonder 
us automakers have had a hard time competing he said 
the united states has been relying on foreign investors to help 
finance this countrys budget deficit gephardt and rostenkowski 
said they are not worried that their bill would discourage such 
investment 
all we are asking people to do is pay what americans pay to do 
business in this country rostenkowski said

in his last week on the job the dea office in fort myers fla 
was firebombed and destroyed 
lawn leaves the dea as public attention is focused more than 
ever on drugs and the federal budget for fighting narcotics is 
booming when he started the deas budget was about 250 million 
the bush administration is seeking about 700 million for 1991 
but at the same time cocaine and its smokeable derivative 
crack enveloped the nation heroin production overseas increased 
dramatically and domestic producers revved up manufacture of 
methamphetamine known as crank or speed 
lawn says he regrets he didnt speak out more forcefully about 
the need for drug education and reducing demand for drugs letting 
people know that to rely on law enforcement alone is to lose that 
war 
he started saying that in 1984 when few law enforcement 
officials were willing to do so publicly but he slacked off 
partly because he was new to the dea 
lawn said he also regrets he did not develop a dea training 
academy for state local and foreign narcotics officers the 
academy remains on the drawing board 
his major accomplishment he said is the deas increased 
profile with the public congress and the administration including 
the greater funding 
lawns claim to fame started a decade ago when as an fbi agent 
he led the investigation that solved the 1979 murder of us 
district court judge john h wood jr known as maximum john 
in san antonio it was considered the most expensive federal 
investigation in history at that time 
it was a dead case until lawn went down there and revived 
it said john russell thenspokesman for the justice 
departments criminal division 
lawn is leaving the dea a few months before he turns 55 the 
mandatory retirement age for federal law enforcement agents 
although he could remain as administrator without the special 
agents badge he decided to retire 
it was important to me to be a special agent so that when i 
talked to the agents they knew they were talking to someone who 
shared their concerns shared their problems knew the reality of 
what its like to be on the street knew about the fears that 
families have being in the law enforcement environment he said

six months ago manuela gastmann lit a candle 
in church and dashed into the street to join a rally against the 
communist government she spent the next day in a prison cell 
today she pores over the meager finances of a tiny activist 
group wondering how a group of people who so adroitly won a 
revolution could so badly lose an election 
we gave the people freedom the 28yearold east berliner 
said tuesday they wanted money 
east germans voted in their first free elections on sunday and 
overwhelmingly threw their support to a conservative alliance that 
promised quick reunification with prosperous west germany 
a threeparty coalition containing many of the leaders of east 
germanys peaceful revolt captured just 29 percent of the vote 
finishing fourth and lagging behind even the reconstituted 
communist party they ousted it will have 12 seats in the 
400member parliament 
the coalitions showing was largely anticipated in recent weeks 
after hardline communist leader erich honecker was forced out on 
oct 18 by massive protests activists spoke of a third way 
between capitalism and communism of governing east germany with a 
new form of democratic socialism 
but the cry for reunification with west germany quickly 
dominated the protest movement 
michael kukuntz one of the founders of the most prominent 
revolutionary group new forum said the opening of the berlin wall 
in november effectively transformed the revolt against dictatorial 
rule into a clamor for consumer goods 
the air began rushing out of his movement he calls my child 
on the night the wall was opened he said east germans who now had 
free access to west germany migrated by the thousands daily and 
those who went west only to visit brought back images of a parallel 
world of wealthy germans 
new forum formed a shoestring political party with two other 
dissident groups democracy now and the initiative for peace and 
freedom 
kukuntz acknowledged that there were differences within new 
forum over whether to embrace reunification and that the groups 
position remained vague in the months before the vote 
meanwhile the wellheeled alliance led by the christian 
democratic union and backed by west german chancellor helmut kohl 
promised rapid unification it won with 48 percent of the vote 
the social democrats who were backed by the west german social 
democrats and favored a slower pace for unification finished 
second 
its not a victory for the christian democrats its not a 
victory for kohl its a victory for the deutsche mark said 
michael bartoszek who helped organize the new democracy dissident 
group in september 
the members of our movement were the first to fight for 
democracy he said 
kukuntz 39 a graphic designer said he began dissident 
activity in the early 1980s his wife was arrested for taking part 
in a group called women for peace and fired from her job 
miss gastmann was working in a staterun exportimport office 
when she said she was drawn into the protest movement in september 
she said she took part in demonstrations at the gethsemane 
evangelical church in east berlin holding candlelight protest 
vigils with thousands of others 
she said she was among hundreds authorities arrested following 
an oct 7 rally at the church and was held for 24 hours in a small 
cell with 20 other women she said she saw police beat some of 
those women 
when the hardline communists fell less than two weeks later and 
the selfstyled communist reformers who replaced them agreed to new 
elections miss gastmann began working as a bookkeeper with the 
initiative for peace and freedom 
i was very sad after the elections because the people of the 
christian democratic union are not the people of the 
revolution she said i cant understand why the people of east 
germany cant see that 
while a solidarity activist leads poland and a former dissident 
is president of czechoslovakia the east german revolutionaries say 
they will continue to fill the role that is most familiar to them 
we started as the opposition and now we are the opposition 
once more said bartoszek

the bush administrations new national 
security strategy says us forces are more likely to be called to 
fight in third world countries than in central europe or against 
the soviet union 
a report on the strategy sent to congress on tuesday warns of 
political turbulence ahead and cautions against moving away from 
the us role as world peacekeeper 
the report said future conflicts are more likely to break out in 
the third world which a senior white house official called a 
much more unstable place than europe 
another senior official who like the first insisted on 
anonymity told reporters our mission in the world may be 
shifting from containment of an enemy to providing a reassurance of 
stability 
theres no question we still have the central task of 
maintaining the balance of power with the soviet union but we see 
a new era of uncertainties new possible sources of instability 
new concerns even in the european area and certainly in the third 
world the official said 
the strategy will help guide president bushs efforts to 
streamline and reshape american military forces in the postcold 
war period 
in a new era we foresee that our military power will remain 
an essential underpinning of the global balance but less 
prominently and in different ways the report said 
the growing technological sophistication of third world 
conflicts will place serious demands on our forces they must be 
able to respond quickly and appropriately as the application of 
even small amounts of power early in a crisis usually pays 
significant dividends 
in a new era some third world conflicts may no longer take 
place against the backdrop of superpower competition yet many will 
continue to threaten us interests the report said 
it will be increasingly difficult to slow the spread of 
chemical biological and nuclear weapons along with longrange 
delivery systems instability in areas troubled by poverty 
injustice racial religious or ethnic tension will continue 
whether or not exploited by the soviets it said 
bush reiterated his hopes for securing three major arms control 
agreements this year on longrange nuclear weapons conventional 
forces in europe and chemical weapons 
he said the us postwar policy of containment of an 
aggressive repressive soviet union has succeeded brilliantly 
the annual report by the presidents national security council 
said that western rearmament and the economic boom in the 1980s 
helped trigger the systemic crisis engulfing the communist 
world 
we have seen powerful pentup democratic forces unleashed all 
across eastern europe that have overturned communist dictatorships 
and are reversing the pattern of soviet dominance it said 
such fundamental political change will likely be turbulent 
there may be setbacks and new sources of instability as the 
soviet union and the states of eastern europe advance into 
historically uncharted waters 
the report said our goal is to move beyond containment to 
seek the integration of the soviet union into the international 
system as a constructive partner 
it said central america remains a disruptive factor in the 
ussoviet relationship we hold the soviet union accountable for 
the behavior of its clients in cuba and nicaragua

an icy weather monster in canada is beginning 
to worry us winter wheat farmers whose crop is waking up and 
starting to grow 
there has been a vast improvement in the crop recently 
because of muchneeded precipitation says agriculture department 
meteorologist raymond p motha 
from southern texas north through oklahoma kansas and into 
nebraska where hard red winter wheat was planted last fall for 
the 1990 harvest the crop has responded well to the new moisture 
the key thing right now is the possibility of cold weather as 
the crop comes out of dormancy motha said tuesday its 
growing and kind of tender in case we get a hard freeze 
motha said crop watchers are keeping tabs on a situation in 
canada that could send cold weather scooting south by the weekend 
as far as freeze danger weve got another two or three weeks 
of potential freezing weather in the nations breadbasket he 
said 
mothas comments followed a weekly report that showed too much 
rain in parts of the south have hampered farm work while other 
areas have benefited from widespread precipitation 
heavy rains added to the alreadysurplus moisture supplies in 
much of the mississippi delta the governments joint 
agricultural weather facility said in its report for march 1218 
rain improved winter wheat prospects in most of the great plains 
and portions of the pacific northwest 
the facility is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not 
include production forecasts 
pastures were reported to be improving as a result of the 
widespread moisture livestock was said to be in good condition and 
spring lambing and calving continued in most areas 
motha said the southeast is almost excessively wet and that 
many of the droughtplagued areas of the last two years have 
recovered others however still suffer longterm shortages of 
subsoil moisture 
theyve had some substantial and droughtrelieving rains in 
the southern and central great plains so that much of the hard 
red wheat area of texas oklahoma and kansas are in pretty good 
shape moisturewise he said 
in the eastern corn belt soil moisture is generally in pretty 
good shape motha said but in the western corn belt including 
iowa nebraska and southern minnesota the longterm reserves of 
moisture are still below normal 
those are the deeper reserves that allow crops to survive brief 
periods of dry weather when this subsoil moisture is scant the 
topsoil needs frequent rain to sustain the growing plants 
motha said the longterm deficiencies still persist in iowa 
nebraska and the dakotas but he said recent moisture has helped 
ease the situation from the last fall 
in the west there are still large and troublesome areas of 
drought particularly in southern california he said 
the weekly report said winter wheat was in generally 
goodtoexcellent condition in idaho and goodtofair shape 
in washington spring planting of small grains was under way in the 
columbia basin of oregon 
looking at other crops the report said 
although rain and wet fields continued to hamper field work in 
the mississippi delta corn planting progressed as the weather 
allowed rice planting continued in louisiana 
corn planting was about onethird finished in georgia and was 
making progress in southern texas except in some rainy areas 
cotton and sorghum planting continued in the rio grande valley and 
the coastal bend area 
irrigation was under way in floridas citrus area with trees 
setting newcrop fruit peaches were in goodtoexcellent 
condition in georgia and peach trees were setting fruit in texas 
springlike weather prevailed over floridas major vegetable 
areas and the harvest picked up steam vegetable growth was 
reported to be good in the rio grande valley of texas with 
harvests continuing for carrot cabbage celery and lettuce crops

the pentagon policy of excluding women from 
combat does not keep female soldiers out of harms way and it 
denies them the chance to further their careers rep patricia 
schroeder says 
it appears that women can be the first killed but theyre not 
allowed to be in the front lines mrs schroeder dcolo told 
the house armed services personnel subcommittee tuesday 
mrs schroeder has proposed legislation directing the army to 
conduct a fouryear test to see how women would perform in 
combatrelated units 
by law women in the navy and air force are barred from serving 
aboard combat ships and aircraft the army is not covered by the 
law but has sculpted its own policy in line with it 
mrs schroeder argued that many of the noncombat jobs that 
women now hold put them in the line of fire on the modernday 
battlefield which relies more on hightech weaponry than 
handtohand combat 
the congresswoman submitted her bill following the us invasion 
of panama last december during which some of the 600 women who 
took part in the initial operation came under fire even though 
their jobs were not considered combatrelated 
but the armys personnel chief testified that the experiment 
mrs schroeder advocates is unnecessary 
the fundamental issue is one of national policy theres 
no ducking that whether women should serve in direct combat and 
thats for you to decide lt gen allen k ono said 
ono argued other nations such as canada have wrestled with the 
issue of using women in combatrelated jobs and that the united 
states can learn from such experience although canada recently 
offered infantry training to 80 women only one was able to become 
qualified he said 
the army cant operate without its women soldiers but in 
regards to combat arms we are able to recruit sufficient numbers 
of males ono said 
however lt gen thomas a hickey the air forces personnel 
chief testified there probably isnt a combat job in the air 
force that women couldnt do 
theyre physically capable theyre emotionally capable if 
you want us to put them there its up to you hickey said 
mrs schroeder argued that the restriction shuts off many 
routes of advancement for those women who want to make the 
military a career 
rep beverly byron dmd who chairs the personnel 
subcommittee said she did not favor opening combat jobs to women 
but is interested in making sure that women in the military have 
promotion opportunities in their selected fields 
frontline duty is crucial to advancing to the top ranks of the 
military leadership several female military officers testified 
such a restriction cant help but slow the advancement of 
people to senior ranks said capt kathleen conley an air force 
academy graduate who flies the air forces huge c141 transport 
planes i hope women will be flying fighter aircraft very very 
soon 
however some military women acknowledged they are not 
interested in entering the combatrelated fields 
i dont want to go into the infantry i dont think women are 
physically or emotionally ready to do so said army spec rose m 
deberry a member of the 16th military police battalion who took 
part in the panama invasion

nasa will talk with aerospace company 
officials thursday about sending astronauts to rescue a 157 
million communications satellite stranded in space by a miswired 
titan 3 rocket 
the intelsat 6 satellite is whirling around earth at an altitude 
of 276 miles about 22000 miles lower than it should be to do its 
job 
the design was wrong said judy stowell a spokeswoman for 
martin marietta corp which built the rocket our analysis shows 
an engineering design error caused the vehicle to be wired 
improperly 
as a result after the titan was launched on march 14 the 
satellite didnt separate automatically as it was supposed to when 
engineers sent a separation signal a small rocket that was to 
boost the satellite to its duty station stayed with the spent titan 
and left the satellite marooned 
a martin marietta spokesman was quoted by the denver post as 
saying that the titan had been wired to launch two satellites and 
that the separation signal went to a location where there was none 
but ms stowell said tuesday that explanation was premature and 
that two committees were investigating the failure 
while martin marietta searched for the cause the national 
aeronautics and space administration scheduled its meeting at the 
johnson space center in houston with representatives of intelsat 
owner of the satellite and hughes aircraft its builder 
intelsat a 118nation consortium did not insure the satellite 
which was to have gone into service over the atlantic ocean a 
spokesman tony trujillo said it was the most sophisticated 
communications satellite ever built capable of carrying 120000 
telephone calls simultaneously 
intelsat was being charged 115 million for the titan rocket and 
launch by martin marietta the satellite cost an additional 157 
million 
nasa hasnt said whether it is willing to go after the 
satellite as it has for five others 
they are just going to come in and give us some information 
where the spacecraft is and its condition and so forth said hal 
lambert manager of integration operations at the space center 
we are going to discuss whether its possible to get the 
satellite 
two rescue methods have been proposed lambert said in one the 
space shuttle would carry a rocket stage into orbit to be bolted 
onto the satellite by astronauts in the other the satellite would 
be put into the shuttle cargo bay and brought back to earth for 
refitting 
because it was not intended for shuttle operations the fiveton 
satellite has no fitting that could be grappled by the shuttles 
robot arm that would mean a special capture device would have to 
be designed and built 
industry sources have little doubt the rescue can be 
accomplished astronauts have saved five satellites that way 
bringing three home and repairing two in orbit 
the cost of such a mission however would be high and probably 
would become the deciding factor with shuttle flights costing 250 
million and up nasa no longer will rescue satellites for 15 
million as it did in 1984 with the palapa and westar satellites 
nasa spokesman say they dont know how much would be charged 
today because the agency no longer does commercial business and 
there is no published rate schedule the charges however probably 
would be based on the amount of cargo space and weight involved 
a virginia company orbital sciences corp has a device called 
a transfer orbit stage that includes a duplicate of the rocket that 
was to carry the intelsat satellite to its high orbit 
joseph padavano chief engineer of the device said it would 
take up only onefifth of the shuttle cargo space but that it 
weighs 25000 pounds more than half of the shuttles capacity

members of congress say the state department 
ignored key facts in reporting that the palestine liberation 
organization is adhering to its commitment to renounce terrorism 
its close to a whitewash sen connie mack rfla said 
tuesday it could have been a lot tougher 
mack joined sen joseph lieberman dconn and rep mel levine 
dcalif in criticizing the state department report which was 
sent to congress earlier this week 
the report said there have been nearly 30 border and rocket 
attacks by palestinian groups against israel since plo chairman 
yasser arafat pledged in december 1988 not to pursue terrorist 
tactics 
at least nine of the attacks involved constituent groups of 
the plo the report said and in three cases civilians appeared to 
be the target 
nonetheless the report said we have no evidence in those 
cases or any others that the actions were authorized and approved 
by the plo executive committee or by arafat personally 
but lieberman said the report demonstrates the plo still has a 
long way to go before it can be considered a responsible or 
peaceful player on the international stage 
the state department also provided incomplete information he 
said and officials were bending over backwards not to be too 
critical of the plo for fear of jeopardizing the middle east 
peace process 
secretary of state james a baker iii took into account 
proposals by the plo made mostly through egypt in trying to open 
negotiations between israel and palestinian arabs the effort was 
suspended with the collapse last week of the israeli government 
lieberman and mack cosponsored the legislation that requires the 
state department to report to congress every four months on whether 
the plo is complying the its noterrorism pledge 
lieberman said the report failed to report some terrorist acts 
and inflammatory statements made by palestinians affiliated with 
the plo for instance he said mohammad rashid who was involved 
in the bombing of a pan american world airways plane in 1982 has 
been offered legal aid by the plo 
levine called the report extremely disappointing and said 
it seems that the administration has selectively reviewed the 
evidence in order to support a preordained conclusion 
arafats renunciation of terrorism and a statement by him 
acknowledging israels existence cleared the way for official us 
talks with the plo those talks are being conducted in tunis by 
robert pelletreau jr the american ambassador to tunisia 
the report described the plo as a loosely structured 
organization composed of disparate elements with different 
views it said the plo is deficient in controlling all of its 
groups especially those that oppose current plo policy and carry 
out crossborder attacks against israel 
these deficiencies are not reasons to excuse plo activities or 
to relax our vigilance the report said on the contrary we 
have told the plo we will hold them to their commitments and we 
continue to examine all incidents on a casebycase basis

depression vandalism and heavy 
drinking are rife in an abandoned hotel in this rhine river city 
that serves as a center for east germans who fled their country 
seeking a better life 
many of the halfmillion east germans whove arrived over the 
past six months have managed to get a piece of prosperity but 
others have been left behind in the rougher climate of capitalist 
west germany 
we were tempted to come here by all the nice things that were 
dangled out in front of us said eric patz a miner from 
karlmarxstadt who is now unemployed in remagen it was all 
misleading 
and now that were here were treated like the last piece of 
garbage added his friend marion schilling 
i knew things would be hard here but not this hard said 
ms schilling who has lived in a small room at this center with 
her boyfriend and 7yearold daughter since december i dont get 
enough money to buy the basic things my daughter needs like new 
shoes 
life may get tougher for the resettlers on tuesday west 
germany announced it would cut many of the special privileges 
enjoyed by the immigrants 
the changes to take place july 1 would eliminate guarantees of 
a place to stay startingout money and lowinterest loans for 
new arrivals the changes are part of an effort to stop the influx 
of east germans which has strained housing and job markets 
at the beginning in september it was really euphoric here 
said daniel selle who directs the center in remagen which is 15 
miles south of bonn 
the people who began coming later have a lot of problems that 
they brought with them from the east they have trouble holding 
jobs or they drink 
many of them too had illusions about what life in the west 
would be like he said in an interview tuesday 
the influx intensified dramatically after hungary opened its 
borders to east germans in september and thousands poured into west 
germany it continued even after the toppling of east germanys 
communist government in october 
west germany is pushing for quick unification in hopes the east 
germans will decide to stay home especially now that voters there 
elected their own government sunday 
the remagen center financed by rhinelandpalatinate state and 
operated by the red cross houses 76 people the wallpaper is 
peeling from the rooms and winding hallways but they are generally 
in good shape 
the center has three communal kitchens and several private ones 
and residents can sift through piles of donated clothes to pluck 
out a wardrobe 
however brandnew refrigerators in one communal kitchen stand 
empty because people were stealing food from each other an 
intended playroom for children was turned by residents into a 
garbage dump and animosity abounds between east germans and the 
many ethnic germans from the soviet union and other east bloc 
countries who also live in the center 
reports of fighting and heavy drinking have come from centers 
throughout the country in the past few weeks 
selle an easygoing man with round wirerimmed glasses and a 
long ponytail characterizes his work at the center as frustrating 
people here arent willing to act as a community there is no 
solidarity he said and every monday i have a whole list of 
things to get repaired which were destroyed over the weekend 
however not all immigrants at the center are embittered bernd 
hobusch says he and his family were grateful to have had a place to 
stay after their arrival 
we had so many things to take care of getting our papers in 
order and looking for work said hobusch a 39yearold 
construction worker from the east german city of dessau living 
here at least relieved us of one problem 
hobusch and his family will be moving out of the center next 
week he his wife and four children have been living in one room 
there since december 
ive had a job since january but i had to earn enough to pay 
a security deposit on an apartment hobusch said it was really 
hard to find an apartment with four children landlords here dont 
like kids 
hobusch complained about the attitude of many other east germans 
at the center 
a lot of them just collect money from the state and sit around 
all day drinking he said they live here for months and dont 
even look for jobs

the federal government is moving to fulfill 
franklin d roosevelts promise to send home the remains of polish 
patriot and preeminent pianist ignace jan paderewski when poland 
is free 
the conditions could not be met over five decades of nazi 
occupation and communist dictatorship and there still are 
concerns to be overcome 
but with poland quickly moving to full independence and 
democratic rule us and polish officials now are looking to june 
1991 the 50th anniversary of the pianists death in new york city 
as the appropriate date to return his remains 
on thursday tadeusz mazowiecki the first noncommunist prime 
minister of poland in 40 years will visit paderewskis temporary 
resting place in a crypt at arlington national cemetery 
but us officials say they have no indication that mazowiecki 
will demand the immediate return of the remains of a man who is one 
of polands foremost heroes and became the polish republics first 
premier 
its the general consensus in the polish community both here 
and in poland that it would be best on the 50th anniversary of his 
death june 29 1991 said a state department official 
the trends are very favorable and final decisions will be made 
in the fall as to the exact arrangements said the official who 
spoke on the condition he not be identified 
there are going to be major changes in the polish government 
between now and then the official said there is a high 
probability for a new constitution and new senior officers who are 
not communists 
we have waited because we wanted to make sure the steps that 
needed to be taken were accomplished properly and that the 
paderewski family the catholic church and the polishamerican 
community were all in agreement that poland was once again whole 
and free he said 
at his death at age 80 paderewski was the most famous pianist 
in the world 
but he also used his concerts to raise money for polish refugees 
after world war i and served as the first premier of the republic 
of poland in 1919 and 1920 he became president of the parliament 
of the polish government in exile in london after nazi troops 
stormed across the polish frontier in 1939 he still was working 
for poland at the time of his death 
on july 5 1941 several days after his death paderewskis body 
was placed at president roosevelts order in a crypt at the base of 
the monument raised to those killed when the battleship maine 
exploded in havana harbor in 1898 a spark that helped ignite the 
spanishamerican war 
paderewskis zinc coffin lies inside a large cypress box inside 
the crypt near the base of the maines flag staff 
in 1962 when it was apparent paderewskis temporary sojourn 
would be lengthy president john f kennedy reaffirmed roosevelts 
promise that the body would be returned only when poland was free 
a bronze plaque placed shortly thereafter reads ignace jan 
paderewski polish statesman and musician his remains rest 
temporarily within the uss maine memorial

an informal survey of new york city abortion 
providers suggests that women who reveal they are infected with the 
aids virus may quickly find their appointments canceled 
twothirds of the abortion clinics and physicians surveyed by 
the citys human rights commission canceled an appointment after 
the caller said she was infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv which causes aids 
revealing your hiv status to a health care person is not 
safe katherine franke a commission lawyer who led the study 
said tuesday 
most people dont tell thats the way they get abortions 
she said 
the commission began looking into the matter after receiving 
several reports from women who claimed they had been denied 
abortion services because they were hivpositive 
physicians and representatives with aids organizations and 
abortion groups said they were unaware of any other study that has 
documented the problem in other parts of the country although they 
had heard anecdotal reports 
dr lewis koplik an albuquerque nm 
obstetriciangynecologist who heads the national abortion 
federations medical advisory committee said he has an 
undocumented gut feeling that the new york experience may be 
occurring elsewhere 
if you have one woman who has hiv infection or aids and cant 
get service thats a real problem its just something that should 
not happen he said 
los angeles obstetriciangynecologist david grimes chairman of 
planned parenthoods medical advisory committee said he does not 
believe the problem is widespread although it may be more apparent 
on the east coast where more women are infected with hiv 
he did say he often sees patients referred by other physicians 
who feel inadequately prepared to treat hivinfected women 
women who are hivpositive but have no symptoms of aids and no 
other diseases are generally at no greater risk than nonhiv women 
for abortion grimes said but he said women whose immune systems 
are compromised whether by aids or some other disease are more 
appropriately treated in a hospital 
in the survey conducted from november 1988 through february 
1989 callers from the new york city human rights commission made 
appointments with 30 abortion clinics and physicians that 
advertised in the yellow pages twenty canceled the appointment 
after the caller said she was infected with hiv but had no symptoms 
of aids 
twelve of the 20 said they did not have adequate infection 
control while others said abortion on an hivinfected woman was 
too complicated a procedure for them to handle and referred the 
caller to a hospital 
many of the responses were very hostile ms franke said 
some just hung up or said we cant treat your kind 
for women refused services or referred to a crowded public 
hospital the result may be delay in getting an abortion which 
increases chances of complications ms franke said 
the chances that a woman will pass the aids virus to her baby 
are estimated at between 20 percent and 50 percent 
franke said that while the human rights commission would be 
prepared to file suit against clinics that refuse to serve women 
with hiv it would rather see the problem addressed through 
education of physicians and other health professionals 
public health officials believe that about 1 million people in 
the united states are infected with the aids virus more than 
11000 of the 121645 cases of aids in us adults reported since 
june 1 1981 have been women

state alcohol and drug abuse directors are 
calling for the federal government to nearly triple the 12 
billion it now spends for treatment programs for alcoholics and 
addicts 
there is an urgent need to make additional treatment services 
available to all persons who need them especially adolescents 
pregnant women and iv intravenous and cocaine drug users said 
john gustafson president of the national association of state 
alcohol and drug abuse directors 
the estimated total costs of alcohol and drug abuse exceed 200 
billion but the bush administration spends only about onehalf of 
1 percent of that amount on treatment the group said in a report 
tuesday 
block grants the states main source of federal funds for 
treatment programs and mental health services total 12 billion 
this year the association said that figure should be boosted by at 
least 2 billion 
federal spending for treatment is at least partially based 
upon a suspicion that treatment programs for substance abusers are 
of dubious value the report said 
however the association said its analysis of more than 15 years 
of research found that substance abuse treatment increases 
employment decreases crime increases productivity and reduces 
health costs 
one study by the university of california at los angeles 
estimated that for every dollar spent for treatment services 
1154 in social costs is saved 
there are no great unsolved mysteries to drug and alcohol 
treatment the real mystery is why we spend so little treating 
dependency and so much paying for its effects crime violence 
illness the breakup of families poverty and death gustafson said 
for comparison he estimated it costs 50000 to keep an inmate 
in prison for a year and 100000 to care for an aids patient for a 
year while outpatient drug treatment costs about 3000 per 
patient 
the governments national institute on alcohol abuse and 
alcoholism estimated that 18 million adults abuse alcohol and that 
10 million of those are alcoholics 
the report said 41 states and the district of columbia reported 
that a total of 14 million people 123525 of them under 18 
receive alcohol and drug treatment each year 
those states estimated that 106 million others are in need of 
such treatment 
the report said that 66766 people in 44 states are on waiting 
lists for treatment about half have been waiting for at least a 
month

roman catholic cardinal joseph bernardin says 
the church should not discipline catholic public officials just 
because they do not oppose abortion 
he said all public officials catholics and otherwise should be 
held accountable for their positions 
it is important however that we continue to engage them and 
not cut them off said bernardin one of the churchs most 
prominent speakers on abortion and other prolife issues 
his comments tuesday night at georgetown university came four 
months after a catholic california assemblywoman was banned from 
receiving communion because of her public stance in favor of 
abortion rights 
lucy killea won election to the california senate after the 
widely publicized action taken by bishop leo t maher in response 
to her television ads focusing on abortion 
bernardin noted that the national conference of catholic bishops 
voted last november for a resolution declaring no catholic can 
responsibly take a prochoice stand when the choice in question 
involves the taking of innocent life 
in accord with the bishops statement i am firmly committed 
to the position that public officials who recognize the evil of 
abortion have a responsibility to limit its extent to work for its 
prevention and to protect unborn life said the cardinal a 
former head of the bishops prolife committee 
he said the church has a clear right to involve itself in public 
policy controversies such as abortion 
however he said i believe that the church can be most 
effective in the public debate on abortion through moral 
persuasion not punitive measures 
bernardin did not mention the california case by name nor 
other recent politicianchurch leader disputes such as the one 
involving new york gov mario cuomo and a bishop who suggested 
cuomo risked going to hell because of his stance on abortion

a consumer group says supermarket displays 
that put sugarladen cereals at kidseye level are attracting 
children with candy ads masquerading as cereal 
such displays add to the problems of getting children to eat 
more nutritious foods center for science in the public interest 
said tuesday 
victoria leonard said the center surveyed supermarket cereal 
displays and found childoriented cereals in colorful packages 
generally lower than the more nutritious cereals marketed for 
adults 
that makes it more likely to catch the attention of a child 
walking by said leonard children are being bombarded by candy 
ads that are masquerading as cereal 
cspi volunteers last november looked at the location of cereals 
displayed in 27 stores in the boston san francisco chicago 
baltimore and washington dc metropolitan areas 
leonard said the center has written the stores asking that they 
change the displays and elevate the childrens cereals 
children are attracted by the brand names and flashy packaging 
and then plead with their parents to buy them she said we 
want parents to make the choice 
cspi is a nonprofit 200000member organization founded in 1971

a former official of a baltimore bank says he 
has filed a revised lawsuit seeking 4 million from the bank the 
cia and other federal officials for allegedly ruining his life 
after he balked at handling arms transactions for a cia front 
robert maxwell charges that he was threatened forced to resign 
and suffered a nervous breakdown after he questioned the legality 
of certain dealings relating to an account held by the nowdefunct 
associated traders corp at the first national bank of maryland in 
baltimore 
maxwell left the bank in late 1985 taking with him several 
documents which he told a news conference tuesday linked 
associated traders with at least 23 million in covert arms 
shipments to central america angola and afghanistan 
published accounts by columnist jack anderson and others dating 
to 1986 have identified associated traders dissolved in the wake 
of that publicity as a cia front according to maxwells suit

interior department officials are under 
instructions to develop better protections for treatment of sacred 
objects and human remains on federal lands 
interior secretary manuel lujan said tuesday he told interior 
bureau heads the new policies should be based on four areas of 
special emphasis 
public education and participation 
cooperation in fighting archaeological looters 
more interagency information exchange 
increased site inventories and collections curation 
this is a subject of much concern to many americans and 
especially to american indians said lujan unfortunately for 
many years indian graves were often desecrated and the human 
remains and objects within them treated disrespectfully

a field biologist who trudged through a soggy 
leechinfested forest in search of a longlost relative of humans 
and apes returned with malaria blood poisoning and the first 
photographs of an animal no scientist had ever seen alive 
for a week i couldnt move bernhard meier of ruhr 
university in bochum west germany said in a telephone interview 
tuesday 
but he recovered and his sighting of the hairyeared dwarf 
lemur in madagascar has been described as one of the most important 
rediscoveries of a mammal in the last decade 
i went three times to that forest to find that animal 
although i already knew it was there he said 
an old man in a nearby village had told him about it 
to get to the forest near mananara in northern madagascar an 
island country off the east coast of africa you need to hike 
three days long and strong meier said nothing is dry after a 
few kilometers because you need to cross many big rivers and 
creeks containing leeches 
the leeches are not dangerous most people say oh leeches 
i dont want these plumsized ugly satisfied leeches on me 
but the mosquitoes are dangerous they transmit malaria 
five preserved specimens the first collected 115 years ago are 
held in museums but until meiers discovery researchers had no 
idea whether the creature still existed 
the first complete description of the animal known to 
scientists as allocebus trichotis will be published shortly in 
folia primatologica a scientific journal meier made the discovery 
last april but it is only now being reported 
the rediscovery of the lemur pronounced leemur is important 
because it is the only surviving species of an entire genus of 
lemurs that have disappeared said russell mittermeier president 
of conservation international in washington dc and a primate 
specialist 
if you lose a species there are close relatives around he 
said if you lose a genus thats worse the discovery of the 
hairyeared dwarf lemur is one of the two most important 
rediscoveries of mammals in a decade mittermeier said 
the other was the rediscovery of the softspined porcupine in 
brazil in 1986 he said 
the lemur is brown and shaped like a mouse with a body 5 inches 
long and a 7inch furry tail it weighs no more than 3 ounces 
allocebus is the smallest primate species in existence except 
during the dry season when the mouse lemur is not fat and is 
smaller meier said 
the lemurs of madagascar are scientifically important because 
they are a group of primates that evolved in isolation during the 
millions of years that the other primates monkeys apes and 
humans were evolving elsewhere 
in effect madagascar is a giant experiment in alternative 
evolution the new scientist an english journal has said 
meier has an enviable record as a lemur hunter within the last 
few years he discovered and described a lemur new to science the 
golden bamboo lemur in collaboration with patricia wright of duke 
university in north carolina he also rediscovered the greater 
bamboo lemur which biologists feared had become extinct 
meier emphasized that the importance of the discovery also lies 
in the attention it focuses on preserving the forest where the 
lemur dwells about 57000 acres of the forest have been designated 
as a biosphere reserve by the united nations educational 
scientific and cultural organization 
that part of the forest is protected but a surrounding area of 
forest about 10 times that size is under increasing pressure from a 
burgeoning local population meier said 
it is one of the last patches of virgin lowland rain forest 
with huge trees you cant imagine 50 meters about 160 feet 
tall meier said this forest is a very special ecosystem and 
cant be substituted by importation of other things

here is a brief look at namibia which 
became independent from south africa today 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
geography the 318252 squaremile country is mostly desert 
with scattered deposits of valuable minerals it is bounded by the 
atlantic ocean south africa zambia botswana and angola its only 
deepwater port walvis bay stays part of south africa after 
independence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
history south africa has ruled namibia since capturing the 
territory of southwest africa from germany in 1915 the southwest 
africa peoples organization swapo began guerrilla attacks in 
1966 after south africa rejected a un resolution demanding it 
relinquish control of the territory an estimated 20000 people 
mostly swapo guerrillas died in the fighting which ended in april 
1989 
un resolution 435 adopted in 1978 established the 
independence process it was not implemented until april 1 1989 
after the united states and the soviet union brokered an agreement 
calling for south african and cuban troop withdrawals from 
neighboring angola where swapo bases were located swapo won the 
most votes in november 1989 elections but had to compromise with 
other parties in writing a westernstyle democratic constitution

population the 1981 census recorded a population of 13 
million but the return of 40000 exiles and the growth rate of 27 
percent a year makes the figure outofdate the population is 
predominantly black divided among seven major ethnic divisions 
plus bushmen mixedrace groups and 75000 whites 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
economy swapo was strongly committed to socialism while in 
exile but since winning the november election has spoken more 
often of working with the mining farming and fishing industries to 
create jobs educate and improve living conditions for the 
impoverished black majority 
south african aid coupled with the whitecontrolled industries 
has made namibia one of the few african countries to achieve an 
annual per capita income of 1000 but the countrys wealth is 
concentrated in the hands of the whites who make up 6 percent of 
the population and south africa is ending its aid

sam nujoma a high school dropout and 
former railway steward who fled his country 30 years ago after his 
arrest for political activity returned in triumph to become its 
first president 
he says he launched a war for independent namibia with four 
guns his southwest africa peoples organization never controlled 
any territory during the 23year guerrilla war against south 
african rule despite the loss of 20000 lives 
nujoma 60 considered a shrewd instinctive politician 
traveled the world winning support for his cause and maintained 
control despite challenges to his leadership 
nujoma who has a full white beard and a perpetual smile was 
generally portrayed by south african authorities as a marxist 
terrorist while in exile 
but since his return home sept 14 even his political opponents 
have praised nujomas moderation and efforts at reconciliation 
including agreement on a westernstyle democratic constitution and 
the appointment of white businessmen and opposition party members 
to his cabinet 
many namibians credit nujomas leadership for the smooth 
transition to independence after the deep divisions caused by the 
war and south africas policies of dividing the country into 
ethnically based regional governments with separate education and 
health care for each race 
nujoma is generally easygoing but can be sensitive about his 
lack of formal schooling he is a compelling speaker when he has a 
prepared text but rambles in disjointed sentences during interviews 
others got their education while i led the struggle nujoma 
once said he had been devoted to politics since his 20s and after 
being fired from his job as a railway steward for trade union 
activities he helped found the ovamboland peoples organization in 
the 1950s 
it was based in ovambo the most populous northern part of the 
territory and was the forerunner to swapo which has been 
criticized for filling its leadership posts with members of 
nujomos ovambo tribe 
he was arrested following a political protest in 1959 and fled 
the territory shortly after his release in exile he helped 
establish swapo and was named president in 1960 
when south africa refused to head a 1966 un resolution ending 
its mandate over the former german colony of southwest africa 
nujoma launched swapos guerrilla campaign we started the armed 
struggle with only two submachine guns and two pistols nujoma 
said last year i got them from algeria plus some rounds of 
ammunition 
swapo was never able to claim military victory but nujoma won 
wide political support during his travels to communist and third 
world countries the united nations declared swapo the sole and 
authentic representative of the namibian people although the 
territory has dozens of political parties 
critics say nujoma was able to maintain his grip on power during 
the years of exile through a ruthless security apparatus that 
detained tortured and killed dissidents and suspected spies at 
swapos camps in angola the organization has acknowledged that 
abuses took place but said some were justified during time of war 
nujoma led swapo to victory with 57 percent of the vote in 
novembers elections for a constitutional assembly but the un 
independence regulations forced the party to compromise with 
opponents in establishing a form of government that limits nujoma 
to two fiveyear terms as president

a massachusetts company is making money out of 
garbage through new recycling methods for cities swimming in the 
refuse of a throwaway society 
public landfills are clogged with paper glass aluminum and 
plastic and less than 10 percent of 160 million tons of garbage 
produced yearly in the united states is recycled according to 
david spencer president and founder of wte corp in bedford 
his company develops methods for processing waste to recover 
ferrous metal and other substances the company also runs 
trashtoenergy plants under contract with cities and joined with 
such companies as dow chemical co to develop plastics recycling 
technology 
at a research station at the university of california at 
berkeley wte hauls in barrels of trash to experiment with ways to 
separate components for recycling and energy conversion 
spencer 44 believes recycling and recovery which is the 
process of extracting certain components of trash will become 
increasingly important as cities run out of land to bury refuse 
long the cheapest and easiest disposal method 
everything we manufacture in this country finds its way into 
the waste stream it all winds up on a trash truck spencer 
said in a recent interview to look at the increase in garbage 
just look at the gnp 
spencer acknowledged that recovery and recycling operations are 
costly for cashstrapped municipalities which must weigh such 
expenses as housing for the elderly against recycling programs 
it often may be less expensive in the short run to bury garbage 
in a landfill but in the long run yesterdays landfill is 
todays superfund site he said 
spencer who has degrees in metallurgy and materials science is 
a philadelphia native who after attending the massachusetts 
institute of technology in cambridge founded waste energy 
technology corp in 1981 the name was changed to wte in 1987 
now a 20 million privately held company with 220 employees 
wtes operations include a wastetoenergy plant and recycling 
facility in akron ohio wasterecovery projects in dade county 
fla and columbus ohio and through a subsidiary a polystyrene 
recycling project in brooklyn ny 
in bedford the company runs the citys curbside recycling 
program 
columbus has wte under contract to use a magnetic process to 
extract ferrous metal from the citys waste stream before waste is 
burned in the citys incinerator that makes the burning process 
less abrasive and wearing on city equipment 
it also reduces the toxic level in and the amount of ash left

an exxon tanker captain who once sailed 
with joseph hazelwood gave him high marks for seamanship but said 
he might not have imbibed as hazelwood did before boarding the 
illfated exxon valdez 
ivan mihajlovic captain of the exxon san francisco who 
testified wednesday in hazelwoods defense said he found no fault 
with the former skippers navigation or with his decision to leave 
the bridge while his tanker transited prince william sound 
on crossexamination assistant district attorney brent cole 
gave the witness a prosecution scenario in which hazelwood had five 
drinks during seven hours ashore in valdez on march 24 the day his 
ship sailed and ran aground 
do you have an opinion whether that is proper conduct for an 
exxon master asked cole 
thats probably something i wouldnt do said mihajlovic 
defense attorney michael chalos objected because of a dispute in 
testimony as to how much hazelwood actually drank but superior 
court judge karl johnstone said cole was entitled to ask the 
question 
chalos then asked the witness you said your own personal 
preference wouldnt be to drink ashore does the fact someone else 
would drink make it improper 
no responded mihajlovic 
mihajlovic was among the final witnesses in the defense case 
which is expected to conclude by weeks end 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is the only exxon valdez crew 
member charged in the nations worst oil spill the tanker gashed 
its hull on bligh reef spewing almost 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude that devastated fisheries wildlife and the pristine shores 
of the sound 
the former skipper is charged with one felony criminal 
mischief and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating 
a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil he faces 
up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines if convicted 
the prosecution maintains that hazelwood was reckless in leaving 
the bridge of his tanker in control of a third mate during a 
transit they claim was hazardous 
but mijalovic said he doesnt consider the sound hazardous and 
noted he has left the bridge of his own vessel in that area he 
said a captain is not required to be on the bridge for that 
transit he said such a regulation only exists for the panama canal 
he also corroborated a defense claim that ships regularly 
navigate the sound without licensed pilots on board he cited a 
1986 letter from the alaska maritime agency that advised captains 
the pilotage requirement was waived as long a vessel had two miles 
of visibility 
hazelwood has a pilotage endorsement for prince william sound 
but his third mate gregory cousins had not taken the required 
exam for endorsement witnesses have said the endorsement shows 
that an officer is familiar with navigational markers and potential 
hazards in the area 
one captain told me it was like getting pilotage for the 
pacific ocean mihajlovic he was joking around that it the 
sound was so open in comparison to the east coast

the bass brothers of texas won a battle of 
millionaires when voters rejected a referendum that would have 
required a huge hog farm to build a 10 million facility to treat 
manure 
weld county residents voted 14706 to 6334 to defeat a 
referendum on the issue county officials said 
national farms inc owned by the brothers from fort worth 
texas opened the massive hogprocessing operation 20 miles east of 
greeley last year when it reaches full capacity the facility will 
process 300000 hogs a year and will be one of the largest hog 
plants in the nation 
our reaction is that it was what we expected said bill haw 
president of national farms we built the most environmentally 
sound livestock facility in the world the people in weld county 
obviously recognized that 
advocates of the treatment plant claimed nitrogen from the pig 
manure is leaching into groundwater and may reach the nearby south 
platte river 
the most prominent backer of the ballot issue was denver oil and 
railroad magnate philip anschutz who owns a 32000acre private 
hunting preserve downstream from the hog plant on the south platte 
in northeastern colorado 
anschutz paid nearly 40000 to underwrite the efforts of a 
citizens group protect our water which was the chief advocate 
for passage 
the ballot proposal asked whether all swine production 
facilities in the county designed to hold more than 25000 
animals must provide secondary sewage treatment national farms 
is the only facility of that size in weld county 
haw claimed anschutz was trying to get even with national farms 
because the company bought land that anschutz wanted for expansion 
of his preserve 
it the vote was a vendetta by philip anschutz haw said 
it didnt take 
anschutz disagreed 
the issue with us has always been making certain that public 
health and environmental protection are maintained as the massive 
hog farm increases its operations he said in a statement 
he said he would continue to monitor the situation 
haw said it would have cost national farms about 10 million to 
build the secondary sewage treatment plant the ballot issue would 
have required 
national farms currently flushes manure from its indoor 
hograising pens several times daily the waste is collected and 
then sprayed onto grazing land used by cattle 
haw contended national farms irrigation system is sufficient 
treatment and that growing vegetation will consume the nitrogen 
from the hog wastes 
other weld county cattle feedlot operators feared passage of the 
ballot issue could hurt the countys economy in the long run 
we think its serious not only for business its serious for 
the whole economic climate of weld county said richard l 
monfort president of conagra red meat cos of greeley

voters in special elections broadened new yorks 
congressional delegation to include a veteran hispanic lawmaker and 
a young republican woman whos taking her fathers seat 
susan molinari a 31yearold republican city council member 
easily prevailed tuesday to fill the post vacated by her father 
guy molinari who resigned to become staten island borough 
president she had 60 percent of the vote 
democratic assemblyman jose serrano won even more easily to 
replace robert garcia a democrat who quit his south bronx seat 
after his conviction in the wedtech influencepeddling scandal 
serrano 46 had 92 percent against lackluster opposition 
he will be the only puerto rico native serving as a full voting 
member of congress molinari whose district includes staten island 
and a sliver of brooklyn will be the youngest member of congress 
im just thrilled and very honored by what has taken place 
tonight said molinari who took a congratulatory telephone call 
from president bush 
she called voters in her district where democrats predominate 
but often cross party lines probably the most sophisticated in 
the city 
serrano who rose from poverty to political prominence 
celebrated with mayor david dinkins and supporters in a bronx 
restaurant noting the days foul weather he exulted here we 
are a little bit damp and a lotta bit happy 
the hispanic leader had 26719 votes or 92 percent and 
republican simeon golar had 2027 votes or 8 percent with all 
precincts in turnout traditionally low in the district was about 
14 percent of the registered voters 
molinari had 45682 votes or 60 percent and democrat robert j 
gigante had 25916 votes or 34 percent with all precincts 
reporting two minor party candidates shared the rest turnout was 
about 31 percent 
serrano moved to the bronx with his family when he was 7 and 
worked as a bank teller among other jobs before winning his 
assembly seat in 1974 he rose to be education committee chairman 
earning a reputation as an earnest and thorough legislator 
jose roberto martinez director of the puerto rican federal 
affairs office in washington said he expected serrano to take a 
lead in representing puerto rican concerns absolutely it will 
be helpful he said 
for his part serrano noted that his congressional district is 
one of the nations poorest and said he plans to speak often with 
schoolchildren encouraging them to improve their lives 
representing this district is more than being a congressman 
he said in an interview its like being a big brother a social 
worker a friend to people who need someone to talk to them and to 
encourage them to go on 
molinari won by dint of her own success in the city council as 
well as her fathers popularity elected to the council by a 
161vote margin in 1985 she won reelection last year in a 
landslide 
her father who held the seat since 1980 was cochairman of 
bushs campaign in new york in 1988 and his contacts should help 
her establish a presence in congress 
at the same time molinari has cited her independence from her 
father and from the bush administration on matters such as 
legalized abortion which she supports in the campaign she 
stressed environmental issues a prime concern in staten island

as namibians danced in the 
streets celebrating independence after 75 years of south african 
rule many whites in this country were feeling betrayed and bitter 
it seems as if the battle over the years was in vain said 
johnny johnson editor of the citizen a newspaper traditionally 
supportive of the south african government but critical of its 
handling of namibia 
at one time southwest africa was regarded virtually as a 
fifth province of south africa johnson wrote in an editorial he 
noted that hundreds of south africans lost their lives in its 
defense the border became synonymous with patriotism and duty 
and love of ones own country 
the border he wrote of is the one namibia shares with angola 
500 miles from the northernmost tip of south africa where south 
african troops had fought namibian guerrillas and their allies 
angolan government troops 
many south africans had come to feel namibia also known as 
southwest africa was part of their country 
the southwest africa peoples organization swapo began a war 
of urban bombings in 1966 when south africa rejected a un 
resolution calling on it to grant namibia independence swapo 
established bases in angola to the north after that country won 
independence from portugal in 1975 
but the arrival of 50000 cuban troops to help the new marxist 
angolan government in its civil war with usbacked guerrillas 
gave south africa a reason to delay namibian independence and an 
excuse to enter angola on the side of the antimarxist rebels 
pretoria said it would never allow namibia to become independent 
with the chance that cuban troops would use the territory to reach 
the borders of south africa 
on the eve of namibias independence president fw de klerk 
told his nation that it had always been the governments intention 
to grant independence 
today is the culmination of a process which we have started a 
long time ago he said weve been working for creation of a 
climate which would allow namibians to decide for themselves what 
they want to do 
what some south africans could not accept is that the majority 
of namibians chose swapo and its leader sam nujoma whom the south 
african government had characterized for decades as part of the 
total communist onslaught 
the day swapo takes power the communist flag of moscow will 
fly over windhoek defense minister magnus malan once said 
but it was a rainbowcolored flag representing a multiracial 
government under a westernstyle democratic constitution that was 
raised over the namibian capital just after midnight today 
and it was the south african president not soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev who was a keynote speaker at the independence 
festivities 
letters to newspapers have complained for weeks about the 19 
million contribution the south african government donated to the 
celebration some said it was the price of de klerks ticket 
it was something the government should not have done if only 
in respect for those who died in the war johnsons editorial 
said 
members of the opposition conservative party planned a memorial 
service this evening for young south african men who have died 
fighting communist forces in southwest africa and angola 
fred rundle one of the memorial service organizers asked 
what does mr fw de klerk and the national party say to the 
parents of the over 1200 young men killed during the war if the 
government had decided to give over to the communists why did they 
fight the war in the first place 
the tens of thousands of black namibians and angolans on both 
sides who died in the fighting were never counted 
but when the deaths of white soldiers intensified in 1988 as 
cuban jet bombers struck farther south the dutch reformed church 
the most influential in the nation asked what were the strategic 
interests of the country that required its sons to die in angola 
the question an editorial in the churchs newspaper set off a 
storm with the citizen suggesting it gave comfort to the enemy by 
merely raising the issue within three months however south 
african troops were out of angola by the end of the year the 
agreement had been signed to withdraw from namibia 
the sudden switch from war to diplomacy from conflict to 
peace came too suddenly for most south africans to grasp the fact 
that the sacrifices had at worst been in vain and at best had 
gained time the citizen said

algis bernatavicis broke ranks with the 
red army and joined hundreds of other lithuanians who deserted 
after their baltic republic declared itself independent 
they accused us of being saboteurs he said tuesday one day 
after walking out on his unit near moscow they called us germans 
and nazis 
there is no turning back now said his friend 19yearold 
valdas grigalunas who had just left his post with the northern 
fleet 
for the hundreds of lithuanian youths who have fled the soviet 
military in the 10 days since their small republic declared itself 
sovereign there indeed seems to be no turning back 
the new lithuanian government is backing the youths decisons to 
return home and trying to negotiate their security said deputy 
prime minister kazimieras motieka 
but the soviet military has said it will use force to ship the 
deserters back to their units and presumably military justice 
if the conflict is not resolved by saturday 
the showdown is among the increasing tensions between lithuania 
and moscow 
on tuesday night police were spot checking the passports of 
young men boarding the train from moscow to lithuania apparently 
looking for deserters 
bernatavicis and grigalunas were interviewed as they debated 
signing up for a new lithuanian volunteer force which officials 
said would be used as customs and frontier guards 
grigalunas was still officially on leave but said he was not 
likely to leave his homeland to return to a harsh life in the 
soviet armed forces which lithuanians consider an army of 
occupation 
fifty years ago lithuania and fellow baltic republics latvia 
and estonia were forcibly annexed by the soviet union 
all three have been complaining since their drive for 
independence began two years ago that their draftees were being 
harassed tortured or killed by soldiers and officers offended by 
their desire for freedom in one celebrated case a young baltic 
conscript machinegunned eight soldiers and claimed it was 
selfdefense against a gang rape 
bernatavicis said insults forced him and 13 other lithuanians 
from his unit to desert he said it was not difficult he simply 
changed into civilian clothes and went home 
lithuanian officials said they intend to set up border and 
customs forces to show the worlds governments that lithuania 
controls its territory and should be formally recognized as 
independent 
so far no foreign country has officially recognized lithuania 
as independent and moscow has warned it will not tolerate a change 
in customs enforcement at the border 
the soviet union has tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of 
troops stationed in lithuania whose baltic port of klaipeda is 
extremely valuable to the soviet navy 
signs in the capital of vilnius said the sajudis peoples front 
the nationalist movement that dominates the lithuanian government 
was handling registration of men between ages of 19 and 40 who were 
ready to serve voluntarily in defense of the state 
both men and women responded crowding the tiny office to fill 
in applications stating their military experience and availability 
on short notice 
i just want to do some good for free lithuania said a woman 
about 30 years old 
many of the volunteers are former soviet soldiers who say they 
consider themselves lithuanan and want to serve in the lithuanian 
army said ludwiga pociuniene who was taking applications in 
another office at the parliament building 
she dug out one letter written by a soldier from kanous who 
said he fled his army unit in moscow after being beaten senseless 
and hospitalized he was later refused care for severe headaches 
the youth said his officer told him lithuanians must hang 
themselves 
pociuniene said the lithuanian police were under great pressure 
from moscow to arrest the deserters but the new lithuanian 
parliament has asked them not to obey the kremlin command 
in february even before independence lithuanias parliament 
ordered state prosecutors to prevent the transfer and filing of 
charges against lithuanian soldiers who had to escape unbearable 
conditions in the soviet army according to the lithuanian review

the kangaroo may soon become common 
cuisine in the countrys most populous state now that new south 
wales plans to make it legal to dine on australias national symbol 
quite clearly this is a food product which is very much going 
to waste and there does seem to be a certain demand for it among 
restaurateurs and among people who like game meat said ian 
armstrong the states agriculture minister 
the new south wales parliament is considering a bill to legalize 
kangaroo consumption and armstrong predicted it would pass during 
the current legislative session 
the state of south australia and the northern territory already 
allow kangaroo cuisine 
animal welfare groups oppose new south wales plans and promised 
today to picket restaurants or butchers selling kangaroo meat 
the kangaroo is our national emblem and it should not be 
exploited for monetary value said christine townsend of the 
group animal liberation we really think people would be 
disgusted by eating kangaroo 
she said it had not been proven that kangaroos were a pest to 
farmers she contended that sheep do as much damage to the 
countryside as kangaroo 
farmers say kangaroos harm their grazing lands and fencing 
causing millions of dollars worth of damage 
armstrong said the kangaroo population has grown too large 
the national parks and wildlife service estimates that australia 
has about 20 million kangaroos the agency says more than 3 million 
are killed annually mainly for their skins and to be used as pet 
food 
the state of new south wales has about 7 million kangaroos of 
which 800000 will be killed this year said a spokesman for the 
wildlife service 
armstrong said butchers who specialize in game meats had 
expressed interest in the product he said there also would be a 
market for exports to europe 
he said his department was considering legalizing the 
consumption of meat from the ostrichlike emu bird but he assured 
reporters that koala bears and wombats would never become legal 
menu entrees 
armstrong dismissed fears by conservationists that kangaroo meat 
was unsafe and said every butchered portion would be inspected 
ms townsend the animal liberation spokeswoman said the 
countrys animal welfare groups would work together to produce 
leaflets opposing the move contact restaurant and catering 
associations and protest outside any restaurant or butcher that 
started selling the meat

two international auction houses agreed to 
underwrite a 1 million reward no questions asked in the theft 
of a dozen uninsured art treasures from the gardner museum 
our firm has never done this before but there has never been 
such a catastrophic art theft said diana d brooks president of 
the sothebys auction house 
this is the most serious theft in our memory this is a very 
sad day for the art world she said from new york 
the reward in sundays heist was offered tuesday when the 
museum remained closed to the public as investigators bustled 
inside 
sothebys and christies auction houses are underwriting the 
reward by using their own money and by soliciting funds from art 
supporters worldwide museum director anne hawley said 
hawley indicated tuesday the reward might even be paid to the 
thieves if the art was safely recovered eleven paintings and 
drawings by rembrandt degas and vermeer and other old masters were 
among the works stolen 
the loss was estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
investigators focused on what may have been recent similar 
efforts to break into the gardner and the museum of fine arts 
about two weeks before sundays theft at least three people 
participated in an apparently staged disturbance outside the 
museum investigators said 
a man pounded on the door the same one the thieves used sunday 
and begged to be let in to escape two attackers investigators 
said when a museum guard refused the man got into a car with his 
two supposed attackers and drove off 
on jan 15 two men who appeared to be police officers tried to 
enter the museum of fine arts when it was closed for the martin 
luther king jr holiday said william mcauliffe the museums chief 
of security 
were checking to see if they were police he said 
the gardners art collection gathered and donated for a museum 
by the late isabella stewart gardner was only insured for 
restoration and conservation not for theft 
the cost of theft insurance would be more than the museums 
annual 28 million operating budget besides mrs gardners will 
which was written in 1920 prohibited any additions or alterations 
to the collection 
authorities told the museum that the reward would help recover 
the stolen art 
the fbi is very certain this will aid in the investigation 
considerably hawley said

officials of reebok international ltd responding 
to parents complaints nationwide have pulled a television 
commercial which some said could give youngsters a dangerous taste 
for adventure 
the tv spots of 30 and 60 seconds which made their debut 
saturday featured two men leaping in slow motion from a bridge 
with an elastic cord tied to their sneakers the jumper wearing 
reeboks bounces back while the other man clad in a pair of nikes 
continues the free fall 
the pump from reebok it fits a little better than your 
ordinary athletic shoe concludes the commercial that has 
appeared on the cbs tbs and fox networks 
bernadette mansur vice president of marketing for the 
stoughtonbased athletic company said tuesday calls had come in 
from around the country from parents concerned that their children 
would try emulating the jump 
we have heard from consumers and we pay special attention to 
that she said we made a decision and have directed our agency 
to pull the ad for review 
the company also heard from network officials some of whom were 
troubled by the disclaimer extremely dangerous dont try 
this the message appears briefly at the bottom of the television 
screen 
bungee cord jumping is considered a daredevil sport abc 
spokeswoman janice gretemeyer said from new york were concerned 
about the safety issue and we have asked reebok to make the 
disclaimer larger 
bungee jumping originated in the south pacific islands as a test 
of manhood boys were required to leap from bamboo towers with 
vines attacked to their ankles

china today acnowledged severe economic problems 
but included in its 1990 budget steep spending increases for 
defense education and subsidies for inefficient staterun 
enterprises 
the present financial situation remains grave with many 
contradictions and great difficulties cropping up in national 
finance finance minister wang bingqian told the national 
legislature 
the communist nations economic downturn following 18 months of 
austerity measures has reduced revenues and complicated efforts to 
meet demands to balance the budget he said 
what is more in some localities and work units financial 
procedures became chaotic supervision and management became lax 
budgetary control was loosened and tax evasion illegal retention 
of profits diversion of funds and similar breaches of financial 
laws and discipline became quite common he said 
he told the 2700 delegates to the annual national peoples 
congress that china would register a deficit of 189 billion down 
slightly from 2 billion in 1989 if tabulated by western 
accounting methods in which domestic and foreign borrowing are 
regarded as part of the deficit the imbalance would be 9 billion 
an increase of more than 1 billion 
wang put state revenues for 1990 at 6886 billion up 109 
percent and spending at 7075 billion up 103 percent 
while most departments were being told to cut spending and 
practice frugality again this year the resurgent military with 
more political clout following its role in putting down 
prodemocracy demonstrations in june was awarded a sizable 
increase 
national defense was budgeted 616 billion an increase of 152 
percent over 1989 western military analysts say real spending is 
far greater if peripheral costs are counted 
spending on education in a nation with a 20 percent illiteracy 
rate was increased 98 percent to 75 billion 
nearly onethird of the state budget 226 billion will go to 
subsidies for moneylosing enterprises and price rises a great 
drain on the state treasury wang said 
the state in 1990 will need 14 billion to support moneylosing 
state businesses up from 1277 billion last year 
wang said the state which last year required most workers and 
factories to buy bonds to help finance public debt has budgeted 
26 billion to pay back individuals up 2 billion 
however amortization of bonds held by enterprises public 
institutions and banks will be postponed he said 
wang said the government will try to increase revenues by 
raising business tax rates and improving collection of individual 
earnings taxes 
he said beijing will also moderately increase the revenues 
local authorities must turn over to the state and reduce subsidies 
to some localities 
in another speech to the congress state planning commission 
chief zou jiahua said china needed more central controls over the 
economy saying the state will set more mandatory targets this year 
for basic materials in short supply and exert more controls over 
distribution of goods and capital investment

senior leader deng xiaoping today officially left 
his last government post the chairmanship of the state central 
military commission 
the expected move followed the 85yearold dengs retirement in 
november from the central military commission of the ruling 
communist party a body with largely the same composition and 
function as the government commission 
that was his last party position 
deng who came to power in the late 1970s and began 
marketoriented economic reforms that have changed the face of 
china is still regarded as the nations most powerful man 
he played an instrumental role in the revival of ideological 
orthodoxy following the suppression of the prodemocracy movement 
in june 
although he now holds no party or government posts he is 
believed to still have the final say on major decisions and plays a 
key role in maintaining the outward impression of harmony among 
beijings various leadership factions 
deng has sought to set an example for other aging 
revolutionaries by stepping down from public office and encouraging 
the promotion of younger leaders he resigned from the politburo 
standing committee the partys top decisionmaking body in late 
1987 
however he and other more conservative octogenarians have not 
relinquished their behindthescenes authority 
deng was not present at todays session of the national peoples 
congress which accepted his resignation and did not attend 
tuesdays opening of the annual meeting 
the congress acted on a letter from the party central committee 
saying that deng had resigned from the party military commission 
and proposing that he also be allowed to give up the chairmanship 
of the state body 
the letter noted that party general secretary jiang zemin had 
been appointed to succeed deng as chairman of the party military 
commission 
jiang dengs chosen successor after the fall of party chief 
zhao ziyang in june is also expected to be appointed head of the 
state military commission a body responsible for defense policies 
however the congress did not immediately act on naming a new 
head to the state body

the dollar rose against most major foreign 
currencies in early european trading today while the british pound 
plummeted on the heels of tuesdays budget 
gold prices were sharply lower falling by as much as 9 an 
ounce the lowest level since late last year 
the bank of england reportedly intervened to stop the pounds 
slide which began minutes after foreign exchange markets opened in 
london 
currency dealers said chancellor of the exchequer john majors 
first budget delivered to parliament on tuesday was too soft on 
inflation and increased pressure for another rise in interest rates 
it is not a happy outlook said tim potter a senior dealer 
at goldman sachs international in london 
the dollar gained support from several international events 
dealers said including concerns about soviet troop movements along 
the lithuanian border and fears that the cost of german unification 
will be far greater than expected 
the dollar was also perked up by tuesdays release of a 
relatively good us trade report for january traders said 
the political and fundamental base for the dollar is very good 
right now said jensuwe fischer senior trader at manufacturers 
hanover in frankfurt 
markets were closed in tokyo for spring equinox day a national 
holiday in london the dollar was quoted at 15425 japanese yen 
compared with 15365 at tuesdays close in tokyo 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late tuesday 
17025 west german marks up from 16965 
15199 swiss francs up from 15157 
57477 french francs up from 57340 
19207 dutch guilders up from 19107 
125675 italian lire up from 125350 
11783 canadian dollars down from 11792 
in london the dollar strengthened against the british pound 
and was quoted at 15950 compared with 16105 late tuesday 
bullion dealers said the rising dollar was helping to fuel gold 
sales although many linked the metals weakness to disinterest in 
buying 
gold was down 810 a troy ounce in london and 925 in zurich 
the metal in london at a bid price of 39370 down from 398 
bid late tuesday at midmorning the citys major bullion dealers 
fixed a recommended price of 38990 
in zurich the bid price was 390 down from 39925 late 
tuesday 
earlier in hong kong gold fell 625 to close at a bid 39451 
silver fell in london to a bid price of 505 a troy ounce from 
tuesdays 509

the berlin villa where the nazi leadership met 
to implement the final solution against europes jewish 
population will be the site of a world jewish congress conference 
on german reunification 
the new yorkbased organization announced tuesday that the 
meeting is scheduled for may 8 the 45th anniversary of ve day 
the world is expecting a jewish statement on reunification 
said edgar bronfman the president of the world jewish congress 
i think that the place where they decided on the final 
solution is the right place to have such a meeting and the 
anniversary of the victory in europe seems to be the right day 
some 100 members of the world jewish congress from about 70 
countries will attend the conference at the villa in wannsee 
berlin where on jan 20 1942 high german government and party 
officials adopted a plan to exterminate the jews 
jews have a right to state a moral position on german 
reunification and we will make a moral statement and part of that 
moral statement is to see that it the holocaust doesnt happen 
again bronfman said 
in the long run he said a united germany can be a very 
positive thing for europe but certain precautions must be taken 
to prevent a repeat of history for example germanys borders 
must be sealed in cement and the country should not be allowed 
nuclear weapons he said 
bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of antisemitism 
once the two germanys are united in fact he said reunification 
might cause a decline in antijewish feelings 
now that reunification is about to be a fact they wont be 
blaming the jews for a divided germany bronfman explained 
the conference will convene may 6 and a formal declaration on 
german reunification will be issued may 8 it will be the first 
meeting ever held on german soil by the world jewish congress 
which was founded in 1936 in response to hitlers threats against 
jews

one by one nine recovering drug 
addicts living in a clapboard barrio church left a religious 
service to be counted among the homeless 
they were nervous about personal questions but eager to be 
included in the us census effort because they so often feel 
forgotten 
i think they should know how many people we have said 
18yearold julie who asked that her last name not be revealed 
late tuesday and early today eight pairs of censustakers 
fanned out across this west texas oil and cow town adding up the 
unfortunate 
the homeless may be more visible in major cities than in towns 
like san angelo population 90000 but those who work with the 
indigent here say they are eager to show that small communities 
have a problem too 
people dont believe it when you tell them there are in excess 
of 100 street people in san angelo said lloyd thompson manager 
of a salvation army family shelter 
the census duos visited 37 shelters motels and churches in the 
san angelo area tuesday this morning they checked under bridges 
crossing the concho river street corners and city parks as part of 
the census count of the homeless in towns as small as 50000 people 
after nearly two hours of searching the streets before sunrise 
10 census workers reported finding only deer cottontail rabbits a 
lawn chair and a water heater laying on its side under a bridge 
they said they believed most of the homeless spent the night 
indoors because of cool temperatures 
i think theres quite a few homeless here said judi chappa 
a homeless advocate in san angelo its not like new york city 
but for a country town we have a surprising number thats just 
the way it is everywhere 
police officers and sheriffs deputies offered tips on where 
homeless gather and some of the homeless who heard about the count 
called the census bureau to assist in the search ms chappa said 
jill dice a 19yearold censustaker said she was scared and 
nervous as she began questioning recovering addicts at the 
twostory victory temple a church where a drug rehabilitation 
center is run 
i didnt really know how theyd approach what we were doing 
but everyone was very cooperative said ms dice who earns 5 an 
hour and a 50cent hourly night differential for the homeless count 
another center resident 24yearold robin answered questions 
on the long census form after she was given reassurances of 
confidentiality 
i really thought it was a violation of my privacy she said 
they asked if i was single divorced or married and what my 
income was i dont know what that information is used for but i 
think its a little personal

a 10yearold palestinian boy was killed by 
israeli troops in the occupied west bank town of tulkarem raising 
to 143 the number of arab youngsters reported slain in the uprising 
against israeli rule 
the army and arab witnesses gave conflicting accounts today of 
the death of shukri barakat who was hit in the head with a rubber 
bullet tuesday evening 
the death came a day after former president jimmy carter accused 
israel of violating the human rights of palestinians in the 
occupied territories citing imprisonment without trial and the 
shooting deaths of children 
carter who ended his threeday visit tuesday accused israeli 
troops of excessive use of firearms in dealing with the 
27monthold palestinian uprising 
he added a lot of these are little children who have been 
killed and these things are very disturbing to me and to the rest 
of the world 
according to the israeli information center for human rights in 
the occupied territories the latest death raised to 143 the number 
of children aged 16 and under killed by israelis since the uprising 
began in december 1987 
fortytwo have been 12 years and younger the center said it 
listed three israeli children who died in a firebomb attack on a 
bus as among the 43 israeli victims of the uprising 
confronted with past criticism over the deaths of palestinian 
children israeli military officials have charged that uprising 
activists put youngsters at risk by placing them at the front of 
protests 
shukri a grade school student was hit in the head by a rubber 
bullet that shattered his skull doctors at ramallah hospital said 
the army said in a statement that stones were thrown at soldiers 
on patrol and they fired rubber bullets to disperse the youths 
the troops hit one of the youths and he was later reported to 
have died the army said 
relatives told arab reporters however that the boy was 
standing in the doorway of his home when he was hit with a bullet 
apparently fired from a nearby rooftop army post they said they 
saw no stones thrown 
the incident was being investigated by military police the army 
spokesmans office said 
tuesdays death was the second reported from a rubber bullet in 
three days on sunday a 50yearold palestinian died after he was 
hit in the head by a rubber bullet as he drove his horse cart 
through the al amari refugee camp in the west bank palestinians 
doctors said the bullet was fired at close range 
the army says that rubber bullets generally are not lethal they 
are frequently used by troops to disperse demonstrators 
the childs death raised to 667 the number of palestinians 
killed by israeli soldiers or civilians in the uprising against 
israeli rule in the territories israel seized in the 1967 middle 
east war 
an additional 198 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaboration with israeli authorities 
carter met with israeli human rights activists during his visit 
and attorney avigdor feldman told the former president that the 
high fatality figures seemed to reflect problems with the armys 
firing regulations 
feldman said given this toll and because such a large 
proportion of the casualties are children who cannot be accused of 
actually endangering the lives of army troops one of three 
conclusions can be reached either the regulations for opening fire 
are inappropriate the regulations are not implemented or those who 
contravene them are not brought to trial

an opponent of the most restrictive us 
abortion statute was arraigned in the laws first court test as 
gov joseph f ada today stood behind his signing of the 
legislation 
i still believe that a fetus is a human being and therefore 
as human beings they have rights civil rights ada said 
ada signed the measure into law monday it was unanimously 
passed march 8 by the us territorys legislature 
the law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers 
the life of the mother it makes it a thirddegree felony to 
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure a misdemeanor for a 
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person 
to solicit a woman to have an abortion 
less than 48 hours after ada signed the bill attorney janet 
benshoof director of the american civil liberties unions 
reproductive freedom project in new york was arraigned in superior 
court on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit abortion 
she pleaded innocent before judge peter c siguenza who 
released benshoof on her own recognizance and said a trial date 
would be scheduled april 2 
she said she will continue to organize opponents of the law in 
hopes of persuading voters to overturn the measure in a november 
referendum 
benshoof who traveled here in an unsuccessful attempt to talk 
ada out of signing the measure called the law a sick statute 
and an invasion of the bedroom 
i can understand and appreciate that ada said of her 
comments people have opinions to make and i respect their 
opinions its a democratic country were in 
before the legislature approved the measure attorney general 
elizabeth barrettanderson called it unconstitutional 
asked why he signed the legislation over such an objection ada 
said i have to make that decision myself and the only body 
that actually resolves that issue is the court 
barrettanderson said today law enforcement officials would not 
enforce the section of the statute forbidding abortions until a 
court ruling on its constitutionalilty 
however she said that if an abortion is performed and guams 
law is upheld in court the individuals involved will face criminal 
charges if the statue of limitations of three years has yet to run 
out 
barrettanderson said authorities would continue to enforce the 
laws restriction on soliciting a woman to have an abortion 
the law sets a referendum during the nov 6 general election for 
residents of this pacific ocean island about 1500 miles east of 
the philippines to decide whether to keep the law

an organization of family planning clinics hailed 
as a victory for poor women an appeals court ruling striking down a 
federal regulation on discussion of abortion 
but a different appeals court upheld the regulation which may 
send the matter to the us supreme court 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals said the regulation that 
bans governmentfunded family planning clinics discussing abortion 
with clients is an unconstitutional attempt to limit freedom of 
speech 
poor women deserve to hear and to learn everything that more 
economically advantaged women hear and learn said scott 
swirling executive director of the national family planning and 
reproductive health association 
the association was a plaintiff in the case decided in a 41 
decision released monday 
the speech involves informing a woman about the existence of a 
health and privacyrelated activity in which she has a 
constitutional right to engage the appeals court said 
state attorney general james shannon said the ruling was 
particularly significant because it comes after the us supreme 
court ruling last summer that gave states further authority to set 
restrictions on abortion 
what the court has said here is that on constitutional grounds 
these regulations are impermissible shannon said 
he said he expects the matter may go to the supreme court 
because the 2nd us circuit court of appeals has ruled differently 
on the same issue 
the court noted that in the 2nd circuit opinion the majority 
states that the regulations are neutral because they prohibit any 
discussion about abortion 
but the 1st circuit majority rejected that interpretation it 
is naive to assert that not talking about abortion to a pregnant 
woman when discussing her options is valueneutral by 
discussing only what is best for the unborn child the counselor 
has already made the womans choice 
lucy eddinger a spokeswoman for the office of population 
affairs in the us department of health and human services which 
is responsible for administering the regulation said the agency 
had not had a chance to review the opinion 
mike w robinson a spokesman for the us justice department 
which argued the case for the federal government said no decision 
had been made on an appeal 
in other abortionrelated developments 
prochoice forces in boise idaho were to continue their 
uphill battle today against antiabortion advocates claiming they 
have the votes for final passage of the most restrictive law 
against abortion in any state 
tempers flared tuesday night in annapolis md in a weeklong 
state senate filibuster by antiabortion senators when prochoice 
senators tried for the first time to break the filibuster

in a grueling 12hour overnight negotiating 
session socialist party leaders today achieved what eluded them at 
last weeks fourday national congress an agreement on who will 
run the party 
the outcome allowing pierre mauroy to retain the powerful post 
of first secretary ended former premier laurent fabius challenge 
for the job and control of the party apparatus 
what remained to be seen was if the political wounds could heal 
after months of infighting a failed congress last weekend at 
rennes and a wrenching compromise 
ah if only we had been able to do at rennes what has just 
been done in paris said mauroy after agreement was reached at 5 
am 
i showed a spirt of compromise said fabius once frances 
youngest premier the protege of president francois mitterrand 
the rennes electroshock affected everybody said fabius 
everybody gave a little unity prevailed 
under the agreement fabius will place one of his supporters in 
the no 2 party post and three others will have leadership 
positions mauroy who was allied with education minister lionel 
jospin also a former first secretary will have four supporters in 
the leadership 
three remaining posts will go to a smaller faction led by 
premier michel rocard one will go to that of defense minister 
jeanpierre chevenement and one to jean poperen minister for 
relations with parliament 
these decisions were to be confirmed later today by a meeting of 
the socialists board of directors 
many words and much ink were expended in recent weeks on the 
idea of a synthesis of party platforms supported by the various 
factions in the party 
in reality policy differences were minimal the issue was 
control of the party and what that control might mean to future 
presidential candidates 
mauroy announced that agreement had been reached on the text of 
the platform outlining the partys orientation for the next three 
years but no details were provided 
one doesnt know what it means to be a socialist in 1990 
said julien dray author of one of the minority manifestos 
circulated in rennes you have the impression that the socialists 
are just happy managing the income from growth 
poperen also was cautious in his assessment of the compromise 
saying that all of the difficulties have not been overcome 
the party clearly suffered from the spectacle at rennes which 
dismayed socialists everywhere and amused supporters of 
conservative parties who have their own problems with unity 
mauroy who served as mitterrands first premier will have his 
hands full trying to make the agreement work and putting a new face 
on a party tarnished by the recent squabbling 
fortunately for the new leadership it has three years before 
the next scheduled national elections and five years before france

coca cola lost its bid to return to 
india today when the government turned down an application that 
would have allowed the soft drink maker to compete with domestic 
producers 
even a spokesman for cokes top competitor pepsicola 
criticized the move as a return to economic nationalism by india 
which in recent years had encouraged foreign investment 
commerce secretary sp shukla said cokes application to build 
a 3 million plant in an export zone had been rejected the 
reasons for our move will be explained in a letter to the 
applicant he said 
a spokeswoman for the ministry of commerce said protection of 
indias domestic market played a major factor in the decision 
a request by pepsico inc for an additional plant probably 
would also be rejected she added speaking on condition of not 
being identified in keeping with government practice 
coke left india in 1977 when it refused to give the government 
details of its secret syrup formula an indian company calling 
itself campa cola adopted cokes logo but not the taste of the 
real thing 
the coca cola co applied two years ago to manufacture its syrup 
in an export processing zone 
under the proposal only 25 percent of its output would have 
been sold in india to local bottlers as an added incentive coke 
offered to invest in a joint venture in southern india to export 
tea concentrate to japan 
cokes goal was to break into indias 350 million soft drink 
market which is now controlled by three domestic soda companies 
industry analysts say there is room for growth in that market 
the average indian consumes only three bottles of soft drink a 
year compared to 13 in neighboring pakistan 38 in thailand and 
550 in the united states 
murad baig a spokesman for cocacola accused the government of 
giving in to domestic soda barons and of trying to protect a lazy 
industry 
it is backwardlooking and doesnt help india he said we 
just sacrificed hundreds and hundreds of jobs 
cokes revised proposal mirrored a successful bid by pepsico 
inc which in 1988 won the right to sell pepsi in india in 
exchange for investing in a 15 million agricultural joint venture 
in punjab state 
pepsi will begin selling its drink called pepsi era this 
summer and has already begun marketing potato chips under the 
hostess brand name and its cheeseflavored cheetos snacks 
pepsis plan was approved under the administration of thenprime 
minister rajiv gandhi who opened india to foreign investment 
but indias new government led by prime minister vp singh 
will most probably reject pepsicos second proposal to set up 
shop in an export zone the ministry of commerce spokeswoman said 
rajiv desai a spokesman for pepsico in india said the 
decision to ban pepsis top competitor coke smacked of economic 
nationalism this government is chasing ghosts of the past whereas 
all over the world everyone else is looking ahead 
for decades since independence from britain in 1947 india 
limited the operation of foreign companies and imposed huge tariffs 
on imports to protect its domestic industries 
under gandhis administration india opened up to foreign 
business 
the clunky ambassador car faced new competition on indias roads 
by the sporty maruti compact a joint venture with the japanese 
company suzuki 
ironically singh as finance minister under gandhi was the 
mastermind of much of indias new openness to foreign investment 
but his economic policies appear to have changed since he took the 
top government office 
several of singhs cabinet appointments including george 
fernandes minister of railways and madhu dandadate minister of 
finance are oldschool socialists and oppose expansion of foreign 
investment in india 
the ministry of commerce spokeswoman said she had no idea when 
the government would decide on another hotly debated foreign 
investment proposal by the dupont co for a 140 million us 
joint venture to make nylon

unemployed factory worker robert allen wont 
have to see the us census bureaus figures to learn about 
homelessness in america he says hes proof there is a problem 
allen 28 was among the people approached by census workers 
tuesday night at the cherry street mission during the first 
nationwide survey of homeless people he walked away when they 
tried to ask him questions 
we need jobs not surveys said allen who has been on the 
streets for three months why should i take part what are they 
going to use the numbers for anyway to tell us there aint no 
homeless problem hell im a living example that there is a 
problem 
two census workers went into the lobby of the mission where 
about 10 people were staying tuesday night the mission is in an 
area of topless bars prostitutes and crack houses 
some of the residents lay on wooden benches others stood 
watching a small blackandwhite television 
the workers went to each person in the shelter asking them if 
they wanted to participate 
do you need help filling out this form kathleen shively a 
census worker asked jim grainer who was lying on a bench grainer 
rose and answered her questions slowly he said he had been 
homeless for several years 
one person jumped up and tried to attack ms shively but a 
guard jumped between the two 
although some people backed away from census workers others 
willingly answered the questions 
at st pauls community center becky jenks sat at a table and 
ate a slice of pizza she said she lost her home 1 years ago after 
she had a stroke and was no longer able to work 
i dont know if the census will help all i know is that im 
here tonight so why not give them the information it cant 
hurt ms jenks said 
the shelter threw a party to encourage the homeless to come in 
off the streets to be counted shelter workers served pizza and 
soft drinks as most of the 70 patrons sat around a 25inch color 
television 
homeless advocacy groups across ohio cooperated with the census 
bureau but contended the survey was doomed to undercount the 
homeless the ohio coalition for the homeless estimated 140000 
men women and children in ohio were homeless in 1988 an increase 
of 18 percent over 1987 
the census bureau never intended the survey to be an exact count 
of the homeless said jerry blocker a spokesman for the regional 
census bureau office in detroit 
its going to give us some ideas about the homeless problem 
but we know its impossible to count every single homeless person 
thats not what this survey is about blocker said

president lee tenghui has risen from 
obscurity to become a widely popular leader since succeeding the 
chiang kaishek family dynasty but he now faces intense pressure 
to bring more democracy to taiwan 
much of his twoyear tenure as president has been marked by 
cautious policies designed to strike a balance between the 
conservative old guard of the ruling nationalist party and an 
increasingly restless population clamoring for more freedoms 
a president acts like the head of a family lee recently 
said all members interests must be taken care of to keep the 
family happy and harmonious 
but newspapers recently have drawn a different picture of the 
67yearold leader saying he rarely consults party elders on 
important policy decisions 
he also displayed independence when he chose his top personal 
aide as his vice presidential candidate shunning demands by many 
old guard politicians that his running mate be the sole surviving 
son of chiang kaishek 
the move led to speculation that lee was primarily interested in 
consolidating his own power 
some people say lee could turn himself into another emperor if 
he is given too much power said nationalist lawmaker huang 
chuwen but i dont think he has any intention to do it nor 
will the society allow it 
many taiwanese hope that lee elected as president for six more 
years today will become less cautious and move to dismantle the 
existing political system that ensures the electoral college and 
legislature are controlled by old guard nationalists 
those elderly politicians were elected on mainland china before 
the nationalist government fled to taiwan after losing a civil war 
to communist forces they were frozen in office to support the 
partys claim that it remains the legitimate government of all 
china 
public pressure for general elections has increased sharply 
particularly after some deputies proposed increasing the assemblys 
powers and the salaries of its members 
a student sitin at a downtown taipei park began friday with 200 
participants but their ranks had swelled today to 2000 many said 
they would stage a oneday hunger strike to promote democratic 
change 
he has to grasp this momentum for democratic reform very 
quickly said chuang suohang a fellow at the institute for 
national policy research 
although concern about the nations political future has caused 
lees popularity to drop somewhat from his earlier approval ratings 
of more than 80 percent he still can count on widespread support 
and good will 
part of his popularity stems from his being the first native 
taiwanese to lead the government and the ruling party formed 95 
years ago on the chinese mainland by sun yatsen 
he has frequently toured the island to visit farmers soldiers 
and other groups to build up personal support 
lee was elevated from vice president to head of government in 
january 1988 when president chiang chingkuo the son of chiang 
kaishek died and ended four decades of family rule on taiwan 
in the last year of his life chiang chingkuo ended martial law 
and a ban on opposition political parties in a political 
liberalization program that lee says he will continue 
because he is a native taiwanese lee is viewed warily by many 
old guard nationalist conservatives who still dream of returning 
victoriously to rule the chinese mainland 
lee has carefully reiterated the nationalist claim to represent 
all china but he also has pursued a more pragmatic policy to 
increase unofficial contacts with the chinese mainland 
he has yet to allow direct trade as demanded by many businessmen

republican clayton williams says he would 
feel uncomfortable facing ann richards in the texas governors race 
because she is a woman 
the gop gubernatorial nominee said tuesday that he had no 
problem with a woman seeking the governors office but added he 
would be more cautious running against her 
williams discussion of the gender issue overshadowed a highly 
touted lunch at the white house with president bush who pledged to 
campaign actively for williams a millionaire oilman and rancher 
id be less comfortable i think campaigning against a 
woman said williams 
ms richards faces state attorney general jim mattox in an april 
10 runoff for the democratic nomination 
even cowboys get the blues said ms richards in austin 
the inevitable is not always comfortable the state 
treasurer said i dont want to be his mother i want to be 
governor of texas 
williams was in washington for what he called a listening and 
learning visit last week he clobbered three opponents to win 
the gop nomination to replace retiring republican gov bill 
clements 
during a luncheon at a mexican restaurant for washingtonbased 
reporters for texas media organizations williams made his comments 
about running against a woman he said he did not care whether ms 
richards or mattox won the democratic nod 
well take either one of them on said williams they both 
have strengths and weaknesses 
but he took the statement which he has made earlier a step 
further adding that i wouldnt be as comfortable in battling 
with a woman i dont have that comfort factor because ive never 
done that 
i dont have a problem there but neither do i have 
experience said williams who has never held political office 
asked to explain his comments he said the worlds from which 
i came was the male world

the millionaire developer faxed a message to the daily news liz 
smith complaining that she has shown favoritism toward his wife in 
her coverage of the split 
the letter according to todays news read 
dear liz 
why dont you stop saying that ivana is fighting to protect 
herself and her children 1 the children are our children 
and no one loves them more than i do 2 the children are totally 
protected by me and do not need ivanas protection exclusively 
you have carried the episode too far and should be ashamed of 
yourself as a professional 
smith who first broke the story of the trumps estrangement 
last month said trumps message was also faxed to ivana trumps 
attorneys who responded 
donald trump has a peculiar way of protecting his children 
when he insists on enforcing an antenuptial agreement that would 
1 end the continuity of his childrens lives by making them move 
out of their home in the trump tower into exile in the country away 
from their friends and schoolmates 2 make his children live on 
10 percent of what they are presently living on 3 try to force 
an agreement where he would have to drop dead he is 43 before 
they would get any of his multimilliondollar empire

the census bureaus effort to get an accurate 
count of the number of homeless people living in the district of 
columbia has gone well according to officials but the process will 
have to be carried over because of cold weather 
spokeswoman pauline lichtmanpanzer said today that low 
temperatures made it difficult for federal enumerators to locate a 
lot of homeless people who should be counted and that the count 
would resume wednesday 
we really didnt expect that the temperatures would be so 
low she said our enumerators said that caused many more 
persons to seek refuge in city or private shelters well be back 
on the streets wednesday and will hopefully get better numbers 
although the national weather service said temperatures were 
only four degrees below the normal 38 degree reading overnight it 
was far below the sunny 80degreeplus afternoons the area had 
last week 
lichtmanpanzer said that the canvassers were welcomed at most 
shelter locations they visited during the survey period but that 
wasnt the case at the capitol hill shelter operated by the 
community for creative nonviolence whose leader mitch snyder 
refused to let census takers inside 
snyder who recently fasted for nine days in protest of proposed 
reductions in the city governments homelessaid budget denounced 
the federal effort tuesday night 
homeless people are very resourceful he said they have 
to be to survive on the streets i doubt that the census takers 
will be going down every alley in the city looking into every 
shanty and crawl space these people should be allowed to have 
their dignity and not be disturbed in the middle of the night to 
accommodate government grandstanding 
snyder met the census takers outside of the shelter operated by 
the community for creative nonviolence and turned over 
approximately 80 census forms that he said had been completed he 
had previously announced that no enumerators would be allowed in 
the building 
we need to create more shelter space and more affordable 
housing to get these people off the streets snyder said all 
the census bureau is doing is putting on a show for the media by 
sending these teams of counters out on the streets 
you cant use this census with any degree of legitimacy he 
said politicians can use these figures to say anything that they 
want them to mainly that the problem of homelessness isnt as bad 
as the american people have been made to believe because theres no 
way that you can legitimately count how many homeless people that 
are in this city or in this country 
valerie lobban a district office manager with the census 
bureau said snyders actions were not representative of the 
receptions that census counters had received at other washington 
shelters she said the process had reportedly been going without 
difficulty 
the district of columbia government estimates there are 7500 
homeless people in the nations capital up more than 50 percent 
from 1982 levels 
wylie williams the districts deputy mayor for economic 
development said the count was important because only when we 
know how many homeless there are can improvements be made in the 
delivery of services

a senior iranian official has said his 
government is working for the release of a hostage held in lebanon 
the new york times reported today 
the official an ally of president hashemi rafsanjani who asked 
not to be identified said in a european capital last weekend that 
the iranian government was operating with the full expectation 
that the united states in particular will show an equal amount of 
good will the times reported 
the statement implied that actions by the united states like 
releasing frozen iranian assets would help continue the process 
said the times 
the official did not name the hostage targeted for possible 
release or specify his nationality 
there are eight americans among the 18 westerners believed held 
hostage in lebanon the longest held terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press began his sixth 
year in captivity last week 
iranian officials including a deputy foreign minister have said 
recently that all the hostages may be released this year but other 
senior iranian figures including former interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi have called for the continued imprisonment of 
foreign hostages in lebanon 
the senior iranian official insisted that the importance of 
militant opponents of the release of hostages was being greatly 
exaggerated abroad 
on tuesday iranian radio reported that a majority of parliament 
issued a statement late monday calling on the foreign ministry to 
distance itself from the hostage issue as a lebanese internal 
affair 
the official said that in his view the united states has wasted 
time talking to unimportant people about the hostages 
including middlemen and businessmen who pretend to have special 
ties to the iranian government 
he said talks should be conducted with responsible iranian 
officials in the context of normalizing ties and not just getting 
hostages out

romanians and ethnic hungarians took 
to the streets of a northwestern city again today and the army 
sent reinforcements to quell ethnic violence that has left at least 
six people dead 
troops cordoned off the town after armed ethnic romanians on 
tuesday night poured in from neighboring villages and battled 
ethnic hungarians who were protesting an attack a day earlier on 
their political association headquarters 
also today a government factfinding panel went to tirgu mures 
a transylvanian city 250 miles northwest of bucharest 
vice president cazimir ionescu said leaflets distributed by the 
fascist iron guard had caused the fighting by falsely claiming that 
the hungarian minority centered in transylvania is seeking 
political autonomy 
they scared the romanians with the idea that the hungarians 
want to take over transylvania and they are telling the hungarians 
that some requests they have made to the government will not be 
granted he said in an interview 
its a movement that wants to create panic but we dont know 
exactly what it wants the vice president said 
since the december revolution toppled communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu romania has been inundated with propaganda signed by the 
iron guard calling on romania to expel ethnic hungarians and other 
ethnic minorities 
the grassroots fascist organization was powerful in romania 
during the late 1930s and early 1940s during the ceausescu regime 
iron guard and other noncommunist groups were repressed 
this morning more than 2000 ethnic hungarians gathered in tirgu 
mures central square of roses witnesses said groups of romanians 
were gathering on the outskirts of the city and heading for the 
square the witnesses said 
a government commission of inquiry flew to tirgu mures this 
morning and additional troop reinforcements were sent in from 
neighboring areas to try to quell the violence that government 
radio said left six dead and 300 injured one witness in the city 
of 250000 ioan pol said some ethnic hungarians threw firebombs 
during the fighting tuesday he said he heard what appeared to be 
gunfire but its origin was unknown 
among those hospitalized was kevin harvey a british 
photographer working for the associated press who was beaten and 
clubbed 
the ruling council of national unity which is dominated by 
former communists met in special session today to decide on 
additional measures to defuse the tension 
the provisional government appealed for calm 
neighboring hungary asked for immediate un mediation to 
restore order in the region the hungarian state news agency mti 
reported 
the fighting the most widespread ethnic violence in romania in 
decades began saturday when a crowd attacked a tirgu mures 
pharmacy that posted a hungarianlanguage sign hungarian news 
media reported 
the clashes have their roots in traditional historical rivalries 
in the region fueled by ethnic hungarian demands since december 
for greater cultural and political autonomy including the use of 
hungarian street signs hungarianlanguage television schools and 
other social institutions 
in the hungarian capital of budapest about 50000 people 
rallied tuesday in support of the estimated 17 million ethnic 
hungarians in romania who were long suppressed by ceausescu 
ceausescu is dead but it seems that some want to keep his 
spirit alive istvan csurka a leader of the nationalist 
hungarian democratic front told the torchbearing crowd 
in the romanian city of iasi near the soviet border republic of 
moldavia demonstrators also took to the streets to protest the 
ethnic clashes 
ceausescu ousted and executed in a popular revolution in 
december was replaced by a provisional government pledging 
democratic reform but ethnic hungarians say his 
discriminationatory policies have continued 
hungary asked for immediate un mediation to restore order in 
the region mti reported 
romanias leadership repeatedly broadcast a warning tuesday that 
any kind of extremist nationalist or chauvinistic actions 
irrespective of who they come from are of the nature to 
destabilize the national and international situation of romania 
we insist that you go back to your homes in peace said the 
communique signed by leaders of the ruling council of national 
unity 
tirgu mures is considered a cradle of ethnic hungarian culture 
in transylvania which was ruled by hungarians for centuries before 
being granted to romania under a 1920 treaty most of romanias 
ethnic hungarians live in transylvania 
under ceausescu ethnic culture and minority rights were largely 
suppressed in a drive to impose a single national identity in this 
country of 23 million people

the supreme court ruled today that migrant 
farm workers injured on the job may sue their employers in federal 
court after receiving workercompensation benefits 
by a 90 vote in a florida case the justices said states do not 
have the power to ban such suits 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court rejected the 
us labor departments interpretation of a federal law designed to 
protect the seasonal workers 
the law the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection 
act provides aggrieved farmworkers with direct recourse to 
federal court where their rights under the statute are violated 
marshall said the labor department is not empowered to regulate 
the scope of the judicial power vested by the statute 
the court upheld a lower court victory for 10 florida farmhands 
who were hurt in 1985 while being transported in a van by their 
employer the adams fruit co 
each collected workercompensation benefits from adams under 
florida law and then sued the company in federal court alleging 
the van was unsafe 
the company said floridas workercompensation law made it the 
exclusive legal remedy for such injuries and a federal judge agreed 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals overruled the judge 
and reinstated the workers suit 
that ruling conflicted with a decision by the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals which said a farm worker injured when sprayed by 
pesticides could not sue 
in resolving the conflict today marshall said the federal laws 
enforcement provisions in no way intimate that the availability 
of the right to sue in federal court is affected by state 
workers compensation law 
state officials from california texas and massachusetts urged 
the high court to rule in favor of the migrant workers 
the case is adams fruit vs barrett 882035

a government trying to shed light on how many of its citizens 
live in the shadows wrapped up an unprecedented 14hour survey 
today to count the homeless 
free meals blankets and parties helped lure the homeless to 
government workers carrying clipboards and flashlights but the 
counters some of them homeless themselves also encountered 
gunfire in brooklyn a spring snow in vermont robbers in florida 
and the protests of critics and elusive targets everywhere and 
many of the homeless fell once again between the cracks 
although results of the homeless census wont be known for 
months the census bureau declared it a success nationally the 
operation went very smoothly census director barbara everitt 
bryant said at a morning news conference in new york 
ms bryant noted that there were a few spots including 
cleveland and washington dc where the census workers didnt 
finish and would return tonight 
around the nation some homeless people took comfort in the very 
fact of being counted 
it shows that theyre starting to recognize us as humans and 
not the scum of the earth said chester broadwell 21 a resident 
of the waystation shelter in burlington vt 
but in toledo ohio 28yearold robert allen snubbed us 
census officials 
what are they going to use the numbers for anyway to tell us 
there aint no homeless problem hell im a living example that 
there is a problem allen said we need jobs not surveys 
a total of 15000 enumerators the federal term for 
headcounters were dispatched to seek the name age sex race and 
marital status of a segment of society that considers itself 
forgotten 
the 27 million effort the most ambitious ever undertaken to 
count the homeless focused on every city of 50000 or more 
residents the tally will be added to the conventional census that 
begins april 1 as part of the constitutional mandate to count 
citizens every 10 years

in st paul minn census workers waited outside limestone 
caves along the mississippi river once the domain of bootleggers 
they now are frequented by the homeless 
in new york city enumerators in brooklyn ran for cover early 
today when a gunshot came from a building they were approaching 
according to fernando armstrong assistant regional census manager 
no one was injured and armstrong said it wasnt clear that the 
shot was aimed at the censustakers 
in fort lauderdale fla two census takers were robbed at a 
homeless shelter by a man who followed them after being 
interviewed census bureau spokesman ken baldowski said the 
workers were not injured and they pledged to continue their work 
he said 
no count was made public and the nationwide survey did little 
to settle the debate over the size of the homeless population now 
estimated at a low of 250000 to a high of more than 3 million 
before the count which targeted 22000 shelters and street 
sites nationwide ms bryant said well get the vast majority 
there are no believable numbers of homeless in america this is 
going to get an order of the magnitude of the problem 
still many homeless people clearly went uncounted 
in new york city eight enumerators and a supervisor spent 
slightly more than an hour at the port authority bus terminal 
where hundreds of homeless stay but they appeared to spend much of 
their time milling about a newstand on the terminals ground level 
rather than on the upper levels where many homeless people sleep in 
stairwells on bus platforms and in hallways 
regional director sheila grimm denied that the counters had 
avoided the upper levels she said the nature of the homeless at 
the port authority demanded that the enumerators merely make a 
sweep through the terminal rather than interview individuals 
in manchester nh census workers overlooked a man sleeping on 
the steps of city hall it was outside the specified survey area 
and in northern california census workers skipped spots in the 
santa cruz mountains where in two incidents two years ago shots 
were fired at census representatives doing preparatory work for the 
1990 census 
activists who consider homelessness a national disgrace fear an 
undercount that will justify government cuts in services 
counters were turned away from the 1400bed shelter in 
washington dc operated by the community for creative 
nonviolence 
these people should be allowed to have their dignity and not 
be disturbed in the middle of the night to accommodate government 
grandstanding said activist mitch snyder 
david hayden also rebuffed counters at his justice house 
community in roanoke va he earlier had burned census forms to 
protest what he claimed was a bogus count 
but other shelters sought to get the highest tally possible 
we ought to do everything we can to get as many names on the 
list as possible said ruth beshalske director of the st pauls 
community shelter in toledo ohio site of a party for the homeless 
in sacramento calif one group gave away 1000 blankets at a 
salvation army center where the city contributed to a free ham 
dinner 
thats how much we think it is in the citys interest to get 
an accurate count said arnie godmintz a coordinator from the 
sacramento housing and redevelopment agency 
the union gospel mission in st paul minn waived the 125 
price for a meal and drew a crowd of about 250 to 300 people 
double the normal showing 
counters faced all manner of obstacles in the nightlong tally 
not the least of which was 22 inches of springtime snow in parts of

labor party leader shimon peres today held 
talks with key religious parties aimed at building a new governing 
coalition to replace the rightwing likud blocs caretaker 
government 
in another development the director of the government press 
office disputed a state department report that the palestine 
liberation organization was adhering to its pledge to renounce 
terrorism 
peres moves followed his designation by president chaim herzog 
on tuesday to build a government to replace the likudlabor 
coaltion cabinet toppled in a parliament vote of no confidence 
thursday 
the decision by herzog brought renewed calls in likud to oust 
caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir as party leader since his 
party could be excluded from the government for the first time in 
13 years israeli newspapers said 
peres said he telephoned shamir today and asked him to meet to 
discuss forming a new joint coalition shamir refused peres said 
on army radio 
mr shamirs response was that they have a decision not to 
join a laborled government and so he saw no need to meet peres 
said 
industry minister moshe nissim of the likud bloc said a 
laborled government would cause severe political damage to 
israel 
shamir met today with six other likud leaders to map out a 
strategy for blocking peres coalitionbuilding the radio said 
if likud can muster 60 votes in the 120member parliament they 
can prevent the 66yearold peres from becoming prime minister 
peres has six weeks to build a coalition and if he fails likud 
could be named to try but political analysts believed the momentum 
was in peres hands and that he could outmaneuver likud if he acted 
quickly 
israeli news reports said peres hoped to present a new cabinet 
to parliament for a customary vote of approval by next week 
peres was optimistic after a twohour meeting with the 
fivemember agudat israel party he said on the radio that an 
agreement was emerging with the pivotal ultraorthodox party 
the agreement was based on labor promises to provide funds for 
religious seminaries and housing in exchange for a freeze in 
ultraorthodox demands for controversial religious legislation 
peres said 
together with agudat the left and arab parties labor would 
have 60 votes for a government meaning that it would still need to 
win over at least one of three other religious parties 
labor leaders viewed their best chance as an alliance with the 
ultraorthodox shas or sephardic torah guardians which holds 
five seats in parliament 
shamirs 15monthold coalition collapsed on a noconfidence 
motion after shamir refused to accept a us plan for starting an 
israelipalestinian dialogue peres has already pledged that as 
premier he will accept the compromise proposals by secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
regarding the state department report on the plo the director 
of the government press office yossi olmert said it is not 
relevant to reality 
the plo continues to be deeply involved in terrorist activity 
against israel both in israel proper and in the occupied 
territories he said in a statement 
at the same time the army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron 
was quoted as saying there was no proof that plo chief yasser 
arafats mainstream faction fatah was carrying out attacks 
against israel 
the state department report listed nearly 30 border and rocket 
attacks by palestinian groups against israel since arafat renounced 
terrorism in december 1988 but it added we have no evidence in 
those cases or any others that the actions were authorized and 
approved by the plo executive committee or by arafat personally 
israel has maintained that the plo is a terrorist 
organization and has urged the united states to end its dialogue 
with the plo 
a government report provided by olmert said that in 1989 there 
were 12 attacks by fatah within israel 15 attempts at crossborder 
attacks and two firings of rockets at farming settlements

i heard about the shoes she bought a lot of shoes and thats 
about it said david gong a 26yearold graduate student who was 
among 10 people who passed the first test on tuesday as jury 
selection began in us district court

mrs marcos to president bush offering to turn over her fortune to 
a fivemember international panel which would distribute the funds 
to the filipino people 
in the letter released by the philippine government mrs 
marcos claimed she was innocent and that the trial was an attempt 
to extort money and property from me 
mrs marcos attorney gerry spence said mrs marcos wrote to 
offer bush help in finding funds allegedly stolen from the manila 
government on condition the money be used for philippine 
charities and that bush help to arrange for her husbands body to 
be sent home from hawaii where he died last sept 28 spence said 
she had not received an answer 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush 
had received a letter from mrs marcos fitzwater would not 
elaborate saying only that the president could not respond for 
legal reasons pertaining to the trial 
judge john f keenan today resumed his screening of 150 
prospective jurors after excusing 10 and tentatively accepting 10 
others on the first day 
mrs marcos met at the courthouse by a few reporters and 
photographers had no comment other than a brief good morning 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of participating in the illegal 
transfer of more than 160 million from the philippines treasury to 
buy manhattan real estate and of defrauding banking institutions 
of another 165 million to finance the deals

helping mrs marcos and her late husband philippines president 
ferdinand e marcos conceal their ownership of the real estate 
marcos was named in the october 1988 indictment but died sept 
28 in exile in hawaii 
mrs marcos wearing a black dress and a mournful expression 
told the mob of reporters who met her tuesday that she was unhappy 
over facing trial here i should be tried in my own country the 
republic of the philippines not in a foreign country she said 
supporters greeted mrs marcos with signs reading marcos is 
innocent and justice for imelda other signs showed pictures 
of the marcoses with expresidents nixon carter and reagan 
arriving separately with his lawyers khashoggi told reporters 
he felt the united states had betrayed mrs marcos but was 
too big to be embarrassed by any revelations from the trial 
asked where he might prefer to be the saudi who was once called 
the worlds richest man replied i would rather be in mecca 
fasting 
mrs marcos could face a maximum of 50 years in prison and a 1 
million fine if convicted on all counts of racketeering

obligations or personal bias were told to return to court next

asked what they knew of mrs marcos several prospective jurors 
said they had heard about the many pairs of shoes she left behind 
when she and her husband fled the phillipines in early 1986 and 
went into exile in hawaii 
critics of the marcoses including the government of president 
corazon aquino have cited the shoes as symbolizing the excesses of 
an opulent lifestyle of leaders in a country plagued by widespread 
poverty 
samuel cerezo a 51yearold transit official was asked whether 
the shoes would prejudice him against mrs marcos 
no my daughter also has a lot of shoes he replied

flood waters flowed over the florida 
panhandle today keeping about 1500 people from their homes and 
the swollen alabama river spread into a mileswide coffeecolored 
lake curving around selma 
the choctawhatchee river crested at caryville overnight at 21 
feet or 9 feet above flood stage but the river was continuing to 
rise about 20 miles downstream near ebro said ginger vance a 
spokeswoman for the washington county civil defense office 
it will be at least thursday before most evacuees can start 
returning to their homes and begin cleaning up said county 
adminstrator roger hagan caryville is a small farming town about 
100 miles west of tallahassee 
most of the people forced from their homes were staying with 
friends or relatives or camping out said sharon fowler a state 
department of health and rehabilitative services worker she said 
only about 20 people spent the night at a shelter in bonifay 
a lot of people are camping out out in the woods in the 
hills wherever they can get she said they want to stay close 
to their property 
the flood waters surged into the florida panhandle from alabama 
and georgia after heavy rain doused those states last week at 
least 11 people died in floodrelated accidents in alabama 
alabama rivers swollen by torrential rain were dropping over 
much of the state today with drops of more than 7 feet by the 
alabama river at catoma creek near montgomery and 9 feet by the pea 
river at the hamlet of elba 
a broken levee at elba forced about 2000 residents to flee as 
flood waters turned the town into a lake over the weekend few 
people have been able to return to their homes because power and 
phone service remained out city officials planned to tour the 
ravaged downtown area today 
engineers with army corps of engineers said tuesday that the 
levee had no structural flaws it just wasnt high enough for the 
flood 
hundreds lined up in elba on tuesday for diphtheria and tetanus 
booster shots to avoid any outbreak of diseases associated with 
flood waters or contaminated drinking water 
there was no levee to protect lowlying areas in selma where 
caskets rose from the ground in a flooded cemetery and up to 500 
people fled their homes tuesday when the alabama river rose more 
than 12 feet above flood stage 
about 65 homeless people bedded down for the night in a school 
gymnasium 
we were about under water said richard colman who was 
rescued from his home by helicopter the water just kept on 
rising and it caught us 
selmas central business district sits safely on a bluff above 
the alabama river but raging flood waters poured into poor 
neighborhoods on the east side of town and the opposite side of the 
river 
a halfdozen caskets popped from the inundated ground at elmwood 
cemetery on monday i think what happened is that most of the 
graves were pretty recent and the water came up before the dirt had 
settled down good and the pressure just brought them up said 
jonas lewis the cemeterys caretaker 
in geneva ala emergency workers stopped up a break in the 
levee that was flowing like an open fire hydrant near the 
courthouse tuesday afternoon 
flooding along several rivers elsewhere in the florida panhandle 
drove at least 500 people from their homes but about 300 returned 
tuesday along the blackwater river 
at least 1000 people were forced out in washington county most 
of them leaving their homes in caryville on the banks of the 
choctawhatchee and nearby rural areas monday after county 
commissioners ordered a mandatory evacuation 
a voluntary evacuation extending about 20 miles downstream to 
ebro was requested tuesday that affected at least 500 people but 
washington county commissioner john cook of vernon estimated about 
half of those residents decided to remain in their homes

states may not prohibit grand jury witnesses 
from ever revealing their own testimony the supreme court ruled 
unanimously today 
the court said a florida law providing such a prohibition 
similar to laws in 15 other states violated freespeech rights 
the decision upholding a federal appeals court ruling is a 
defeat for florida officials who tried to block a former newspaper 
reporter from disclosing details of his appearance before a grand 
jury four years ago 
the interests advanced by the portion of the florida statute 
struck down are not sufficient to overcome the reporters first 
amendment right to make a truthful statement of information he 
acquired on his own chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for 
the court 
he added the ban extends not merely to the life of the grand 
jury but into the indefinite future the potential for abause of 
the florida prohibition through its employment as a device to 
silence those who know of unlawful conduct or irregularities on the 
part of public officials is apparent 
todays decision does not affect state laws barring grand jury 
witnesses from disclosing their testimony while the investigation 
is in progress 
jane kirtley of the reporters committee for freedom of the press 
said the decision will help journalists who want to interview 
people who testified before grand juries once an investigation ends 
the court recognized that this kind of statute is an 
overwhelming restraint that could not withstand constitutional 
scrutiny ms kirtley said 
michael smith a former reporter for the charlotte heraldnews 
in charlotte county fla wants to publish a news story and 
possibly a book about a 1986 grand jury investigation into 
allegations of corruption in the county sheriffs department and 
the county state attorneys office 
the grand jury probe ended in 1986 and no indictments were 
handed down 
smith challenged the florida grand jury secrecy law because he 
feared he could be prosecuted for revealing his testimony before 
the secret panel 
a federal judge upheld the law and threw out smiths suit but 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled for smith sparking 
floridas appeal to the supreme court 
in his opinion for the court rehnquist cited past decisions 
that say states may not punish publication of lawfully obtained 
truthful information absent a need to further a state interest of 
the highest order 
no such need exists in this case he said 
rehnquist acknowledged that the invalidated law could help 
prevent investigation targets who later stand trial from trying to 
influence grand jury witnesses but he said with present day 
criminal procedure generally requiring the disclosure of witnesses 
on the part of the state the names of these witnesses will be 
available to the accused sometime before trial in any event 
the chief justice also noted that florida provides substantial 
criminal penalties for both perjury and tampering with witnesses 
the justices were told that the 15 states with laws similar to 
floridas are alabama arizona indiana kentucky louisiana 
michigan mississippi missouri nevada north carolina north 
dakota south dakota texas utah and washington 
the case is butterworth vs smith 881993

riverboat gambling will be allowed in 
missisippi beginning april 1 under a bill signed into law by gov 
ray mabus 
proponents have touted the measure as a way to boost tourism in 
communities along the mississippi river mabus signed the bill 
tuesday 
riverboat gambling already has been approved in illinois and 
iowa but the illinois law doesnt take effect until january 1991 
and the iowa statute not until april 1991 
in mississippi boats at least 150 feet long and capable of 
carrying a minimum 250 passengers would be allowed to open casinos 
on the waterway 
the state would license the boats which could open their 
casinos while moving or docked 
the important aspect of the legislation is that it would let 
those communities along the mississippi river have the right to 
vote on whether they would like to have casinotype gambling in 
their area said the governors spokesman kevin vandebroek 
residents of mississippi counties with ports on the river could 
force a referendum and voters could forbid the boats from docking 
in their counties the mississippi river forms the states western 
line 
some operators already have expressed an interest in bringing 
gambling boats to the river 
weve been meeting with people that have shown some 
preliminary interest in bringing a boat into this area said 
jimmy heidel executive vice president of the vicksburgwarren 
chamber of commerce 
cruise ships can already open their casinos while in the waters 
of the mississippi sound off the states southern coast 
mississippi lawmakers are trying to resolve differences in a bill 
that would reduce the minimum size of those vessels

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
march 17 
grants pass ore daily courier on earthfriendly products 
companies should try hard work instead of hype in trying to cash 
in on the growing trend among consumers to buy socalled 
earthfriendly items 
industry must research new ways to produce and use biodegradable 
materials in packaging and to reuse materials that arent 
biodegradable such as glass they also need to phase out products 
that damage the environment such as hairsprays containing 
chemicals that destroy the earths protective ozone layer 
unfortunately all many companies are doing these days is 
slapping labels with misleading or outright false claims on their 
products rather than looking for ways to honestly help 
environmentally conscious shoppers 
plastic trash bags suddenly turn into degradable bags and a 
can of aerosol hair spray becomes ozone friendly even though 
it contains chemicals that cause smog and air pollution 
regulators need to force manufacturers to verify their claims 
just as they did when firms claimed to have cures for baldness 
this time the goal is much more important than growing hair though 
its obvious from the governments halfhearted attempts at 
cleaning up the environment that any real progress will have to 
come from grassroots movements people will have to change their 
lifestyles and demand that politicians and companies change their 
ways too

akron ohio beacon journal on the postal service 
talk about bad timing just as the us postal service is asking 
for a 19 percent rate increase the government accounting office 
comes along and details some outrageous costs the service ran up at 
conferences for postal executives 
the postal service which is projected to lose 16 billion this 
year spent up to 10 million on conferences last year the gao 
reported at one conference in scottsdale ariz officials were 
treated to 99 dinners and ran up a bar tab of 12718 all paid 
for by the postal service 
the postal service generally doesnt deserve the scorn heaped on 
it and there is even an argument for some rate increase but when 
those in charge of the service squander the money they have they 
cant expect to be seen as credible when they ask for more

the heralddispatch huntington wva on pentagon spending 
last month the general accounting office found that the air 
force kept such poor financial records it was almost impossible to 
audit many accounts 
now comes the news the pentagon has a 43 billion yes thats 
right 43 billion slush fund it can spend as it wishes without 
congressional approval 
the slush fund was brought to light by rep john d dingell 
dmich who correctly has called for a corresponding 43 billion 
cut in the defense department set aside accounts making up the 
slush fund 
dingell says the 43 billion accumulated over a period of 
several years was laundered through the us treasury the net 
result congress could kill a weapons program and find out years 
later that it was still being funded from the slush fund 
theres simply no excuse for this careless sloppy backdoor 
handling of taxpayers money

san antonio expressnews on subsidies to the national rifle 
association 
not many people are aware that the defense department indirectly 
subsidizes the national rifle association or nra the 
multimilliondollar handout is drawing the attention it deserves as 
the pentagon adjusts to a shrinking share of the federal budget 
the subsidy comes from the armys division of civilian 
marksmanship or dcm which was established in 1903 to improve the 
shooting skills among men of military age the program received 
46 million in fiscal 1990 the bush budget for fiscal 1991 asks 
for 56 million 
only about 200 marksmen were recruited last year for the 
military as a result of dcms efforts that works out to about 
23000 per recruit which the house armed services committee calls 
a very expensive recruiting tool 
us rep fortney stark dcalif isnt the first to question 
the value of the program expresident jimmy carter tried to do 
away with it and a federal judge once suggested that the 
symbolic relationship between the army and the nra might be 
unhealthy since the nra attempts to influence the government on 
controversial issues such as gun control 
thousands of small items could be cut from the budget without 
impairing us interests the armys nraoriented marksmanship 
program is one of them

for his irancontra trial a federal judge ruled today 
us district court judge harold greene said that production of 
the diary entries is not essential to the achievement of justice 
in this case 
the judges ruling came as reagans videotaped testimony was 
being shown at poindexters trial on five felony charges of 
conspiracy making false statements and obstructing congress 
greene earlier had directed reagan to turn over the diary 
entries to his former national security adviser but the 
expresident challenged the judges order by invoking executive 
privilege the bush administration joined reagans assertion of the 
privilege 
the claims of executive privilege filed on behalf of the 
former president and of the incumbent president are sufficient to 
defeat poindexters request said greene 
greene granted reagans motion to quash poindexters subpoena 
for the diary entries which relate to both the iran initiative and 
contra resupply operation 
the judge said there is absolutely no basis in law for a 
holding that poindexter is entitled to the diary entries in 
addition to reagans videotaped testimony 
poindexters lawyers say he needs the diaries because reagan was 
unable in his videotaped testimony to recall many details of the 
irancontra affair for example the former president said he could 
not remember when he learned of a november 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran 
mr reagan did testify under oath at great length about many 
specific activities in his administration an event that is 
unprecedented in american history said greene 
the judge said reagans testimony plus written answers he gave 
several years ago in the irancontra affair provided poindexter 
with ample assistance for the conduct of his defense 
poindexters lawyers say the diaries may refer to facts that 
reagan now says he cannot recall 
but if the concept of executive privilege is to retain any 
meaning it will surely shield personal presidential papers from 
production on so flimsy a basis said greene 
in greenes courtroom meanwhile jurors began watching reagans 
videotaped testimony taken feb 1617 in los angeles for the 
poindexter trial 
the jurors were instructed to treat his testimony like that of 
any other witness 
greene said testimony from reagan should not be judged by a 
different standard you apply the same test he told the jurors 
you give the same care and same weight to reagans 
videotaped testimony as you would if he were here in person 
greene told the jury of seven women and five men 
poindexters lawyers were presenting the reagan tape in a bid to 
offset evidence presented by irancontra prosecutors who brought 
their case to a close tuesday 
would you please state your full name and spell your last name 
for the record a clerk asked on the videotape 
ronald reagan reagan the former president responded 
in 7 days of testimony prosecution witnesses told the jury the 
former national security adviser destroyed a presidential document 
and sent false letters to congress about covert aid to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
the jury was watching reagans testimony on a television monitor 
placed in front of the jury box transcripts were released the week 
after reagan testified and the tapes were shown in the federal 
courthouse in washington dc copies of the tapes were being 
released to the news media today 
reagans videotape was to be shown in its entirety concluding 
at midday thursday greene told the jury 
on tuesday greene denied a defense motion of acquittal saying 
there is evidence suggesting poindexter adopted false information 
designed to obstruct congress 
reagan made a number of statements favorable to poindexter 
he said he was convinced that his aides activities on behalf of 
the contras were all being done within the law he also said 
i dont think any false statements were made by poindexter in 
connection with the irancontra affair 
the former president said i am in complete support with 
allegedly false letters poindexter sent to congress about assisting 
the contras 
the letters said the administration was in compliance with 
both the spirit and letter of the law restricting aid to the 
rebels 
but they also embraced yearearlier denials by thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane that white house aide oliver 
north was raising funds for the contras and aiding them militarily 
while reagan said he never gave poindexter authority to destroy 
records or obstruct congress he did suggest it might have been all 
right to withhold information and destroy documents to protect 
national security in the us arms initiative with iran 
reagan suggested that any leaks of sensitive information from 
congress might jeopardize the lives of us hostages held in 
lebanon 
under crossexamination the former president said he never 
had any inkling his aides were guiding the contras strategy in 
any way and he said he never authorized his aides to break the 
law

about 1500 supporters of the late 
ferdinand marcos today spat on and burned an american flag and an 
effigy of uncle sam outside the us embassy to protest the new 
york trial of his widow imelda 
protesters held placards demanding justice for imelda and 
we love the marcos family during the generally peaceful 
demonstration 
the protest came one day after jury selection began in the 
racketeering trial of the 60yearold mrs marcos in us district 
court in manhattan 
about 50 members of the leftwing league of filipino students 
who wanted to hold a separate antius bases demonstration threw 
homemade bombs at police when they were prevented from getting near 
the embassy 
one of the bombs hit the roof of the entrance to the embassy but 
caused no injuries no injuries were reported to police or students 
the students who had marched from a nearby park lobbed more 
bombs at the police who tried to chase them two members of the 
group were arrested 
the melee briefly disrupted the demonstration of the marcos 
supporters who also tried to flee the scene thinking the police 
were dispersing them 
they returned to continue the rally 
we are here in support of our first lady speaker luz 
domingo told the crowd we are here to protest american 
intervention and the injustice done to her 
another speaker attorney romeo cayetano said the trial of mrs 
marcos on foreign soil was an affront to philippine sovereignty and 
showed the manila government has no honor 
manila newspapers published the text of a letter sent by mrs 
marcos to president bush offering to turn over her fortune to a 
fivemember international panel which would distribute the funds 
to the filipino people 
in the letter released by the philippine government mrs 
marcos claimed she was innocent and that the trial was an attempt 
to extort money and property from me 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush 
received a letter from mrs marcos fitzwater would not elaborate 
saying only that the president could not respond for legal reasons 
pertaining to the trial 
mrs marcos is accused of taking part in the illegal transfer of 
more than 160 million from the philippine treasury to buy 
manhattan real estate the indictment also alleges she defrauded 
banking institutions of 165 million to pay for the properties she 
could be imprisoned for 50 years and fined 1 million if convicted 
of all charges 
jury selection continued today 
mrs marcos is being tried with saudi financier adnan khashoggi 
who is accused of helping the marcoses hide their ownership of the 
real estate 
marcos the ousted philippines president who was the central 
figure in the october 1988 indictment died sept 28 in exile in 
hawaii he fled there after being toppled in the civilianmilitary 
uprising that propelled corazon aquino to power four years ago 
meanwhile press secretary tomas gomez said mrs aquino had no 
comment on the trial and mrs marcos letter to bush the 
president has more important things to do than monitor the 
trial gomez said 
gomez said the letter was irrelevant to mrs marcos court 
case

anticlimactic 
five years from now things will be different very different a

the albuquerque nm tribune on the east german elections 
once again an electorate has sensibly defied predictions the 
conservatives big plurality in east germanys first free election 
simplifies the process of german reunification where a 
socialist victory widely expected would have bogged it down in 
ambiguities 
the socialists are strong enough however to moderate the 
breakneck pace of reunification and interject some caution into the 
process 
despite their strong showing the conservatives lack the 
twothirds majority needed to change the constitution and 
precipitate reunification their invitation to the social democrats 
to enter a grand coalition was quickly rejected 
as a result whatever government emerges from the election 
must lead the people of east germany through their historic 
transition without the luxury of bipartisan backing in opposition 
the social democrats will retain at least some of the influence 
they sought over the pace and content of coming negotiations 
ultimately the best social glue of all is economic rebirth 
brought closer by the voters embrace of unification

the clarionledger jackson miss on nicaragua 
some impatient americans stand astounded almost a month after 
nicaraguas election the issue of armed contra guerrillas and a 
hostile sandinista army hasnt been settled no wiser words could 
be spoken on this situation than patience patience 
all in the united states who clamor for a virtually 
instantaneous transition from divided poor and wartorn to united 
peaceful and prosperous need a brief history lesson nicaraguans 
have fought among themselves with help from many outside friends 
for the last 10 years before the sandinista revolution and the 
contra counterrevolution the nicaraguan people had hardly a 
moments peace in this country 
the election feb 25 was a remarkable first step but only a 
first step in the long process of democratization violeta 
chamorro and daniel ortega have acted civilly even graciously 
toward each other but that doesnt remove the bitterness lingering 
from a decade of bloody civil war suspicions run deep and 
distrust is founded on years of deceit practiced by both sides 
the bush administration to its credit has not made unrealistic 
predictions about the transition of power it has stroked both 
sides of the political spectrum in diplomatic overtures the 
president unlike president reagan appears to realize the peace 
within nicaragua must be hammered out within nicaragua it cannot 
be dictated from washington or any other foreign capital

the newsleader springfield mo on food labeling 
maybe its time for an oldfashioned food fight thats about 
all there is to a nutty proposal by the department of health and 
human services encouraging the states to pass food labeling laws 
that job clearly belongs to the federal government not with the 
states 
unfortunately alternatives to mandatory food labeling are 
working in far too many cases 
the center for science in the public interest reported recently 
that four of the largest fast food chains have quit offering 
onthespot information about their menus violating a 1986 
agreement to provide ingredients and nutritional information 
nationwide 
americans should be up in arms more than 65 million of us one 
in three is on a diet right now more than one in four is 
overweight

winstonsalem nc journal on hostagetaking 
today marks the fifth anniversary of the kidnapping of terry 
anderson he was a professional bystander an associated press 
reporter in lebanon who had the misfortune to become the story 
himself when snatched by shiite moslems in that ruined land 
presently seven other americans are also being held along with 
at least that many additional western hostages 
the continued captivity of these victims is an insane act whose 
only conceivable value is to keep the hostagetakers on the worlds 
agenda perhaps they subscribe to the adage that all publicity is 
good publicity but they are wrong 
instead the continuing captivity is a constant reminder that we 
live in an often vicious and irrational world where western values 
are hardly universally shared

los angeles daily news on product safety 
the federal trade commission in announcing an investigation 
into the environmental claims being made these days on behalf of 
more and more products has selected a difficult target in its 
longstanding campaign against false advertising 
the task promises to be tricky because deceptive 
environmental claims in some instances may be responses to 
unfounded or exaggerated concerns that may be traced to 
fearmongers 
witness some of the alarming but illfounded things that have 
been said in the past year or so there was the panic about alar on 
apples a risk that turned out to be practically nonexistent 
lately the fear peddlers are having a field day with malathion 
spraying which most scientists do not consider a threat to health 
though the few dissenters get a disproportionate share of 
attention and the talk of global warming goes on and on amid 
mounting evidence that the atmosphere really isnt heating up 
significantly 
the ftc has an obligation to protect consumers from hucksters 
who use phony environmental claims to hawk their merchandise 
however it would be helpful if those consumers looked more 
critically at claims made by the activists and others who have 
agendas if not products to sell in the marketplace of ideas

philadelphia daily news on phoenix as 1993 super bowl site 
in arizona the question of a holiday honoring martin luther 
king divides even the certifiably loony republican party majority 
accordingly many organizations refuse to convene in arizona until 
that state decides to honor a great man 
the national football league is not one of them its 1993 super 
bowl is scheduled for phoenix it was more important to pump cash 
to one of the leagues most inept owners than to stand on principle 
except for norman braman owner of the philadelphia eagles he 
stands alone in opposing the site and vowing to work toward 
rescinding the offer if arizona does not act sometimes standing 
alone is the only place for a principled man

milwaukee sentinel on the delayed baseball season 
a oneweek delay in the start of the 1990 majorleague baseball 
season probably will drive the schedule makers crazy and maybe 
bring back the doubleheader if there arent enough open dates to 
make up for the late start 
the late start due to a dispute between players and owners 
also reduced the length of spring training 
this might be seen as heresy by those who promote the socalled 
cactus and grapefruit leagues as something to warm up the fans as 
well as the players but maybe spring training should always be 
three weeks long 
the truth be told the games played at the training sites are 
boring contests that count for nothing 
the experts will argue that conditioning is the real purpose of 
spring training thats true but why does it seem that every camp 
closes with the manager counting the wounded 
all this of course ignores the economic importance of spring 
training to states where the camps are located but the owners and 
players ignored that too and there has been no mention of 
reparations for the losses florida and arizona will suffer because 
of the prolonged negotiations 
the retirees and other baseball devotees who live in those 
states should switch their allegiances to minorleague teams and 
the new senior league made up of retired players who cant get 
enough of baseball these are guys who really come to play

nearly a year after the exxon valdez disaster 
little has been done to protect wildlife from another such oil 
spill an expert who directed the rehabilitation of sea otters 
after the alaska spill said wednesday 
basically there are no facilities in existence today anywhere 
in north america nor any ongoing organization to respond to another 
oil spill randall w davis said in an interview 
davis codirector of international wildlife research of san 
diego calif is completing a report on the rescue program after 
the alaska spill last march 24 that includes recommendations for 
oil spill contingency planning in alaska and california 
the valdez spewed almost 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
the sea when it ran aground in prince william sound soaking 1100 
miles of scenic coastland searchers found 34400 dead birds and 
believe at least 1000 sea otters and countless other animals died 
in the nations worst oil spill 
we are only a little bit further ahead than we were a year ago 
in that we have a little bit better understanding of how to do it 
but so far there has been very little advance preparation davis 
said 
in order to respond quickly that is within one day we need a 
rehabilitaion facility he said we probably need a number of 
them in areas that are considered high risk 
davis said these areas should include valdez the southern 
terminal of the alaska oil pipeline and probably a site on the 
california coast and others in other parts of the country 
the special needs of marine mammals make a facility much more 
difficult to build he said birds are a little bit easier to 
treat marine mammals require generally more sophisticated 
facilities and it is difficult to build them right at the time of 
the spill 
our response in alaska was not as effective as it could have 
been because we were trying to build those specialized facilities 
while we were treating animals said davis that makes it very 
very difficult 
international wildlife research has drawn up plans for a 
combined rehabilitation and research facility that davis said could 
be built either in california or alaska for about 5 million he 
said the rehabilitation portion alone could probably be built for 
15 million 
davis was in washington for a news conference at which the izaak 
walton league of america presented a conservation award to the 
procter amp gamble company for its support of animal rescue efforts 
the company donated manpower a computer and dawn dishwashing 
detergent to the alaska effort it also is underwriting production 
and distribution of mission rescue a video about the cleanup 
that is being offered at no charge for showings at zoos aquariums 
and nature centers 
davis oversaw the rehabilitation of 230 sea otters in the months 
following the alaska spill 
he was joined at the news conference by jay holcolmb director 
of international bird rescue research of berkeley calif who 
headed activities that saved some 1600 birds after the valdez 
spill 
by using computer technology we were able to record and save 
crucial technical data collected over a sixmonth period on the 
care of thousands of birds he said this information proved 
its worth in our work in rescue efforts following the recent spills 
in san francisco and huntington beach calif

sen jesse helms said today he has asked 
congressional investigators to determine whether the national 
endowment for the arts is funding pornographic art 
helms is deeply concerned about the neas apparent 
indifference to enforcing the congressional ban on funding obscene 
art the north carolina republican senators office said in a 
statement 
helms and other conservatives pushed a law through congress last 
year that bans federal funding of art that may be considered 
obscene by the endowment chairman 
the law expressly forbids spending tax money on depictions of 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in sex acts and materials that lack 
serious artistic value artists complained that the restrictions 
inhibited creativity and free expression 
in a letter to charles bowsher comptroller general of the 
general accounting office helms said endowment chairman john 
frohnmayer may be sincere in saying no nea funds are being used to 
support obscene art 
but the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is 
imperative that there be an objective investigation by an agency 
independent of the nea helms wrote 
his letter was accompanied by several examples 
he said that in january the endowment gave 20000 fellowships 
to three acknowledged lesbian writers helms said the washington 
blade a gay newspaper reported that the authors are wellknown 
for the homoerotic content of some of their works 
another example cited by helms was the degenerate with a 
capital d exhibition at the black and white in color gallery in 
new york which included a work titled alchemy cabinet 
featuring a vial containing the remains of an aborted baby 
a flyer for the show boasted that we will show the art no 
matter what laws are passed threats are made or restrictions 
placed helms said 
helms also charged that the endowment an independent federal 
agency is asking grant recipients not to give the endowment credit 
when it funds obscene works 
on several occasions i have come across material stating that 
funding was provided by the nea only to have the nea deny such 
funding he said the nea apparently takes no action against 
those who use its name without authorization 
this is new virginia falck an nea spokeswoman said in a 
telephone interview from washington when told of the helms letter 
we dont have an official response 
this has been going on for over a year ms falck said 
some of the things that weve been accused of by him and other 
congressmen we have funded and some we havent 
ms falck said frohnmayer could not be reached immediately for 
comment frohnmayer was scheduled to speak today at a congressional 
hearing on a measure to extend nea funding five years when it 
expires sept 30

youths in the west bank town of qalqilya troops clashed with 
stonethrowing high school students the students were marking the 
22nd anniversary of a battle in the jordanian town of karameh the 
march 1968 battle is viewed by palestinians as a victory over 
israel 
arab reports said parents surrounded one of the schools to try 
to prevent soldiers from entering and making arrests 
they said at least seven palestinians were slightly wounded with 
rubber bullets and rocks doctors at the un hospital in qalqilya 
said more than 50 palestinians were treated for tear gas 
inhalation and four were admitted with beating injuries 
an army spokesman confirmed the incident but said he knew of 
only one person treated for a rubber bullet injury and one person 
given first aid for gas fumes 
the alleged collaborator ahmad khalil musabeh was shot in the 
head by masked assailants in the market at khan yunis in the gaza 
strip he was the 199th palestinian to be killed by fellow arabs 
since the uprising began in december 1987 most of the victims have 
been accused of collaborating with israel 
there were conflicting reports meanwhile on the circumstances 
surrounding the 10yearold boys death 
the army said in a statement that youths hurled stones at 
soldiers on patrol and that the troops fired rubber bullets to 
disperse the youths the troops hit one of the youths and he was 
later reported to have died the army said 
but relatives told arab reporters the child was standing in the 
doorway of his home when he was hit with a bullet apparently fired 
from a nearby army post they said they saw no stones thrown 
military police were investigating the incident 
on tuesday former president jimmy carter accused israel of 
violating the human rights of palestinians in the occupied 
territories and cited in particular the deaths of children 
according to the israeli information center for human rights in 
the occupied territories 143 palestinian children aged 16 and 
under have been killed by israelis in the uprising a total of 42 
have been 12 years and younger the center said 
confronted with past criticism over the deaths of children 
israeli military officials have charged that uprising activists put 
youngsters at risk by placing them at the front of protests 
the army also says that rubber bullets used frequently to 
disperse demonstrators are not lethal generally 
a total of 667 palestinians including children have been 
killed by israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising began

more than 15 minutes behind schedule 
the clue lies in the flights code that appears in airline and 
travel agent computers the code for the usair flight for example 
has a 1 as the last digit that means that for the past month 
the flight has arrived on time between 10 and 20 percent of the 
time 
a 2 at the end of a flights computer code would mean the 
flight lands on time between 20 and 30 percent of the time and so 
on up to the 90 to 100 percent range a rating of less than 30 
percent gets chronically late honors in the department of 
transportations monthly air travel consumer report 
so what does a traveler do if the flight has a low score 
a passenger flying from philadelphia to boston could take delta 
648 at 450 pm with a 60 to 70 percent chance of arriving on 
time or usair 424 ten minutes later which has a 40 to 50 percent 
chance 
but how often do customers ask for this information 
no one ever has said yolande frommer referring to 
customers at her washington dc travel agency 
theyll ask the type of aircraft how many seats are in a row 
where the exits are and what movie is playing she said but they 
dont think to ask the chances of the plane arriving on time even 
though it often is a major concern 
many people simply arent aware that the information is 
available 
phil davidoff presidentelect of the american association of 
travel agents said that although few travelers use the data some 
agents notified customers when the ontime rating is below 50 
percent 
its clearly down the line in factors that will affect a 
decision about which flight to take davidoff said 
the data comes from the airlines themselves they are required 
by law to report it to the government each month delays due to 
mechanical problems are not counted in the ratings because the 
government thinks that including them might encourage airlines to 
rush repairs in order to keep up their ontime rating 
chris witkowski of the ralph naderfounded aviation consumer 
action project said the ratings are an important tool for wise 
travelers he dismisses the idea that expanding the ratings to 
include delays due to mechanical breakdowns might jeopardize safety 
if there is a chance of that happening it calls for stricter 
government inspections witkowski said 
some other consumer groups disagree richard livingston of the 
airline passengers association of north america a consumer and 
safety advocacy group said he thinks the government should pay 
more attention to the relative safety and security of flights 
instead of collecting data which might not be used by passengers 
they tend to focus too much on delays he said 
in addition to the flight data the report tells which of the 30 
biggest airports have the most ontime arrivals at each hour of the 
day 
the latest report covering january said all flights were on time 
in the 9 am hour at new yorks john f kennedy the 6 am hour 
at orlando fla and the 7 am hour at kansas city these were 
the only cases of 100 percent ontime arrivals in january 
the worst records were at jfk in the 5 pm period at 
charlotte nc in the 10 pm slot and at new yorks laguardia 
between 6 and 9 pm in each of those cases more than 40 percent 
of flights were late 
hoyt decker who heads the transportation departments consumer 
division said airlines have shown a keen interest in the consumer 
reports 
it most assuredly does influence performance he said 
decker acknowledged that the average travelers first concerns 
are the price of the ticket and the time the flight leaves but he 
said travel agents should be passing along the information about 
flights and airports as part of their services 
if people arent using it they should he said

chancellor helmut kohl on wednesday 
predicted full german unification by the end of 1992 frances 
president told him the merger should lead to closer integration for 
all of europe 
with the start of the big european market on dec 31 1992 we 
will also see a united germany kohl said in the southern city of 
constance he spoke to reporters after a twoday summit with 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez 
kohl was referring to the european economic communitys plans to 
create a barrierfree internal market by that date 
we want a speedy development but not a hectic one said 
kohl 
kohl expressed hope that an east german government will be 
formed soon and that talks about the planned economic union between 
the two german states can resume 
he planned to meet later with leaders of the victorious alliance 
for germany a grouping of three parties that won the most votes in 
sundays election in east germany it did not achieve a majority 
however and must form a coalition government 
kohls chief spokesman hans klein said president francois 
mitterrand of france had sent a telegram congratulating the 
chancellor for the victory of his east german political allies 
they received massive campaign support from kohl 
like kohls christian democratic union the alliance supports 
fast reunification and a market economy along with traditional 
christian values 
according to klein mitterrand also told kohl that german unity 
must be part of the larger process of overcoming the divisions of 
europe 
german unity in the unity of the european economic 
community which in turn is a stage to european unity is the path 
which we have jointly mapped out and which is the one we now have 
to pursue klein quoted the letter as saying 
some europeans are concerned that a united germany will be an 
overbearing economic power and france is seeking to link the 
united germany firmly with the west 
on friday kohl is slated to fly to brussels for talks with eec 
officials about the possible effects of a common german currency on 
the eecs own european monetary system 
under the common currency idea the powerful west german mark 
would become east germanys currency as well 
rudolf seiters kohls chief of staff said west germany hopes 
to have the currency plan in place by july 1 
also wednesday west germanys opposition social democratic 
party said it opposes nato membership for a united germany unless 
the western alliance abandons its strategy of nuclear deterrence 
the demand was made in a 12point disarmament program unveiled 
by the leftist social democrats it states that nato would have to 
undergo fundamental changes if it were to include a united 
germany as a member 
the partys counterpart in east germany finished in second place 
in the election it favors a more gradual approach to reunification 
than the alliance and turned down an offer to take part in a 
coalition government

global warming during the past century could not 
have come solely from a longterm influence of the oceans 
according to a study that supports the idea that the greenhouse 
effect has begun to warm the earth 
a computer simulation suggests that the oceans can account for 
only about threefifths of the warming recorded in the last 100 
years 
the researchers cautioned that the result does not prove 
greenhouse warming played a role other scientists agreed but 
split on how strongly it bolsters the idea that greenhouse warming 
has begun 
the greenhouse effect refers to a warming caused by a buildup in 
the atmosphere of certain gases such as carbon dioxide chiefly 
from human activity scientists are concerned that it eventually 
could alter climates and rainfall patterns and lead to coastal 
flooding from raised ocean levels 
but they disagree about whether the greenhouse effect has yet 
produced any detectable impact 
the earth has warmed by about ninetenths of a degree fahrenheit 
during the past century a major problem in demonstrating a role 
for the greenhouse effect is that scientists do not know how much 
of the warming comes from longterm natural variability said 
gerald meehl of the national center for atmospheric research in 
boulder colo 
the oceans which slowly absorb and release huge amounts of 
heat are probably the most likely source of this longterm 
influence he said 
the new study of the oceans influence is presented in 
thursdays issue of the british journal nature by tml wigley and 
scb raper of the university of east anglia in norwich england 
their simulation found that over intervals of up to 100 years 
the oceans might produce a trend of up to about half a degree 
fahrenheit 
that means the ocean influence could not have produced the 
observed global warming by itself the researchers wrote yet we 
still cannot claim to have unequivocally detected the greenhouse 
effect they said 
researcher robert cess said the study cannot really rule out the 
idea that the oceans did produce the global warming the simulation 
was too simplified to produce a firm conclusion said cess an 
atmospheric sciences professor at the state university of new york 
at stony brook 
but researcher stephen schneider of atmospheric research center 
who called himself 80 percent certain that greenhouse warming has 
begun said the result adds to his belief 
its not proof yet he said its another step along the 
way 
scientists will need 10 to 20 more years of observations to be 
sure if they are seeing a greenhouse warming he said

luis del cid a key codefendant of manuel noriega 
has agreed to plead guilty to a drug conspiracy count his attorney 
said today 
final details of the plea bargain are still being worked out 
but should go before a federal judge soon said del cids defense 
lawyer samuel burstyn 
there is an agreement in principle burstyn said its in 
the process of being reduced to writing 
del cid a lieutenant colonel in panamas military at the time 
of his capture during the us invasion of that country is accused 
in a february 1988 indictment of accepting 200000 in 
cocainetrafficking profits from a drug pilot 
the indictment says the money was delivered by the governments 
chief prosecution witness floyd carlton caceres at the 
headquarters of the panamanian defense forces in panama city in 
december 1983 it allegedly was intended for noriega the 
panamanian general deposed as dictator after the dec 20 invasion 
noriega is in federal prison on charges of accepting 46 
million in bribes to allow colombias medellin drug cartel to use 
panama as a way station for usbound cocaine 
the conspiracy count could bring del cid up to 10 years in 
federal prison burstyn said and there is no sentence limit 
written into the agreement 
but he said he did not expect his client to serve more than 2 
years when the plea bargain is approved under the charges included 
in the indictment del cid could have served up to 70 years in 
prison according to the us attorneys office 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said 
she could not confirm or deny a possible deal with del cid 
any comment about a plea agreement would be premature until 
its filed with the court and accepted by the court she said 
burstyn refused to say today whether del cid will testify 
against his former boss under the agreement but previously he 
noted that once a defendant has pleaded guilty he must honor a 
subpoena from the prosecution and cannot invoke his fifth amendment 
right to refuse to testify 
if the agreement is approved del cid will be the second of the 
six defendants in custody to enter a guilty plea drug pilot 
eduardo pardo already has pleaded guilty to flying drug profits 
from fort lauderdale to panama 
also in custody is accused colombian cocaine trafficker william 
saldarriaga free on bond are another alleged drug pilot daniel

secretary of state james a baker iii 
today urged nationalist leader nelson mandela to reconsider his 
call for nationalization of financial institutions and industries 
in south africa a us official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said baker 
was pleased with the way mandela received that the source 
declined to elaborate 
the official also said that baker assured mandela during his 
meeting with the african national congress leader that sanctions 
imposed on south africa by the us congress would be continued by 
the bush administration 
after the meeting baker and mandela commended each others 
efforts to bring peace to southern africa 
also today the united states lifted santions against namibia a 
day after the country achieved independence from south africa 
there were differences said mandela a leader of the anc 
which is fighting to end whiteminority rule in south africa but 
i would like you to concentrate on the friendship that exists 
between the anc and the government the congress and the people of 
the united states 
mandela and other anc leaders have argued that in order to 
correct the huge economic disparity between blacks and whites in 
south africa key industries must be nationalized once whites share 
political power with blacks 
mandela among world leaders attending namibias independence 
celebrations said one of the disagreements was bakers plan to 
meet president f w de klerk during a south african visit this 
week mandela says it sends an inaccurate message that the south 
african government has made meaningful changes 
the anc leader said he is looking forward to meeting with 
president bush in washington but no date has been set 
baker told reporters after the meeting with mandela that the anc 
had gone out of their way to make arrangements for us to see 
their colleagues in south africa baker said of mandela i 
think his courageousness is something that the world has taken note 
of and has sustained many even in the us that apartheid must 
be abolished 
baker in greeting mandela said the usbrokered negotiations 
that led to independence for namibia were an example of how 
superpower cooperation could benefit the world i fully agree 
mandela replied 
mandela also praised bush and and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev when he complimented world leaders for easing 
international conflicts 
one of the things we deeply appreciate are the efforts made by 
the world powers to relax world tensions said mandela 
i think that we are turning a new chapter and for that we are 
grateful to president reagan president gorbachev and of course to 
president bush mandela said 
mandelas comments on reagan and bush however did not 
specifically extend to american policy toward south africa anc 
leaders have said they can communicate better with the bush 
administration although they still disagree with some of its 
policies toward the south african government 
the african national congress the main black group fighting 
minority white rule in south africa has long condemned reagans 
policy of constructive engagement toward south africa which 
involved continued ties in order to exert influence and opposition 
to economic sanctions

president bush assured polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki today that the united states supports the right 
of the polish people to live secure within their present 
borders 
bushs statement delivered at a colorful white house welcoming 
ceremony was intended to calm polish fears that the reunification 
of germany might lead to german claims on territory ceded to poland 
after world war ii 
in any decisions affecting the fate of poland poland must 
have a voice bush said to ringing applause 
agreement has been reached that polish representatives will be 
present at meetings of the socalled twoplusfour nations when the 
issue of polandss western borders are discussed the conference 
consists of east and west germany the united states britain 
france and the soviet union 
bush invited mazowiecki back to the white house for an 
unscheduled round of talks on thursday 
we see a new europe in which the security of all european 
states and their fundamental right to exist secure within their 
present borders is totally assured bush said at arrival 
ceremonies on the south lawn of the white house 
america wants to see poland succeed bush said we want to 
welcome poland as a full partner in the community of nations we 
want to see your people enjoy the fruits of free enterprise 
opening a meeting in which polish fears of a reunified and 
strong germany are expected to be the dominant theme bush told 
polands first noncommunist prime minister since world war ii that 
the united states will remain a power in europe and that the nato 
alliance will remain strong and united 
we have come from a country that wants to and can play a 
significant role in the new emerging order in europe mazowiecki 
said in reply 
were coming here to talk about the future the future of 
polishamerican political cooperation in the face of momentous 
changes and economic cooperation so vital in our move to free 
enterprise 
however mazowiecki said there are strains in the partnership 
the present acceleration of history is one in which the 
partnership is being put to a test he said adding that the two 
nations would pass the test because of their common interests and 
us goodwill 
later in a ceremony in the white house rose garden bush and 
mazowiecki signed a treaty designed to promote business and 
economic relations between the two countries and to attract 
significant us investment 
we can take this treaty to the us investment community and 
say this is why you should invest in poland bush said 
mazowiecki said the treaty is very important because it 
offers prospects for american business and companies to become 
engaged in the polish environment 
the prime minister said investors will encounter problems in 
their initial involvement in poland problems such as a faltering 
and unreliable telephone system 
but i would like to tell your people they should not be 
discouraged he said we will welcome the courageous people who 
will come and help move us through this happy year of problems 
mazowiecki bowed to the american flag as he and bush reviewed 
the military color guard standing at attention on the lawn a child 
wearing colorful polish national dress gave the prime minister red 
and white carnations the colors of the polish flag 
bush declined to respond when asked during a photo session if he 
objects to the continued presence of soviet troops in poland 
earlier white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
united states hoped it would not be necessary to have those troops 
in poland 
the presence of soviet troops is something that is a little 
surprising to us he said we frankly dont think that will be 
necessary in the long run 
poland unlike its east european neighbors has said it wants 
soviet troops to remain apparently because of concern over the 
prospect of a reunited and strong german state 
mazowiecki asked at the white house if he wants a written 
guarantee on his countrys western borders with germany replied 
well be talking about this 
he told reporters before leaving warsaw that poland wants the 
united states to support its demand for a signed treaty 
guaranteeing its western border before reunification 
any treaty will have to be worked out between the two german 
states and poland said a us official who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity the united states does not think it 
appropriate to become involved in exactly how and when that is 
done the official said 
the unification meetings involve east and west germany and 
representatives of the united states britain the soviet union and 
france the four victors in world war ii who retain authority in 
both german nations

president bush ended sanctions against the new 
nation of namibia on wednesday and promised to give the former 
south african colony full access to the american market 
with the end of south africas administration all us 
sanctions against namibia are being lifted bush said 
we welcome namibia as a full trading partner and are taking 
steps to ensure that it is given access to the american market 
he said 
the treasury department said lifting the sanctions would allow 
new loans and investments in namibia and remove the prohibition 
against imports of certain goods from namibia 
the sanctions had been imposed against south africa because of 
its antiapartheid racial policies and extended to namibia because 
it was administered by the south african government the sanctions 
remain against south africa 
namibia the last colony in africa spent the past 75 years 
under the rule of south africa 
the independence of namibia today marks the end of colonialism 
in africa and a proud beginning for the worlds newest country 
the president said 
he said the united states has already established full 
diplomatic relations with the new republic of namibia and will 
exchange ambassadors as quickly as possible 
americans can take pride in the role the united states played 
in making this transition to independence possible bush said 
brought about in large measure by vigorous american diplomacy 
the 1988 brazzaville protocol and the new york accords cleared the 
way to namibian indepence and the withdrawal of all cuban troops 
from angola he said 
bush said he sent secretary of state james a baker iii to the 
independence ceremonies in windhoek as a sign of the respect and 
esteen in which we hold the worlds newest democracy 
he said baker carries the good wishes of all americans to 
president sam nujoma and the namibian people we are especially 
gratified that namibias constituent assembly has produced a 
constitution that is among the most democratic in africa and which 
provides an excellent basis to ensure national harmony and 
development 
from this promising beginning we look forward to a warm and 
productive relationship with namibia said bush 
president nujoma was the leader of the south west african 
peoples organization which led the war against south africas 
rule elections last november provided swapo with a parliamentary 
majority 
nujoma has discarded swapos ideological rhetoric embraced a 
freemarket economy and appointed nonpolitical experts as his

the government could lose its competitive edge 
if it does not continue its research in defense technology despite 
diminishing military budgets industry experts told congress 
wednesday 
the worst that could happen is if were caught with a major 
technological surprise norman r augustine chairman and chief 
executive officer of martin marietta corp and a former pentagon 
official told a house panel 
augustine and two other defense industry specialists told the 
armed services defense policy panel that the united states should 
create a proven weapon and then consider saving the product 
however they said the work must include testing as well as 
research and development 
donald a hicks chairman of hicks amp associates inc noted that 
if the government had stopped at research and development of the 
next generation airtoair missile commonly known as amraam the 
pentagon never would have learned of some of the problems found 
during the operational tests 
we should go all the way to putting the item in inventory 
into the troops hands then shut down the production line and put 
the proven data package on the shelf augustine said 
the experts also stressed the importance of moving ahead with 
the next generation of weapons aircraft and submarines only if 
development reflects a significant improvement from the current 
systems 
hicks a proponent of stealth technology said the united states 
has a real advantage in developing the radarevading 
characteristics best known on the b2 bomber 
we should get it into the inventory and get as much as we 
can hicks said of the aircraft that is the center of controversy 
because of its costly price tag of 530 million a copy

voters which would you pick 
elections for the 394seat parliament are less than a week away 
and the 29 political parties jockeying for a say in the next 
hungarian government are sparing no effort to win the hearts and 
minds of the electorate 
with hungary among the soviet bloc countries furthest on the 
road to reform many campaign themes deal with independence from 
the soviets a red army pullout began march 12 and a return to 
political pluralism and a market economy 
the campaign ends march 23 two days before hungarians vote in 
the days remaining the parties given the greatest chance of 
winning the hungarian democratic forum the independent 
smallholders the league of free democrats and the socialists 
are focusing on the undecided voters 
there are many of those and it appears sundays vote will be 
only a preliminary test of party popularity none is expected to 
win a majority forcing a runff to decide a winner 
a gallup poll published march 12 said 21 percent of the 1000 
people queried would vote for the democratic forum 
the party has campaigned on a nationalistic platform interlaced 
with christian democratic values a europeanwide movement that 
emphasizes traditional christian values in everyday life 
its staunch anticommunist views are obvious in its campaign 
posters which include the bullnecked soviet officer at the train 
station the partys president jozsef antall is the stern man on 
the poster above the highway 
the free democrats who consider themselves liberals and seek 
creation of a west europeanstyle society had 203 percent support 
in the poll 
the independent smallholders supported by 157 percent of the 
respondents came in third the party has presented itself as the 
main rural party with centerright leanings 
in last place was the governing socialist party the main 
remnant of the communist party that ruled more than four decades 
it had support of 8 percent of the respondents 
the socialist party has pledged a full commitment to democracy 
but hungarians apparently are finding it difficult to trust a party 
born of the communists who ruled the country alone for more than 
four decades 
reformers gained the upper hand in the communist party last 
year leading to the partys dissolution last year the socialists 
then declared themselves successors to the communists talks with 
opposition groups led to the elections 
they will be the second free elections in the soviet bloc but 
voters have pointed out in interviews recently that parallels 
should not be drawn between their vote and that in east germany on 
march 18 
more than 40 percent of the east germans cast ballots for the 
christian democrats who campaigned on a platform of quick 
reunification with west germany and had support from west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
we dont have a west germany here to influence the voters 
said zoltan fodor a 35yearold computer specialist in budapest 
we also dont have the theme of reunification 
a woman sunning herself on a bench near a wall of election 
posters agreed that the proximity of west germany to east germany 
played an important role in the elections 
they always had westernstyle democratic values in view 
said the woman who identified herself only as piroska she was 
referring to the fact that most east germans had access to the 
other germanys television programs even in the dark years of 
totalitarianism at home 
we in contrast have been more isolated in some respects

the j paul getty museum announced today 
it has purchased its greatest 19th century painting the 
masterpiece irises by dutch artist vincent van gogh for an 
undisclosed sum 
painted in 1889 irises was sold to the museum by alan bond 
the financially troubled australian entrepreneur who paid a record 
539 million for the work at a 1987 auction 
in keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private 
acquisitions the museum will not be disclosing the price of the 
work the getty said in a statement 
the painting already is on display in the museums secondfloor 
galleries where other 19th century paintings are displayed 
including works by pierreauguste renoir edouard manet and edvard 
munch 
the chance to acquire the painting was a great moment in the 
history of the museum and the trust said harold m williams 
president and chief executive officer of the j paul getty trust 
getty the late oil baron endowed the museum with 21 billion 
making it the worlds richest art institution 
the painting characteristic of van goghs bold style 
represents a patch of garden in a french asylum at saintremy de 
provence where the troubled artist committed himself following a 
mental breakdown in arles 
this is among the most original and dynamic of all van goghs 
compositions in which the spearlike slashing representation of 
the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color said george 
goldner the gettys curator of paintings and drawings at the 
same time it is a picture of great poetry as expressed in the one 
white iris on the left side which in its isolation has a special 
poignancy 
the private transaction was arranged by sothebys new york 
auction house which had loaned bond 27 million to buy irises 
using the painting itself as collateral 
the unusual deal was widely criticized for inflating prices in 
the international art market 
since bonds financial empire began crumbling under the weight 
of more than 5 billion in debt there has been considerable 
curiosity about the fate of irises among art curators dealers 
and collectors 
in a statement released by sothebys bond was quoted as saying 
i am very pleased with this sale particularly because this great 
masterpiece will be on exhibition at such a preeminent museum

chinas military schools and insolvent staterun 
enterprises will get more money this year but other sectors will 
have to cut back as the nation faces another year in the red the 
finance minister said wednesday 
wang bingqian said in a report to the national peoples congress 
that the present financial situation remains grave with many 
contradictions and great difficulties cropping up in national 
finance 
also wednesday the legislatures 2700 delegates accepted the 
resignation of senior leader deng xiaoping from his last government 
post chairman of the state central military commission 
deng 85 retired in november from his last communist party 
post which was as head of the partys central military commission 
his resignation from the state body was expected and party chief 
jiang zemin is expected to be named his successor 
although deng now holds no official posts he is believed to 
still have final authority on major issues 
wang detailed chinas financial problems of the past year and 
warned that this year would be no better 
the condition of the state budget for this year is grim 
because during this period of economic improvement and 
rectification economic growth is slowing down he said 
wang said an austerity program instituted in 1988 had slowed 
down chinas economy reducing revenues and complicating efforts to 
meet state demands for a balanced budget 
this years deficit will be 189 billion down slightly from 
last years 2 billion wang said 
if domestic and foreign borrowing were regarded as part of the 
deficit as they are in the west this years imbalance would be 9 
billion up more than 1 billion from last year 
wang said state revenues for 1990 are expected to go up nearly 
11 percent to 6886 billion while spending is expected to grow by 
just over 10 percent to 7075 billion 
the government will try to increase revenues by raising business 
tax rates and improving collection of individual earnings taxes he 
told the legislature the revenues that local governments must turn 
over to the state will be moderately increased and subsidies 
to some regions will be reduced wang said 
the military will get a hefty 152 percent increase in its 
budget national defense was allotted 616 billion although 
western military analysts say real spending is far greater if 
peripheral costs are included 
defense spending was held down during the 1980s as china 
concentrated on economic development but the military was expected 
to get more this year because of its greater political clout after 
putting down last years prodemocracy movement 
education got a 98 percent boost 
nearly onethird of the state budget or 226 billion will be 
spent on subsidies for moneylosing enterprises and price rises 
wang called it a great drain on the state treasury 
the state has allocated 2 billion to pay back individuals who 
last year were required to buy bonds to help finance public debt 
repayment to enterprises public institutions and banks has been 
postponed he said

president mikhail s gorbachev today ordered 
lithuanians to turn in their weapons a day after the baltic 
republics breakaway government demanded an end to soviet military 
maneuvers 
the soviet interior ministry should confiscate guns from anyone 
who refuse to hand them in after a week said gorbachevs directive 
read on the evening television program vremya 
lithuania declared independence march 11 a move condemned by 
gorbachev and the soviet congress and lithuanians have begun 
signing up for voluntary defense service 
the official news agency tass said the decree aims to protect 
the rights of soviet citizens and soviet soverignty in lithuania 
the decree ordered the kgb to step up security on the soviet 
border on lithuanian territory and halt all illegitimate actions 
violating federal legislation on frontiers 
the soviet foreign ministry also was ordered to clamp tighter 
controls on granting foreigners the right to travel to the republic 
in a telegram tuesday night lithuanian prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene complained about unannounced soviet military moves 
which lithuanians consider an attempt to intimidate them into 
backing down on their declaration of independence 
the people of lithuania are deeply disturbed about the actions 
of the soviet armed forces the intense mobilization of armored 
vehicles and tanks the intensified flights of military air force 
planes and unauthorized sorties into lithuanian territory by 
paratroopers involved in intelligence activities she said in the 
cable from vilnius 
in moscow a bill establishing tough requirements for secession 
passed its first legislative hurdle the supreme soviets council 
of the union one of two chambers gave the bill preliminary 
approval and sent it to the other chamber 
deputies said the secession procedure which requires a 
republicwide referendum and a transition period of up to five 
years would have to be observed by lithuania even though it has 
already declared its independence 
but lithuanian deputy vaidotas antanaitis who attended the 
session as an observer disagreed the bill doesnt apply to us 
weve already left he said during a break in the proceedings 
the bill gained approval in a 17515 vote after deputies argued 
that to delay its passage might lead more republics to copy 
lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence 
mrs prunskiene said lithuanias parliament had not been 
notified in advance of the maneuvers which began over the weekend 
nor on the status of the soviet army in lithuania the lithuanians 
want soviet troops to leave 
representatives from ussr ministries and agencies arrive 
in lithuania and act without contacting the government of 
lithuania she complained in the telegram which was addressed to 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other senior soviet officials 
mrs prunskiene called on the kremlin to discuss the presence of 
troops and other issues the government is convinced that there 
is a sound basis for coming to mutually beneficial understanding 
and for discussing issues of common interest in a calm and rational 
manner 
the soviet congress of peoples deputies on thursday declared 
lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence illegal and 
invalid but did not say what steps would be taken to try to prevent 
secession 
gorbachev has said he would not use force and foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze speaking tuesday in namibia reiterated 
that position we are against the use of force in any region and 
particularly against the use of force domestically 
lithuanian deputy prime minister kazimieras motieka said tuesday 
that soviet military airfields in the republic have an excessive 
number of helicopters and perhaps also military units 
lithuania has eight soviet military bases and tens of thousands 
of troops according to emigre sources 
the lithuanians insist on negotiating independence and say they 
intend to respect soviet interests 
lithuanias parliament today began debate in the capital of 
vilnius on defining the structure of its new government 
specifically on trimming the number of its ministries 
there was no sign today of soviet troop movements officials 
also said there were no signs of an economic blockade that many 
lithuanians have anticipated in retaliation for the declaration of 
independence 
we are still receiving gas and oil lithuanias two most 
critical imports from the soviet union said mrs prunskiene an 
economist who was elected prime minister on saturday 
in a stern warning to lithuania on monday the kremlin ordered 
its ministries to ensure that no moscowrun enterprises or agencies 
were turned over to lithuania 
it also said it would not tolerate a lithuanian attempt to take 
over control of its boders but the lithuanians moved ahead with 
plans to take charge of the frontiers and youths volunteered to 
help 
signs in vilnius said the sajudis grassroots nationalist 
movement was handling the registration of men between ages of 19 
and 40 who were ready to serve in defense of the region 
both men and women were responding to the call and crowded the 
tiny office in the parliament building to fill out the forms 
lithuanian officials said they intend to set up border and 
customs forces to show the worlds governments that lithuania 
controls its territory and should be formally recognized as 
independent 
so far no foreign country has officially recognized lithuania 
as independent 
mrs prunskiene said the government hoped to have installed 
withing 10 days 37 border posts in locations on the soviet and 
polish frontiers that are not occupied by soviet forces

the architect of the usbrokered 
negotiations that led to namibian independence said wednesday the 
success of the talks shows there is hope for peace in all of 
southern africa 
it is really the first time since the early 1960s that 
southern africa has a chance for peace said chester crocker the 
former us assistant secretary of state for african affairs he 
was speaking on the first full day of independence for namibia 
which since 1915 had been a territory of south africa 
crocker spent eight years negotiating independence for namibia 
and had to work out a series of complicated deals to bring it about 
these included persuading angolas marxist government to send 
home 50000 cuban troops who were helping it battle antimarxist 
guerrillas and south african fighters the angolans also agreed to 
close bases of the african national congress the nationalist group 
fighting south africas government 
crocker was criticized by many african governments for linking a 
cuban withdrawal from angola to namibian independence 
it never made any sense without it he responded in an 
interview you had three wars going on and theyre all 
interlinked and theres nothing in it for south africa if there 
is no cuban withdrawal angola and namibia are intimately connected 
by history it was a natural approach 
we were pushing two rocks up two hills simulteaneously not 
one rock up one hill said crocker now a professor at georgetown 
university 
the negotiations often broke down just as it appeared a deal was 
near 
in 1984 the united states set up an office that was to become 
its embassy in namibia two us officials assigned to the office 
dennis keogh and army lt col kenneth crabtree were killed by a 
bomb at oshakati in the northern war zone the office was closed 
when it became apparent independence was in the distance 
crocker kept pushing and a us embassy was opened here against 
wednesday by secretary of state james a baker iii a plaque 
honoring the two slain men is in the foyer 
asked why the sides ultimately reached an agreement crocker 
said angolas attempt at a decisive military offensive in 1987 
was a total fiasco 
south africa agreed to terms because this for them was a very 
substantial accomplishment for their own diplomacy as they saw it 
castro would say the same from his perspective he said of the 
cuban leader 
but look what the south africans got theyre leaving namibia 
on their own terms theyre getting rid of the anc presence in 
angola theyre getting rid of the only foreign troops in southern 
africa the cubans crocker said 
its a great sense of accomplishment and reward to see it 
work and to see this country about to take off to see the region 
turning a page he said 
this is an achievement for us diplomacy people talk about 
ussoviet diplomacy and it did play a role but frankly it was 
our concept and it was our effort and they joined it when it 
really began to take off 
the civil war is still going on in angola and a civil war also 
rages in mozambique along with political violence in south africa 
but crocker said that through the success of the namibian 
agreement people have seen negotiations work and that sort of 
demonstration can be very powerful 
on the subject of south african apartheid crocker said those 
who attribute recent reforms in south africa to american sanctions 
or to his policies denigrate the struggle of black and white 
south africans to promote change the struggle has always been 
inside thats where the power is 
he said legalization of labor unions and their subsequent 
pressures against apartheid were far more important than sanctions 
imposed by the united states

for the seven months he lived in tompkins square 
park louis hrusovsky could count the days since his last 
satisfying meal the hours spent idle the moments until police 
would roust him 
early wednesday hrusovsky returned to tompkins square and put 
that abject arithmatic to good use he counted the homeless 
this area will be one of the most thorough counts in the 
city he said i lived in this park for seven months until 
three weeks ago i can give you the name of everyone in the park 
hrusovsky and his fellow enumerators a cheery determined 
group tried to do just that they were a bright spot in the first 
national effort to count americas unsheltered 
from the start critics had said that the census conducted 
tuesday night and wednesday morning would overlook many of the 
nations homeless including an estimated 70000 to 90000 in new 
york city 
city officials and advocates for the homeless repeated the 
charges on wednesday not only did the counter miss the nooks and 
crannies where many homeless sleep subway tunnels and back 
alleys they also failed to visit several shelters 
at the port authority bus terminal home to hundreds of 
homeless reporters watched as some counters milled around a 
newsstand it seemed as if they were ignoring the terminals upper 
levels where many people sleep in hallways bus platforms and 
stairwells 
barbara everitt bryant the us census bureau director 
insisted that the terminal was blanketed and said any shelters 
that were missed would be checked on wednesday night anyway 
census officials said they were looking for a snapshot of the 
homeless not precise numbers 
among the skeptics was a man who identified himself as sharif 
he said he had been living in tompkins square park a scruffy plot 
of green on manhattans lower east side for the past four months 
the census bureau doesnt have the heart or audacity to go to 
where people crash he said before the census takers arrived he 
pointed out nooks of the park abandoned buildings and vacant lots 
where he said sleeping homeless would go uncounted 
sharif was wrong at about 230 am hrusovsky and 11 other 
enumerators arrived at the park methodically carefully they 
counted everyone 
some of the census takers had been homeless some had not all 
were from the neighborhood and knew it well 
since 1952 my family has never been in the census said 
blanca moore i chose to work in my neighborhood and i am 
hopeful that all these people can be counted 
after counting the sleeping forms dotting the park 11 
enumerators wended their way through the lettered streets that are 
known as alphabet city a decayed section of vacant lots abandoned 
buildings occupied by squatters and gentrified apartment houses 
first stop at 3 am was a fencedin lot on avenue b 
paul eskridge tested the chained gate and peered in at three 
makeshift tents ringed by old appliances and grocery carts stacked 
with cans to be returned for deposit 
this is private domain so well have to guess three tents 
two people in each to be conservative so six in all he said 
filling out the forms 
as the group made its way down ninth street eskridge darted 
across the street and snagged a man who said he was homeless 
what kind of hour is this to be out you guys are the kooks 
said the homeless man he politely answered the questions 
at the next corner the group eyed three young men standing on 
the corner 
i know those three theyre drug dealers said one 
enumerator 
ok then avoid them said another 
on a side street off avenue d the group stepped into a 
rubblestrewn lot where three shacks stood patched together from 
tar paper and wood scraps 
dont wake anyone up one woman whispered as a man emerged 
from a leanto 
hi susie garcia called out to him were from the census 
bureau 
a few minutes of explanation and the group left with the count 
nine males six females all adults 
one counter mentioned he saw a child in one shack 
theyre saying there were no kids because theyre afraid well 
send a social worker out there said another counter 
despite the chilly drizzle counters introduced themselves to 
everyone they passed 
im doing it for the money admitted garcia who received 
950 an hour but i live right in this neighborhood and i hope 
it makes a difference besides this isnt a job its an 
adventure 
shortly before 4 am a car pulled up and rolled down a window 
hey isnt it too late to take a census 
several counters replied in unison its never too late for a 
census

namibia celebrated its first day of 
independence wednesday with a joyful multiracial parade and 
president sam nujoma stressed the need for economic development if 
the country is to achieve democratic ideals 
we have inherited a lopsided economy twothirds of our 
people are very poor and 30 percent are unemployed nujoma told 
an overflow crowd of more than 30000 namibians and hundreds of 
foreign dignitaries 
allnight parties and tribal dancing followed the lowering of 
the south african flag at the sports stadium just after midnight 
namibians cheered as the red green and blue banner of their newly 
independent country was raised in its place marking the end of 75 
years of south african rule 
the 72member national assembly elected in november was sworn 
in and thousands lined the streets again just after dawn as a 
3milelong parade made its way to the stadium where nujoma spoke 
fortyone of the legislators belong to nujomas southwest 
africa peoples organization the guerrilla movement that waged a 
23year war against south african rule and then captured the most 
votes in novembers balloting 
black women from the herero tribe wearing colorful anklelength 
victorian dresses and headdresses marched in front of white 
teenagers twirling batons down kaiser street which will be 
renamed independence avenue 
the floats depicted the countrys ethnic diversity primitive 
bushmen and modern bands were carried along on the back of flatbed 
trucks to the stadium the speeches were followed by singing and 
dancing that lasted into the night 
many young blacks cheered loudly when palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat his car blocked by the parade 
stepped out and walked a few steps along the route before slipping 
into a hotel 
between the festivities and state dinners dozens of foreign 
leaders took the oportunity to discuss issues 
south african president fw de klerk met with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze it was the first meeting between a 
south african president and a member of the soviet government since 
relations were broken 34 years ago over south africas system of 
racial segregation 
de klerk also met yugoslavian president janez drnovsek and 
swedish foreign minister sten andersson south african foreign 
minister pik botha described the contacts as south africas 
return to international acceptability 
shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii met 
angolan president eduardo dos santos they discussed a possible 
ceasefire in the angolan civil war where the united states and 
the soviet union back opposing sides 
to coincide with independence the united states lifted economic 
sanctions against namibia the sanctions were imposed against south 
africa to protest apartheid but they extended to namibia while it 
was under south africas control 
the two superpower ministers also had separate meetings with 
nelson mandela the deputy president of the african national 
congress 
nujomas focus on economics before an audience of international 
decisionmakers was seen as an indication of the countrys need for 
an infusion of money to balance its budget and meet the 
expectations that independence has created for so many black 
citizens 
unemployment is disproportionately suffered by the black 
majority and was exacerbated by the return last year of more than 
40000 exiles business and industry are concentrated in the hands 
of whites who make up just 6 percent of the population 
nujoma an avowed socialist during his 30 years in exile made 
no reference to that ideology during his speech but he repeatedly 
mentioned the necessity of private capital and investment to 
strengthen the namibian economy 
namibia has an annual per capita income of about 1000 a year 
one of the highest in africa but this is partly based on south 
african aid which is ending the semidesert country has good 
infrastructure and profitable mining fishing and agriculture 
industries controlled by whites 
the country of more than 13 million people faces a 191 million 
deficit this year on a budget of a little more than 766 million 
south africa captured namibia from the germans in 1915 and 
agreed to give up its control last year as part of a complicated 
deal also involving angola and cuba 
in return for independence cuba withdrew troops backing the 
angolan government against guerrillas and south african fighters 
namibia had also been known as southwest africa 
chester crocker the former us assistant secretary of state 
for african affairs who worked out the deal said wednesday its 
success showed there is hope for peace in all of southern africa 
egyptian president hosni mubarak spoke as chairman of the 
organization of african unity and like nujoma he focused on the 
economy 
political freedom cannot be sustained without economic 
development said nujoma he said the lessening of tensions 
between east and west is a positive global development and said he 
hoped the rich countries of the world will not now build a new 
iron curtain between north and south that would lead to the 
marginalization of africa

illegal immigration along the southwestern 
border has surged in recent months reversing a threeyear downturn 
that began when the federal government told employers they could 
not hire undocumented workers 
according to figures from the immigration and naturalization 
service apprehensions of illegal aliens along the southwest border 
were up in each of the last 10 months compared with the same month 
a year ago 
ins spokesman verne jervis said the rise in apprehensions 
considered to be the best indicator of illegal immigration began 
in may 1989 and continued through february 
according to the ins figures apprehensions of illegal aliens 
were up 299 percent over the last 10 months compared with the 
same period a year ago apprehensions totaled 801937 over the 
period compared with 617317 from may 1988 through february 1989 
some months recorded surges of nearly 60 percent while in other 
months the increases dropped below 20 percent 
the last three months have been among the highest with 
apprehensions rising 573 percent in february from a year earlier 
by 396 percent in january 1990 from the previous january and by 
583 in december 1989 over the same month in 1988 
although the trend in apprehensions continued downward through 
the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the first six months of 
this fiscal year have seen an increase in apprehensions of 37 
percent over the same period a year ago 
apprehensions had begun dropping sharply in fiscal 1987 a year 
after congress passed and president reagan signed the immigration 
control and reform act of 1986 
the law made employers subject to civil and criminal sanctions 
for hiring undocumented workers 
jervis said the recent rise in illegal immigration may be due to 
the availablity of fradulent documents which undocumented workers 
use to obtain work or simply to the desperation of some 
mexicans seeking work in the united states 
jervis said the bush administrations budget for the fiscal year 
that begins oct 1 seeks an increase in money for the border patrol 
to 2892 million from the current 2626 million 
the administration wants to raise the number of border guards 
from 4852 to 4942

a house panel voted wednesday to restrict the 
sale and possession of usmade assault rifles and require a 
minimum 10year sentence for a person carrying such a weapon while 
committing a crime 
president bush last year banned import of the semiautomatic 
rifles the bill approved by the house judiciary subcommittee on 
crime would require the administration to extend the ban to 
domesticmade versions which the president determines have no 
sporting purpose 
subcommittee chairman bill hughes dnj said it makes no 
sense to ban imports and not the american assault weapons that 
account for twothirds of those in circulation 
theres no question but that assault weapons are being used 
with increased frequency by drug dealers criminals and mental 
incompetents to carry out acts of violence hughes said 
the term assault weapons refers to semiautomatic versions of 
automatic rifles originally developed for military use 
the bill would not affect the ownership or transfer of existing 
weapons and it would not apply to handguns 
the 10year minimum penalty would apply when an assault weapon 
is used or carried during a violent crime or drug crime 
the bill next goes to the full house judiciary committee

the state department on wednesday welcomed the 
resumption of food delivery to rebelheld territory in northern 
ethiopia but said only a small fraction of starving people are 
being reached 
eleven trucks carrying 120 tons of us donated food crossed 
tuesday from governmentheld territory to an area controlled by the 
tigrean peoples liberation front said state department deputy 
spokesman richard boucher 
a second convoy is expected to travel thursday 
we welcome the movement of this test convoy made possible by 
informal agreement among the warring parties in ethiopia boucher 
said the government of ethiopia its relief organization 
numerous private voluntary agencies and the concerned rebel groups 
each in their way deserve credit 
boucher said that 4 million to 5 million ethiopians face 
starvation but that only a small fraction of them will be reached 
whatever the success of the new operation 
there is an urgent necessity of opening other relief corridors 
and for the warring parties to give top priority to feeding the 
hungry he said 
boucher called for the reopening of the red sea port of massawa 
to food shipments and said internationally supervised food 
distributions should be made from there into eritrea the countrys 
northernmost province 
according to un estimates more than 1 million people are 
threatened with starvation in eritrea alone 
agreements must be reached for airlifts into affected areas as 
needed whether controlled by the government or by insurgents 
boucher said 
the relief effort is the first since eritrean rebels launched an 
offensive in early february and overran the port of massawa

in the eyes of the armys reserve 
officer training corps james m holobaugh went from being a model 
cadet to a reject by uttering three words i am gay 
now with the same kind of determination that made him a top 
rotc performer holobaugh is fighting the armys ban on homosexuals 
and and to receive the commission he earned 
holobaugh 24 was once held in such esteem by the army that he 
was chosen to appear in an rotc recruitment ad he was due to 
receive his army commission at washington university in st louis 
last may a year before graduation 
but after informing his superiors a month earlier that he had 
come to the realization he was gay no commission was forthcoming 
the pentagon regards homosexuals as unsuitable for military 
service the us supreme court recently dealt opponents of that 
policy a blow by refusing to hear two appeals of the pentagon 
policy 
the armys professor of military science at washington 
university in january recommended after a hearing that holobaugh be 
denied his commission and be required to repay his fouryear 
scholarship worth 25000 
a final decision is to be made by the commanding general of the 
army cadet command at fort monroe va an rotc spokesman said 
i was kind of surprised about the scholarship holobaugh an 
easygoing man with a ready smile said in an interview monday 
if i had flunked out of school i could understand but this was 
not for something i made a choice about i just am 
holobaugh is finishing his engineering studies at the university 
of new haven but will get his degree from washington in may before 
taking a job in new york city 
advised that years of lawsuits have been unsuccessful in 
changing the armed forces policy on homosexuals holobaugh decided 
last month that going public with his ordeal might be a more 
effective way to put pressure on the military 
the decision was not an easy one i just told my father the 
first week of february that i was gay and then bam im on 
television it was hard for him holobaugh said 
he said he has received letters of support from all over the 
country and planned to begin taking his case to college groups 
wednesday night at the massachusetts institute of technology on 
thursday he was scheduled to speak at harvard law school 
i feel now for the rest of my life there will be something 
ill be fighting for he said 
if schools begin kicking rotc off campus because of the defense 
departments ban of homosexuals the military might be swayed to 
change its policies in order to protect a program that each year 
turns out more than 70 percent of the armys junior officers 
holobaugh said 
holobaugh took part in just about all of rotcs extracurricular 
activities and earned seven as and one b in his military classes 
first at the university of missouri at rolla where he spent 2 
years and then at washington university 
a lot of people badmouth the army when youre in its like 
the thing to do but i knew i had chosen the right thing 
i thought it was a great opportunity to serve my country to 
get a lot of good experience as an officer and to finance my 
education he said adding that the army would have to sue him if 
it wants to collect any of the scholarship money 
holobaugh said he went through the process of accepting he was 
gay in late 1988 and early 1989 
he went to a captain for advice in april 1989 because he was 
deeply afraid he could be courtmartialed if they found out he was 
gay after he was already in the army the captain advised him to 
tell the truth and request he be denied his commission he followed 
the recommendations even though he said he wanted the commission 
later after talking with a private attorney he informed the army 
he wanted to fulfill his service obligations 
now that i look back on it im really glad i said something 
because i cant imagine going four years on active duty or eight in 
the reserves and trying to keep this secret he said

the republic of georgia postponed elections 
scheduled sunday to introduce a multiparty system and give 
opposition parties time to organize their campaigns against the 
ruling communists 
the republics ruling supreme soviet parliament decided late 
tuesday to postpone the elections a spokesman for the opposition 
peoples front valerian khukhunasvili said the decision was made 
after intense negotiations between the communist party chief and 
the head of the peoples front 
the official soviet news agency tass said the elections would be 
held in october or november and that current legislators would 
continue in their offices until then 
the georgian supreme soviet also abolished an article in the 
republics constitution granting the communist party a monopoly on 
political power tass said the move echoed the national 
legislatures vote last week to end the unchallenged role of the 
communist party 
the amended georgian constitution gives all political parties 
and public organizations the right to take part in working out 
the policies of the government in managing government and public 
affairs 
the peoples front was instrumental in pressing for the change 
and has spearheaded the republics fight for independence 
on march 9 the georgian parliament condemned what it said was 
the republics forced annexation by the soviet union in the 1920s 
and demanded negotiations on restoring independence 
two days later the baltic republic of lithuania declared itself 
independent which the soviet government refuses to accept 
proindependence groups have scored significant victories in 
local elections this year in lithuania and the two other baltic 
republics estonia and latvia 
proindependence parties in georgia including the peoples 
front have been pushing for secession for more than a year the 
parties have used mass demonstrations to press for independence 
on april 9 1989 soviet soldiers moved against a crowd of 
peaceful demonstrators in the republics capital of tbilisi 
killing 19 a patrol later shot another person for violating curfew

the state department accused the burmese 
government wednesday of engaging in arbitrary interference in 
the lives of many burmese citizens by forcibly removing them from 
their homes 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said burmese military 
authorities have relocated often on short notice residents of 
some burmese cities particularly rangoon to new areas outside 
those locations 
in many cases the new housing areas are illprepared lacking 
sanitary and other facilities and are isolated by distance and 
lack of regular transport he said 
while some of those being forcibly relocated appear to be 
squatters we understand that many are legitimate owners of houses 
and property 
there have been reports of deaths as a result of the 
relocations most appear to have taken place in areas where there 
has been strong antigovernment sentiment he said 
whatever the motives for the relocations they appear to have 
been carried out without due regard for the interest safety and 
rights of those involved boucher said 
we call upon the burmese military regime to respect the 
fundamental and legitimate civil rights of the burmese people 
including refraining from arbitrary interference in their lives and 
property

ive learned to live with the fact that im one of the chosen 
outcasts he said in a coarse morningafter rumble 
bryant who has been homeless since 1972 said he is a korean 
war veteran and a master carpenter he smokes marijuana and drinks 
but ascribes his plight to a society that wont accept 
nonconformity 
like others in the shelter he was approached earlier in the 
evening by the census takers he laughs when asked about it 
i truly believe the government is like everyone else they 
have good intentions but no direction its like everything the 
government does it gets so involved and so complicated that very 
little good comes out of it 
he is asked about his future

weakening said reynolds who received just 14 percent of the vote 
when he ran against savage in 1988 
other victors in tuesdays election included secretary of state 
jim edgar whose campaign for the gop gubernatorial nomination over 
an abortion foe drew support from the white house he faces 
attorney general neil hartigan who was unopposed in the democratic 
primary fourterm republican gov james r thompson is retiring

probe that forced out speaker jim wright last year won his first 
try at political office in a tough fourway democratic race for 
cook county board president

blackoriented weekly newspaper said savage has been hurt by a 
finding by the house ethics committee that the congressman had made 
improper sexual advances to a peace corps worker during a trip last 
year to zaire

percent of the vote but thats whats amazing he keeps getting 
elected just barely 
clay said savages support comes mostly from poor blacks in the 
district which covers the citys south side and some suburbs

the senate today narrowly defeated an attempt 
to toughen controls on urban smog as part of a compromise clean air 
bill it was the third major defeat for environmentalists seeking 
to strengthen the nations main air pollution law 
the vote was 53 to 46 
opponents of the smogcontrol measure including senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine argued the overall bill under 
consideration already is a big improvement over current federal law 
and that stronger provisions could block passage this year 
sen john kerry dmass a key sponsor of the proposal argued 
the amendment was needed to assure clean air in many of the cities 
that today suffer from the worst smog problems 
the amendment would have preserved the federal governments 
authority to impose an air pollution reduction plan if states and 
local officials fail to act it also would eliminate exemptions for 
some industrial polluters and broaden the smogcontrolling curbs to 
include smaller polluters 
the vote was the third major setback for environmentalists in 
the clean air debate 
by a 5246 vote tuesday night the senate defeated a proposal to 
require tougher tailpipeemission controls on automobiles greater 
use of clean fuels by fleet operators and production of 1 million 
cars capable of burning alternative fuels 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
defeated amendment a prescription for deadlock on the clean air 
bill 
do we want 13 more years of speeches or do we want a bill do 
we want to make statements or do we want to make law mitchell 
said 
still unresolved was a proposal to give federal aid to coal 
miners who would lose their jobs as a result of the clean air 
measure a plan described by senate leaders as a deal breaker 
sen robert c byrd dwva is seeking 700 million in aid for 
the miners over four years if they lose their jobs because of 
tougher acid rain controls at coalburning powerplants in the 
midwest 
the white house contends the assistance is too expensive 
sen timothy wirth dcolo said tuesday that byrd appears to 
have a majority of the votes for his proposal however an aide 
to mitchell said it was uncertain whether the amendment would pass 
if it came to a vote 
white house officials and senate leaders were trying to work out 
a compromise with byrd 
byrd for more than a decade has fought additional controls on 
sulfur dioxide from utility plants because such curbs would 
threaten the jobs of thousands of coal miners including many in 
west virginia where highsulfur coal predominates 
the clean air bill would set tough new pollution controls on 
industry and automobiles to reduce urban smog cut toxic chemical 
emissions from industry and require electric utilities to reduce 
sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of the 
decade 
the auto pollution control amendment was sponsored by wirth and 
sen pete wilson rcalif wirth argued his amendment was needed 
because autos are the biggest source of pollution in our cities 
but senators backing the compromise bill insisted that passage 
of the tougher controls would threaten the legislation it will 
bust the deal with the white house said sen max baucus dmont 
the vote on the wirth amendment revealed some of the maneuvering 
on the bill sen steven symms ridaho was among some senators 
who voted for the tougher controls after arguing vigorously against 
the legislation for weeks 
senate sources suggested that symms and other senators hoped to 
cripple the compromise bill by adding an amendment the white house 
would not accept 
environmentalists meanwhile said that while a number of votes 
are expected on other amendments intended to strengthen the clean 
air bill the tougher auto pollution curbs were a top priority 
daniel weiss of the sierra club accused the administration of 
ramming down the throats of the senate a bill that does not go 
far enough to control urban smog 
the vote was a good deal for general motors and a terrible 
deal for the general public said gene karpinski of the us 
public interest research group 
the automakers strongly opposed the tougher pollution controls 
saying they would be required to manufacture alternativefuel cars 
that customers might not want to buy the measure also would 
require automakers to meet new tailpipe standards by the year 2003 
although they say the technology to accomplish that does not exist

a codefendant prosecutors say could tie manuel 
noriega directly to drug payoffs has agreed in principle to plead 
guilty to a drug conspiracy count his attorney said wednesday 
luis del cid 46 was a lieutenant colonel in the panamanian 
military and a top aide to noriega when the two were captured 
during the us invasion in december 
del cid acted as a liason and money courier between drug 
traffickers and manuel antonio noriega the us attorneys 
office has said 
his defense attorney samuel burstyn said he negotiated with 
the government almost from the time of del cids capture but only 
recently settled on a plea bargain 
final details of the deal should go before a federal judge soon 
burstyn said 
there is an agreement in principle burstyn said its in 
the process of being reduced to writing 
a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office diane cossin said 
she could not confirm the deal 
we do not deal in speculation and have not announced the plea 
agreement she said we dont discuss business until it is 
completed 
burstyn refused to say if del cid will take the stand against 
noriega but such understandings are normal in most plea 
agreements and previously burstyn has said that a guilty plea 
would permit the prosecution to subpoena his client and would 
prevent del cid from using the fifth amendment to avoid testifying 
noriegas attorney steven kollin did not immediately return 
phone calls from the associated press when the possibility of a 
del cid deal was first reported last month kollin said his client 
would be unhurt as long as del cid tells the truth 
burstyn said one of the key sticking points in the negotiations 
was del cids probable prison term under the indictment del cid 
faced a possible 70 years in prison and after his capture he 
rejected an initial prosecution offer of 40 years in return for a 
guilty plea 
under the agreement finally reached he would face a maximum 10 
years in prison on the single conspiracy count but is unlikely to 
serve that long burstyn said 
theres no time limit in the agreement but i believe hell 
serve no more than 2 years the attorney said 
del cid is accused in a february 1988 indictment of accepting 
200000 in cocainetrafficking profits from drug pilot floyd 
carlton caceres now the prosecutions chief witness carlton and 
noriega had agreed to the price during a december 1983 meeting the 
indictment alleges 
later that month carlton delivered the money intended for 
noriega to del cid at the headquarters of the panamanian defense 
forces in panama city the pilot continued to deal with noriega 
and prosecutors have said that shows the money was indeed passed on 
to the panamanian leader 
the defense previously has disputed some prosecution claims that 
del cid was a key aide to noriega forcing the us attorneys 
office to acknowledge he was not head of panamanian intelligence 
as they first claimed 
but prosecutors in turn showed a picture of del cid and noriega 
at a meeting with cuban leader fidel castro a meeting the 
indictment says was intended to mediate a dispute between the 
panamanian leader and the medellin drug cartel that paid him 46 
million and bribes 
if the plea bargain is approved del cid will be the second of 
the six defendants in custody to plead guilty drug pilot eduardo 
pardo has already pleaded guilty to flying 800000 in cocaine 
profits from fort lauderdale to panama in may 1983 and is awaiting 
sentencing 
also in custody is accused colombian cocaine trafficker william 
saldarriaga free on bond are another pilot daniel miranda and an 
accused minor trafficker brian alden davidow all three have 
pleaded innocent

the federal budget deficit totaled 9752 
billion for the first five months of fiscal year 1990 just 248 
billion less than the grammrudman deficit target for the entire 
year the government said wednesday 
the treasury department said the deficit last month was 3642 
billion 301 percent above the 2787 billion imbalance in 
february 1989 
receipts totaled 6517 billion in february up 53 percent from 
the same month last year but expenditures amounted to 10158 
billion a 132 percent increase over february 1989 
the revenues werent so bad but the expenditures were way 
up said economist michael k evans head of a washington 
forecasting firm essentially expenditures have not been under 
control all year long 
it was the significant acceleration in federal spending in 
february that allowed the deficit to widen here agreed william 
v sullivan jr director of money market research at dean witter 
reynolds inc in new york 
the february deficit followed a 942 billion surplus in 
january the first for the fiscal year that started oct 1 
evans and sullivan noted that the grammrudman target for fiscal 
1990 has all but been abandoned with evans suggesting the actual 
imbalance for the year will total 160 billion to 165 billion 
unless theres a miracle well come in ahead of last year 
which was 152 billion evans said 
that means we have got to look for an improvement of almost 
90 billion in the budget in fiscal year 1991 to meet the 
grammrudman target of 64 billion sullivan added thats a 
virtual impossibility 
the 1990 deficit through february was 53 percent above that for 
the first five months of fiscal 1989 receipts were up 56 percent 
to 39348 billion for the period while outlays were up 55 
percent to 49099 billion 
as usual the biggest spending categories in february were for 
the military social security and other programs in the department 
of health and human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 2426 billion in february and 11678 
billion so far this year it is projected to total 28679 billion 
for the entire fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 2051 billion for the 
month and 9904 billion for the year so far they are expected to 
total 24459 billion for the year 
other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid totaled 
1554 billion for february and 7525 billion so far they are 
projected to cost 19117 billion for the year 
interest on the national debt totaled 1732 billion during 
february and 11173 billion so far this year it is expected to 
total 25485 billion for the year

after six weeks of testimony the case 
of former exxon valdez captain joseph hazelwood has gone to the 
jury 
the exxon valdez rammed bligh reef in alaskas prince william 
sound on march 24 1989 spilling almost 11 million gallons of 
alaska crude oil and devastating fisheries and wildlife 
hazelwood is charged with criminal mischief reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil in the grounding if convicted he could receive 
7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
the prosecution contends hazelwood was drunk and reckless while 
in charge of the exxon valdez and risked his ship and crew before 
and after the grounding the defense counters that his judgment was 
not impaired he showed no signs of inebriation and he gave prudent 
commands to protect the safety of ship and crew 
here are some key points raised by the two sides in hazelwoods 
trial 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
prosecution hazelwood was reckless in leaving the bridge in 
control of the third mate during a hazardous transit 
defense it is part of the captains job to delegate 
responsibility another captain testified that he does not consider 
prince william sound hazardous he had left the bridge of his 
vessel in the same area and there is no regulation requiring the 
captain to be on the bridge during the transit 
 
prosecution the third mate left in charge of the bridge had no 
license to pilot the ship within prince william sound hazelwood 
was the only one aboard who had such a license 
defense another captain testified he didnt have a pilots 
license for prince william sound and believed there was no 
requirement for a pilot to be aboard a ship transiting that area 
he cited a letter from the alaska maritime agency advising 
captains in 1986 of a change in pilotage requirements 
 
prosecution chief mate james kunkel testified he warned 
hazelwood that helmsman robert kagan needed practice in 
steering and required special supervision in even the 
simplest tasks 
defense kunkel also said kagan was capable of executing a 
simple 10degree right rudder turn the missed turn that would 
have steered the tanker away from the reef another witness said 
the order was so simple it could have been executed by a 5yearold 
 
prosecution hazelwood told the third mate gregory cousins to 
divert the tanker from normal shipping lanes to avoid ice but 
never gave specific steering directions as a result cousins wound 
up racing between the chart room and the radar screen trying to 
work out the proper maneuver and had no time to keep an eye on 
kagan 
defense hazelwood left clear instruction for the iceavoidance 
maneuver and if the instructions had been followed the valdez 
would have cleared bligh reef when hazelwood asked cousins if he 
felt comfortable with what he had to do cousins replied in the 
affirmative 
 
prosecution hazelwood risked the lives of crew members by not 
ringing a general alarm and letting them sleep through the disaster 
defense kunkel said they discussed abandoning ship but feared 
there would be panic and that putting the crew in oilpolluted 
water in the middle of the night was riskier he said hazelwood 
gave orders to wake the crew by going from cabin to cabin 
 
prosecution hazelwood risked the crew and ship when he 
recklessly tried to extricate the grounded tanker off bligh reef by 
frantically revving the engines and maneuvering the rudder without 
having sufficient information to determine the vessels stability 
hazelwood told the coast guard he was trying to get off the reef 
defense hazelwoods maneuvers after the grounding were 
professional attempts to stabilize the ship he was not trying to 
move or extricate it the point became all but moot when the judge 
ruled the ship was incapable of moving anywhere and could not have 
sunk as prosecution witnesses claimed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
prosecution hazelwood had five drinks and spent perhaps seven 
hours in a bar drinking before sailing 
defense hazelwood had two or three drinks and spent only three 
hours in the bar 
 
prosecution three witnesses two of them coast coast 
investigators said they smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath 
crew members saw hazelwood drinking in valdez that day before they 
sailed 
defense crew members testified that hazelwood negotiated a 
precarious gangplank to the ship without a misstep and appeared 
sober as he gave orders defense suggested hazelwood drank a 
lowalcohol brew while on the ship accounting for the alcohol 
smell 
 
prosecution an expert using a method called retrograde 
extrapolation concluded that hazelwoods level of intoxication at 
the time of the shipwreck was 14 percent based on blood and urine 
tests taken 10 hours afterward at the time of the test hazelwood 
had a blood alcohol level of 061 percent the legal limit for 
driving a car in alaska is 10 percent 
defense the retroactive test is only useful for periods of 23 
hours after an incident and if hazelwood drank anything after the 
accident the results of such an extrapolation would be invalid 
their experts called the calculations nonsense 
 
prosecution one could hear that hazelwood was drunk by the rate 
and pitch of his voice on a tape made by the coast guard when the 
ship went aground 
defense a taperecording expert said the tape was a poor copy 
that did not accurately reflect hazelwoods voice the witness also 
said that while slurred speech might be an indication of 
drunkenness changes in the rate of speech or pitch were not

months the keepers of the clock said getwell cards addressed to 
big ben arrived from all over the world

operating a vessel while intoxicated and other offenses in 
connection with last years catastrophic alaska oil spill 
the jurors were not told for example that hazelwood has a 
history of drunken driving convictions and participated in an 
alcohol rehabilitation program this was held to be inadmissible 
evidence 
in addition because hazelwood is being tried under state law 
the jury did not hear that his blood alcohol level of 061 taken

many of the newly elected east german 
lawmakers may have collaborated with the former secret police and 
all deputies should be closely investigated before taking their 
seats in parliament officials said wednesday 
bishop gottfried forck urged all east german parties to conduct 
such investigations by next week before parliaments first session 
werner fischer charged by the outgoing government with 
supervising the secret polices dismantling said there were 
growing indications many secret police informers were among the 
newly elected lawmakers east germany held its first free election 
for the new 400member parliament on sunday 
the indications have reached such a dimension that they cannot 
be ignored fischer told the associated press 
forck said he met west german president richard von weizsaecker 
in west berlin on wednesday to discuss the revelations 
both forck and weizsaeckers office said the talks were 
confidential and refused to discuss details 
fischer said indications that agents of the secret of the 
police known as stasi might have infiltrated east german 
political parties were evident before sundays vote but he said 
his office decided not to make them public to avoid disrupting the 
balloting 
after the peaceful popular revolt that toppled the hardline 
communist leadership in october the interim government began 
dismantling the hated secret police stasi had 85000 agents and 
tens of thousands of informers 
the secret police force was a major part of the communist 
apparatus that controlled all walks of life for 40 years and many 
people were intimidated into becoming its helpers 
rainer eppelmann chairman of one of the three parties in the 
alliance that won sunday said as many as 40 of the newly elected 
lawmakers might have been secret police agents 
in an interview with west germanys masscirculation newspaper 
bild eppelmann alleged that four elected deputies from erfurt had 
been secret police agents 
eppelmann became leader of democratic awakening party last week 
after the groups former chairman wolfgang schnur admitted he had 
been a longtime secret police informer 
eppelmann said he was convinced that former stasi collaborators 
are sitting in other political parties as well 
forck said church officials prosecutors and representatives of 
political parties should be present when the secret police files 
are opened forck said it would be up to the parties to decide if 
deputies found to have been secret police informers should give up 
their seats 
he said the results of the probe should be kept confidential 
fischer said there were clear indications that some former 
secret police agents were now being employed by west german 
intelligence but forck said these were only rumors 
lutz stavenhagen the bonn government intelligence services 
coordinator denied that west german intelligence was taking over 
former stasi agents 
it is a clear policy of west german intelligence not to employ 
former stasi agents he said 
ralf bachmann deputy spokesman for the outgoing government in 
east berlin said the decision whether to make secret police files 
public should be left to the new parliament 
helmut lueck spokesman for the christian democrats the 
conservative winner of sundays election called for a church 
commission to probe the new deputies for any links to the former 
secret police

after sending 15000 workers into camps and caves streets and 
shelters the census bureau declared success wednesday in its 
firstever tally of the nations homeless but critics found fresh 
ammunition to charge that the special census failed to do its job 
census workers many of them homeless themselves endured 
gunfire robbery insults and foul weather to count the number of 
americans with no fixed address past guesses have ranged from 
250000 to 3 million 
the results wont be announced until late 1991 and the debate 
over the census will continue until then and beyond it was framed 
again wednesday by two men on opposite sides of the country 
its just the people in their ivory tower drinking their mint 
juleps and counting noses said george whitney a resident of 
baloney joes shelter in portland ore nobody can help the 
homeless because nobody understands the problem 
in new york dwayne mays stood up for the census in which he 
participated both as a counter and as one of the counted he too 
is homeless 
hopefully it will let people realize there is a whole 
population of homeless people that is not dehumanized still 
maintains selfrespect and selfesteem that is living in 
conditions that are abhorrent mays said were here and we 
are counted now 
not all the homeless were counted though even by the census 
bureaus assessment in some cases homeless people avoided the 
census takers in others they were apparently overlooked 
in manchester nh census takers failed to count a man who was 
sleeping on the steps of city hall he was outside their survey 
area 
in san diego county calif a group of farmworkers in a migrant 
camp said a team of census enumerators walked past them without 
stopping to count 
in new york city reporters watched census workers mill around a 
newsstand on the ground floor of the port authority bus terminal 
apparently avoiding the upper floors where hundreds of homeless 
sleep census officials insisted they had canvassed the entire 
station 
the census bureau spent 27 million on the homeless count 
which it carried out between 6 pm tuesday and 8 am wednesday in 
every city with a population over 50000 
in several cities census workers said homeless people had 
vanished from their usual spots apparently to avoid the government 
that tells us something said don weese manager of the 
census bureau office in tulsa okla it tells us theres a large 
segment of that homeless population that simply does not want to be 
recognized known or encountered at all 
still the officials defended their effort and said it would 
provide a valuable snapshot of the state of the homeless 
the issue is politically important because federal money goes to 
cities and states on the basis of population urban leaders have 
been fuming for a decade saying the census bureau ignored most of 
the homeless in the 1980 census 
shelter and street night appears to have been a success 
census bureau director barbara bryant said i believe our efforts 
have given us a good start on achieving our goal of a full and fair 
census of the american people 
ms bryant conceded that census workers had missed some shelters 
and other homeless hangouts and would have to try again wednesday 
night in a handful of cities they included washington new york 
philadelphia and cleveland 
critics found nothing in the tally to change their view 
you cant use this census with any degree of legitimacy 
said mitch snyder an advocate for the homeless in washington 
politicians can use these figures to say anything that they want 
because theres no way that you can legitimately count how many 
homeless people that are in this city or in this country 
for the most part the census was carried out as planned there 
were some frightening moments however 
in new york city a group of census workers scattered when a 
gunshot was fired from a building they were approaching in 
brooklyn they werent injured and census officials said it wasnt 
clear whether they were the targets 
in oklahoma city police turned back two census workers who 
unwittingly stumbled onto a stakeout 
they were just told the bad guys are loose and it wasnt 
pursuant to what those two were doing and to take a hike said 
john prince a local census official 
in fort lauderdale fla two census workers were robbed at 
knifepoint by a man in a homeless shelter neither was injured 
the mishaps underscored the unenviable nature of the task ms 
bryant the census director said she hoped the first homeless 
census also would be the last 
i hope that the numbers we got last night and the 
characteristics of the people we found will provide the information 
that program planners need to solve this problem she said our 
goal is not to be out there in the year 2000

the supreme court said wednesday that states 
may not require people who appear before a grand jury to keep their 
testimony a secret forever 
the court ruled unanimously that such a florida law similar to 
those in 15 other states violated freespeech rights 
the invalidated florida law barred grand jury witnesses from 
disclosing their testimony even after the investigation ended 
the justices were told that alabama arizona indiana kentucky 
louisiana michigan mississippi missouri nevada north carolina 
north dakota south dakota texas utah and washington have 
similarly restrictive laws 
the federal government and most states impose no disclosure 
restrictions on grand jury witnesses apparently not even while an 
investigation is in progress 
but the new decision does not affect state laws that bar people 
from disclosing their grand jury testimony while the secret panels 
investigation is active 
grand juries are presented evidence by prosecutors who seek to 
have charges filed against criminal suspects it is up to the grand 
jury to decide whether charges should be filed and its proceedings 
are conducted in secret to spare the reputations of presumably 
innocent people 
the interests advanced by the portion of the florida statute 
struck down are not sufficient to overcome a witness first 
amendment right to make a truthful statement of information 
lawfully obtained chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for the 
court 
the ban extends not merely to the life of the grand jury but 
into the indefinite future he said 
jane kirtley of the reporters committee for the freedom of the 
press said the decision will help journalists who want to interview 
grand jury witnesses 
the court recognized that this kind of statute is an 
overwhelming restraint that could not withstand constitutional 
scrutiny she said 
michael smith a former reporter for the charlotte heraldnews 
in charlotte county fla wants to write a news story and possibly 
a book about a 1986 grand jury investigation into allegations of 
corruption in the county sheriffs department and the local state 
attorneys office 
he testified before that grand jury which ended its 
investigation in 1986 and issued no indictments 
smith now a national guard sergeant at fort indiantown gap in 
annville pa was called by the county grand jury to testify about 
stories he had written about the alleged corruption 
the grand jury itself is kind of an inquisition process he 
said wednesday if witnesses arent allowed to say what they did 
or heard in there then you not only have an inquisition but an 
inquisition operating in the dark 
george waas the assistant attorney general who handled the 
case said the decision will clear up any confusion about the 
validity of such openended secrecy laws 
our opinion is that its an issue that needed to be clarified 
and now it has been he said 
smith challenged the florida secrecy law because he feared he 
could be prosecuted for revealing his grand jury testimony 
a federal judge threw out smiths suit but the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals ruled for smith wednesdays decision 
upheld the appeals court ruling 
in a separate decision the justices ruled unanimously in 
another florida case that migrant farm workers injured on the job 
may sue their employers in federal court even after receiving 
worker compensation benefits

an advocacy group said it filed a lawsuit 
wednesday against the maker of an allegedly defective heart valve 
that has been implanted in the chests of more than 80000 people 
public citizen asked the court to order shiley inc and its 
parent company pfizer inc to notify all those who have had the 
valve implanted about alleged defects and possible lifethreatening 
consequences if it fails 
the suit also asked that the companies pay for psychological 
counseling and medical consultation to advise these people of the 
risks and benefits of having the valve removed the symptoms of 
valve failure and emergency steps to be taken if those symptoms 
occur 
the group founded by consumer activist ralph nader filed the 
lawsuit in los angeles county superior court shileys principal 
offices are in california 
pfizer based in new york said the suit is completely without 
merit and will frighten cardiac patients unnecessarily and 
ultimately do much more harm than good 
pfizer said the valves have saved the lives of tens of 
thousands of patients all but a small fraction of 1 percent of 
these valves continue to function properly 
the device is called the bjorkshiley concavoconvex heart 
valve also known as the shiley valve it was implanted in more 
than 80000 people including about 40000 in the united states 
the food and drug administration approved the valve in april 
1979 but after reports of malfunctions shiley removed it from the 
market in november 1986 
the company has reported to the fda nearly 400 failures of the 
valve 248 of which resulted in death 
the valve consists of a disc inside a metal ring covered by a 
teflon sewing ring that is sutured to the heart to hold the valve 
in place the disc pivoting on two thin metal struts opens to 
allow blood to flow through and then closes 
the malfunctions have involved fractures of the struts when a 
fracture occurs the disc escapes from the ring allowing an 
uncontrollable blood flow through the heart 
the lawsuit alleged that pfizer and shiley were aware of 
problems with the valve but engaged in a course of conduct 
designed to prevent the true facts regarding the risks created by 
the implantation of the defective valves from being known and to 
shield themselves from legal liability through deliberate 
concealment of material facts 
pfizer said in a statement it notified all physicians who have 
implanted the valves of the very small fracture risk and 
advised them to educate and monitor their patients 
we believe this is the proper and most effective way to 
communicate with patients about such a sensitive medical issue 
the company said it added that the fda has endorsed this method of 
communication 
but public citizen said that surgeons who implant the valves 
do not orinarily follow their patients for more than a few weeks 
after surgery the lawsuit also alleged that pfizers letters 
failed to contain accurate and complete information about the 
risks posed by the valves

a convoy of trucks unloaded at 
least 110 tons of food for famine victims wednesday after safely 
passing through wartorn northern ethiopia 
the 11 trucks arrived tuesday night in kobo in the wollo 
province after leaving the provincial capital of dessie at dawn on 
a 75mile journey over mountainous roads through contested 
territory 
the convoy was the first relief effort since early february 
when a rebel offensive closed a red sea port being used to unload 
supplies 
the state department on wednesday welcomed the resumption of 
food delivery to rebelheld territory but said only a small 
fraction of starving people are being reached 
sponsors of the convoy hope to feed about one million people in 
the provinces of wollo tigre and southern eritrea until next 
december when the harvest is due 
the united nations estimates that more than 4 million people in 
northern ethiopia are in danger of starvation caused by drought and 
war 
we are excited we think the whole trip was a success said 
hamed bahget deputy director of catholic relief services in 
ethiopias capital addis ababa there was no hitch 
the trip was completed without a formal ceasefire between the 
government and the tigre peoples liberation front which has 
controlled much of wollo province since late last year 
both sides have promised safety for the convoys operated by a 
consortium of ethiopian church groups with money and food donations 
mostly from the united states and western europe 
privately relief workers say the promise of safe passage could 
be revoked at any time because of either error or suspicion that 
the convoys are being used to smuggle war material 
the tigreans have been fighting since 1975 to oust president 
mengistu haile mariam and establish a government similar to 
albania the last orthodox communist government in eastern europe 
the trucks are scheduled to return to dressie on thursday when 
a second convoy will leave for another town in wollo or tigre 
the church groups hope to extend their distribution network from 
wollo and tigre into southern eritrea 
eritrea the countrys northernmost province is largely 
controlled by another larger rebel group the secessionist eritrea 
peoples liberation front the united nations says more than one 
million people are threatened with starvation in eritrea alone 
the ethiopian government and tigre rebels on wednesday began a 
third round of preliminary talks aimed at ending their 15yearold 
conflict 
the italian foreign ministry an observer at the meetings said 
the talks centered on the composition of the delegations the 
agenda for fullfledged negotiations and ways to end the fighting 
the government delegation was headed by deputy prime minister 
ashagre ygletu meles zenawi president of the tigre peoples 
liberation front led the rebel delegation 
earlier talks were held in rome on nov 411 and dec 1219 the 
current session is aimed at achieving fullscale peace negotiations 
to be presided over by italy and kenya

a bush administration official said wednesday 
that more federal money should not be pumped in to expand drug and 
alcohol abuse treatment programs until existing resources are 
targeted more effectively 
dr beny primm who heads the office of treatment improvement in 
the department of health and human services said his office is 
trying to determine how much treatment is now available and how 
many people want it before figuring whether more money is needed 
many of the treatment slots go unoccupied he said while 
people in other areas can wait for months to enter programs 
primm appeared at a news conference with officials of the 
national association of state alcohol and drug abuse directors 
which released a report calling for the federal government to 
nearly triple the 13 billion it now sends to the states for 
treatment programs 
primm said he agrees with the associations view that treatment 
of alcohol and drug abuse is effective but he said the existing 
public treatment network must be coordinated better to distribute 
more efficiently available resources 
if a needs assessment indicates a great need for treatment to 
be expanded and there are handles on what is now provided then we 
are willing to make those recommendations he said 
john gustafson president of the association said dr primm 
and i clearly disagree 
the group estimates that more than 10 million people in the 
united states need alcohol and other drug treatment and that 44 
states and the district of columbia have waiting lists totaling 
66766 people primm however said he did not know what those 
figures were based on 
primm said cities need a central referral unit that can match 
treatment openings with those seeking treatment also needed are 
new techniques to assess needs and demand a massive effort to 
show that treatment works and efforts to attract highquality 
workers and to make treatment more acceptable in the community he 
said 
primm also said he was concerned that several cities in the 
northeast had not yet asked to receive the funds they were awarded 
under a 100 million twoyear program designed to make more 
treatment available in areas that have long waiting lists for their 
publicly funded programs the cities had specified that they had 
waiting lists of more than 500 people he said 
i dont know what the reason is he said something is the 
matter and its not the federal government 
the program can fund 21535 treatment slots but cities have 
requested funds for only about 19000 placements he said 
he declined to identify the cities saying it would premature 
since he did not yet know why they havent tapped the funds

nasa reacting to criticism about the number 
of astronaut space walks that will be needed to maintain the 
proposed space station said wednesday it will review its 
requirements and report the results to congress 
nasa said that on friday it will review the status of an ongoing 
study of the spacewalk requirements the announcement made no 
reference to two articles in the new york times this week that 
prompted the review 
on monday the times reported that an internal nasa 
investigation showed 2200 hours of space walks would be required 
each year 5 times as long as all us space walks to date it 
said the study found the station could not be built as designed 
because its parts would begin to break down before the station was 
completed in the late 1990s 
on wednesday the newspaper quoted dr william fisher a 
coleader of a nasa investigative panel as challenging his bosses 
for saying the findings were a worst case scenario fisher an 
astronaut said his team had been done a disservice by implication 
its efforts were somehow not credible simply because the results 
are unpopular 
fisher said our ongoing investigation may well show the 
problem to be even greater than our preliminary figures would 
indicate 
nasa said richard h truly the agencys administrator will 
conduct fridays review others taking part in addition to fisher 
will include charles price the other coleader william lenoir 
who heads nasas space flight program richard kohrs director of 
the space station program and officials from the johnson space 
center

with californias drought entering its fourth 
year the largest water agency supplying southern california wants 
mandatory conservation rules banning driveway washing daytime lawn 
watering and car washing 
even if we had rain of biblical proportions we couldnt get 
back to normal this year bob gomperz spokesman for the 
metropolitan water district said wednesday 
the district imports water into the desertlike region by 
aqueducts from the colorado river and northern california and 
sells it wholesale to 27 smaller water districts 
the agency supplies more than 500 billion gallons yearly to the 
13 million residents of a sixcounty area containing 300 
communities from ventura county to the mexico border the area 
includes los angeles and san diego 
californias rainy season is just about over mountain snowpack 
levels are running at less than 63 percent of normal and river 
runoff is 35 percent of normal the states cooperative snow survey 
reports 
most of the season is over already the thing is cast now 
its grim said the surveys jack pardee 
runoff in the sierra nevada range fell to 63 percent of normal 
in 1987 60 percent of normal in 1988 and 64 percent last year so 
far in 1990 the runoff has been 63 percent 
the region also has lost some of the water it took from the 
colorado river water as arizona has begun using more of its 
entitlement from the heavily allocated river the projected 
reduction was about 300000 acrefeet or approximately the amount 
used by 700000 households annually 
there is a possibility that southern california could 
experience shortages even with normal precipitation for the 
rest of the year said district general manager carl boronkay 
if the shortage is as serious as i think it is then its 
time we all got serious and began mandatory programs to cut 
usage boronkay said 
if communities begin watersaving measures immediately most of 
the region could avoid being forced to take such drastic steps as 
have been taken in santa barbara northwest of los angeles where 
watering lawns is now illegal 
statewide several communities have resorted to rationing 
monterey county on the central coast is holding consumers to 80 
percent of their past consumption rate santa clara county 
southeast of san francisco has rationed water at 75 percent of 
normal the central valley water project has cut the flow of water 
up to 50 percent 
and el dorado county including part of the sierra nevada east 
of sacramento has banned new water connections 
the metropolitan water district estimates that supplies could 
fall short of demand by up to 12 percent in the coming year the 
agency also warned that mandatory water rationing may be necessary 
if there isnt some improvement next year 
conservation measures it wants to impose include banning hosing 
down driveways watering lawns during daylight washing cars and 
serving water in restaurants without a customer request 
but the los angeles department of water and power which gets 
about half its water from the district doesnt feel those measures 
will be enough to alleviate shortages it also gets water from 
wells 
were on the borderline of mandatory rationing said dwp 
engineer dennis williams the city of los angeles could very well 
have mandatory rationing 
the city already has a mandatory conservation law like the one 
requested by the water district its been on the books since the 
drought of 1977 and could be activated by the city council at any 
time

the bush administration has endorsed an 
international agreement to control the export and disposal of 
hazardous waste the white house said wednesday 
the united nations basel convention on controlling crossborder 
shipments of hazardous waste prohibits such shipments unless the 
exporting country does not have the technical capability or 
adequate facilities to dispose of it it also allows export for 
recycling 
the convention covers household and infectious wastes and 
municipal incinerator residue as well as hazardous waste 
an anaylst for natural resources defense council an 
environmental group called the convention a modest first step 
toward ending dumping of waste from industrial countries on third 
world countries 
we believe that trade must end anything short of a treaty to 
end all trade is unacceptable said jane bloom senior attorney 
for nrdc 
the united states has a separate agreement covering exports of 
us hazardous waste to mexico and canada 
president bush said a year ago that hazardous waste would be 
exported from the united states only to countries that agreed to 
handle it in an environmentally safe manner 
bush will send congress legislation to implement both that 
policy and the basel accord 
the 1989 basel convention signed by 46 countries was the first 
of its kind calling for keeping crossborder hazardous waste 
shipments to a minimum 
the senate must ratify the treaty which bars waste exports to 
antarctica for bushs endorsement to become policy the policy 
intends to cut down on using african and other third world 
countries as dumping grounds 
environmental groups however have complained that it legalizes 
the international waste trade and that it was weakened to please 
industrialized countries 
the basel agreement says waste exports are to be barred if there 
is reason to believe the importing country will not manage them in 
an environmentally sound manner countries through which waste 
shipments pass must be notified and give written consent 
the agreement says that a country can export such waste if it 
does not have the technical capacity facilities or sites to 
dispose of it in an environmentally sound and efficient manner the 
white house said

oregons klamath river is the most endangered 
river in the nation because of a proposed power project that 
threatens one of the nations oustanding whitewater recreational 
rivers an environmental group said wednesday 
the diversion of the klamath to generate power would also 
threaten several endangered species and sacred native american 
sites american rivers said in a report ranking on the nations 10 
most endangered rivers 
the nonprofit group which works to protect river shorelines 
and block construction of some dams followed the klamath with 
colorados south platte river which was ranked as the most 
endangered in 1988 and 1989 
the penobscot river in maine and the american river in 
california were next on the list the others were the bruneau and 
jarbidge rivers idaho the alsek and tatshenshini rivers alaska 
and canada passaic river new jersey cahaba river alabama jemez 
river new mexico and james river missouri 
we are noticing more diversity of threat and greater 
geographic distribution of the threats said kevin coyle acting 
president of american rivers 
he said western rivers have dominated the list in the past 
now we have a river in the southwest one in new jersey maine 
missouri it is the first time a river has ever been listed from 
alaska he said 
coyle said the threat against colorados south platte has eased 
somewhat because the environmental protection agency is moving to 
veto a wetlands permit needed for construction of the two forks dam 
but he said the river is still near the top of the endangered 
list because we dont believe the south platte is a finished 
issue by any means 
in idaho coyle said the group is concerned about air force 
plans to turn about a million acres along the bruneau and jarbidge 
rivers into a bombing range 
the air force proposes to use this spectacular wilderness area 
for lowlevel supersonic bombing including live ordnance 
airtoground missiles the report said 
the alsek and tatshenshini rivers are threatened by mining the 
report said and the passaic is endangered by plans to eliminate 
flooding by building a flood tunnel to bypass some areas 
on the jemez in new mexico they want to do pumice mining to 
make stonewashed blue jeans he said each of the threats is 
very different 
the clear clean waters of the james river near 
springfield mo are threatened by a proposed water supply dam 
which american rivers said is of questionable necessity 
coyle said the hydropower diversion on the klamath threatens 
one of the nations outstanding whitewater recreational rivers 
his group is working with others to add the klamath to the national 
wild and scenic rivers system and protect it from construction 
federal regulators are to decide this year whether to license 
the proposed power project on the klamath and the bureau of land 
management will decide whether to include 19mile stretch in the 
scenic rivers system he said 
the river segment contains rare yearround whitewater rafting 
in the southern oregon northern california area also threatened 
are several federally threatened fish species a blueribbon 
trout fishery and habitat for peregrine falcons the study said 
in addition there is concern that some sacred sites of the 
klamath and shasta tribes would be destroyed or open to 
vandalism it said

blacks put up barricades and 
stoned cars wednesday to enforce a nationwide strike marking the 
30th anniversary of the sharpeville massacre police said at two 
people were killed and about 50 injured 
tens of thousands of black workers stayed home from work and 
school and attended rallies in black townships in honor of the 69 
blacks killed by police during a 1960 demonstration at sharpeville 
a black township outside johannesburg 
the sharpeville shootings were a turning point for the african 
national congress which broke with decades of nonviolent protest 
to fight south africas whiterun government during the past 
decade a national strike has been called each year to commemorate 
the dead and many employers now give their workers the day off 
in glencoe a town in natal province police said officers 
killed one youth when they fired rubber bullets and tear gas at a 
crowd attacking policemen who were dismantling a barricade 
police said that at umlazi south of durban a black man fired 
shots at attackers who had thrown gasoline bombs at his house and 
stoned his car one man was killed and one wounded by the shots 
police said 
fighting between black political groups in natal province has 
claimed more than 3000 lives since 1987 
umlazi where thousands of people streamed to the stadium for a 
rally was one of the most violent areas of the country throughout 
the day crowds erected barricades with tree stumps barrels and 
burnedout vehicles then threw stones or gasoline bombs at 
officers who came to tear down the barricades 
police said 49 people were injured when officers fired birdshot 
rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds putting up 
blockades intimidating people on their to work or attacking 
police vehicles with stones and gunfire

unable to travel due to the shutdown of public transportation 
were absent from work and school in johannesburg durban 
pietermaritzburg east london uitenhage cape town and other towns 
across south africa 
there was no way to estimate how many people took part in the 
strike 
the largest rally was reported at uitenhage in eastern cape 
province journalists said 100000 people gathered there to 
commemorate blacks killed in the township of langa during a 
sharpeville anniversary protest five years ago 
african national congress leader raymond mhlaba and other 
officials put up a tombstone in a langa cemetery and tossed flowers 
over it for those killed in 1985 the exact death toll has never 
been confirmed estimates range from 29 to 43 
the shutdown of black transportation effectively enforced the 
boycott 
the staterun south african broadcasting corporation reported 
that between 20 percent and 80 percent of black workers stayed away 
from work in many areas press reports said the strike was more 
widely observed in some areas with up to 99 percent of the work 
force on strike in parts of durban 
the harbor on the indian ocean was at a standstill with ship 
departures delayed by a 98 percent absentee rate virtually no 
buses were running in black areas and crowds stoned trains some 
places to try to stop service local journalists said

the judge in john poindexters irancontra 
trial reversed himself wednesday saying that former president 
reagan does not have to produce diary entries sought by his 
onetime national security adviser 
us district court judge harold greene issued the ruling as the 
jury began watching eight hours of videotaped testimony by reagan 
greene had ordered reagan to turn over the diary but said after 
reading the three dozen entries sought by poindexter that the 
material was not essential to the achievement of justice in this 
case 
poindexter said he needed the excerpts because reagan in his 
taped testimony professed a total inability to recall the 
diversion of iran arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan contras and 
a 1985 hawk missile shipment 
defense lawyers also said reagan was unable to recall 
poindexters activities on behalf of the contras 
poindexter is charged with five felony charges of conspiracy 
making false statements and obstructing congress in connection with 
the irancontra affair 
mr reagan did testify under oath at great length about many 
specific activities in his administration an event that is 
unprecedented in american history greene said in a 14page 
ruling 
he granted reagans motion to quash poindexters subpoena for 
the entries which relate to both the iran initiative and contra 
resupply operation saying they offer no new insights about these 
events 
reagan later joined by the bush administration fought the 
subpoena by invoking executive privilege 
if the concept of executive privilege is to retain any 
meaning it will surely shield personal presidential papers from 
production on so flimsy a basis greene said 
the inability of a witness to recall does not 
automatically entitle a party to rummage through personal 
papers including his personal diary he said 
prosecution witnesses have testified during the 7 days of the 
trial that poindexter destroyed a presidential document and sent 
false letters to congress about covert aid to the contras 
reagans videotaped testimony taken feb 1617 was shown in 
greenes courtroom on television monitors including one positioned 
in front of the jury 
the jury spent all day wednesday watching the videotape and was 
to finish the process thursday morning 
the jurors watched intently as irancontra prosecutor dan webb 
questioned reagan in rapidfire fashion 
did you give authority to john poindexter to make any 
false statements webb asked 
no reagan replied and i dont think any false statements 
were made 
did you ever give authority to john poindexter to destroy 
records webb asked 
no responded the former president 
did john poindexter ever tell you he planned on destroying 
any documents the prosecutor asked 
no reagan responded 
did john poindexter tell you he had learned that 
oliver north altered and destroyed records webb asked 
no reagan said 
several jurors laughed when greene put a halt to a heated 
exchange between defense lawyer richard beckler and webb by saying 
lets not make a federal case out of this 
copies of the reagan tapes were released wednesday to the media 
transcripts were released last month and the tapes were shown 
several times in the courthouse

the provisional government accused 
hungary on wednesday of inciting tensions between romanians and 
ethnic hungarians that led to bloody street battles this week in 
transylvania 
in a strongly worded statement released to news media it 
charged hungarian officialdom with propagandistic actions 
that present transylvania as a hungarian component 
clashes between the romanian majority and hungarian minority 
left several people injured wednesday in the transylvanian town of 
tirgu mures scene of tuesday nights bloodletting that killed at 
least six people and injured about 300 
tanks cordoned off all highways into the city of 165000 
northwest of bucharest and patrolled downtown where the pitched 
battles tuesday featured men swinging scythes surging into crowds 
to beat other men 
tirgu mures was reported quiet wednesday night 
however romanians and hungarians were entering the city on foot 
late wednesday afternoon armed with clubs and iron bars witnesses 
said the army had orders to arrest anyone carrying a weapon on the 
streets 
the government accused interim hungarian president matyas 
szueroes of issuing a march 18 call through the press to ethnic 
hungarians in romania urging them to intensify their activity 
and to organize themselves according to the idea that transylvania 
would be native hungarian land 
but the provisional leadership that has run romania since the 
december revolution that overthrew communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu also put some of the blame for the violence on rightwing 
elements inciting ethnic romanians 
interim vice president cazimir ionescu blamed the clashes on a 
resurgence of the fascist iron guard 
a special commission of inquiry flown to tirgu mures on 
wednesday agreed to meet thursday with representatives of both the 
romanian and hungarian communities 
at united nations headquarters in new york a hungarian diplomat 
said wednesday that hungary has appealed for un help to protect 
the rights of hungarians in romania and is pressing for security 
council action to halt ethnic violence in transylvania he demanded 
anonymity 
in a letter to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn asked the international 
community and the united nations to take effective measures 
to protect the individual and collective rights of the largest 
minority in europe 
horn said legal romanian organizations have fueled ethnic 
tensions and prompted violence against hungarian minorities in 
transylvanian cities 
the state department in washington appealed to romanians to 
reject extremist groups and end the ethnic violence 
spokesman richard boucher said romanian citizens of all 
ethnic backgrounds should remember their recent monumental 
sacrifices in ousting the brutal ceaucescu dictatorship in the hope 
of establishing a democracy based on respect for human rights and 
tolerance of political and cultural diversity the romanian 
statement wednesday accused hungary of using the cover of cultural 
aid to send school books and posters that represent transylvania as 
a part of hungary 
the romanian government demands an immediate halt to 
incitements and opposes the way hungarian officialdom manipulates 
the news and presents the situation in romania it said 
tirgu mures is considered a cradle of ethnic hungarian culture 
in transylvania which was ruled by hungarians for centuries before 
being granted to romania under a 1920 treaty 
since the december uprising the hungarian minority has been 
demanding greater cultural and social autonomy including more 
hungarianlanguage schools and other social institutions 
ceausescu suppressed all ethnic minorities in his drive for 
social cultural and political uniformity the 22 million ethnic 
hungarians nearly all of them living in mountainous transylvania 
make up almost 10 percent of romanias 23 million population 
ethnic romanians complain that concessions granted to the 
hungarians by the new government discriminate against them by 
minimizing the use of the romanian language in cities and towns 
where hungarians predominate 
ionescu told the associated press on wednesday in singling out 
the iron guard as a provocateur they scared the romanians with 
the idea that the hungarians want to take over transylvania and 
they are tellling the hungarians that some requests they have made 
to the government will not be granted 
since the revolution antiminority letters and posters have 
been circulating in romania signed by the iron guard an 
antisemitic xenophobic organization that flourished here in the 
late 1930s and early 1940s the group called for ethnic purity and 
expulsion of all nonromanians especially jews 
at a wednesday night news conference interim prime minister 
petre roman said three romanianborn canadian ctizens were expelled 
wednesday for iron guard activities he did not identify them but 
said they were found in possession of iron guard promotional 
literature 
the state rompres news agency identified the three as nicolae 
doru popescu 47 gheorghe balasu 66 and mihaela moisin 49 but 
gave no hometowns in canada

an estimated 2000 to 5000 epilepsy patients 
a year are candidates for brain surgery using sophisticated new 
imaging techniques to provide surgeons a road map for the removal 
of abnormal brain cells 
in a report released at a news conference wednesday a national 
institutes of health committee of experts said that 150000 
americans annually have a first epiletic attack and many go on to 
develop a persistent pattern of seizures some with up to 20 
attacks a week 
anticonvulsant drugs will control seizures in about 70 percent 
of epilepsy patients but 10 percent to 20 percent are not helped 
by such medication 
many of these patients and their families have to deal with a 
chronic disorder that impairs the quality of life for all 
concerned the committee reported 
for those with intractable epilepsy the panel said surgery 
offers the only hope of relief 
the nih convened the panel of 13 experts to study epilepsy 
surgery and to make treatment recommendations for use by the 
nations medical community 
about 500 operations to control epilepsy are performed annually 
in the united states and the panel said the procedure is 
considered successful in 50 percent to 70 percent of the patients 
dr lewis p rowland director of neurological service at 
columbia presbyterian medical center in new york said epilepsy 
surgery consists of locating and removing the group of brain cells 
responsible for the seizures 
rowland chairman of the panel said surgeons remove a portion 
of the skull cut into the brain to remove the problem cells and 
restore the skull bone 
locating the problem cells he said now can be done using 
imaging techniques that use sophisticated computerdriven xrays 
or magnetic resonance imaging 
we can do a a very precise operation now said dr edward r 
laws professor of neurosurgery at george washington university 
medical center in washington we can map the brain and know 
exactly the location of centers that cause the seizures 
death or injury to healthy parts of the brain are very uncommon 
from such operations laws said 
its practical now to do this type of surgery he said 
laws said that most common epileptic surgery targets the 
temporal lobe the portion of the brain at the temple about 70 
percent of those operations are successful with the patients 
recovering either with no seizures or with seizures that can be 
controlled by drugs 
a more complicated procedure is in the frontal lobe of the 
brain that portion beneath the forehead 
results here fall to about 50 percent laws said 
such operations have been performed on children under the age of 
2 but rowland said the average age of epileptic surgery patients 
is 27 
cost of the operations average about 40000 but can run as 
high as 100000 much of the expense comes from the use of 
sophisticated equipment to map the brain and to plan the surgery 
the surgery is covered by some insurance companies and partially 
covered by medicaid in some states 
in their committee report the experts recommended that 
epileptic surgery be limited to those hospitals with the equipment 
and staff to attempt such a complicated procedure 
the committee also said a diagnosis of the epilepsy should be 
confirmed through tests that all patients receive a careful trial 
of drug therapy and that a full range of tests be conducted to 
precisely locate the flawed brain cells that cause the seizures

here is a text of lithuanian president 
vytautus landsbergis statement late wednesday it was issued in 
lithuanian and translated for the associated press by lithuanian 
officials 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this order like any other adopted by a foreign state that 
pretends to claim sovereignty over lithuania has no legal power 
it could be enforced only by brutal military force and if the 
soviet union is willing to prolong the aggression of 1940 against 
lithuania its a pity that it continues the mistake of the third 
congress of peoples deputies 
it amounts to the claiming of nonexistent and unjustified 
sovereignty of a powerful country over a small and unarmed 
neighbor the soviet union has recognized as null and void the 
secret protocol to the agreement between stalin and hitler 
condemned the policy of ultimatums and violation of international 
law including the annexation of lithuania but now once again is 
not able to give up the prize and restore justice 
the ghost of stalinism is walking in the kremlin and the shadow 
of it lies far to the west over lithuania tomorrow will show if 
the world which greets lithuania and her desire for freedom will 
approve well meet tomorrow serene and united as we were before 
facing previous threats

the j paul getty museum said wednesday it 
has bought vincent van goghs irises from a debtplagued 
entrepreneur who had bid a record 539 million for the masterpiece 
in 1987 
the chance to acquire the painting was a great moment in the 
history of the museum and the trust said harold m williams 
president and chief executive officer of the j paul getty trust 
irises already is on display in the museums secondfloor 
galleries alongside other 19thcentury paintings by pierreauguste 
renoir edouard manet and edvard munch 
painted in 1889 in van goghs bold style it depicts a patch of 
garden in a french asylum at saintremy de provence where the 
dutch artist committed himself after a mental breakdown in arles 
purple and midnightblue blooms dominate offset by a single 
white iris to the left and balanced below by salmonpink soil 
the painting was sold privately to the museum by australian 
entrepreneur alan bond who is reported to be 5 billion in debt 
he bought it at a sothebys auction in new york on nov 11 1987 
in keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private 
acquisitions the museum declined to disclose the price 
the museum also did not discuss security arrangements early 
sunday thieves in boston stole 12 artworks from the gardner 
museum the loss was estimated in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
john paul getty the late oil baron endowed the museum with 
21 billion making it the worlds richest art institution 
until the sale of 1987 the painting was a wellknown work 
but it didnt achieve anything like the fame it achieved when it 
was sold here said david nash sothebys director of fine arts 
in new york 
the latest sale was arranged by sothebys which had loaned bond 
27 million to buy irises in an unusual deal that was widely 
criticized for inflating prices in the international art market 
bonds subsequent financial trouble further fueled intense 
speculation among art curators dealers and collectors about the 
fate of the painting 
while acknowledging the controversy diana d brooks president 
of sothebys north america said were comfortable with the way 
we handled it and were delighted that its going to such a 
prestigous institution 
she declined to describe any of the behindthescenes 
negotiations involving the painting but when asked if sothebys 
had steered irises to the getty brooks said if you had 
asked us of our dream we would have said we wouldve wanted it to 
go to the getty museum 
nash of sothebys said the thing thats remarkable about the 
painting is its intensity and the energy that it conveys 
this is among the most original and dynamic of all van goghs 
compositions in which the spearlike slashing representation of 
the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color said a statement 
from george goldner the gettys curator of paintings and drawings 
at the same time it is a picture of great poetry as expressed in 
the one white iris on the left side which in its isolation has a 
special poignancy 
the painting was in private european collections until 1947 
when it was purchased for 80000 by new york philanthropist joan 
whitney payson after van goghs sunflowers sold for 399 
million in 1987 paysons family decided to sell irises and use 
the proceeds to endow a charitable foundation 
brooks said she had informed the paysons that the getty had 
acquired irises the family was absolutely thrilled the 
public would be able to view the painting as part of a museums 
permanent collection she said 
in a statement released by sothebys bond said i am very 
pleased with this sale particularly because this great masterpiece 
will be on exhibition at such a preeminent museum 
the getty designed in the style of a firstcentury roman villa 
overlooks the pacific ocean on the los angeles county coast it is 
one of seven programs operated by the getty trust admission is

senate democrats plan a 2 billion package of 
additional aid for emerging democracies in eastern europe six 
times what president bush has proposed according to a copy of the 
package obtained wednesday 
the draft bill by sens claiborne pell dri and joseph r 
biden ddel calls for the new aid four times more than even 
the democrats proposed just two months ago to be distributed to 
seven former soviet bloc nations through 1992 
pell is chairman of the senate foreign relations commttee and 
biden is chairman of the panels economic policy and trade 
subcommittee 
the draft includes 12 billion for us participation in a 
european bank for reconstruction and development which has been 
proposed by france to finance public works and new private 
enterprises in former communist economies 
bush administration officials have said the united states will 
not participate if the soviet union is allowed to be a net borrower 
from the bank 
but treasury secretary nicholas brady acknowledges the bank 
which has already received commitments from most west european 
countries and japan is going forward with or without us 
participation 
our economic competitors are racing to establish strong 
footings in eastern europe biden said wednesday we seem to be 
hesitating the united states could well be left out 
the administration has proposed spending 300 million in 
additional aid in fiscal 1991 for eastern europe beyond the 738 
million congress set aside to help poland and hungary through 1992 
democrats have accused bush of responding timidly to the 
overthrow of communist regimes as west germany italy france and 
japan are investing heavily in eastern europe 
businesses are waiting for the government to go first and 
cover risks in the region and the government is waiting for 
business leaders to go in on their own said biden what were 
lacking is the vision to develop programs that transform our 
military presence in europe to a political and economic presence 
biden said the 2 billion package could be introduced separately 
or could be tied to the 800 million in new aid bush has requested 
for nicaragua and panama 
pell and biden in late january proposed augmenting the 
polandhungary package with another 511 million to include 
czechoslovakia east germany romania bulgaria and yugoslavia 
their new package would result in 275 billion going to the 
region by 1992 
included in their package is 200 million to create business 
centers in the seven countries to give technical and other 
assistance to american companies seeking a foothold in the markets 
but the bulk of the new money would be for the new european 
bank in addition to the 400 million us share for the 12 
billion bank the bill would establish an 800 million trust fund 
to finance east european purchases from us companies to improve 
the nations infrastructures 
it would provide no direct assistance to the soviet government 
but would authorize the president to extend aspects of the program 
to the soviet union if they promote us values there 
for example it would authorize the aflcio to use 40 million 
in increased funds for the national endowment for democracy to help 
foster effective trade unions in the soviet union as it did with 
the solidarity movement in poland 
biden said he and pell wanted to avoid the furor that erupted 
earlier this month when house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo proposed sending direct aid to moscow 
this is a penetration program not an aid program to the 
extent that the president wishes to engage in it at all biden 
said the goal is to penetrate the soviet union with american 
values

secretary of state james a baker iii 
met black nationalist leader nelson mandela on wednesday amid 
growing superpower diplomacy for more reform in white minorityled 
south africa 
baker arrived to see the african national congress leader 
moments after soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze departed 
delegations from more than 100 nations were in namibia to 
celebrate its independence from south africa and the occasion 
provided a prime opportunity for officials to confer 
shevardnadze visited earlier in the day with south african 
president fw de klerk it was the first meeting between a south 
african president and a member of the soviet government since the 
soviet union broke relations with south africa 34 years ago because 
of apartheid 
baker was to meet with de klerk on thursday to press for further 
reforms in the apartheid system 
a senior us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said baker urged mandela to reconsider his support for 
nationalization of financial institutions and the mining industry 
in south africa the source said baker was pleased with the way 
mandela received that 
baker in turn assured mandela that sanctions imposed by the 
us congress to protest apartheid would be observed by the bush 
administration the source said 
in greeting mandela baker said the usbrokered negotiations 
that led to independence for namibia were an example of how 
superpower cooperation could benefit the world 
i fully agree mandela replied 
one of the things we deeply appreciate is the effort made by 
the world powers to relax world tensions i think that we are 
turning a new chapter he said 
baker mandela several anc leaders and south african communist 
party leader joe slovo met for 30 minutes 
mr baker and i have had a very fruitful discussion mandela 
said afterward as you would expect there are several issues on 
which our views are not so identical but that has to be expected 
mandela reiterated the ancs opposition to bakers meeting with 
de klerk in cape town south africa on thursday 
he said it could create a great deal of confusion by 
suggesting that de klerks government has done something which 
requires a change of attitude on the part of the international 
community we regard that as regrettable 
however mandela also said there were areas of agreement between 
the bush administration and the anc 
i regard mr baker the congress and the american people as 
true friends and that characterized our discussions today 
baker said of mandela i think his courageousness is something 
that the world has taken note of and has sustained many even 
in the us in their position that apartheid must be abolished 
relations between the us government and the anc have improved 
during the last 12 months 
the anc the main black group fighting minority white rule in 
south africa condemned former president reagans policy of 
constructive engagement toward south africa which involved 
maintaining ties in order to exert influence and opposition to 
economic sanctions 
the united states has imposed the toughest sanctions against 
south africa of any western country outside scandinavia but 
congress did it over reagans veto 
anc leaders have said they can communicate better with the bush 
administration although they call for even stricter sanctions and 
cutting all diplomatic ties to the south african government a move 
no western government has taken 
shevardnadze who was to fly to mozambique on thursday 
characterized his talks with de klerk as useful de klerk said the 
talks were promising and constructive 
soviet sources who also spoke on condition of anonymity said 
shevardnadze would like to visit south africa but further reforms 
are required there before such a trip can be considered

a doctor involved in a dispute over the discovery 
of the aids virus said wednesday a frenchamerican agreement on the 
aids test could be called into question if disclosures in a 
reportedly hushedup us inquiry prove true 
dr luc montagnier who led the french team that discovered the 
aids virus also called on his american collegue robert c gallo to 
admit that his own discovery was the result of accidental 
laboratory contamination 
montagnier of the pasteur institute in paris says his team 
discovered the deadly virus first a claim disputed by gallo of 
the national cancer institute 
i think gallo should finally admit the obvious 
montagnier said in an interview with le monde newspaper i again 
make a public call for him to do so and i would be prepared to 
salute his courage if he did so 
the chicago tribune reported this week on a secret us 
government inquiry that allegedly uncovered evidence that gallo was 
not the first to discover the aids virus 
the inquiry conducted by the national institutes of health 
concluded that instead of discovering the aids virus gallo may 
have discovered the offspring of a sample virus sent to him by 
french scientists the newspaper reported 
he said the report referred to by the chicago tribune had never 
been made available to french lawyers which is in absolute 
contradiction with american legislation under the freedom of 
information act 
an outofcourt settlement between the us government and the 
french in march 1987 gave the pasteur institute the right to sell 
its aids test in the united states and allowed the two sides to 
share royalties from the us aids test 
the agreement did not touch on the issue of who discovered the 
virus first 
we do not exclude the possibility of bringing into question 
the terms of the frenchamerican agreement in the light of new 
elements which could turn up montagnier told le monde 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the 
bodys ability to fight disease there is no known cure 
montagnier whose team had shared its aids research with the 
americans contended the virus gallo discovered was the result of 
an error of manipulation in the laboratory this hypothesis is 
not only for me but for the entire scientific community 
completely obvious he said 
montagnier said that by contamination he meant the virus in one 
test tube could contaminate other viral cultures in the laboratory 
and then be identified as a new virus 
he said he is not accusing gallo of fraud but of a laboratory 
accident that carried no dishonor 
the french were first to publish information about their virus 
in may 1983 but the finding from one isolated case was largely 
ignored 
the gallo group maintained it was the first to isolate study in 
detail classify and link a similar virus with aids the work was 
published in the may 4 1984 issue of the journal science

cuts in military spending eventually will mean 
a higher standard of living for many americans but will disrupt 
some areas of the country a congressional study said 
the congressional budget office said in a report released this 
week that money trimmed from defense would likely be directed to 
nondefense programs or used to reduce taxes allowing americans to 
spend or save more money 
alternatively a reduction in spending could be used to cut 
the federal deficit which would lead to higher standards of 
living cbo said in a memorandum assessing the effects of a 
reduced defense budget 
lower deficits would increase national saving resulting both 
in higher domestic investment and lower indebtedness to the rest of 
the world 
the shortterm effects of a cut in defense spending would slow 
economic expansion and increase unemployment but by a small 
amount the study said however that it was unlikely the slow 
economic growth would trigger a recession 
the cbo considered three possible reductions in the defense 
budget 4 percent 7 percent and 10 percent a year in the 
19911995 period 
the cuts would result in a reduction in defense spending ranging 
from 8 billion to 17 billion in fiscal 1991 and 62 billion to 
about 139 billion by fiscal 1995 
president bushs current defense budget calls for 303 billion 
in defense spending 
although cbo found financial benefits from reductions in 
defense the agency concluded that three of nine census regions 
would feel the greatest effect 
if cuts are made in employment levels the pacific and south 
atlantic regions would suffer the most because they boast the 
largest concentration of people employed by the defense department 
if reductions are made in purchases the new england area and 
the pacific would be hardest hit 
states that would suffer are virginia alaska washington and 
hawaii 9 percent of their output is connected to defense spending 
specific metropolitan areas affected would be los angeleslong 
beach nassausuffolk on long island boston and washington dc 
in addition communities around military bases slated for 
closing would suffer disruptions 
local impacts could be offset if other uses for defense bases 
are found or if companies diversify into nondefense work or are 
replaced by companies in nondefense markets the cbo said 
the study was done at the request of the house budget committee

illinois antiabortion lobby suffered a double 
blow at the polls with the defeat of a seventerm state 
representative and a longshot gubernatorial candidate 
rep penny pullen a leading sponsor of antiabortion measures 
blamed her razorthin loss in tuesdays primary on dirty 
politics by abortion rights candidate rosemary mulligan and said 
she may challenge the results 
republican gubernatorial candidate steven baer who appealed to 
opponents of abortion and higher taxes lost by a 2to1 margin to 
jim edgar twoterm secretary of state and nearunanimous choice of 
the state gop hierarchy 
with all precincts reporting pullen an assistant house 
minority leader received 7400 votes to 7431 for mulligan 
i blame the closeness of this election on dirty politics 
the total distortion of my voting record she said 
in washington the national abortion rights action league said 
mulligans outstanding victory over a 14year antichoice leader 
is proof that since we can no longer depend on the courts 
americans are committed to protecting their right to choose with 
their votes 
mulligan a paralegal from des plaines denied her campaign had 
distorted her opponents record 
both candidates received some of their campaign money from 
advocacy groups in the last six months about 67 percent of 
mulligans 40382 campaign fund came from personal pac a 
political committee affiliated with the national abortion rights 
action group and other prochoice groups records show 
miss pullen raised 87168 in the same period including 1000 
from the national right to life pac and 4100 from the 
conservative antiabortion united republican fund records say 
the illinois federation for right to life also provided workers 
to help pullen contact voters who share her views on abortion 
those services have not yet been reported in preelection campaign 
finance records 
edgars victory set up a november election matchup with neil 
hartigan the states twoterm attorney general who was unopposed 
in the democratic primary both candidates are prochoice which 
may move the abortion issue out of the spotlight it held in the gop 
primary

ethnic hatreds that have flared in the 
romanian city of tirgu mures are as old as the squabble over 
transylvania now part of romania but administered for centuries by 
neighboring hungary 
at least six people were reported dead wednesday in the 
transylvanian city about 250 miles north of bucharest and the same 
distance east of budapest about 300 were wounded in pitched street 
battles between ethnic hungarians and romanians some armed with 
wooden staves scythes and pitchforks 
the violence followed weeks of increasing tension over demands 
of transylvanias 22 millionstrong hungarian minority about 10 
percent of romanias population 
among the rights sought by ethnic hungarians were 
reestablishment of separate hungarianlanguage schools and 
universities initially supported by the postworld war ii romanian 
leadership but abolished under toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu 
and proportional government representation on the local and 
national level 
weeks of peaceful demonstrations in transylvania by both ethnic 
groups turned into open conflict on the weekend over an apparently 
minor incident a hungarianlanguage sign in a tirgu mures store 
window identifying it as a pharmacy 
a group of romanians demolished the pharmacy and attacked the 
headquarters of the democratic federation of hungarians the main 
special interest group of the minority street battles followed 
and the army moved in to try to restore order 
the tirgu mures clashes represented the first documented case of 
open ethnic violence in transylvania in more than 40 years and 
displayed the depth of emotions kept in check under the iron hand 
of ceausescu and his predecessor gheorghe gheorghiudej 
while their communist systems perpetuated and later encouraged 
the hatreds as a way of diffusing opposition to authoritarian rule 
both leaders would have moved quickly to crush any open ethnic 
conflict that could have developed into a threat to their authority 
nationalist rivalries seemingly faded in december as the two 
ethnic groups joined in anticeausescu demonstrations in timisoara 
another transylvanian city starting what quickly turned into the 
revolution but bickering along ethnic lines quickly resurfaced 
romanians and hungarians have been in transylvania more than 
1000 years and hungarian kings ruled the territory in the middle 
ages the modern history of the conflict dates to the 1830s with 
awakening nationalist sentiment across europe 
in 1848 the hungarians rose against austrian rule they 
demanded recognition of their own national aspirations without 
being willing to extend similar recognition to likeminded desires 
of national minorities in the region 
hungarian revolutionaries sought the annexation of transylvania 
then administered by austria the hungarians lost their 
independence battle but subsequently gained control of transylvania 
as junior partners in the austrohungarian monarchy 
one incident indirectly leading to the tirgu mures violence was 
romanian displeasure with open ethnic hungarian celebrations of 
march 15 the anniversary of the outbreak of the antiaustrian 
revolution such dates could not be observed during the communist 
era 
after dissolution of the austrohungarian empire in 1918 the 
victorious allies of world war i ceded transylvania to romania 
under the treaty of trianon recurring hungarian repression of 
transylvanian romanians was replaced by officially condoned 
romanian persecution of the regions hungarians 
hungary reclaimed part of transylvania as a reward for 
temporarily siding with nazi germany during world war ii only to 
lose it again at the end of the war with the defeat of the axis

ussoviet talks on a trade agreement 
and separate negotiations on a new longterm grains accord began 
wednesday behind closed doors 
the negotiators reportedly hope to reach agreement on an overall 
trade package in time for a summit meeting between presidents bush 
and mikhail s gorbachev scheduled for june 
i dont have any statement to make ambassador julius katz 
the deputy us trade representative told the associated press as 
he emerged from his limousine to attend the second round of the day 
at the soviet trade mission 
i wont say anything before the scheduled news conference 
tomorrow 
katz heads the us negotiating teams at the two sets of talks 
the soviet trade mission refused to comment on the talks 
an opening round of talks were held last month and both sides 
expressed satisfaction with their progress another round was held 
later in february in london 
the trade package would include granting mostfavored nation 
trading status qualifying the soviet union for the lowest tariffs 
available to us trading partners soviet exports to the united 
states now bear duties as much as 10 times higher than imports from 
other nations 
mostfavored nation trading status would be a first step toward 
making us exports to the soviet union eligible for us 
government loans and credits 
bush first must waive the socalled jacksonvanik amendment 
barring such status passed by congress in 1974 because the soviets 
refused free emigration a waiver would require bush to certify to 
congress that free emigration was being allowed 
the latest ussoviet grains accord which officially expired 
sept30 1988 was extended through dec31 1990 to help 
negotiations and to allow a new fiveyear accord to run 
concurrently with the soviet unions fiveyear planning process a 
us statement distributed here said 
under this accord the soviet union must buy at least 4 million 
metric tons of wheat and 4 million metric tons of corn annually 
together with an additional 1 million metric tons of cumulative 
amounts of wheat corn soybean and soymeal 
at the same time the soviets are allowed to buy up to 3 million 
tons of additional wheat and corn each year without further 
consultations with the united states 
us department of agriculture officials said the soviet union 
bought more than 12 million metric tons of us grains during the 
last quarter of 1989

the nations largest independent oil 
producer didnt steal millions of dollars worth of oil from wells 
on indian land as a us senate subcommittee alleged last year 
osage tribe officials concluded 
the osage tribal council said it investigated koch industries 
inc purchases in osage county okla for 1987 1988 and the first 
five months of 1989 and found that overpayment of royalties by 
koch were made as well as underpayments 
the net amount owed was about 22000 plus 7057 in late 
penalties the council said 
in mondays edition of the osage nation news the council said 
it found no evidence to substantiate accusations by a subcommittee 
of the senate select committee on indian lands that koch stole 
million of dollars worth of oil 
two former koch employees told the subcommittee last may they 
were pressured to steal oil from wells on indian land the company 
expected them to mismeasure oil from the wells so that koch did not 
have to pay for all it got they testified 
the company rebutted the allegations saying the subcommittees 
figures were inaccurate and that comparisons with other companies 
were based on nonapplicable statistics 
kochs executive vice president for corporate and legal affairs 
don cordes said that of the oil it bought from indianowned land 
85 percent came from land owned by the osages in oklahoma 
koch had control of more than 10 million barrels of osage oil 
during the period under investigation and paid royalties of 
approximately 33 million for it cordes said 
this report completely undermines the false allegations of the 
senate subcommittee he said tuesday 
koch records indicated a net overpayment to the osages cordes 
said he added tht the 22000 discrepancy alleged by the tribe is 
less than 01 percent of the total royalties paid during the period 
however the differences between the osage and koch numbers 
are so tiny in relation to the total volume of business done that 
the senate allegations are demonstrably false under either 
conclusion cordes said 
both sets of figures demonstrate the inexactness and imprecision 
of measuring crude oil cordes said 
koch officials maintained from the start of the controversy that 
factors such as temperature crude oil composition and holding tank 
conditions make precise measurement of crude impossible

the federal communications commission on 
wednesday further narrowed the field of contestants locked in a 
highstakes battle to win the right to market a highdefinition 
television transmission system 
chairman alfred sikes said the commission which plans to 
announce the winner of the hdtv sweepstakes in early 1993 voted to 
consider only hdtv systems that will not require use of an extra 
augmentation channel of scarce tv space in order to provide the 
crystalclear pictures and compact discquality sound that the new 
system promises 
at the moment no augmentation system is expected but some 
could emerge or be revived 
only socalled simulcast systems will be considered for testing 
at the advanced television test center this fall sikes said at a 
meeting of the fccs advisory committee on advanced television 
service 
japanese and european manufacturers are far ahead of the united 
states in developing the next generation of television which 
promises many military educational and medical uses besides giving 
viewers motion picturequality views of roseanne 
the test center is to recommend the winning system to the fcc in 
the fall of 1992 
in a simulcast system a tv station would broadcast its regular 
tv signal on one channel and the same program on another channel in 
highdefinition for instance the regular signal on channel 9 and 
the highdefinition signal on channel 12 
commission engineers believe there are enough unused channels so 
that most broadcasters would be able to adopt simulcast hdtv 
systems 
augmentation systems on the other hand also use two channels 
but use the second channel to provide a signal that when combined 
in the tv set with the regular signal on the first channel yields 
the highdefinition picture 
of the nine companies or groups planning to offer hdtv systems 
for testing only one proposed an augmentationtype approach and 
the proposal has been scrapped said peter fannon executive 
director of the test center 
that proposal was the actv2 system from the david sarnoff 
research center thomson consumer electronics and nbc the proposal 
was killed earlier this year when sarnoff joined forces with 
another hdtv proponent philips consumer electronics co 
the new york institute of technology also has said it wanted to 
submit an augmentation system but it had not come up with the 
money to do so fannon said 
in making this determination we are aware of the fact that 
augmentationtype systems could also provide a quality 
highdefinition television service sikes said however we 
find that the substantial spectrum availability and utilization 
problems that selection of an augmentationtype system would entail 
indicates that further testing of such systems is not warranted 
in our judgment the interests of the public will be better 
served by selecting a simulcast system 
sikes also said the commission was committed to first adopting a 
transmission standard for full highdefinition television and then 
if necessary considering socalled enhanceddefinition that would 
todays signals without achieving true hdtv 
the commission has said previously that any hdtv system it 
selects for us transmissions must be compatible with the existing 
tv system to avoid making every tv set in the nation obsolete 
fannon said wednesdays decision leaves eight entrants in the 
testing program five have already been certified sarnoffphilips 
an analog simulcast system from philips zenith electronics corp 
and the narrow muse and muse6 systems from the japan broadcasting 
corp 
three others need to complete the certification process by june 
or lose their test slots faroudja laboratories of sunnyvale 
calif production services inc of tucson ariz and the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
the faroudja actv and muse 6 systems provide an 
enhanceddefinition signal that removes some of the ghosts and 
squiggles that mar todays systems 
entrants will be required to put up 175000 toward actual test 
costs which fannon said would reach 12 million and 15 million 
the test program is being financed by the television and 
electronics industries

indians complain the canned meat sent to 
reservations swims in fat and smells like dog food but government 
cooks on wednesday whipped up a tasting party to show what wonders 
a little barbecue sauce could work 
government commodities are wholesome nutritious and widely 
accepted betty jo nelsen administrator of agriculture 
departments food and nutrition service said at a tasting party 
for reporters where usda cooks laid out a spread of stews 
barbecue and baked meats 
the palatable if somewhat bland dishes in no way resembled some 
noxioussmelling usda meat that house hunger committee members 
displayed at a news conference earlier in the day 
committee chairman tony hall dohio charged that the canned 
beef and pork is unappealing and high in fat and sodium even though 
indians suffer from high rates of diabetes and heart disease 
an odor similar to that of dog food pervaded a small house 
hearing room after hall spooned fatcovered clumps of readytoeat 
meat from usda cans that were distributed to the standing rock 
reservation in north dakota 
people shouldnt have to eat secondclass food we shouldnt 
feed them scraps and poorquality scraps at that hall said 
hall and rep byron dorgan dnd called for a general 
accounting office investigation into the quality of the meat 
some indian leaders have complained about the quality of the 
canned meat during recent congressional hearings and a recent gao 
study of hunger on reservations in north dakota and south dakota 
usda officials contend that the 60 types of food they 
distribute including canned fruit egg mix and peanut butter 
provide a balanced diet and are similar in quality to food sold in 
supermarkets 
the food is distributed through usda programs to 143000 indians 
and 271000 women children and elderly people each month 
the canned beef and pork is covered with fat when its opened 
because its cooked in the can so that it can be stored without 
refrigeration nelsen said 
the meat which is inspected during and after processing cannot 
contain more than 18 percent fat and usually has about 15 percent 
she said 
ground beef by comparison usually contains 20 percent to 30 
percent fat said pat daniel an agriculture department nutrionist 
the meat may be eaten directly from the can but its meant to 
be used in recipes with other ingredients like the stews or 
casseroles served to reporters nelsen said 
an agriculture department aide opened a can of pork for 
reporters wednesday afternoon that had only a faint odor the meat 
had little flavor and a texture similar to canned tuna 
it looks about as appealing as a chicken does when i bring it 
home from the market nelsen said 
usda officials who did not attend halls news conference had 
no explanation for the strong odor from the cans he opened except 
to suggest that the meat may have been left in storage too long 
the meat is supposed to be used within a year they said 
neal flieger a spokesman for the hunger committee said the 
meat had been recently delivered to the standing rock reservation 
from usda and had a similar odor to numerous other cans the 
committees staff has inspected 
hall who has eaten some of the meat said its not the kind 
of taste that makes you gag but its not pleasing its not good 
dorgan said he had not tasted it 
i cant get past the smell he said

president bush stood firm wednesday on his 
refusal to eat broccoli but applauded california growers shipping 
10 tons of the vegetable to feed the hungry in the nations capital 
i am not going to rethink my position he said laughing on 
his way to his private quarters from the oval office but barbara 
was delighted to get the news 
bush has banned broccoli from air force one his wife has 
lamented publicly in the past how difficult a time she has getting 
her husband to eat his vegetables 
bush accompanied by friends from texas produced a news 
clipping about the southern california growers who packed a truck 
tuesday with 10 tons of broccoli and sent it on its way to a 
washington food bank 
when a reporter asked if there was anything else that bush did 
not like the president laughed and replied yeah but i dont 
want to get 10 tons of it 
two cartons of broccoli are reportedly earmarked for the white 
house along with recipes offering some novel ways to serve it 
the rest is to be distributed to soup kitchens shelters and 
other nonprofit organizations that feed the homeless and hungry 
the growers are shipping their produce to the capital area 
community food bank 
bush broke into laughter at the end of a white house ceremony on 
tuesday when he encountered a produce lobbyist wearing a stalk of 
broccoli on his lapel he told the lobbyist other people should eat 
broccoli if they like it 
bushs own taste runs more to pork rinds taco salads and almost 
anything smothered in hot pepper sauce 
peter lassen food solicitor for the capital area community 
foodbank said he was contacted by the california growers monday 
after a news magazine reported the presidential ukase against 
broccoli 
i got a call asking if wed accept a shipment of broccoli as a 
goodnatured protest to the president i said sure were be glad to 
have it he said 
a white house official contacted lassen tuesday and discussed a 
possible welcoming ceremony on monday for the broccoli 
they wanted to make sure it wasnt a hoax said lassen he 
added i dont know if the white house is going to go along with 
that yet 
lassen said his food bank isnt looking for any more broccoli 
shipments right now 
we can handle 10 tons but not much more than that because 
of the shelf life said lassen whose bank distributes 3000 tons 
of food a year

eight nuns moved to a castle in southern 
france after their convent was sold for 14 million and police 
were investigating the religious orders purchase of racehorses and 
other property a court official said wednesday 
roman catholic church officials said the sale occurred without 
the bishop of bruges permission 
he has excommunicated the convents mother superior and the 
youngest of the eight nuns for failing to submit the convents 
books for examination to the diocese and for refusing to let a 
church official enter the convent 
investigators have arrested the convents financial director 
ronny crab 35 and charged him with swindling abuse of trust 
extortion and forgery 
police have uncovered unusual practices for a religious order 
including the purchases of a mercedesbenz auto equipped with a 
bar a farmhouse racehorses and the dilapidated castle in tarbes 
france where they are living the court official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
investigators had traveled to tarbes near lourdes to determine if 
the poor sisters of clare agreed to the 14 million sale of the 
convent to a building corporation 
the nuns left the same day march 6 for the south of france 
and the court official said 
authorities have sequestered th 
losses in an economy already beset by inflation recession and 
unemployment 
the rally and march took place on a warm first day of fall in 
this southern hemisphere nation of 32 million 
menem 59 tried to avoid the strike and an open break with 
organized labor by offering a modest increase in public wages and 
doubling retirement pensions to about 80 a month 
however he said on tuesday they can stage a thousand 
strikes but the economic plan is totally irreversible 
government officials say they have no choice but to reduce the 
budget because the printing of money by the central bank to finance 
the deficit fuels inflation which soared 12000 percent the past 
year including 61 percent in february 
for years argentina financed the fiscal deficit by borrowing 
abroad but it can no longer do that because it stopped repaying 
its debt it also sold bonds to argentines who stopped buying them 
after the government confiscated savings accounts last january 
meanwhile the embattled director of the state telephone company 
threatened to cut off service to congress if overdue bills arent 
paid 
they are being informed about how much they owe and when they 
have to pay maria julia alsogaray told reporters 
ms alsogaray has been heavily criticized for raising rates by 
about 2300 percent since january when the bimonthly bills started 
arriving last week stunned argentines said they could not pay and 
outraged members of congress demanded alsogarays resignation

a scottish farmer said wednesday he is 
selling sand to saudi arabia even though that arid country is 
mostly desert 
the saudis have a lot of sand but it is the wrong shape 
said the farmer john keddie 
the saudis want tons of keddies sand to use in filtration 
systems for water supplies and swimming pools 
their sand is too round ours is cuboid with the corners 
rubbed off ours is also very hard so it doesnt break down in the 
filters said the farmer 
keddie grows oilseed rape and wheat on 600 acres at alloa near 
the forth river in southeast scotland 
he said he investigated the potential of his local sand two 
years ago and made his first sale of sand for glassmaking when he 
found he could no longer make a living only by farming

the judge in the fraud case against imelda 
marcos expressed skepticism wednesday that publicity would affect 
the trial noting that similar negative press didnt prevent 
onetime miss america bess myersons acquittal 
us district judge john f keenan made the comment in the 
second day of jury selection at the trial of mrs marcos and saudi 
financier adnan khashoggi 
outside the presence of wouldbe jurors mrs marcos lawyer 
gerry spence told keenan he was concerned about publicity he read 
from a daily news column about mrs marcos headlined last of the 
redhot evil women 
spence quoted a passage that mentioned mrs marcos as one of 
three famous female defendants along with hotel queen leona 
helmsley convicted of tax evasion and miss myerson acquitted in 
a divorcefixing conspiracy 
keenan said he doubted that news coverage would affect the 
marcos trial outcome recalling the myerson case over which he 
also presided keenan said they got terrible publicity they 
were all acquitted 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of participating in the illegal 
transfer of more than 160 million from the philippines treasury to 
buy new york real estate and of defrauding banking institutions of 
an additional 165 million to finance the deals 
khashoggi is accused of helping mrs marcos and her late 
husband exphilippines president ferdinand e marcos who died in 
exile in hawaii conceal their ownership of the real estate 
in the philippines about 1500 marcos supporters spat on and 
burned an american flag and an effigy of uncle sam in front of the 
us embassy on wednesday to protest mrs marcos trial 
marcos supporters carried placards demanding justice for 
imelda and we love the marcos family during the generally 
peaceful protest 
police stood guard in front of the seaside embassy compound in 
manila but did not interfere 
as on tuesday most of the potential jurors interviewed by 
keenan had heard of the more than 1000 shoes mrs marcos left 
behind in the philippines when her husband was ousted from power 
but none said the shoes would affect their ability to be fair 
i think many people own many pairs of shoes said carol 
cross a bookkeeper from rockland county 
prospective jurors chosen for the jury pool included a postal 
clerk who had heard of mrs marcos shoe collection but who owned 
many shoes herself and a sanitation worker who doesnt follow world 
politics 
one woman was disqualified when she said she didnt think the 
trial should take place and certainly not in new york mrs 
marcos has maintained she is a filipino citizen and should be tried 
in her homeland 
a final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to be 
chosen next week 
when asked during the lunch break what he thought about jury 
selection khashoggi said i think it is a good way to get to 
know the american people

president lee tenghui was elected 
wednesday by aging lawmakers who have not faced voters in more than 
40 years while thousands of students demanding direct presidential 
elections protested for a sixth day 
student representatives met with lee at his office wednesday 
evening and said he made vague promises of political reform lee 
said earlier in a statement that he would not propose any changes 
before he is sworn in for a sixyear term may 20 
we dont quite agree with his promises but we can accept 
them said student leader fan yun one of more than 50 
representatives who met with the 67yearold chairman of the ruling 
nationalist party 
lee was the only presidential candidate before the national 
assembly which is dominated by elderly deputies have not faced 
elections since the communists drove them from mainland china in 
1949 
lee received support from 641 of 688 national assembly members 
who cast ballots at a suburban meeting hall the other delegates 
cast invalid ballots about 2000 police officers in full riot gear 
stood guard 
hundreds of protesters tried to stop deputies on their way to 
the vote one assemblyman was pulled from his car but appeared 
unharmed a police officer was injured in a scuffle with the 
demonstrators the crowd smashed windows of at least two cars 
the nationalist deputies many in their 80s and 90s and in poor 
health were frozen in office in support of the nationalist claim 
to be the legitimate government of all china several voted from 
wheelchairs or used canes to walk to the ballot box 
the opposition democratic progressive party whose 11 
assemblymen were barred from voting because they refused to swear 
allegiance to the nationalist government questioned the legality 
of the election and urged lee to quickly set a timetable for 
democratic reform 
in a statement read to about 5000 supporters wednesday night 
opposition leaders demanded direct presidential elections and the 
release of all political prisoners 
about 6000 university students pressed prodemocracy demands 
during a sitin at a downtown park several thousand more people 
looked on as the students sang and danced under a huge replica of a 
wild lily their symbol of freedom 
lee had said in a statement issued earlier he would devote my 
utmost endeavors to garner all forces to strive for constitutional 
democracy economic progress and social stability in the coming six 
years 
on tuesday lee agreed to an emergency conference among 
nationalist and opposition politicians to discuss changing the 
political system 
public pressure to disband the national assembly has increased 
sharply in recent days particularly after some deputies proposed 
increasing the assemblys powers and the salaries of its members 
the election wednesday marked the first time the national 
assembly has been asked to choose as president someone outside the 
family that ruled taiwan for four decades after the nationalist 
retreat from mainland china 
the assembly elected chiang kaishek president five times and 
his eldest son chiang chingkuo twice 
the younger chiang died in office in january 1988 shortly after 
he began a political liberalization program that included scrapping 
martial law after 38 years and abolishing a ban on opposition 
parties 
lee tenghui was the handpicked vice president of chiang 
chingkuo and automatically assumed his post finishing chiangs 
term as president 
lee is the first native taiwanese to head the government and 
ruling party and is regarded with suspicion by many of the 
nationalist old guard who believe he is not sufficiently committed 
to their dream of one day returning victoriously to rule the 
chinese mainland

the loosely organized reform movement democratic 
russia that won control of the moscow city council this week has 
emerged split and confused lacking a firm idea of what to do with 
its new power 
the group faces enormous challenges in the soviet capital home 
to about 9 million people moscows shops are empty its streets 
are dirty and deteriorating its air is filthy historic buildings 
stand unrepaired and public transportation is overloaded 
the problems facing the muscovites are representative of those 
facing reformers who scored big in local runoff elections this 
week in the three large slavic republics of the soviet union 
russia the ukraine and byelorussia 
originally held together by vague reformist ideas democratic 
russia is now finding it hard to consolidate and work out a joint 
program of action the first question is whether to stick together 
or split up 
we came to this bloc from various groups because we all shared 
some democratic views a councilman who gave his name as fadeyev 
told about 150 activists tuesday at a meeting at moscow state 
university 
but now this stage is over we see that there are 
communists socialists social democrats and even christian 
socialists among us we do not need this totality anymore 
others said the group must stay united at any cost because a 
split would strengthen hardcore communist party bureaucrats who 
still hold many government posts 
we must be united the only hope of the old party apparatus is 
to cause a split among us pleaded sergei sukhorukov a 
councilman 
according to the moscow electoral commission the alliance won 
55 of moscows 65 seats in russias parliament in election runoffs 
in republics and municipalities this week democratic russia also 
gained control of 263 seats in the 465seat moscow city council 
ensuring itself a 60percent majority 
but it is unclear exactly what many of those new council members 
stand for 
we did not use serious screening when we choose democratic 
russia candidates vladimir krylovsky chairman of a moscow 
reformist voters club said in an interview when it seemed to 
us that a candidate shared some of our views we had to throw our 
support behind him 
there will be much discord and wavering but still i see this 
as a victory 
among the few concrete steps the group took tuesday was asking 
moscows prosecutor to investigate antisemitic leaflets that 
appeared during the elections and called democratic russia a 
united jewish front and demanding local newspapers include 
party affiliation when identifying election winners 
we shall decide the question of appointing a city prosecutor 
in accordance with whether he would be able to emerge with results 
before our decision said radical economist gavriil popov who 
presided at the meeting same with editors of local newspapers 
and tv shows 
he read a draft manifesto that included promises of freedom of 
political and religious activity in moscow of a largescale 
development program plots of land near the city to build country 
houses for all who want them as well as farreaching plans to give 
governmentowned apartments free to the residents 
the gathering moved to debate the upcoming session of the city 
council or mossoviet one member accused its executive council of 
working on the agenda without consulting democratic russia 
but council deputy chairman yuri vinogradov denied it im 
ready to talk at any opportunity and today i decided to come upon 
my own initiative we dont entertain any secret plans he told 
the group 
popov a parliament member asked the gathering to appoint 
committees to work out the movements platform recommendations for 
immediate reforms in the city and a declaration of intentions 
for the first time in the history of our country since 1917 
city council of moscow in its majority will not be controlled by 
local communist party apparatus the document stated 
it never answered the question of what would follow

president bush told polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki on wednesday his countrys borders must not be 
altered by the reunification of germany 
bush delivered his assurance at a sunsplashed ceremony at the 
white house welcoming polands first noncommunist prime minister 
since world war ii 
after the pageantry the two leaders talked privately for a half 
hour and bush invited mazowiecki back for an unscheduled 
discussion thursday mazowiecki also was being honored wednesday 
night at a state dinner 
at the top of the agenda are polands fears that a reunified 
germany might try to claim territory ceded to poland by germany 
after world war ii moreover poland wants a greater role than it 
has been granted in international discussions about german 
reunification 
bush played down any disagreement over polish participation in 
unification talks were really not that far apart he told a 
reporter 
later at a state dinner in his honor mazowiecki said a need 
is emerging for a new structure to gradually free europe of 
military rivalry and bring the two separated parts closer 
together 
reconciliation between nations is possible only when they do 
not fear either for their present or their future for this reason 
an important component of the building must be the recognition of 
the polish border along the oderneisse rivers in the form of a 
treaty said the prime minister he praised the allied agreement 
that has guaranteed poland a direct role in the talks on german 
unification 
bush in his toast said all americans agree that polands 
time has come and all our prayers are with you at this time of 
polands rebirth 
bush was applauded by hundreds of people attending the welcoming 
ceremony when he declared in any decisions affecting the fate of 
poland poland must have a voice 
the president said the world was undergoing turbulent changes 
but that we see a new europe in which the security of all 
european states and their fundamental right to exist secure 
within their present borders is totally assured 
bush said america wants to see poland succeed we want to 
welcome poland as a full partner in the community of nations we 
want to see your people enjoy the fruits of free enterprise 
bush had telephoned west german chancellor helmut kohl on 
tuesday to press the us position that polands current borders 
must be maintained in the german unification process 
to the dismay of the united states poland also has said that 
unlike its eastern european neighbors it wants soviet troops to 
remain inside its territory apparently out of concern about 
germany 
we are hopeful that it will not be necessary to have soviet 
troops in poland and we find it hard to believe that they really 
want that white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
shortly before mazowiecki arrived 
the presence of soviet troops is something that is a little 
surprising to us fitzwater said we frankly dont think that 
will be necessary in the long run 
bush and mazowiecki capped wednesdays meeting by signing a 
treaty designed to spur us investment in polands ailing economy 
the agreement the first us economic treaty with any of the 
emerging democracies in eastern europe provides internationally 
recognized protections and procedures for business transactions 
mazowiecki said poland had sparked the process of democratic 
revolution across eastern europe the victory of that revolution 
will in a large measure depend upon our success 
therefore mazowiecki said we must succeed and i do 
believe that we will 
poland has expressed unhappiness with its role in meetings of 
the six nations that are discussing german reunification the 
conference consisting of east and west germany the united states 
britain france and the soviet union has agreed to invite polish 
representatives when polands western borders are discussed 
mazowiecki has said he wants the united states to support 
polands demand for a signed treaty guaranteeing its borders before 
the two germanys unite 
standing alongside bush mazowiecki said we have come from a 
country building a new democratic order we have come from a 
country which wants to and can play a significant role in the new 
emerging order in europe 
however he noted there are strains in the relationship 
the time of the present crucial acceleration of history is 
also one in which partnership is being put to test the prime 
minister said 
affirming us reluctance to expand polands role in the 
sixnation talks assistant secretary of state raymond seitz said 
the conference had a fairly restricted mandate there are a 
variety of ways in which poland can express itself on a variety of 
concerns 
he said that while there may be some differences over 
procedures we know what the border is we regard that as a 
permanent border and there is nothing that is going to change our 
view 
bush and mazoweicki hailed the investment treaty they signed 
bush called it a milestone on the road to a properous poland 
and a stronger uspolish partnership 
mazoweicki said the treaty offers a certain framework and 
what needs to be done now is to fill it with contents

the fbi released composite drawings wednesday of 
the two thieves who committed the art theft of the century at the 
gardner museum when they stole 11 priceless paintings and prints 
even before a 1 million reward was posted tipsters began 
calling the isabella stewart gardner museum and the fbi hinting 
they knew where the artworks could be found officials said 
the public was allowed inside the museum wednesday for the first 
time since the crime with two of its looted rooms now behind 
police barricades 
two men wearing police uniforms talked their way into the 
museum early sunday and made off with 11 paintings and prints by 
such artists as rembrandt and degas they also swiped an ancient 
chinese vase and a gilded eagle from a napoleonic flag pole 
the fbi composite drawings showed two white men in policemens 
hats one was depicted with gold wirerimmed glasses a strong jaw 
and was described as being in his late 20s to early 30s with dark 
hair and eyes medium build and 5foot7 to 5foot10 the other 
shown with pronounced cheekbones was thought to be in his early to 
mid30s with dark hair and eyes 180 pounds and 6feet or 6foot1 
the composites showed both with mustaches and without because 
authorities believe they might have worn fake mustaches during the 
robbery 
the items taken from what was the late mrs gardners personal 
collection are considered too wellknown to be sold on the open 
market and have been estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
the international auction houses sothebys and christies 
underwrote the 1 million reward tuesday for safe return of the 
works the fbi and the museum were fielding tips around the clock 
and deciding which might be the real thing 
youre generally talking about thieves that are going to be in 
contact with others in criminal circles and thats where it 
generally comes from said fbi agent dennis ocallaghan 
he declined to comment on whether staff at the museum had been 
given lie detector tests but said former employees were being 
questioned a standard practice in such cases 
museum director anne hawley said the museum while hoping to get 
the pictures back was also worried about what kind of damage might 
have occurred when they were removed from their frames 
theres always a question of what happens to a painting when 
you roll it up there can be flaking and chipping she said 
paintings are like human beings and they have to be taken care 
of 
while experts have suggested the thieves were selective in what 
they took possibly indicating it was a commissioned crime hawley 
disagreed 
i frankly dont think they were as knowlegeable about art 
she said i think they were knowledgeable about crime 
hawley said mong tipsters calling the museum included a woman 
who reached her tuesday claiming to have received an anonymous 
call from someone who claims to know where the works are 
hawley said the caller was a woman in the art community outside 
boston whose name was known to her she declined to identify her 
the woman called asking how large the reward was one hour before 
the reward was announced

voters in this chicago suburb have made it

eight cars and a companion piece of sculpture at a local shopping 
plaza 
they urged scrapping of the usedcar kebab called spindle 
by a 2to1 margin and voted 3to1 to get rid of big 
bilbored a 40ton 40foot amalgam of television sets radios 
hair dryers and concrete 
the owner says hes leaving them in place for now despite the 
results of tuesdays advisory referendum though he believes that 
in a public space i think the public has some rights 
it was a very interesting referendum said developerart 
collector david bermant 70 of rye ny who owns the shopping 
center and contributed his 1975 bmw to spindle 
bermant said he has placed a couple hundred sculptures in 
shopping centers around the country without any problems from local 
critics 
the works express a common theme taking the technical 
discoveries and scientific theories and the products of a 
technological society and translating them into aesthetic 
objects he said in a telephone interview from his second home in 
santa barbara calif 
this art form will endure said bermant 
but spindle was rejected by a vote of 5512 to 2450 and 
big bilbored was put down 6379 to 1662 in this community of 
about 53000 
the 100000 spindle by los angeles artist dustin schuler

federal authorities filed a 10 million civil 
racketeering lawsuit wednesday against two teamsters locals 
charging that the mafia has dominated the air freight business at 
kennedy airport for two decades 
the lawsuit against locals 295 and 851 of the international 
brotherhood of teamsters alleges a 20year pattern of labor 
racketeering involving extortion illegal payoffs securities fraud 
and obstruction of justice 
it also names current and past union officials and associates of 
the gambino and lucchese crime families many of the defendants are 
either in jail or awaiting trial for organized crime activities 
the suit seeks to recover some 10 million in illegal gains from 
18 defendants remove the mobs influence from the unions and force 
the selection of a courtappointed trustee to assume control of the 
two locals 
the 150plus page complaint names the leadership of the two 
unions and a number of reputed mobsters including anthony 
guerrieri he and reputed gambino boss john gotti were recently 
acquitted of assault charges in a shooting attack on a carpenters 
union leader 
us attorney andrew j maloney said the airfreight business 
is particularly vulnerable because of the nature of the business 
time is of the essence any kind of a slowdown or a strike 
effectively puts them out of business 
james m fox assistant director in charge of the fbis new york 
office said organized crime has owned the airfreight business 
at jfk for decades 
they accomplished this through extortion bribery security 
fraud and obstruction of justice said fox speaking at a news 
conference with maloney at the federal courthouse in brooklyn where 
the lawsuit was filed 
maloney said the mobcontrolled unions extorted payoffs through 
a number of means including threatened and actual strikes and work 
slowdowns 
the air freight forwarders many of them now out of business 
often found it cheaper and quicker to make cash payments to the 
unions rather than oppose them maloney said 
more than half of the air freight coming into the united states 
passes through john f kennedy international airport and the 
illegal activities pushed up air freight costs to consumers the 
authorities said 
no union officials were available to respond to the charges 
according to people who answered the telephones at the locals 
offices 
five weeks ago the federal government sued three organized 
crime groups and six dockworkers union locals accusing the mob of 
exercising a decadeslong stranglehold on the new york and new 
jersey waterfront 
the civil racketeering lawsuit claims that organized crime 
including the gambino family has controlled the international 
longshoremans association locals through murder extortion 
embezzlement of union funds and illegal labor payoffs

united press international won a stay in federal 
appeals court tuesday preventing reuters from breaking a picture 
exchange contract between the two news services 
us district judge peter k leisure last week denied upis 
request for a preliminary injunction that would have forced reuters 
to honor the contract pending trial 
leisure extended an earlier order barring reuters from canceling 
the contract until monday to allow upi to appeal his decision on 
the injunction 
on tuesday a threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals granted upi a further stay which means the contract stays 
in effect at least until the appeal is heard 
judge john newman scheduled oral arguments for the week of april 
16 
the request for the injunction stemmed from a counterclaim made 
by upi to a lawsuit filed by reuters in us district court 
the 10year contract which began in 1985 calls for upi to 
supply reuters with pictures from the united states while reuters 
provided upi with pictures from other countries upi had sold its 
international phot service to reuters 
the main issue is the volume and quality of upi pictures to 
reuters has significantly declined and reuters is entitled to break 
the contract robert sugarman attorney for reuters told the 
appeals court

washington the bush administration told congress wednesday it 
would not seek to control the content of art supported with federal 
tax dollars the decision seemed sure to anger rightwing 
republicans 
controversy over whether to restrict content of federally 
financed art received extensive publicity last year because of two 
photographic exhibits supported by money from the national 
endowment for the arts 
one by robert mapplethorpe included depictions of 
sadomasochism and homoerotic acts another by andres serrano 
depicted a crucifix in a jar of urine 
as a result this years spending bill contained restrictions 
inspired by sen jesse helms rnc on financing obscene works 
and gave a definition of obscene within limits set by the supreme 
court the restrictions were good only for one year 
in submitting legislation wednesday to extend the existence of 
the arts endowment for another five years starting oct 1 the 
bush administration chose not to include content restrictions 
similar to those that apply this year 
john f frohnmayer chairman of the arts endowment spelled out 
the administrations reasoning in testimony before the house 
education and labor subcommittee on postsecondary education 
he said the content restrictions in effect this year caused 
much concern and confusion within the arts community 
after much careful thought and discussion it is our 
conclusion that the legislation proposed here which contains no 
content restrictions along with measures discussed earlier will 
best serve the american public frohnmayer said 
the other measures mentioned by frohnmayer include ways to 
improve the system for evaluating grants the nea will develop a 
grid to assure that all geographic areas are represented and 
that as many cultures as possible are represented the makeup of 
the evaluation panels also will be diversified 
will these modifications in the panel process eliminate 
controversy he asked probably not i do not see as a 
desirable goal that the art which the federal government supports 
be so bland that no one even notices it 
anne g murphy executive director of the american arts 
alliance which opposes content restrictions said she was pleased 
by frohnmayers comments but cautious about whether the 
administration will succeed in keeping nea free of such 
restrictions 
i think its a first step in what is going to be a prolonged 
debate over the next six weeks she said 
helms in raleigh said he had asked the independent general 
accounting office to investigate whether the nea is financing 
pornographic art 
in a letter to charles bowsher head of the gao helms said 
frohnmayer may be sincere in saying no nea funds are being used to 
support obscene art 
but the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is 
imperative that there be an objective investigation by an agency 
independent of the nea helms wrote 
the restrictions that helms helped put in this years law 
expressly forbid spending tax money on depictions of 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in sex acts and materials that lack 
serious artistic value 
frohnmayer in his testimony condemned obscenity but also gave 
a long defense of freedom of expression he criticized the 
religious fundamentalist groups such as the 700 club and the 
american family association for spreading misinformation about the 
arts endowment 
defenders of the nea say only 25 of 80000 grants in the 
endowments history have been controversial 
frohnmayer a lawyer from portland ore said in an interview 
after his testimony that bush personally opposed content 
restrictions although the president is very troubled with some of 
the images and we are certainly aware of avoiding the excesses on 
both sides 
frohnmayer said he opposed content restrictions because the 
original legislation for the nea the original concept for the arts 
endowment is that it be free from political and content 
restrictions and that is really required for creativity to 
flourish

the senate rejected 5936 a resolution 
wednesday night urging president bush to grant immediate diplomatic 
recognition to the breakaway government of lithuania 
the sponsor sen jesse helms rnc attempted to attach the 
resolution to unrelated legislation but he failed in his attempt 
a symbolic criticism of the administrations caution over 
lithuanias attempt to secede from the soviet union 
democrats helped republican leaders in the opposition to the 
helms proposal 
voting in favor of the resolution were 27 republicans and just 
nine democrats opposed were 44 democrats and 15 republicans 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas told colleagues the 
white house opposed the resolution yet predicted wrongly that it 
would pass 
the matter should be left to the president sen john 
chafee rri said in support of dole 
all it can do is create mischief said sen dale bumpers 
dark 
lithuanias parliament declared independence from the soviet 
union on march 11 and its fledgling government has been seeking 
recognition from other nations 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev however has declared the 
indepenence decree illegal though gorbachev has said he would not 
use force soviet troops have been conducting exercises in the 
area and gorbachev on wednesday issued a directive to lithuanians 
to turn in their firearms 
lithuania was one of the provinces of the russian czar before 
the 1917 bolshevik revolution it was able to establish its 
independence along with the neighbiring baltic states of estonia 
and latvia in the turmoil that followed the revolution 
indepedence its maintained until the soviet army invaded the 
country in 1940 and attached it to the soviet union 
the united states never withdrew diplomatic recognition from the 
1940 government and the lithuanian community in the united states 
has maintained a legation with full diplomatic standing ever 
since 
the white house has declined to recognize the current government 
although it has urged the soviet union to honor the will of the 
lithuanian people and refrain from using force 
the administrations refusal of recognition has widely been 
attributed to reluctance on the part of the white house to be seen 
opposing gorbachev whom it considers the best hope for progress in 
the soviet union and who is under pressure from several directions 
the sense of the senate resolution offered by helms would 
not have been binding such symbolic resolutions are frequent 
helms congratulated bush for urging moscow to begin talks with 
the lithuanian people but then called on the administration to 
recognize the breakaway governmenet and name a us ambassador to 
lithuania 
more than 100 members of the house earlier sent bush a letter 
urging that lithuania be recognized as an independent nation 
all the lithuanians ask for is moral and political support 
said the letter drafted by reps john miller rwa and richard 
durbin dill

flooding rivers receded wednesday in most of alabama and some 
evacuees returned to homes and businesses while florida officials 
worked to evacuate people remaining in the path of rising water 
president bush declared parts of southeast alabama a major 
disaster area wednesday night making individuals and local 
governments in coffee county including hardhit elba eligible for 
federal grants and lowinterest loans the white house said other 
areas may be designated for assistance later 
some central georgia cities along swollen waterways began to 
recover from flooding wednesday but cities in the southern part of 
the state were told to prepare for their share of problems 
flooding in the florida panhandle had already forced evacuation 
of almost 2200 people and state officials predicted more than 
1700 of them might have to remain out of their homes for several 
days 
many of the 2000 evacuees from hardhit elba ala returned 
while emergency crews tried to restore clean water power and 
telephone lines to the mudcaked city 
for some the return five days after up to 16 inches of rain 
fell was devastating 
theres three generations of antiques and family heirlooms in 
there becky hayes said as she stood outside a mudcovered 
warehouse her family owns near elbas town square now its all 
upside down like scrambled eggs 
gene malfer a spokesman for the american red cross said the 
organization estimated that 239 homes in elba were destroyed 286 
suffered major damage and about 70 had minor damage 
a building sat in the middle of an intersection where it was 
left by high water from the pea river that poured over a broken 
levee early saturday vehicles at a usedcar dealership were piled 
on top of each other 
allen morse of the army corps of engineers who is overseeing 
the levee rebuilding process said the first priority is 
temporarily filling four breaks in the elba levee because of the 
likelihood of more rain he said permanent repairs could take 30 
days in ideal conditions 
the flooding was blamed for 11 deaths in alabama 
traffic was backed up as evacuees headed into elba slowed by 
national guard soldiers who set up identification checkpoints to 
allow in only those with homes and businesses in the floodravaged 
area 
however numerous sightseers apparently got by the barriers 
forcing officials to evacuate the town for a few hours to clear the 
streets a gas leak at a high school also prompted a brief 
evacuation from the school 
most homes outside elbas levee had power but fresh water was 
being trucked in as health officials advised against drinking city 
water 
the local high school and middle school which were completely 
covered by water over the weekend still had several inches of 
water inside wednesday but around the coffee county courthouse 
square nothing was left but gooey red mud 
water also had covered the first floor of the courthouse where 
probate childsupport criminal and civil records are stored 
we dont know to what extent the records are salvagable 
said allen tapley of the state administrative office of the courts 
tapley said records of about onethird of alabamas court 
systems have been placed on microfilm mostly in urban areas elba 
though still keeps most of its records on paper 
the worst of floridas flooding came along the choctawhatchee 
river as water from last weeks rain flowed downhill from alabama 
and georgia 
hardest hit was the farming community of caryville where 
emergency official rod westall said the choctawhatchee was 
beginning to recede but not by very much caryville will not be 
out from under water until probably sunday 
the choctawhatchee crested near caryville at 92 feet above 
flood stage late tuesday but was still about 89 feet above flood 
stage wednesday said westall 
caryville usually has a population of about 600 this week 
chickens roosted in trees and a swarm of fire ants floated through 
the middle of town 
the choctawhatchee river south of caryville is still rising 
said westall theres not much down there but there are some 
people fish camps weekend cabins theres not a lot of 
people 
some residents refused to leave their homes including willard 
bailey 56 a semiretired mechanic from caryville he was living 
in a houseboat that was tied to his house sitting in 5 feet of 
water 
i built it a couple of years ago never put it in the 
river bailey said as he maneuvered another smaller boat 
through city streets the river came to it the river floated it 
off the trailer 
in macon ga the ocmulgee river began to recede and officials 
said preliminary tests showed no contamination of the citycounty 
water supply from flooding however residents were asked to boil 
water or drink bottled water as a precaution 
the oconee river at dublin ga was expected to crest during 
the night at 27 feet 6 feet above flood stage flooding of a 
lowlying trailer park and much farm and pastureland as well as 
river access roads can be expected in laurens county and dublin 
with this crest the national weather service said

the defense ministry said wednesday 
about 200 contras attacked sandinista troops in northern nicaragua 
and 10 of the rebels were killed in the fighting 
a ministry news release said the fighting took place tuesday 
near ubu norte 110 miles north of managua in matagalpa province 
it gave no details other than to accuse another contra group of 
rustling 400 head of cattle in central chontales province 
three regional contra commanders meanwhile were reported meeting 
with army officers in the chontales capital of juigalpa to discuss 
rebel demobilization in that area before presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorros government is inaugurated april 25 
rebel commanders tirso moreno cesar chavarria and diogenes 
hernandez met for the second day with an army group headed by lt 
col cesar delgadillo a local commander to plan demobilization 
of the rebels in the 5th military region a military source said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the source refused to give details of the talks about 5000 
contra fighters out of a total of 12000 are believed to be in 
the 5th military region area the rest are in base camps in 
neighboring honduras 
on thursday a us delegation is due in managua to discuss us 
assistance with chamorro advisers to jumpstart nicaraguas 
economy almost paralyzed by us sanctions 10 years of leftist 
sandinista rule and the contra war 
a foreign ministry announcement said the delegation is led by 
joseph sullivan undersecretary of state for interamerican affairs 
senior officials of president daniel ortegas outgoing 
administration will receive immunity from prosecution for official 
acts while in office under a new law passed by the national 
assembly 
ortega proposed the law and it was approved tuesday designed to 
protect sandinista party members from legal action by the new 
chamorro administration 
the measure also provides a lifetime pension for ortega and vice 
president sergio ramirez

coalition ticket beat ortega in feb 25 general elections the two 
sides are negotiating a transfer of power with the sandinistas 
swearing to defend the gains of the revolution that brought 
them to power in 1979 
if the peaceful transfer of power and national reconciliation 
are not achieved its legitimate to protect those who have 
propelled the social economic and judicial transformations that 
now benefit most of the people national assembly president 
carlos nunez said 
during the campaign both uno and sandinista candidates promised 
to make their opponents pay the bill for past misdeeds the 
sandinistas accused uno of being in league with usbacked contras 
who brought civil war to nicaragua uno said the sandinistas 
brought repression and economic misery

both sides still fear vengeance or resistance by the other 
the sandinistacontrolled legislature approved the measure

president mikhail s gorbachev 
increased pressure on the breakaway lithuanian republic wednesday 
by ordering its citizens to turn in their guns and telling the kgb 
to strengthen controls on the republics border 
in a decree certain to heighten tension between lithuania and 
the kremlin gorbachev also temporarily banned the sale of firearms 
in lithuania and said those citizens who do not surrender weapons 
within a week will have them confiscated 
lithuanian president vytautus landsbergis in a statement 
distributed by aides at the supreme council legislature said 
gorbachevs directive amounts to claiming the nonexistent and 
unjustified sovereignty of a powerful country over a small and 
unarmed neighbor 
it could be enforced only by brutal military force he said 
the ghost of stalinism is walking in the kremlin and the 
shadow of it lies far to the west in lithuania landsbergis 
said but he predicted that lithuania would remain serene and 
united 
premier kazimira prunskiene of lithuania told reporters in 
vilnius her government still was counting on negotiations with 
moscow on the republics declaration of independence march 11 
we are not getting too worked up about this she said we 
hope common sense will prevail 
gorbachev has proclaimed the declaration of independence 
invalid but lithuania refuses to recognize his authority 
in issuing the decree gorbachev used powers given him when he 
was elected to the new more powerful presidency last week 
the decree demands that citizens living in lithuania turn all 
their firearms in to temporary police custody within the next seven 
days the tass news agency said 
he directed the interior ministry in the event of citizens 
refusal to turn in these weapons to ensure their confiscation 
gorbachev said despite previous directives from the kremlin 
the lithuanian parliament and government continue passing bills 
that violate the rights of soviet citizens and the sovereignty of 
the ussr 
access to firearms is severely restricted in the soviet union 
and it is unknown how many weapons might be in the hands of 
lithuania residents 
lithuanians have begun signing up for voluntary defense service 
and some lithuanians serving in the soviet armed forces have 
deserted 
gorbachev previously said he expected to talk with lithuanian 
leaders about the declaration of independence and senior officials 
have said the kremlin does not intend to use force to bring the 
baltic republic back into the soviet fold 
the white house reacted with concern to the latest 
developments its a matter that we are watching seriously 
said presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
gorbachev demanded that national and local governments ensure 
that soviet law and the rights of citizens be observed and called 
for kgb border troops to increase security on lithuanias section 
of the soviet border it ordered the government to tighten 
control over issuance to foreigners of visas and permission to 
visit lithuania 
that move apparently was aimed at many ethnic lithuanians who 
have returned recently to help set up an independent government and 
market economy in the republic 
lithuanias parliament voted overwhelmingly march 11 to break 
away from the soviet union and regain the independence it had 
before being forcibly annexed by the kremlin in 1940 along with 
the other baltic republics of estonia and latvia 
those republics have since elected parliaments dominated by 
proindependence legislators but have not declared independence 
a draft law outling requirements for secession passed its first 
legislative hurdle in moscow on wednesday deputies said the 
secession procedure which requires a republicwide referendum and 
a transition period of up to five years would have to be observed 
by lithuania 
but lithuanian legislator vaidotas antanaitis said it did not 
affect his republic the bill doesnt apply to us weve already 
left he said 
on capitol hill in washington meanwhile more than 100 
congressmen sent president bush a letter wednesday urging that 
lithuania be recognized as an independent nation 
all the lithuanians ask for is moral and political support 
said the letter drafted by reps john miller rwa and richard 
durbin dill 
on tuesday night the republic sent a telegram to the kremlin 
complaining about increased activity of soviet soldiers stationed 
on its territory 
the people of lithuania are deeply disturbed about the actions 
of the soviet armed forces the intense mobilization of armored 
vehicles and tanks the intensified flights of military air force 
planes and unauthorized sorties into lithuanian territory by 
paratroopers involved in intelligence activities said 
prunskiene the lithuanian premier in the cable to gorbachev 
a group of soviet deputies wednesday complained that lithuania 
was planning legislation that subjects to summary judgment soviet 
citizens speaking out for preservation of the existing government 
structure and the governmental unity of our country tass 
reported 
the interfax news service of official radio moscow reported that 
the legislation would permit a sentence of up to three years for 
calls for the forcible violation of the sovereignty or 
territorial integrity of the lithuanian republic or for the 
overthrow of the lawful authorities 
a senior lithuanian legislator romualdas ozolas confirmed in 
an interview that such legislation exists but suggested that the 
lithuanian parliament will not approve it such stupidity will 
get us nowhere he said of the proposal 
the soviet deputies whose group is called soyuz appealed to 
gorbachev to use the new powers of the presidency to impose direct 
rule on lithuania tass said

six months after hurricane hugo south 
carolinas timber industry faces major fire threats and a long 
recovery but tourism and other state industries are rebounding 
gov carroll campbell said wednesday 
south carolinians and south carolina deserve the comeback of 
the year award campbell said in releasing a report on relief 
efforts since the storm 
though much of the state has returned to normal 10000 people 
still are displaced and economic impacts on most state industries 
will be felt for at least another year campbell said 
the report was released in the same conference room where 
campbell and other top aides coordinated emergency efforts as the 
storm roared ashore near charleston on sept 21 with 135mph winds 
and storm surges reaching 15 feet the storm left 29 dead and 59 
billion in damage in south carolina 
this thing was a monster campbell said 
since the storm about 200 million in state and federal funds 
have been set aside for local and state governments to rebuild 
public structures and pay such costs as overtime for cleanup 
workers 
about another 200 million has been or will be distributed 
through private and public agencies in affected areas 
an eightmember economic recovery commission appointed by the 
governor is scheduled to present recommendations next week 
campbell said tourism has come back strongly with inquiries 
running at a record pace and traffic at state travel information 
centers up 12 percent from a year ago 
but the timber industry will take much longer to recuperate 
campbell said though he offered no timetable 
according to the report 23 weeks of harvesting have brought 
timber salvage efforts to 41 percent of their goal of 625 million 
cubic feet the danger of fire though has prompted the state 
forestry commission to hire an additional 100 firefighters and to 
arrange for seven more firefighting aircraft 
the forest fire problem may well be the greatest danger that 
we still have to face campbell said 
he gave no indication when a 13member panel reviewing emergency 
management would present its report but he suggested local 
officials needed more training federal officials could offer more 
support and coastal buildings need to follow strict building codes 
the biggest problem we had was some local officials that 
didnt know what to do or didnt know what the governments role 
was and what their role was he said 
i guess you can call it apathy he added nothing happens 
for a long time so you sort of sit there 
he said neither state officials nor federal officials were 
prepared for a disaster as large as hugo which resulted in 
disaster assistance to 24 of the states 46 counties

the white house citing a soviet promise not 
to use force in lithuania reacted with concern wednesday to 
reports that mikhail s gorbachev had ordered all arms confiscated 
in the rebellious republic 
its a matter that we are watching seriously said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater earlier wednesday welcomed assurances by soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze that moscow would not 
intervene with force to block independence in lithuania 
he called shevardnadzes statements very very helpful and 
said the united states would take the soviets at their word 
on wednesday night president bush speaking to reporters at a 
state dinner at the white house was asked if he felt reassured 
about how the soviets were handling the lithuanian situation 
i am only because they restated their views on peaceful 
resolution of the impasse the president said it is highly 
complicated im not suggesting its easy but i see no reason to 
question what theyve said 
but after news of the arms crackdown the presidents spokesman 
said we hope that the statements of the foreign secretary 
yesterday are the course they intend tomorrow 
asked if the administration viewed an edict to turn in arms as 
tantamount to the use of soviet force fitzwater said i dont 
want to give it that kind of definition 
we dont have enough information to react to the development 
more specifically he said 
a directive from gorbachev read on the evening television 
program vremya said the soviet interior ministry should 
confiscate guns from anyone who refused to turn them in to soviet 
authorities 
in another development the senate rejected 5936 a resolution 
that would have urged bush to grant immediate diplomatic 
recognition to the new government of lithuania 
the soviet presidents edict gave lithuanians seven days to 
comply 
we view these press reports with concern we continue to urge

raytheon co said it has pleaded guilty 
to a charge of illegally using classified defense department budget 
and planning documents and has agreed to pay a 1 million fine 
raytheon became the fifth defense contractor to plead guilty to 
trafficking in classified pentagon documents the documents may 
have given companies an advantage over competitors in bidding for 
government contracts 
this matter involved conduct more than five years ago larry 
mccracken a raytheon spokesman said tuesday 
it was contrary to company policy then and it is contrary to 
company policy now and it was done without the knowledge of any 
company director or officer he said 
the other companies that pleaded guilty were boeing the hughes 
aircraft unit of gm corp grumman corp and the rca unit of the 
general electric co their fines ranged from 25 million to 55 
million 
we believe the lower amount of the fines we had reflects our 
somewhat secondary involvement in the matter mccracken said

both parties in premier ruud 
lubbers centerleft government lost in municipal elections 
wednesday in the coalitions first electoral test since coming to 
power in november 
the vote in 607 towns and cities brought big gains for the 
opposition d66 party and the green left members of a leftwing 
threeparty alliance that includes the communist party of the 
netherlands 
the results and an unusually low turnout reflected voter 
dissatifaction with the slowpaced beginning to lubbers third term 
the biggest loser was the labor party of deputy premier wim kok 
who said on dutch television the result showed voter impatience 
with the lack of leftwing policies initiated by the new government 
with 985 percent of the votes counted labor had 249 percent 
of the vote down 7 points from its 319 percent result in last 
septembers parliamentary elections 
lubbers centrist christian democrats who have held the fulcrum 
of power in every dutch government since world war ii rose from 
316 percent of the vote in the last municipal elections in 1986 to 
327 percent on wednesday 
but last september the christian democrats won 3533 percent of 
the vote 
although local issues blurred the picture in some spots the 
overall vote was seen in national terms 
if parliamentary elections were held today both the christian 
democrats and labor would apparently lose seats but together would 
still have a majority in the 150seat parliament 
the d66 party soared from 79 percent in september to 125 
percent wednesday 
the partys leader in parliament hans van mierlo said on tv 
the gain showed voters agreed with its strong environmentalist 
platform 
green left took 68 percent of the vote up 28 percent from 
september 
turnout on a blustery spring day was just above 50 percent in 
most places an unusually low figure in the netherlands 
lubbers referring to the sweeping changes in eastern europe 
said in a television interview people who followed the news on 
radio and television in the past half year saw so many important 
events that what was happening here looked a little insignificant 
the rightwing liberals scored 147 percent of the vote 
wednesday up from 146 last september but sharply down from their 
176 in 1986 municipal voting

the conservative government of 
president alfredo cristiani offered unconditionally wednesday to 
renew talks with leftist rebels possibly in april to try to end 
el salvadors 10yearold civil war 
the offer came in a statement read by spokesman mauricio 
sandoval at a news conference 
it said the government is ready to resume the process of 
dialogue without any prior conditions 
sandoval said in responding to questions that while government 
officials had no firm date in mind for meeting with leaders of the 
rebel farabundo marti national liberation front such an initial 
meeting could be held in april 
a monthly round of talks begun last june were broken off nov 11 
when the guerrillas launched a threeweek allout offensive 
against san salvador in retaliation for the bombing of a leftist 
union hall 
the rebels accused the military of responsibility for the 
bombing which killed 10 union leaders and wounded 30 activists 
the armed forces denied it 
since then the government has been insisting the rebels 
publicly renounce all attacks against civilian targets as a 
condition for renewing the talks 
last week the guerrillas promised not to attack nonmilitary 
objectives and the government called that positive 
more than 71000 people have been killed since the civil war

a homosexual lover of the late liberace 
testified wednesday that he gave evidence about four bludgeoning 
murders in laurel canyon in exchange for leniency in his own 
robbery case 
scott alan thorson took the stand in the murder trial of eddie 
nash and said the convicted drug dealer and former night club 
owner made incriminating statements about the slayings 
thorson received a probationary sentence but claimed he did not 
get any leniency in exchange for his cooperation 
nash 60 also known as adel nasrallah and his bodyguard 
gregory dewitt diles 41 are being tried in the 1981 bludgeoning 
slayings of four people in a laurel canyon drug den both man could 
face the death penalty if convicted 
prosecutors contend nash ordered the killings in retaliation for 
a burglary at his posh studio city home two days before the 
slayings money drugs jewelry and other items worth about 1 
million were stolen 
defense attorney edward rucker has said nash was not involved in 
the slayings and that the killings occurred when the thieves fought 
over how to divide the spoils 
prosecutors filed murder charges against nash in 1988 based 
mostly on new evidence provided earlier that year by thorson who 
was in jail on a robbery charge 
during a preliminary hearing in 1989 thorson testified he first 
met nash when buying drugs and later moved in with him after a 
falling out with liberace 
thorson said nash never directly admitted his involvement in the 
killings but said he would force the robbers to beg for mercy and 
claimed the slayings got out of hand 
thorson 32 a former las vegas dancer sued liberace claiming 
the late piano player promised him 70000 a year in return for 
being his livein lover and chauffeur the case was settled out of 
court in 1984 liberace died of aids in february 1987 
the late porn film star john holmes was tried and acquitted of 
the killings in 1982 after he was accused of planning the robbery 
and then when cornered by nash helping to arrange the murders 
holmes reportedly confessed his role in the slayings shortly before 
dying of aids in 1988

miscommunications between technicians and computer 
engineers were to blame for the failure of a martin marietta corp 
rocket to deploy a 150 million communications satellite company 
officials said 
the commercial titan was wired to carry two satellites when only 
one was aboard company officials said monday 
the 5ton intelsat satellite was left stranded in space last 
wednesday when it failed to separate from the rockets upper stage 
a clamshelllike device that can house up to two satellites the 
satellite remains in an orbit closer to earth than is useful with 
little chance for recovery 
the mistake may cost as much as 500 million including lost 
revenue from transmitting telephone calls and television signals 
space analysts say 
the technicians in charge of the boosters electric system and 
the computer software engineers were working in the same building 
martin marietta officials said 
no one was goofing off or being secretive said company 
spokesman steve frank it was language that each group thought 
meant the same thing 
martin marietta officials at cape canaveral fla found the 
same wiring problem in an identical commercial titan rocket 
scheduled to be launched in june carrying another intelsat 
satellite 
a board of inquiry has been formed to investigate the incident 
and recommend improvements frank said 
company investigators found that martin marietta electricians 
apparently wired the rocket in a configuration allowing it to 
release two satellites the wires in turn were connected to a 
computer that was supposed to trigger the separation of the 
satellite from the rocket 
when ground crews ordered the computer to send its signal the 
faulty design prevented it from traveling past the satellite to the 
separation device 
it was a case where the computer people said they would launch 
the first payload and the wiring people thought that meant the 
bottom payload compartment frank said there was just nothing 
at the separation device to receive the signal 
the denver post today quoted anonymous sources close to the 
investigation as saying the company is likely to adopt prelaunch 
checks including a mock satellite separation on the ground using 
the firing commands employed in space

the vatican said tuesday it is pleased with progress 
in efforts to legalize the ukrainian catholic church in the soviet 
union but the ukrainian church said one of its representatives 
walked out of the latest talks and any agreement would be invalid 
soviet dictator josef stalin suppressed the church in 1946 and 
forcibly merged it with the russian orthodox church it has since 
been a stumbling block in vaticansoviet relations 
but in a new climate underlined by establishment of official 
vaticansoviet ties last week negotiations have been started to 
legalize the ukrainian catholic church which has more than 4 
million followers in the soviet union 
the latest development indicates that at least some in the 
ukrainian catholic church are taking a harder line than the vatican 
talks began in the ukrainian city of lvov on march 5 bringing 
together vatican ukrainian catholic and russian orthodox 
representatives one major issue was the property the orthodox 
church took from the ukrainian catholic church after 1946 
formal legalization awaits approval of a new law on religious 
freedom promised by president mikhail s gorbachev when he met pope 
john paul ii at the vatican on dec 1 agreement also needs to be 
reached with the russian orthodox church on about 450 confiscated 
churches and other property 
the press office in rome of the ukrainian catholic church said 
that one its representatives archbishop volodymyr sterniuk 
abandoned the lvov talks in protest march 13 and as a result any 
document that emanates from the negotiations must be considered 
without legal value 
the statement criticized what it called the constant refusal 
of the moscow patriachate of the orthodox church to recognize the 
ukrainian church as a separate legal entity and not just a group of 
believers ukrainian catholics pratice the byzantine or eastern 
rite but look to rome for guidance and recognize the leadership of 
the pope 
the statement said to have been signed by seven ukrainian 
bishops also said that only after all church property was returned 
would it be possible to consider the problems of orthodox 
congregations displaced by the return of the confiscated churches 
but chief vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the holy see 
was very satisfied with the agreements reached so far with 
orthodox church representatives 
the problem is evolving in a manner which we judge positive 
he said 
navarro said he didnt have details of the accords but that they 
were agreed upon after sterniuk left the talks and that a second 
ukrainian catholic church representative remained on 
there was no immediate announcement on another round of talks

the american society of newspaper editors on 
tuesday criticized defense secretary dick cheneys delay in 
alerting the 16member press pool of the us invasion of panama 
last december 
cheneys decision to delay calling the pool until after the 
close of office hours and the broadcast of the evening news made 
assembling the pool difficult and actually increased the security 
problem said jean otto chairman of the asnes pressbarpublic 
affairs committee 
it also assured that the pool would not arrive until hours 
after the invasion was launched on dec 20 otto associate 
editor of the rocky mountain news said in a news release 
the asne statement came as a pentagonsponsored report was 
released saying the us news media missed the start of the 
invasion because cheney decided secrecy was more important than 
ensuring news coverage 
the report also criticized cheneys press secretary pete 
williams for not trying to convince the secretary to send a group 
of reporters and photographers to panama in time to cover the 
critical opening battles 
i take the blame for what happened in panama williams said 
in response to the report 
he said the defense department was fully committed to the idea 
of allowing the news media to cover military operations and that 
steps already were being taken to correct problems described in the 
latest study 
a pool system was established by representatives of the pentagon 
and the news media after the 1983 invasion of grenada it is 
designed to have objective observers inform american citizens from 
the start of military actions involving us personnel 
in addition to the delay in alerting the media the military was 
unprepared to transport reporters to the scene of the fighting 
otto said 
since the creation of the pool there has been no security 
breach involving the press she said cheneys lack of trust 
has instead breached the right of the press to report and of 
americans to learn what happens early in military actions 
if a pool arrangement is to work the pentagon and especially 
the defense secretary must have enough confidence to let it 
happen otto said if they do not then the pool is a sham and 
the press should call it by its right name

the design was wrong said judy stowell a spokeswoman for 
martin marietta corp which built the rocket our analysis shows 
an engineering design error caused the vehicle to be wired 
improperly 
as a result after the titan was launched on march 14 the 
satellite didnt separate automatically as it was supposed to when 
engineers sent a separation signal a small rocket that was to 
boost the satellite to its duty station stayed with the spent titan

president chadli bendjedid is pushing algeria 
toward democracy but at a cautious pace 
islamic fundamentalists oppose some of his programs they have 
not been specific about their own vision of algeria however and 
bendjedids position seems secure as he modifies institutions to 
allow more representative government 
bendjedid 61 has made few speeches during 11 years in power 
and rarely appears in public he was a regional military commander 
and got substantial help from the army in attaining the presidency 
in 1979 after the death of houari boumedienne who had left no 
clear successor 
algeria has taken a pronounced turn toward democracy since the 
army has withdrawn from the political councils of the ruling 
national liberation front and professes neutrality 
a popular uprising in 1988 ended the fronts undisputed rule 
over all areas of society and 20 political parties now are 
registered the front holds all the parliament seats but more than 
70 percent of voters approved a constitutional amendment last year 
that in theory makes algeria a multiparty democracy 
multiparty local elections are scheduled for june 12 and 
parliamentary elections are required within two years but the 
country has a long way to go in turning democratic concepts into 
reality 
hundreds of thousands of officials bureaucrats and workers in 
nationalized companies are used to the job security free insurance 
and free health services acquired in a generation of oneparty 
rule the press is allowed to dissent but tends to await official 
guidance on controversial issues 
the results of the changes have become very difficult to 
evaluate in an exhaustive and precise manner but the process is 
beneficial ahcenedjaballah belkacem head of the official news 
agency aps wrote in the government daily el moudjahid 
what had been a a military dictatorship gives new parties 1 
million each to help them get started he wrote the judiciary is 
free of government control citizens feel they can oppose 
government actions and demagogic oratory is less prevalent than 
before belkacem said 
in a cautionary note he added that other aspects of the new 
freedoms such as wildcat strikes and a growing unemployment 
problem are negatives for which we will have to pay a heavy 
price now and for a certain time to come 
abasso madani of the islamic salvation front the largest 
opposition party said algerias main problem is a leadership 
crisis 
in his first televised political statement the opposition 
leader said bendjedid had not given a clear picture of his plans 
for algeria 
madani said little of what his fundamentalists would do a few 
vague words about cutting government expenses including military 
spending and rejecting socialism communism and liberalism 
left listeners uncertain of his political program 
he also was not specific on the rights of women 
any woman who accepts that she is a moslem must accept all the 
consequences that result from this choice madani declared 
causing many women to wonder what he had in mind for them 
fundamentalist leaders have a growing voice in national 
politics but most of their followers are poorly educated 
unemployed men the middle classes and the vast majority of 
algerian women oppose rule by islamic law 
algerians generally are accustomed to supporting or at least 
not challenging whoever holds power that means bendjedid probably 
will continue as president and algeria will develop a form of 
democracy possibly through slow and undramatic steps

ornithologists say the european white 
stork a fabled carrier of good fortune and babies for centuries 
is in danger of becoming extinct 
bird watchers are waiting to see how many storks return from 
their annual migration last spring only 15 came back to denmark 
their northernmost meeting point in europe 
that compares with an estimated 4000 breeding pairs a century 
ago similar reductions in the number of white storks once common 
as far south as the balkans have been reported elsewhere in europe 
hans skov of the ornithological society said the number of 
storks in denmark had declined by half in only a decade and at 
this rate will disappear altogether by the year 2000 
he and aides are putting wagon wheels dressed with straw on 
farmhouse roofs telephone poles and chimneys as convenient nesting 
places for the storks when they complete the 7500mile journey 
from southern africa 
white storks are considered good omens particularly of 
fertility and traditionally have been encouraged to build their 
nests on housetops 
wagon wheels were a form of encouragement to storks in the 
middle ages when it was believed a stork on the roof brought good 
luck to the house skov said in an interview 
bird lovers should be careful to provide favorable nesting 
conditions because modern tile roofs are slippery a poor foothold 
for the birds he said 
most of denmarks remaining storks live in the jutland peninsula 
in the north sea ornithologists say about nine of 10 storks return 
from their annual migration to a spot within less than 350 feet of 
their old nests 
white storks which have wingspans of 6 feet and weigh about 
nine pounds are on the retreat all along their migration route 
skov said 
african drought and human expansion into bird habitats took a 
toll in the 1980s he said and the birds are hunted in lebanon 
use of chemical fertilizers and the draining of fields for 
farming have destroyed european wetlands where storks fed on toads 
snakes and insects but the largest single cause of adult stork 
deaths may be hightension power lines 
electrocution kills about half the adult storks that die in 
denmark and about 70 percent in west germany skov said 
when the wild stork neared extinction in the netherlands in the 
1970s the society for the protection of birds began a 
rehabilitation project adult birds were induced to mate in 
controlled conditions at a stork village in grootammers a 
western town and at 12 breeding stations around the country 
offspring were released at selected locations erik wanders a 
spokesman for the society said the netherlands now has more than 
200 project storks project storks tend to migrate less than 
wild storks he said they hang around the places where they 
were released and most of them remain here during the winter

it is an ideal of sorts a seemingly perfect 
target a goal to shoot for but some people think it might have 
terrible consequences such as throwing people out of work and 
undermining the economy 
it is zero inflation and its a temptation 
were the goal to be achieved without real problems it would be a 
crowning achievement for the chairman of the federal reserve and 
his aides it would be their place in history their washington 
monument 
but can it be achieved or is it like an exquisite museum piece 
encased in glass there to be contemplated but never possessed 
nobody really knows 
note the united states has achieved very low inflation such as 
levels of less than 2 percent in the 1960s it has suffered many 
zerominus levels as in the great depression when the economy 
shrank rather than grew 
in fact it actually achieved zero inflation during peacetime 
right on the nose in relatively recent memory in 1936 although it 
is generally agreed that the degree of economic destruction was 
ruinous 
but nobody seems to remember any concerted attempt to reduce 
inflation to zero without slowing the economy to the point where 
recession became the more serious problem 
the controversy is alive again because the notion is making the 
rounds in washington the idea being that only when inflation is 
destroyed will the country be able to safely embark on strong 
growth again 
some powerful people support the idea alan greenspan federal 
reserve chairman hasnt ruled it out martin feldstein former 
chairman of the council of economic advisers thinks it could be 
achieved in five years 
others are emphatically against the attempt such as benjamin 
friedman harvard economics professor he testified in washington 
that a substantial reduction in inflation will involve some 
heavyweight tradeoffs 
the most serious of the tradeoffs is a reduced level of 
economic activity punctuated by lower production lower sales 
higher unemployment reduced revenues for all branches of 
government restraints on social programs 
the list could be endless 
a study by the congressional research service suggests that zero 
inflation within five years achieved by means of restrictive 
monetary policies would bring on a serious recession 
among other consequences it listed these 
negative gross national product for each year of the 1990 to 
1993 period an unemployment rise to 12 percent for 1993 an 
interest rate of 17 percent in 1993 for 90day treasury bills and 
a quadrupling of the budget deficit 
nobody can prove such a scenario but the fearsome possibilities 
are enough to suggest to some people that the effort isnt worth 
taking for them it is probing the unknown the economic 
equivalent of genetic engineering 
john wright bridgeport conn businessman investment adviser 
and economist worries about the pursuit but contends zero 
inflation shouldnt be seen as either necessarily undesirable or 
unachievable per se 
common sense tells us says wright a frequent critic of 
monetary restraints and high interest rates that inflation is 
caused only by an excess of demand over the supply of goods and 
services 
as he sees it restraints on money supply which makes up most 
of the federal reserve antiinflation program is simply a means of 
limiting excessive demand but he observes policies can affect 
both demand and supply 
it would be safer he suggests for the antiinflation program 
to control demand by providing incentives for savings and 
encourage efficient production supply by lowering the cost of 
capital investment

academy award season wouldnt be complete 
without a town full of busted egos this year is no exception with 
acclaimed filmmakers from spike lee to michael moore grumbling 
about their oscar snubs 
lee the respected writerdirector of do the right thing 
and moore who won acclaim for roger amp me have cause for 
complaint lees film landed on 81 film critics top 10 lists but 
earned just two nominations and is not up for best picture 
roger amp me the documentary embraced by critics and audiences 
with equal zeal was blanked completely 
we wuz robbed said lee we got jerked out of best 
director best film i think my cinematographer did a great job 
i know in my heart that my father bill lee deserved a 
nomination for best score 
a bitter moore said when nominations were revealed that his film 
violated two of the principal rules of documentary filmmaking 
it was entertaining and people were going to see it 
director bruce beresfords driving miss daisy led all films 
with nine nominations but beresford was not named in the best 
director competition 
enemies a love story which opened to rave reviews earned 
just three nominations and the elaborately produced batman 
drew just one nomination for art direction ed zwick the director 
of glory was bypassed too glory also was not named for 
best picture 
one of the most successful independent movies of the 1980s 
sex lies and videotape collected only one nomination for 
original screenplay 
my left foot was one of the few films that impressed both 
the toughest critics and voters in the academy of motion picture 
arts and sciences among its five nominations was a best supporting 
actress selection to brenda fricker 
i had won the los angeles film critics awards and thought 
well in the film center of the world the critics said youve done 
something right fricker said it never crossed my mind for one 
second i would be nominated why the surprise the oscars tend to 
prefer safe but socially relevant films such as born on 
the fourth of july eight nominations dead poets society 
four nominations and glory five nominations 
drugstore cowboy a gritty work about selfindulgent drug 
addicts on a crime spree was selected as film of the year by the 
national society of film critics unsafe and scarcely socially 
conscious it earned no oscar nominations 
for the second year in a row academy voters did not nominate 
the years most praised documentary last year errol morris the 
thin blue line which led to the release of wrongly convicted 
murderer randall dale adams was overlooked for best documentary 
feature best picture best director and best score by philip 
glass 
this year the victim was roger amp me moores controversial 
chronicle of general motors and its effect on unemployment and the 
economy of flint mich 
the omission of roger amp me prompted 44 filmmakers to write 
the academy expressing their shock and outrage over the 
perceived oversight the filmmakers asked that the academy consider 
changing the documentary voting 
some of hollywoods more humble performers say the real honor is 
just being nominated however both the turning point 1977 
and the color purple 1985 earned an impressive 11 
nominations neither won one trophy 
the slight was probably greater with steven spielbergs the 
color purple spielberg won the best director prize from the 
directors guild of america that year but wasnt nominated by the 
academy only three times since 1949 has the dga winner not 
repeated at the oscars 
an oscar insult has as much to do with money as it does pride 
unemployment and underemployment in the movie business is soaring 
on any average week only 10 percent of the screen actors guild 
is working the average actors income is 10400 and 80 percent 
of the guilds membership annually earns less than 5000 from 
sagrelated work 
in any given year half of the writers guild of america west 
does not work the dga does not supply employment data 
why do people want to win oscars its the same reason why 
horse owners want to win the derby in england said shane 
connaughton whos nominated with jim sheridan for best adapted 
screenplay for my left foot 
and of course the money is very important if you win your 
price goes up 
recognition such as an oscar nomination means added dollars both 
for the talent and the studio touchstone home video for example 
has moved the video release of dead poets society to march 28 
if the film wins any statuettes itll be in video stores in two 
days 
warner bros has estimated that the nominations for driving 
miss daisy will mean at least another 20 million at the box 
office

in september 1974 when busloads of black 
children pulled up for the first time at south boston high school 
the ensuing rockthrowing and racial curses reminded the nation of 
two truths it might have preferred to forget 
the civil rights battles waged in the 1950s and 1960s were far 
from over in the 1970s and the social evils that touched off those 
battles were by no means confined to the south 
the boston school desegregation battle is the subject of the 
commendable common ground a twopart fourhour cbs miniseries 
airing sunday and tuesday 
the programs subject matter though 15 years old still is 
relevant the issues of race and class remain at the core of 
american urban life perhaps nowhere more so than in boston itself 
where last years stuart murder case demonstrated how racial 
divisions in that city persist 
the miniseries four years in the making is based on the 
pulitzer prizewinning book of the same name by j anthony lukas 
it looks at the boston busing battles through the eyes of three 
real boston families deeply affected by it an irishcatholic 
family a black family and a young white liberal married couple 
who move to a racially mixed neighborhood 
jane curtin of kate amp allie and saturday night live 
fame gives an insightful performance as the deeply religious 
irishcatholic alice mcgoff mother of seven and a resident of the 
ultraclannish charlestown neighborhood 
she captures nicely the complexity of a lowermiddleclass white 
woman who does not believe herself a racist but cannot understand 
why as she puts it blacks feel theyre the only ones who have 
it tough 
as her children get swept into the daily racial conflicts that 
eventually spread to charlestown high school mcgoff finds herself 
taking a leading role in the white resistance movement unlike her 
more openly racist neighbors she favors nonviolence and leads 
demonstrators in ironic chants of the lords prayer while battling 
police 
in the end after two years of exhausting demonstrations and 
strife mcgoff learns a lesson in tolerance from her daughter 
lisa who delivers a climactic valedictory speech at charlestown 
high about racial harmony 
cch pounder plays rachel twymon a tough longsuffering 
mother of six in the predominantly black roxbury neighborhood 
she is devoted to the idea of integrating bostons schools but 
the growing militancy and violence goes against her grain twymon 
is portrayed as a hard taskmaster to her children so much so that 
one of her daughters runs away 
richard thomas looks appropriately liberal as colin diver right 
down to the hornedrim glasses as a star law student at harvard 
looking for a way to channel his idealism diver takes a job with 
the thenyoung and charismatic boston mayor kevin white but 
eventually becomes disenchanted with the political machinations 
diver his wife and two children satisfy their thirst for real 
city life by moving to a racially mixed gentrifying neighborhood in 
bostons south end but the realities of that lifestyle the 
crime prostitution and racial animosity eventually send them 
retreating to the suburbs 
common ground is a nicely subtle miniseries that may not 
settle for viewers the pros and cons of the boston busing conflict 
but does reveal much about three families searching desperately for 
decent solutions in angry times the producers lack the time 
however to show as the book does so well who these three 
families are where they and their ancestors came from and most 
importantly the history and background of the boston school 
conflict 
key elements also are lost in some of the portrayals 
in the case of rachel twymon especially the miniseries 
apparently for lack of time draws her as an almost heartless 
disciplinarian of her children without making clear as the book 
does what a hard life she had in fact she was desperately ill 
with the crippling disease lupus which eventually claimed her life 
nonetheless common ground is a praiseworthy miniseries a 
reminder that recent racial incidents in new yorks howard beach 
and elsewhere in urban america show that the civil rights battle 
continues and that there are no easy answers

in the cliches about congress chairman are 
powerful especially the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee the taxwriting people that position notwithstanding 
rep dan rostenkowski isnt getting much respect for the drastic 
measures he recommends to balance the budget 
another chairman the fellow democrat who heads the senate 
budget committee says bluntly that the rostenkowski plan is going 
nowhere 
despite a succession of brief setpiece speeches by other house 
democrats praising rostenkowskis package of tax increases and 
spending cuts or at least his courage in proposing it other party 
leaders are keeping their distance 
president bush treated the plan more cordially than some 
democrats but his bottom line was unchanged he said he would 
negotiate but was not forsaking his pledge against new taxes 
and democratic congressional leaders decided long ago that they 
would not move to increase taxes unless bush moved first their 
reason was dramatized when conservative republicans in congress 
said the rostenkowski proposal was evidence that the democrats are 
the party of higher taxes and more spending 
rostenkowskis proposal includes a spending freeze it also 
includes repeal of the grammrudman budget restraint system 
designed to force the deficit down with automatic spending cuts 
that take effect if deficit reduction targets are not met 
he said congress should scrap that system and govern the old 
fashioned way making decisions and honestly paying the costs of 
government 
but rep newt gingrich of georgia the republican whip called 
that a tipoff that in a year or two the democrats would seek more 
money for domestic social programs even if it pushed the deficit up 
again 
gingrich said republican strategy is to withhold the money that 
might lead to increased spending on social programs he said are 
proven failures weve been starving the welfare state he 
said thats a conscious longrange strategy 
we value a balanced budget he said we value even more a 
smaller government 
rostenkowski recommended increases in top bracket income taxes 
and in the gasoline tax a freeze in federal spending with sharp 
cuts in the defense budget and a freeze on cost of living 
increases in social security and other programs entitling 
individuals to federal benefit payments 
while bush said the administration would enter budget 
negotiations based on the rostenkowski proposal other democrats 
see that as nothing more than a trap 
sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the budget committee said 
he wasnt interested in discussions of a proposal centered on tax 
increases and freezing social security payments 
clearly rostenkowski means business with this proposal but 
its not going anywhere sasser said in a cbstv interview 
changing that would take more political salesmanship than 
rostenkowski can provide hes a house insider and it would take a 
campaign from the national stage to push through the kind of budget 
change he advocates his chicago house seat is as safe as they 
come and he has 1 million in his campaign treasury money he can 
take with him into retirement provided he retires before the 1992 
elections 
his budgetbalancing terms would involve political risks for 
both parties at a time when both are putting safety first 
felix g rohatyn the new york investment banker called the 
rostenkowski proposal an exception to a situation in which 
democrats are not offering alternatives to the program of the 
administration 
he told a democratic audience in washington last week that party 
leaders in congress are part of an existing power structure 
almost a coalition government with a republican administration 
at a 1989 forum on congressional leadership a senate republican 
leader said the way out of the deficit cycle is a political 
nonaggression pact in which neither party would try to blame 
unpopular budget measures on the other 
weve got to get in a room and all of us sit down democrat 
and republican alike and just say were going to go out of this 
room arm in arm over the cliff together sen alan simpson of 
wyoming the republican whip told that american enterprise 
institute forum 
thats the real courage and it doesnt take courage if well 
all do it and pledge that the other side wont tear the rear end 
off he said

japan spent many years establishing itself in 
the us marketplace with reputable products ranging from cameras 
to cars to copy machines now the japanese are about to peddle us 
some powerful plastic 
jcb international credit card co ltd the largest credit card 
company in japan is aggressively expanding in the united states 
and plans to market the card to american consumers beginning this 
summer 
the most widely accepted plastic in the far east already is 
issuing corporate cards to us businesses in addition it is 
accepted by a growing number of american merchants from hotels and 
airlines to swank retailers like bergdorf goodman eager to 
encourage spending by wealthy japanese visitors 
at least 300000 american outlets are expected to welcome jcb 
cardholders soon double the present number jcb officials say 
worldwide jcb is accepted by 14 million merchants triple the 
number of five years ago 
the japanese card company has negotiated deals with at least 
three cardprocessing services in the united states and is known to 
be talking with several us banks about issuing the card for 
which they would receive fees the bank of hawaii issues the jcb 
card in that state 
jcbs effort has startled and alarmed the leading us credit 
card companies already embroiled in intense competition with each 
other it also comes at a time of rising us resentment over what 
is seen as japans arrogant and seemingly inexhaustible financial 
might 
we think jcb is going to be one of the major competitive 
threats of the 90s said richard woods a spokesman for 
mastercard international which is accepted by about 8 million 
merchants worldwide 
they have deep pockets theyre longterm players theres no 
question they have an interest in providing global payment 
services woods said were watching them very closely 
visa international accepted by 75 million merchants worldwide 
also is monitoring jcbs forays into the united states said 
spokesman david brancoli but he suggested that jcb should be 
watching out for its own backyard where visa is doing quite well 
there are 25 million japanese who have visa cards brancoli 
said we expect it to increase to 40 million in japan 
founded in 1960 by sanwa bank jcb stands for japan credit 
bureau it is the oldest and predominant credit card in japan with 
about 70 million cards issued almost entirely to japanese 
jcbs biggest threat may be to the american express card 
because they technically function in the same way as charge cards 
targeted mainly to the same market of affluent consumers 
on the other hand visa mastercard and the upstart discover 
card issued by retailing giant sears roebuck amp co function as 
credit cards targeted to a much wider income range of consumers 
users are charged interest on the amount they dont repay 
steven richardson vice president of travelrelated services at 
american express said he didnt consider the jcb card a 
significant threat and noted that in japan both card companies 
have a partnership arrangement nonetheless he said we 
obviously look at any new developments in the industry and consider 
them all seriously 
creditcard experts speculated that american express accepted 
by 3 million merchants worldwide is looking hard at ways to learn 
more about the competition 
obviously the american market is an attractive place said 
bruce brittain head of brittain associates inc an atlantabased 
consulting firm that does market research on creditcard use 
theyre targeting people with the big bucks 
still he said the enormous competition by card companies in 
the us market would present jcb with a formidable challenge 
for someone who had one of those cards now it would almost be a 
conversation piece he said 
jcb executives in this country admit the expansion effort is in 
its infancy so far jcbs only us offices are in los angeles 
chicago san francisco and new york 
these offices are seeking to increase the us 
merchantacceptance base but also operate as travel centers to 
help japanese cardholders much like american express does abroad 
for its clients 
our cardholder base is mainly in japan said mitsuo 
funayama new york branch manager but we have started to issue a 
corporate card already in this country and as of this summer we 
will seek individual customers 
funayama said jcb is still planning the us marketing effort 
he didnt know how much the card would cost but speculated annual 
fees would exceed 30 a year 
our future market is almost the same as american express 
funayama said nonetheless he said it was extremely doubtful that 
jcb would soon overtake american express or any other us card 
from our point of view in japan jcb is huge and american 
express is not so big he said im sure jcb wont be so big in 
this country

when nicolae ceausescu ruled romania 
his secret police watched and listened to everyone opened mail 
inspected packages and made appropriate notations in the dossier of 
each citizen 
at the customs post office on giulesti street in central 
bucharest on the third floor was an assembly line where letters 
and packages mailed by or to people on a list of suspected or 
potential enemies of the state were xrayed analyzed by metal 
detectors or steamed open 
anything incriminating was noted then letters were resealed and 
delivered 
those whose mail was inspected knew nothing of it but they 
might have suspected when police took them in for questioning or 
they heard the thousands of rumors about the securitate secret 
police 
journalists were taken through the mailmonitoring facility this 
month the tour appeared to be part of the provisional governments 
effort to convince foreigners and its own 23 million citizens that 
the securitate has been abolished since the communist dictator was 
deposed and executed in december 
a week before the tour state television showed a uniformed 
officer displaying wrecked telephonetapping equipment 
video cameras were placed in hotels and public buildings and 
near the homes of suspects the securitate was said to have 
hundreds of thousands of informers 
so great was the fear of informers last summer a few months 
before ceausescus downfall that bucharest residents avoided even 
looking at western reporters and few would address them even 
casually 
dispelling such fear would be difficult for any government in 
power only three months 
romanias provisional administration which includes several 
former communists has made the job harder by keeping information 
about the securitate secret such as how many of its officers were 
captured after the ceausescu regime fell 
that secrecy and the fact that many people suspected of being 
informers still have their civilian jobs in factories and offices 
feed popular suspicion that the television broadcast post office 
tour and similar revelations are mostly for show 
in the broadcast the skeptical television reporter asked the 
uniformed officer how long it would take experts to reassemble the 
tangled masses of snapped wires at the dorobanti telephone 
exchange about three days the officer conceded 
maj gen nicolae cerbu deputy commander of the army signal 
corps told reporters at the mail surveillance center that up to 
6000 letters and parcels passed through the office each week 
the attitude toward the regime was a priority in this 
checking and they also did it just out of curiosity cerbu said 
about 1 million letters and packages are mailed in romania each 
day cerbu said 120 people were employed in the tampering operation 
at the customs post office 
packages were xrayed and put through metal detectors to find 
weapons or explosives letters were steamed open by machine and 
read then reglued and sealed 
even casual remarks unflattering to ceausescu or his regime 
could be grounds for persecution 
a 22yearold student still reluctant to tell a western 
reporter her name said the police summoned her two years ago 
after she received a letter from a spanish friend in czechoslovakia 
my friend wrote that ceausescu had such a stupid face and 
suggested she emigrate to bulgaria the student said 
that was pretty stupid she told the reporter since the 
stalinist regime in bulgaria was much like ceausescus 
police questioned her about her relations with the spaniard and 
warned be careful because you might get into trouble the 
student said 
on her next trip to czechoslovakia she asked her spanish friend 
never to mention ceausescu again in his letters

norwegians can name a son odd bent even 
roar but scott and russell are beyond the law 
danes need middle names to tell each other apart since half the 
people share 14 surnames 
in sweden middle names are unusual swedes are allowed as many 
first names as they want however and some use two last names 
every baby must be registered with name officially approved in 
the highly regulated societies of europes far north 
names like bent worm roar bull or odd ones sound fine to 
scandinavians but the rules bewilder some parents 
take becky carlsson a 30yearold american living in sweden 
she has tried for 12 months to get her maiden name hincks 
approved as a middle name for her 14monthold son samuel 
they wouldnt accept hincks as a second first name or a 
middle name said mrs carlsson who has appealed the case 
sam could be a hincks if his mother had continued to use her 
maiden name the law says a hincks and a carlsson may have a baby 
named hincks carlsson but two carlssons cannot hincks is 
forbidden as a first or second name because it is a surname 
all this regulation started because a lot of names were being 
casually used said anne svanevik a norwegian name researcher 
officials were trying to stabilize things so it would be easier 
to find people in files for example 
scandinavians often adopted the name of a farm or region which 
they might change like an address if they moved 
they created new surnames by adding sen or son to the 
fathers given name a danish jens son of hans became jens 
hansen his son per took the name jensen the grandson became 
persen and so on 
chaos reigned by the mid1800s and governments insisted everyone 
adopt a permanent family name iceland is an exception patronymics 
persist among the islands 250000 people 
new rules brought forth lists of legal last names reserved 
family names surnames available to anyone and acceptable given 
names 
each year in sweden thousands of johanssons anderssons and 
svenssons ask to change their names which are so common that 
mixups are inevitable each must apply to the patent and registry 
board for permission 
about 20000 of norways 42 million people change family names 
each year 
norway passed a forename law in 1923 because people started to 
use last names as first names and to protect children from having 
names that sounded strange ms svanevik said 
an 1828 decree inadvertently stripped danes of a rich variety of 
informal surnames leaving 70 percent with names ending in sen 
said gillian fellowsjensen of denmarks institute of names 
research 
the government said everyone had to have a permanent last 
name said mrs fellowsjensen who was allowed by a 1983 reform 
of the law to hyphenate her name 
they didnt mean just the sen names it was up to the local 
vicar to record names a lot of vicars werent very imaginative and 
wrote down the easiest one the patronym 
hundreds of danes now have the same first and last names 
creating an identity problem that can follow them to the grave 
tombstones are inscribed mr managing director jensen and mr 
unskilled worker jensen to distinguish the occupants 
in oslo a city of 480000 people 50 of the 4000 hansens in 
the telephone book are named hans and hints are provided like hans 
the surveyor hans the retired hans the bricklayer 
scott russell and some others are registered as surnames in 
norway and cannot be used as given names immigrants are given 
leeway however and usually can register nonnordic first names 
like hussein or carlos without problems 
i know a norwegian family who wanted to name their baby scott 
and were refused while scott was approved for another family with 
one british parent ms svanevik said 
at the swedish population registry thomas erikson said we 
respect whatever name people had when they moved to sweden their 
children born here have to abide by swedish law 
erikson said mrs carlssons difficulty arose because hincks 
clearly was a surname 
if she could show that it was used anywhere as a first name it 
would probably be all right he said 
mrs carlsson even tried to smuggle the middle name into sweden 
we went home to hartford conn and had him baptized 
samuel hincks carlsson then we filed to change his name here 
she said 
it didnt work 
in the eyes of the swedish state hes still samuel carlsson 
but god knows hes samuel hincks carlsson said sams father

stop blessing such unions he got a standing ovation but some

the rev zalmon sheron an openly gay priest said in asking 
me and other clergy to stop blessing samesex unions he has 
rendered countless lesbian and gay people in this diocese 
invisible 
however the rev richard kim said i know we have to find new 
ways to minister but we cannot rewrite the bible

a leader of the synagogue council of america 
says american christians critical of israel in its conflict with

22 arab states except egypt still are at war with israel

if you were following marilyn vos savants brain 
builder no 115 you wouldnt be reading this 
you would be out getting lost putting yourself in someone 
elses shoes striving in short to make yourself smarter and you 
would have read page 184 of her new book brain building 
exercising yourself smarter which says 
brain builder no 115 get less news 
exercise this week get the news only once a day and only 
from the radio next week get the news only once a day and only 
from the television the following week get the news only once a 
day and only from the newspaper at this point it should be very 
clear why you should turn to the newspaper permanently 
still with us maybe we should explain 
marilyn vos savant believes its sexy to be smart she also 
believes in logic as in smart is sexy marilyn vos savant is the 
smartest person in the world therefore marilyn vos savant is the 
sexiest person in the world 
not that she would say that vos savant is no braggart the 
cover of her book may trumpet the author as the worlds smartest 
person but its not a phrase she seems likely to use 
its a fact though vos savant is listed in the guinness book 
of world records as the person with the highest iq ever recorded 
at age 10 her intelligence quotient was put at 228 which is 
pretty much off the chart as far as the rest of us are concerned 
an iq of 100 is considered normal 
now 43 she has applied her abilities to among other things 
collaboration with her husband dr robert jarvik in artificial 
heart research a novel shes in the midst of writing and an 
advice column she writes each week for parade magazine 
and now she has written a book designed to bring out the latent 
genius that lurks theoretically in all of us she generously 
believes that people are equally endowed between the ears more or 
less but that most of us have become mentally flabby her book 
is presented as a solution a sort of jane fonda workout for the 
brain

that is followed of course by brain builder no 57 dont

there is no small element of wit in vos savants book which 
sometimes reads like a national lampoon parody of selfhelp books 
now this book is not for bloody mathemeticians by any 
means the author said in an interview its not a series of 
tedious algebra exercises of which weve had enough to last us a 
lifetime 
she says that last part with special conviction 
tedious algebra exercises aside vos savant seems to have had 
fun learning and wants to share the wealth her idea of a brain 
tonic is a delicious meal a good mystery a stimulating 
conversation 
to be sure her book includes math problems and other 
browknitters but most tend to be things along the lines of 
take a simple math problem and draw a picture of it or

very logical but did it really take the smartest person in the 
world to figure that out 
vos savant whose black curls ring a thin sharplydefined face 
sighs and looks briefly toward the window in her publishers 
conference room 
i know certain things are selfevident all right and i 
think they have to be said its like a diet book you know you 
just have to tell people ok initially were sorry this is a 
very basic fact of life but youre going to have to eat less 
using logic is common sense but people do not necessarily 
exercise that common sense 
her book she said is aimed at the sort of person who writes 
her at parade she figures she gets about 600 to 700 letters a week 
when i see the things that people write and the questions 
they ask i see how their minds work i can see the areas in 
which if they just had a little more confidence in themselves 
it would be wonderful for them 
not surprisingly vos savant seems to have no such lack of 
selfconfidence still she laughs when shes asked if shes living 
up to her potential 
well if the artificial heart ever works we we will have 
achieved a lot if it doesnt probably the best i can say i 
have achieved is being in touch with as many millions of people as 
im in touch with and i feel wonderful about that 
in the meantime she is brimming with advice sleep less get 
out more tune into time tune into the weather tune into 
yourself dont eat or drink at your desk dont eat unless youre 
hungry put yourself in the other persons place

the notorious walled city a squalid enclave 
whose dark alleyways once were the domain of prostitutes opium 
addicts and fugitives is attracting tourists and students these 
days 
they wind through virtual tunnels made by buildings squeezed too 
close together for sunlight or vehicles to enter they dodge open 
sewers and dripping pipes in the rancid air to see the sinkhole of 
vice before it becomes a park 
hong kong announced plans three years ago to raze the sevenacre 
district just a short walk from the international airport as soon 
as its 33000 residents could be relocated officials believe it 
was the worlds most densely populated area 
the city wall itself wont come tumbling down japanese 
occupation forces took it apart during world war ii and used the 
stones for an airport runway 
since the plans to make a park were announced we have had 
almost daily busloads of tourists visiting the walled city said 
herman cho an official of the relocation program you cannot 
deny the walled city has unique features 
many groups venture only to the perimeter to take pictures of 
the jumble of highrise buildings 
other tourists walk alleyways slick with water dripping from a 
canopy of overhead pipes for closer inspection of a slum that 
despite its wretchedness is rich in history 
ive been in the worst slums in new york and theyre not this 
bad said christopher lok 15 of ridgefield conn touring the 
neighborhood with his 10th grade classmates from the hong kong 
international school 
the enclave on the kowloon peninsula across the harbor from hong 
kong island once was a qing dynasty fort and administrative center 
protected by a 13foot wall 
in 1898 britain leased kowloon from china for 99 years along 
with hong kong but the two countries could not agree on who would 
control the walled city 
few problems arose for half a century because the seven acres 
were sparsely populated but thousands of squatters poured into the 
contested neighborhood after world war ii claiming they were under 
chinese jurisdiction 
britains colonial government which did not want to antagonize 
beijing seldom bothered them the result has been relative chaos 
in a very small space 
residents of the walled city have not paid property taxes or 
registered their businesses which include dozens of unlicensed 
dentists and doctors they have put up buildings without government 
approval which are crammed with people who cannot afford the 
higher rents elsewhere in hong kong 
when britain agreed that hong kong would be returned to china in 
1997 the jurisdictional dispute evaporated and the colonial 
government announced plans to demolish its main urban eyesore 
nearly 14000 residents have moved out of the walled city under 
a compensation program costing the equivalent of 295 million and 
the process is expected to be complete by mid1991 
the brothels opium dens and gambling halls have gone long 
since and officials say walking the maze of dim dank lanes is 
safe 
rarely does one meet a character more sinister than a schoolgirl 
on her way to class or see anything more frightening than a 
scurrying rat on certain afternoons several men play classical 
chinese music on traditional instruments in a room off old folks 
road the main alley 
there are no guide maps and the alleys are marked only in 
chinese but it is difficult to get lost most paths eventually 
lead to the outside 
factories producing food from fish balls to noodles are 
everywhere sweating barechested men in their 20s wearing black 
boots because of the muck on the floor make small blocks of 
coagulated pig blood in one shop 
across the lane madame chan 58 sits in a bamboo chair all day 
in front of a cellsized apartment for which she pays the 
equivalent of 51 a month 
the ventilation is very poor and that makes me ill she 
complains then reels off a list of ailments 
indeed the only open space inside the walled city is the center 
for the elderly on the site of the yamen or local government 
offices in the late qing dynasty 16441911 
inside one yamen building is a black stone tablet from the 19th 
century giving regulations for payments to soldiers just outside 
the center are two cannons from the qing dynasty that were found in 
1975 
the walled city also is the home of two temples including one 
with a statue of the god fuk tak said to date from the sung dynasty 
9601280 
historical sites in the walled city are to be preserved and 
included in the new park

even after three decades as a master orator fidel 
castro seems uneasy before a speech 
this night about 50000 students await him outside the 
presidential palace 
in the minutes before castro steps to the podium he can hardly 
keep still he glances around and shifts his feet he seems hardly 
to notice when the throng beneath him chants fidel fidel 
it is an extraordinarily difficult period for him and his 
country not since the 1960s when the cold war raged and us 
hostility seemed irrepressible has cuba faced such uncertainty 
how different things are from that day in 1974 when castro 
predicted confidently while host to president leonid i brezhnev 
of the soviet union that communism eventually would triumph in the 
world 
can anyone doubt it he asked 
those were heady days for the revolution the united states 
seemed shaken to its roots by the watergate scandal and 
skyrocketing oil prices american troops had been forced from 
vietnam a year earlier the communist conquest of indochina was 
imminent 
but the world has turned upside down 
communism appears to have failed in indochina and has collapsed 
in eastern europe there are predictions of cataclysmic internal 
upheaval in the soviet union and moscows future economic support 
for cuba is uncertain 
against this unpromising background the students convened 
outside castros headquarters one night this month to hear the 
leader speak 
the mood was upbeat the students chanted slogans with a 
recurring antiamerican theme fidel for sure hit the yankees 
hard 
someone shouted anyone who doesnt jump is a yankee 
everyone jumped castro smiled and jumped too 
his message was simple there is no reason to fear because the 
ideals of our country are immortal 
not only will the revolution not fall it will rise he said 
castro spoke for 90 minutes and was interrupted dozens of times 
by chants and applause 
his commitment to communist fundamentalism is enshrined in the 
slogan he now uses at the end of every speech socialism or 
death and huge numbers of cubans seem prepared to stick with 
him 
in that sense cuba is not comparable to the countries of 
eastern europe where the leaders who fell last year were often 
hated by their people 
arrayed against the procastro militants are what appear to be 
growing ranks of disaffected cubans 
five years ago the average number of cubans fleeing by boat to 
florida 90 miles away was one a month according to us figures 
the monthly average has reached 40 despite the threat of prison 
terms ranging from one to three years a resourceful teenager 
recently made the trip on a surfboard 
jorge luis pichardo a 26yearold safety inspector who fled to 
miami on a raft last august said pay in cuba allows people to 
subsist but not to live 
a friend who accompanied him gustavo brugues son of cubas 
ambassador to bolivia said he once spent two days in a food line 
to buy pork for a family celebration sometimes you have to wait 
in line and theres nothing at the end of it he said 
on the other side are people like juan aizpura rodriguez he was 
a 15yearold dropout at the time of the revolution in 1959 a 
poor black youngster from one of havanas many tough neighborhoods 
aizpura now has a college degree in social science and is on the 
national board that governs neighborhood watchdog groups called 
committees for the defense of the revolution the groups provide 
social services and keep an eye out for antigovernment activity 
if it werent for the revolution the broadest majorities of 
our population would still be suffering aizpura said 
perhaps the most pampered cubans are the children the amount 
spent on their health care and education is unusually high for a 
third world country 
at a school for slow learners one of 14 in the capital the 
emphasis is on individual attention it has 47 staff members one 
for each 4 students buses take the students from home to school 
and back 
all education has a high priority in cuba the number of schools 
30 years ago was a small fraction of those functioning today 
nationwide vaccination has sharply reduced childhood diseases 
like measles and whooping cough polio was wiped out in 1963 
the official infant mortality rate is 111 per thousand putting 
cuba almost on a par with industrialized countries before the 
revolution the rate was 60 
we think we can still reduce it more said dr evilio 
cabezas of the public health ministry he credited extensive 
prenatal and postnatal care and added its all absolutely 
free 
what kind of lives do these literate healthy cubans have they 
are certainly better off than an estimated 175 million latin 
americans living in poverty which castro says is a byproduct of 
capitalism 
cuba has hardly any beggars begging is illegal 
unemployment is much lower than elsewhere in latin america and 
drugs are far less of a problem than in the united states 
prostitution has been outlawed but not eradicated 
a us official who is an expert on cuba said the revolution had 
improved life for onethird to onehalf of cubas people 
lack of freedom is a prime reason why cubans leave home the 
current political uncertainty has brought harsh repression of human 
rights activists and the number of detentions has increased sharply 
twice in recent weeks progovernment mobs have formed outside 
the homes of dissidents 
one of those homes belonged to gustavo arcos who has spent a 
total of 12 years in prison since breaking with castro in 1965 
the rules of the game have changed he said they are not 
going to permit any more dissidents 
daily life can be demoralizing 
food markets are dingy and poorly stocked apathy at work is 
common opportunities for recreation are limited 
television often is dull comparatively few cubans have their 
own cars and a trip across town on the erratic bus system can take 
hours 
some medicines are unobtainable and decent housing is in acutely 
short supply some residential areas of havana are in such 
disrepair they resemble war zones 
can castro survive his political thinking is out of line with 
the democratic trend among moscows allies but castro points out 
adversaries have underestimated him before 
much will depend on the attitude of the soviet union which 
contributes 5 billion a year to subsidize cubas economy castro 
is preparing for the day when cuba can no longer count on the 
soviets 
he has acknowledged that a sharp reduction in soviet oil 
shipments could force cuba to replace tractors with mules stop 
manufacturing adult clothing for five years and reduce bus service 
in havana by twothirds 
he expresses confidence the revolution will survive without the 
soviets but many experts claim severe hardship would cause an 
uprising 
castro told the students from each test we come out more 
revolutionary from each combat we come out better

victoria tennant says starring in a 
miniseries is a good way to see the world well sort of 
the winds of war and its sequel war and remembrance 
took her to her native england and other parts of europe but for 
some exotic sites from moscow to singapore they had to make do 
with standins new delhi for instance was really cambridge 
england with potted palms 
her newest miniseries voice of the heart which will be 
seen in syndication beginning april 16 in about 80 percent of the 
country did take her to authentic locales in england the south of 
france and new york 
in nice she ran across the trail of her husband steve martin 
who was filming dirty rotten scoundrels 
i spent two weeks with my husband in the south of france while 
he was working she said then i had to go to london for voice 
of the heart then we went to nice to film and we got there five 
days after steve had left i got his trailer his driver and we 
had the same crew 
the fourhour voice of the heart which also stars lindsay 
wagner and james brolin is based on the bestselling novel by 
barbara taylor bradford 
the story covers 12 years in the life of a troubled american 
actress played by wagner who disrupts the happiness of her best 
friend an aristocratic british author played by tennant and an 
american movie star played by brolin 
the book was inspired by a friend of the author who attempted 
to heal old wounds and patch up broken friendships when she learned 
she was dying bradford loosely based tennants character lady 
francesca cunningham on her own writing career 
tennant who currently is starring in the motion picture the 
handmaids tale filmed voice of the heart two summers ago 
a year ago she worked on another miniseries based on a bradford 
book act of will in which she stars with jean marsh peter 
coyote kevin mcnally and elizabeth hurley playing a mother who 
sacrifices everything for her daughter 
two other bradford books a woman of substance and hold 
that dream also became miniseries 
tennant was born in england where her father ran mcas london 
office and her mother was a russian prima ballerina at 8 she 
began studying ballet and later attended the central drama school 
it was an assumption early on that i would be involved in 
acting she said 
her first film was the ragmans daughter after which came 
sphinx and the dogs of war she was also in the miniseries 
chiefs and the movie best seller 
the winds of war was the first television i did and it was 
a terrific lifechanging thing to do she said it brought me 
back to america and gave me a new career id lived in new york 
before but if youre a european its hard to have a career in this 
country winds of war made me a recognizable quantity that 
producers were willing to hire 
she met steve martin when they worked together in the comedy 
all of me 
i played the baddie who pretended to be the goodie and then 
revealed herself to be the baddie tennant said i was lily 
tomlins stablemans daughter when she dies she leaves me all her 
wealth thinking her soul will enter my body but an eastern mystic 
making the transfer makes a mistake and her soul enters steves 
body in the meantime ive inherited all the money it ends 
happily however 
in her next project she costars with martin in a movie he 
wrote tentatively called la story she calls it a romantic 
comedy about bringing yourself to accept another person 
tennant also has written two screenplays that she hopes to star 
in both have been optioned by producers 
steve and i dont write together she said i look at his 
work he looks at mine its nice when you live with someone in the 
business and you can go for walks and talk about your story it 
clears up a lot of questions in your mind 
i wrote my first script in a week when my husband was shooting 
at night i worked all night in periods of euphoric concentration 
when i typed the end i burst into tears it was so wonderful 
that i had written something and it was so wonderful that it had 
come to an end

tobacco usa the smoke shop is called 
but it could be a nickname for this region and so when greensboro 
hung a no smoking sign in this and other businesses it was a 
sign of the times hard times for tobacco 
you get some hostile reactions acknowledged matthew pappas 
who works at tobacco usa a wholesaleretail outlet some people 
you tell em they cant smoke in the store theyll throw their 
cartons down and walk out 
theyre not just reacting to the irony of smoking regulations in 
a cigarette store even here at home they realize they cant 
escape the sea change in american attitudes toward smoking 
not that long ago it wasnt just ok to smoke it was kool 
id walk a mile for a camel the slogan said winston tastes 
good like a cigarette should there was the lucky strike radio 
hour the barn painted with the familiar mail pouch logo 
remember the winston man in the ads the hero whod rescue 
someone and then light up nowadays the model who portrayed him is 
stumping for the antismoking forces 
and what about the romance that drifted on cigarette smoke 
through casablanca and so many other old movies now one james 
bond film with a pack of smokes as a prominent prop carries an 
onscreen health warning 
during world war i the new york medical journal said that given 
the nervous strain at the front it would be folly both from a 
medical and a military standpoint to deny tobacco to the men 
now study after study cites new dangers us surgeons general 
refine their warnings more than 40 states and 400 localities 
restrict smoking even greensboro 
its everywhere you turn said martha vick who grew up on a 
tobacco farm raises the leaf with her husband and is director of a 
museum of tobacco farming in kenly nc 
this is a legal crop we produce she said tobacco farmers 
are hardworking godfearing citizens i imagine every producer 
wonders what the future is going to hold 
to economic forecaster geoffrey greene the future of smoking in 
the united states can be glimpsed in the demographics of the baby 
boom generation 
there was a long period of time when there was inertia 
building when the evidence became more and more clear that there 
were concrete health effects said greene senior economist at 
data resources inc of lexington mass 
then a few years ago came the spur you started hearing the 
stories joe x from college dropped dead of a heart attack at 39 
or 42 people whod always been thinking about well maybe i 
ought to quit smoking started saying now im going to do it 
around the same time then surgeon general c everett koop 
issued a report on the effects of breathing smokers sidestream 
smoke a message baby boomers were ready to hear in greenes view 
were increasingly aware that its an interconnected world 
he said and theres more willingness to accept some constraint 
on individual liberties if others could be harmed 
the milestones of tobaccos recent decline are just as clear to 
billy yeargin president of tobacco history corp which studies 
and preserves the commoditys heritage 
the surgeon generals report in 1964 warning of health risks 
from smoking gave birth to the organized efforts against tobacco 
and later reports by koop and other officials have conferred the 
sanction of the government on tobaccos antagonists yeargin 
said since 1965 the percentage of adults who smoke has dropped 
from 40 percent to 29 percent 
still antismoking sentiment is not new it goes back at least 
to king james i of england who in 1604 blasted the black 
stinking fume of this custom loathsome to the eye hateful to 
the nose harmful to the brain dangerous to the lungs 
now yeargin said old objections are increasingly taking the 
form of law even in virginia where tobacco exports began just 
eight years after king james issued his broadside the legislature 
this month overwhelmingly approved limitations on public smoking 
it has certainly alarmed me yeargin said of the accelerated 
pace of restrictions someone once said the surest test of 
democracy is how society treats its minority in this case 
those who smoke 
in greensboro home of lorillard inc which makes newport kent 
and true cigarettes and employs 2300 people the referendum 
restricting smoking passed by 173 votes out of about 30000 cast 
last november 
a slim margin yes acknowledged david hudgins a leader of the 
group greensboro to alleviate smoking pollution but the vote 
changed peoples views he said predicting a repeal effort now 
being discussed will fail if it goes to a vote 
people have just had enough of it hudgins said referring 
not just to breathing others smoke but to the campaign by tobacco 
companies against the referendum 
they finally realize that they can speak out and there can be 
some pride in not supporting tobacco its not a stigma just 
because were from north carolina 
the american cancer societys joann schellenbach in new york 
agreed when the ordinance passed in greensboro it was considered 
one of those major battles in the war a real turning point 
business has realized there are savings if employees dont 
smoke in everything from the cost of insurance to officecleaning 
she said 
do the antismoking forces have tobacco on the run 
absolutely she said 
in washington rep thomas luken dohio would like to believe 
that but said tobacco companies have grown stronger along with the 
antismoking movement 
a bill he sponsored one of dozens of smokingrelated measures 
before congress aims to protect children from tobacco advertising 
by banning all but textonly ads in newspapers and magazines and by 
stopping what luken considers circumvention of a federal ban on 
broadcast advertising and a requirement that tobacco ads carry 
warning labels 
his office points to a 350000 contract to use a pack of lark 
cigarettes to conceal a detonator in the james bond film license 
to kill 
when we got in touch with the producer he voluntarily agreed 
to put a warning label at the end of the movie the first time a 
movie has ever had a health warning said luken aide benjamin 
cohen 
andrew white a spokesman for philip morris usa said that larks 
are sold by philip morris in japan not in the united states and 
that the contract was part of a japanese promotion of the movie 
we adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the law 
white said 
at the tobacco institute the industrys lobbying arm in 
washington spokeswoman brennan dawson said it is peer pressure 
that makes teenagers smoke not stadium billboards or magazine ads 
yes she said the regulators have won many recent rounds 
including a virtual ban on smoking aboard airliners and yes for 
those in the industry its certainly a difficult climate 
but smokings decline in this country should not be exaggerated 
ms dawson said 
if its something that 50 million people still do im not 
sure that i buy that its been desocialized she said

ilene bankers kindergartners listen to 
their hearts with stethoscopes fashioned from paper towel tubes 
and then return to their desks where calf lamb and chicken hearts 
await their scrutiny 
down the hall gail krehels secondgraders spend an hour 
learning about the dynamics of wind and youngsters simulate the 
swirling of tornadoes by shaking homemade devices fashioned from 
plastic soda bottles filled with water 
at parkway school cited for excellence by the us department 
of education two years ago elementary science is taught the way 
most educators think it should be but all too rarely is with 
handson experiences adequate class time and a spirit of discovery 
and experimentation 
the nations governors and the bush administration agreed in 
february that us students should be first in the world in science 
achievement by the year 2000 a key step toward reaching that goal 
is improving elementary science instruction 
that wont be easy 
study after study has shown serious deficiencies in both the 
quality and quantity of science instruction for elementary students 
instead of the thrill of discovery they more often get the 
tedium of texts 
the situation is even more serious for girls whose science 
achievement typically lags behind boys and worsens through high 
school often because parents and educators offer girls little 
encouragement 
were systematically sorting out women and minorities said 
bill aldridge executive director of the national science teachers 
association 
a 1988 international comparison of science achievement among 
fifthgraders in 14 countries found us students ranking in the 
middle 
the latest statistics from the national assessment of 
educational progress found more than twothirds of us elementary 
school teachers spend less than two hours a week on science eleven 
percent of thirdgraders say they had no science instruction at all 
in new jersey a 1988 survey found that less science was being 
taught in every elementary grade than four years earlier 
in fourth grade for example new jersey schools averaged 70 
minutes a week of science instruction in 1988 down from 98 minutes 
in 1984 but still better than the national average of 28 minutes 
the science teachers association recommends 100 minutes of science 
a week for fourthgraders 
the sad result of this lack of time spent on science only one 
in four 9yearolds tested by naep demonstrated basic understanding 
of life or physical sciences were able for example to correctly 
identify in a multiplechoice test that a fox is a predator of a 
mouse 
this northern new jersey suburb demonstrates that solid 
grounding in science in the elementary years is critical to later 
success about 85 percent of paramus high school students take at 
least three years of science including biology and chemistry 
nationwide only about onethird do so 
part of the problem is that parents and educators alike consider 
reading the primary mission of elementary education in many 
schools around the country that has meant science doesnt rank as 
an educational basic in the same league as language skills or 
math 
reading instruction typically takes up as much as seven times 
more elementary class time than math the next mosttaught subject 
according to several statewide studies 
science often is even more vulnerable in tight budgetary times 
which many states including new jersey now face this month new 
jersey gov jim florio announced sharp reductions in state 
education aid and paramus science coordinator bob diblasi said 
sciencerelated field trips could be vulnerable to cuts 
even in a district like paramus with a longstanding commitment 
to science education the subject must fight for everscarcer 
classroom time diblasi said 
pressure in recent years from parents and politicians for aids 
education drug education moral education and the like has put 
elementary class time at an even greater premium he said 
many educators contend that reaching the governors goals for 
science education will take no less than a concerted and costly 
effort to improve teacher training and devise better curricula 
similar to federal programs launched in the early 1960s following 
sputnik 
i believe it down to my shoes its a matter of resources 
said joel bloom new jerseys assistant state commissioner in 
charge of science programs 
all this talk about goals is nice but its not going to 
happen without money said aldridge of the science teachers 
association 
nationally most elementary schools spend less than 10 per 
pupil for science supplies or equipment 
but schools like parkway and others cited for excellence 
demonstrate that new spending is only part of the answer 
teachers like banker and krehel and administrators like diblasi 
illustrate that creativity and dedication are at least as 
important especially since elementary schools rarely have 
fullscale labs 
linda wrhen of the smedley street school in oil city pa who 
is participating in a new national teacher training project 
sponsored by the science teachers association and upjohn co has 
her thirdgraders make string telephones to study sound 
when ms banker wanted to teach her kindergartners about the 
heart she got the father of one her pupils to donate the calf 
lamb and chicken hearts from his butcher shop 
to run her experiment on tornadoes ms krehel brought in the 
plastic soda bottles and persuaded parkways principal joe roma 
to give her about 50 for connecting tubes 
but even if some schools seem able to do the job without fancy 
lab equipment there is no substitute for adequate classroom time 
paramus kindergartners spend an average of 75 to 90 minutes a week 
on science roughly triple the new jersey statewide average of 29 
minutes for that grade 
another key ingredient for solving science educations problems 
appears to be clearly enunciated districtwide goals 
in the last couple of years in paramus for example school 
administrators made it a priority to get more girls into advanced 
science programs teachers and guidance counselors were asked to 
encourage girls and there were meetings with parents to make them 
aware of opportunities 
one result is that this school year eight female students are 
taking advanced placement physics compared with none last year 
and female enrollment in advanced placement biology is up 45 
percent from a year ago

politicians say they cant live without 
television but gripe that high tv advertising rates force them to 
spend too much time begging for money from fat cats 
during my 1986 reelection campaign i found myself raising 
money to get on tv to raise money to get on tv to raise money to 
get on tv said sen ernest f hollings dsc its a vicious 
cycle 
the result is growing support in congress for legislation that 
would force broadcast stations to cut their campaign advertising 
rates 
its a drive that crosses party lines as republicans and 
democrats alike try to make television share the blame for an 
embarrassing rash of congressional ethics problems linked to 
political fund raising 
virtually all of more than a dozen campaignfinance reform plans 
now circulating on capitol hill contain provisions that would make 
broadcasters cut their rates for political ads or give candidates 
free air time 
if we only passed that and nothing else it would be very 
significant said sen mitch mcconnell rky in competitive 
races the single biggest thing pressing us to raise more money is 
broadcast media time 
under the current system candidates complain that their contact 
with voters is limited because of the time they must spend raising 
money from corporate and union political action committees and 
wealthy benefactors 
mill visits and dropping by the country store have become a 
casualty of the system hollings said 
television advertising is the name of the game he said 
the hard fact of life for a candidate is that if youre not on 
tv youre not truly in the race 
campaign spending patterns reflect that shift in strategy 
in 1956 candidates for federal state and local office spent 
about 10 million less than 6 percent of their campaign budgets 
on tv and radio time according to the federal communications 
commission 
three decades later republican ed zschau and democrat alan 
cranston alone spent a combined 13 million as cranston 
successfully defended his senate seat in california 
us house candidates in 1988 on average spent 20 percent of 
their campaign money on tv and radio ad time a total of more than 
50 million according to the national association of broadcasters 
senate candidates meanwhile devoted nearly 44 percent of their 
campaign dollars to broadcast time spending more than 200 million 
averages however can be deceptive 
while hollings paid 2400 for 30 seconds of primetime 
advertising on the largest tv station in south carolina cranston 
and zschau had to pay 30000 for comparable air time in los 
angeles 
senate candidates in competitive races may spend as much as 90 
percent of their campaign dollars on tv advertising and on fund 
raising to finance tv ads according to the senate commerce 
committee 
the spiraling cost of campaigns is directly attributable to 
the increase of television advertising in general and the 
widespread belief that demogogic advertising works said curtis 
gans vice president of the committee for the study of the american 
electorate 
the committee a nonpartisan group studying the decline in 
voter participation found that spending in the most expensive 
senate campaigns has doubled since 1974 after adjusting for 
inflation and that the amount politicians spend on tv and radio 
ads has more than tripled 
nothing or next to nothing is spent on any activity that 
involves the citizenry gans said we manipulate our citizens 
we do not involve them 
politicians and the media consultants who run their campaigns 
blame the high cost of advertising on pricegouging broadcasters 
congress in 1972 told broadcasters they could charge candidates 
no more than the lowest unit cost paid by commercial 
advertisers however stations skirt that rule by charging more for 
spots that are guaranteed to run on a specific date and time than 
for socalled preemptible spots that can be rescheduled 
except for a few major sports events such as the super bowl and 
the world series commercial advertisers buy preemptible ad time 
they know that if their spots are bumped the ads will reach the 
same audience share later 
political candidates dont have that luxury to ensure that 
their ads dont get bumped in the crucial weeks before an election 
they may pay up to eight times the preemptible rates paid by 
commercial advertisers 
jan crawford a consultant who specializes in buying media time 
for democratic candidates said she spent 85000 on tv and radio 
advertising in 1974 to elect richard lamm governor of colorado 
twelve years later she spent 15 million in the same state for 
air time for thenrep tim wirths successful senate race 
costs are now determined by what the market can bear ms 
crawford told the senate commerce committee 
catherine farrell a media buyer for republican candidates 
recalled that in one 1988 race a station raised the price for a 
local advertising spot during abcs good morning america show 
from 80 to 400 in one week 
there was no arguing with them she said they said we 
have nothing else thats it take it or leave it 
hollings mcconnell and sen john danforth rmo have proposed 
legislation that would require broadcasters to charge candidates 
preemptible rates for guaranteed time slots 
but in defense of their rates broadcasters stress that 
twothirds of political ads are placed in the last three months of 
the year when advertising space demand is high because of the new 
fall tv season and christmas sales 
advertising is only one component of a campaigns expenses 
said levitt pope president of radio and television station wpix in 
new york travel costs are higher telephone charges have 
increased direct mail and polling costs have risen 
pope also blames political consultants and media buyers who he 
said want to spend more on broadcast time than on phone banks 
because they often get a 15 percent commission on ads they place 
echoing that criticism are reformers such as gans 
what has developed is a competition not between parties 
principles proposals or candidates but between media advisers who 
compete with each other to see who can outslick the other and 
win gans said

the cold war thaw brings a dilemma for hollywoods 
scriptwriters whom are we going to use for villains those 
ruthless agents of the evil empire look like pussycats now 
movies such as to russia with love and the spy who came in 
from the cold would be robbed of their immediacy if filmed today 
the fourth war might be considered a casualty in the onrush 
of world events the cannonpathe release concerns two 
unreconstructed cold warriors who fight a private battle that 
threatens to upset the peace between the united states and soviet 
union 
roy scheider is the hardnosed colonel of an american base on 
the border of west germany and czechoslovakia in the fall of 1988 
he becomes inflamed when he sees a fleeing czech shot down by 
soviet border guards 
scheider plots revenge slipping over the border for a night of 
drunken mischiefmaking his opposite number jurgen prochnow who 
is equally dedicated to combatting his enemy retaliates 
the pranks become deadly and scheiders subordinate tim reid 
is powerless to stop him a sympathetic but disciplined general 
harry dean stanton warns scheider to no avail the plot is 
complicated by the arrival of a suspicious beauty lara harris 
the struggle climaxes in a mantoman battle that seems to bear 
out albert einsteins prediction that the fourth world war will be 
fought with stones 
john frankenheimer the manchurian candidate seven days 
in may is an old hand at directing this kind of macho 
confrontation and he masterfully builds the tension the 
bonechilling terrain actually canada adds immeasurably to the 
films effectiveness but in the end its todays headlines that 
make the fourth war dated 
scheider and prochnow make worthy protagonists and stanton adds 
strength as the general 
whats a screenwriter to do even the south africans cry 
freedom lethal weapon 2 are becoming less viable as heavies 
oh well the colombia drug lords are still available 
the fourth war was produced by wolf schmidt and is rated r 
for language and violence running time 91 minutes

keys to the highway columbia rodney crowell 
 
if rodney crowell were a glass of iced tea hed be just right 
not too sugary not too lemony steeped and aged first in the sun 
he goes down easy on keys to the highway his sixth lp but 
easy doesnt mean wimpy crowells music is pleasant country pop 
yet his lyrics show a man who has earned as on various tests of 
strength 
crowell whos been performing and producing since the 1970s 
has hit it big during the past year his last album diamonds amp 
dirt produced five no 1 country singles crowell earned the 
academy of country musics new male vocalist award and just this 
february he won a grammy and was nominated for five country music 
awards 
keys to the highway isnt as full of gems as diamonds amp 
dirt but it has plenty of treasure 
my past is present opens the album with toetappin 
kneeslappin swing tell me the truth we gotta go on 
meeting like this and if looks could kill also would please 
the twosteppin set the latter tune like several others 
contains standard country melodies in this case its a piano line 
that sounds like its going up and down up and down the melody 
staircase 
despite the upbeat cuts this record aint a hoedown keeping 
with country tradition crowell gets gritty and personal ive 
seen my troubles smoking down on the tracks my nose all bloodied 
taste of salt in my tears he sings on the lps cornerstone 
the faith is mine 
that faith helped crowell cope with his fathers death things 
i wish id said is a tender ode to james crowell it might have 
been a maudlin tearjerker in another country artists mouth but 
crowell sounds sincere and sturdy 
his personal touch also comes through on now that were 
alone crowells female fans would say yeah lets snuggle but 
theres his wife rosanne cash warbling unobtrusively in the 
background she also lends vocals on other tracks 
this time however crowell is out of the johnny cashcarter 
family shadow hes proved himself a major country artist in his 
own right

flood elektra they might be giants 
 
pop music like most everything else takes itself too 
seriously which is why we need bands like they might be giants 
their first majorlabel album flood has been criticized 
for not being trenchant that alone justifies its existence a 
record that isnt trenchant cant be all bad 
on flood they might be giants singersongwriters john 
flansburgh and john linnell have given us 19 songs that are part 
spike jones and part pet sounds the music never stays in one 
place long enough to become dull and often its quite catchy 
birdhouse in your soul has a fine rock n roll kick 
twisting is the best surfing music yet this decade and 
someone keeps moving my chair offers not one not two but 
three great hooks also memorable are a couple of 30second cuts 
the quasiponderous opening fanfare that announces the album and a 
department store jingle that includes a cracking whip and three 
words minimum wage heeyah 
other lyrics stand out as well and at least one can be cited 
without giving away the plot everybody wants prosthetic 
foreheads on their real heads 
sure its silly stuff flood is filled with musical jokes 
that perhaps would stick to the ribs rather than just tickle them 
if they were motivated by a point of view rather than simply a 
desire for laughs but within the realm of silly music some of the 
socially conscious pap found these days in the top 40 makes 
flood sound awfully good

how could anyone write an autobiography at 
the age of 15 its possible when you consider the young life of 
drew barrymore 
at the age of 6 she was starring in steven spielbergs et 
the extraterrestrial the most successful film of all time she 
was a drinker at 9 marijuana smoker at 10 cocaine user at 12 
recovering addict at 14 
little girl lost pocket books 1795 is the apt title of 
the teenagers memoir written with todd gold the book describes 
in harrowing detail her descent into a juvenile abyss of deception 
excess and degradation the road back has been rocky 
after a wild drunken spree drew underwent 87 days of 
rehabilitation in a hospital released she embarked on another 
bender flying from new york to los angeles on a credit card stolen 
from her mother the second treatment she hopes will be her last 
it was never the work that was the problem with drew it was 
the time inbetween remarks her mother ildiko barrymore that 
is the problem for many actors how to fill that time between the 
jobs the jobs give you a sense of selfworth and accomplishment 
the barrymores have a long history of alcoholism and addiction 
drews grandfather john barrymore and aunt diana were destroyed 
by drink as were members of earlier generations drews father 
john jr has had a long history of addiction he is a menacing 
figure in little girl lost a wildbearded wreck who turned up 
only to abuse his daughter and former wife and ask for money 
i was not aware of the extent that genetic predisposition 
has says ildiko barrymore once you become aware of that you 
deal with it on a level of more intelligence in terms of what needs 
to be done 
drew now 15 and her mother live on a quiet street in the san 
fernando valley one day after school drew sat down for an 
interview always an attractive girl she has turned into a 
teenage beauty and she talks thoughtfully about the tumultuous 
events of her young life 
q how can you write a life story at your age 
a people were saying you should tell your story you should 
tell your story i was really too scared to i got a few 
different offers to write a book and i chose one it was really 
scary to lay your life on the line you dont know what the 
feedback is going to be will it be positive or negative i took 
the risk 
q did you realize you would have to live through the bad 
periods again 
a it was scary in the fact that you would have to bring up 
these issues you had already dealt with or are scared to deal with 
again but i just focused on positive energy and went with the flow 
q how do you answer those who might say youre writing the book 
for exploitation or publicity 
a i certainly wasnt looking for publicity because id gotten 
enough before i wrote the book i know exactly why i wrote it 
theres a lot of parents with kids who may not be addicts or 
alcoholics but who can relate to what ive gone through they could 
know that theyre not alone that was real comforting to me to 
know that im not alone in this situation that im going through 
q was one of your problems that you have spent most of your 
life in an adult world 
a i dont think it really helped but it was more me in 
wanting to fit in so badly and to be at their level so badly i 
thought that was what i was supposed to do 
q did steven spielberg have an important influence on you 
a he is probably the most important male ever in my life he 
means everything to me hes given me a lot of experience a lot of 
good advice the nurturing i never got from my dad he filled a lot 
of empty spaces just by being there 
q what was your relationship to your father 
a the little bit of relationship that there was was very 
abusive and just chaotic even though it was like that i just 
wasnt going to accept that he wasnt going to come back i had 
this fantasy in my mind that i was going to have father knows 
best walk through the door i wanted that so bad and i wasnt 
going to face reality that it wasnt going to happen 
q even though your mother was loving and supportive you had 
resentments with her why 
a when i was little she had to work all the time i felt like 
she was abandoning me but she really wasnt she was just working 
and making money for us later on i just wasnt there at all i 
would turn the table around and say that she wasnt there for me 
every time she would be with me id walk out the door there was a 
lot of friction there 
q what was your lowest point 
a probably when i went back into rehab the last time i had hit 
many emotional bottoms but there was always 1 percent of me out of 
100 that thought i would make it out this time i honestly did not 
think i would make it out through sheer love of people i cared 
about and my own wanting it for nobody but myself i worked through 
it but it was really scary 
q what is your life like today 
a its very calm and mellow there are times when its in the 
fast lane and there are times when its in the slooow lane im 
usually somewhere inbetween which is where i always wanted to be 
im living life one day at a time i go to meetings i go to 
movies i act stupid im not afraid to be my age anymore then 
there are times when i act like 20 
i was always so scared to ever ever ever act my age scared 
what people would think now i really dont care because i have 
fun 
q what do you do when people offer you a drink 
a as soon as i got sober it has been eight months now i 
havent had many days of temptation so if anyone doesnt know im 
sober and they offer me a drink i automatically say no 
its hard i have to make sure i dont go in slippery places 
with slippery people i have to make sure that i dont say anything 
rude to my mom by accident because thats what i used to do at 
first it was like walking on egg shells but day by day it gets 
better and better

its kind of like falling in love 
your favorite treasure is a meissen figurine that once belonged 
to your aunt one day you spot another maybe in a little shop and 
you have to have it 
by the time you find a third youre head over heels and willing 
to spend a weeks salary in short youre a collector 
bob rau collects art glass while dana garrett has a soft spot 
for scotty dogs as creators and cohosts of the collectors 
series on pbs rau and garrett have seen passions ranging from 
classic cars to fine crystal from priceless antiques to 
twoperpenny baseball cards and vintage bowling shirts 
says rau enthusiasm makes great television 
now in its fourth season the collectors is distributed to 
262 stations nationwide statistically 82 percent of the homes 
using television it is by far the most successful locally produced 
program in the history of oregon public broadcasting 
nine years ago garrett was an unemployed actress she hadnt 
done any television until she filled in for a local talk show host 
who was on maternity leave she interviewed every manner of 
celebrity newsmaker and oddball during that fourmonth stint but 
her favorite guest was rau an affable insurance executive whose 
hobby was antiques 
before the program garrett assembled some props to show how 
easy it was to mistake a very good reproduction for an authentic 
tiffany lamp rau noticed the difference from 100 feet away 
thats a nice reproduction he told her as he gently 
examined the other you know ive got the base for this tiffany 
lamp 
four years later her television career wellestablished 
garrett was looking for a new challenge and she remembered rau 
it had been years since their first meeting but she picked up 
the phone and asked whether hed be interested in doing an 
interview program for antique collectors as it happened rau was 
newly retired and the idea sounded like fun 
the pilot program was straight out of andy hardy like a 
neighborhood troupe doing a talent show garrett produced they 
both starred and an old friend directed there were 24 people in 
the audience counting family members 
from its first airing in 1984 the collectors seemed charmed 
for two days the studio was swamped with postcards and letters 
of praise when the program didnt appear at the same time the 
following sunday the switchboard was flooded with calls garrett 
and rau were clearly on to something 
production began that fall and the first series started in 
janaury 1985 
their next lucky break came midway through the production of 
their third season when oregon public broadcasting hired a new 
executive director maynard orme who had seen some clips of the 
collectors he stopped by the set one day 
the first thing he asked was whats being done to take this 
show national garrett recalls i took one look at him and i 
said youre a collector 
indeed orme had a collection of 1000 model trains 
they submitted a tape to national public broadcasting service 
that fall and were told not to expect any reaction for six to 
eight weeks the positive response came within six days the 
decisionmaker was yet another collector 
each halfhour program has a general theme with several short 
features and interviews with experts in between rau conducts 
spontaneous appraisals of collectibles furnished by a live audience 
although he is astonishing in his knowledge of antiques and 
collectibles of all types rau like all collectors is happiest 
telling about his own specialty 
it began innocently enough with a vinegar cruet handed down 
from his grandmother by 1963 hed assembled a minor collection of 
cruets all in the 3 to 6 range then a fellow offered to sell 
him an art glass piece for 90 
his interest piqued rau began studying about cameo and art 
glass and he began collecting in earnest 
rau learned as one friend put it there was a big difference 
between a vase and a vahzz somehow he was able to make the 
difference plain to his banker who lent him 40000 to invest in 
art glass 
if youre thinking thats a lot of vinegar cruets consider that 
his collection today is worth a cool 1 million 
money however is not the point this is love after all 
happily its there for anybody 
few people can collect rare paintings but signed pieces by 
talented artisans may be a worthwhile investment a sentimental 
display of old toys gathered lovingly over a 30year period may 
also be worth money over time 
if youre willing to spend 200 for an addition to your 
collection youve reached what rau calls an advanced stage of 
acquisition he and garrett agree on some simple ground rules for 
wisely assembling a collection 
first educate your eye read everything you can about your 
subject books price lists and the many good magazines for traders 
next you should get handson experience by going to auctions 
and sales a corollary of the second rule is to leave your 
checkbook at home until you know what theyre doing dont rush 
into it 
the keys to collecting are pride and emotional attachment says 
garrett and she tries to explain the feeling you want it you 
want to live with it you want to put it on the mantle and look at 
it every day 
the third rule is the most important garrett and rau promise if 
you let your heart be your guide you wont be disappointed 
you never regret what you buy says rau youll only 
regret what you dont

midafternoon a manhattan hotel room in walks 
smokey robinson the sweater wool the jeans denim the voice a 
mixture of silk and grain 
rock n rolls greeneyed handsome man is now 50 and his songs 
his babies have grown up too shop around turns 30 this 
year my girl is 25 the tears of a clown 20 but the 
singer looking trim and upbeat has aged well and so have his 
songs 
its in the blood robinson figures thats one reason his 
father lived to 89 and robinson swears he didnt look past 60 until 
a heart attack two years before his death 
musically robinson has never forgotten the advice of motown 
founder berry gordy jr make the song a story a complete thought 
be sure anyone can relate to it and if you leave something out 
give people enough so they can fill in their own ending 
take his 1965 classic with the miracles the tracks of my 
tears 
marv tarplin came up with the opening riff and if a guitar could 
cry it would sound like this one with just a few notes marv 
could whip up an emotional hurricane the singer recalled smokey 
knew the song would be about a cat whod been cut deep hurt by 
heartache 
add drums bass some harmonies and hes ready to begin 
people say im the life of the party cause i tell a joke or 
two although i might be laughing loud and hearty deep inside im 
blue 
the riff had haunted smokey for months he sings carefully his 
voice quivering slightly on laughing playing so closely off 
the guitar that the words seem to slide from the strings 
take a good look at my face youll see my smile seems out of 
place 
smokeys singing to an old girlfriend since she left him hes 
been trying to show that hes better off without her but thats a 
lie 
he thought of the songs title after spotting a man who had 
cried so much that tears were streaked all over his face smokey 
turns those words into a dare a threat only a fool wouldnt 
believe him 
if you look closer its easy to trace the tracks of my tears 
its not working she doesnt want him midway theres a pause 
as if everyones waiting for his next move a drum fill breaks the 
silence and smokey pours it on driving his point home the singer 
and band hammering down on every word 
mysmileismymakeupiwearsincemybreakupwithyou 
bring up it in the end man gordy had told him repeat 
that its easy to trace the tracks of my tears refrain until 
you wear it out 
his voice cracking smokey pleads one more time take a 
guhhhhhhhhd look at my face by the end hes down on his 
knees calling baby baby baby 
he gordy instilled me that idea of telling a story to the 
degree that i was probably one of the most critical of songwriters 
in the history of songwriters insisted robinson whose new album 
is called love smokey the single everything you touch is 
already a hit 
when i write a song i dont want to just write a hit record 
i want a song that in 2291 people can see that and say hey i 
want to record this because its still relevant i want to be 
beethoven i want to be bach and i approach it with the same 
attitude 
so call his songs symphonies for moonlight drives and 
candlelight suppers concertos for what love is made of it all 
starts with a phrase robinson says or a riff from tarplin a few 
of the results going to a go go you really got a hold on 
me i second that emotion ooh baby baby 
you see man explained robinson starting on a lunch of 
juice and pancakes i grew up loving irving berlin and cole 
porter those were the songs being played in my house ella 
fitzgerald sarah vaughan billy eckstine nat king cole as a 
teenager i loved leiber and stoller burt bacharach and hal 
david ive always loved songs and songwriters 
love smokey was completed four times before robinson would 
release it he cant put his finger on it he just knew something 
was missing motown used to be like that every monday morning 
gordy would gather his star writers for a little love critique 
and everyone would pitch songs hard 
you brought your stuff and i had four records that i recorded 
on the temptations and norman whitfield had two and 
hollanddozierholland had three everybody went into that 
meeting man with high hopes recalled robinson 
we were very critical of each other we all wanted each other 
to be the best that we could be 
the past decade has been uneven for this smoothest of soul 
singers the highlights the hit singles being with you and 
just to see her which earned him a grammy in 1988 for best rampb 
vocal performance for a male induction into the rock and roll hall 
of fame in 1986 
but there have been tears real tears easy to trace his 
marriage of 27 years to claudette robinson his childhood 
sweetheart and a former miracle broke up his close friend marvin 
gaye was killed by his father in 1984 robinsons own father had 
died before that 
and robinson began using cocaine heavily 
when dad died i called marvin gaye dad when he died i 
was not involved in drugs to that degree which made it even more 
stupid to get into them after he had gone and died just to see how 
drugs beat his life down and what it did to him should have been 
enough 
robinson kicked drugs three years ago but that hasnt changed 
him he says or his music love smokey consists of ballads 
light dance songs and an experiment with rap on dont wanna be 
just physical 
worldwide travelers you aint been nowhere till youve 
traveled down loves road robinson wrote that as a teenager and 
hes never stopped revising it 
heartaches and all robinson insists hes always been happy the 
kind of guy who could sing about sugar and spice and everything 
nice and make it sound like folk wisdom 
the fact is im glad to be alive because by all rights i 
should be dead he said i approach it with the same enthusiasm 
i always have and i hope i always do

that estimable victorian philanthropist dr 
henry jekyll had a number of servants in his employ a butler a 
housemaid a cook and that creepy man he called his laboratory 
assistant mr hyde 
valerie martin has taken a fresh look at robert louis 
stevensons classic tale of the doppelganger that lurks in each of 
us and written mary reilly doubleday 1895 which is the 
strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde as told by the housemaid 
in stevensons version the housemaid is glimpsed only briefly 
weeping loudly at the sight of dr jekylls soliciter who has been 
summoned to the house to investigate possible foul play by mr 
hyde she is never named 
martin dubbed her mary reilly had her learn to read and write 
at a school financed by jekylls largesse and set her to keeping a 
diary of the goingson at the wellappointed mansion she gets an 
eyeful what with mr hyde wandering through the house at odd hours 
and dr jekyll sending her to seedy soho on mysterious errands 
martin in a recent interview is asked if anyone has said to 
her how dare you fiddle with a classic 
i could say i didnt fiddle with it at all theres been a lot 
of fiddling with it whole new plots added on she said a 
reference to film versions that have provided the scientist with a 
fiancee and so forth i think ive stayed very respectifully 
inside of that framework nothing that happened in stevensons book 
has been changed i didnt give him any girlfriend 
martin often assigns dr jekyll and mr hyde to her students 
at the university of massachusetts near amherst where she teaches 
graduate creative writing and undergraduate literature courses she 
offered several explanations as to why the book published in 1886 
endures 
its the old traditional proud man brought low tale also 
its a horror story the idea of the terrible thing being inside 
rather than outside adds sort of a fatal quality to it its 
also very dreamlike and atmospheric very quickstroke and clean 
in the telling 
although stevensons story predates freudian analysis martin 
thinks thats another reason for its appeal there is sort of a 
consensus that psychologically this is an accurate description of a 
repression complex 
what interested me about it is that we seem to have bought 
into the notion that repressed anger should be expressed but this 
book describes something i think is very true that the expression 
of it only intensifies it she said citing studies that show 
that the more often one commits violence the easier it becomes 
mary reilly is an engaging believable narrator an energetic 
worker who takes pride in a job well done and who speaks her mind 
when jekyll asks martin has succeeded at the tricky balancing act 
of rendering such a character articulate without making her sound 
too educated she also has succeeded in crafting a story that is 
absorbing even though the reader already knows the outcome 
to get the protagonists voice right martin dug up journals of 
servants not easy to find since most were illiterate in 
libraries on both sides of the atlantic toured victorian 
restorations to get a sense of how such households were set up and 
even blacked a woodstove with polish to gain firsthand experience 
i never did find out why they swept tea leaves on the 
carpet martin confessed although the reader finds mary reilly 
dutifully doing so because the authors research showed it was a 
common task 
part of the quality that she has does come from journals that 
i read of servants who took pride in their work martin said 
youve got to find some way to feel that your work is worth doing 
or your life is essentially worthless 
martin is aware that although virtually everyone knows the 
jekyll and hyde story many may not have read the stevenson 
original 
i tried to disremember all the previous movie versions and 
treatments when writing mary reilly i hope that my book is 
enjoyable just as a read all by itself she said hoping that 
readers would understand everything they need to know about the 
original 
martin a softspoken woman who phrases her words carefully has 
written five previous novels including the consolidation of 
nature a recent martyr and alexandria she is often 
labeled a gothic writer which she thinks probably stems from her 
southern roots she was born in missouri and raised in new orleans 
although she has no trace of a southern accent 
im never quite sure what people mean by gothic she said 
asked for her own definition she replied mischievously i think 
theres a lot of humidity in gothic novels fog and vapor and 
such 
film rights for mary reilly have been purchased by warner 
bros roman polanski has expressed interest in directing it

conway twitty thinks the reason why hes had so 
many no 1 hits during his 34 years in music is a matter of 
percentages 
if theres any secret to my longevity in this business its 
the fact i always put 99 percent of emphasis on the song he 
says its one percent singer record company and everything 
else as far as im concerned 
theres also been the element of luck my dad told me when i 
was a kid when the cotton is out there you get it when its not 
out there you can rest ive been very fortunate it has been out 
there for me a long time 
twitty has had more no 1 hit singles in billboard magazine than 
anyone else in country music merle haggard is second or anyone in 
pop 
one of his recent no 1 singles was julia one night at a 
show in minneapolis fans as usual placed roses with notes attached 
along the edge of the stage i always try to read them twitty 
said that night i didnt but the next night i asked my wife to 
read me a few of the notes one said dear conway im here 
tonight please sing my song love julia 
i thought that was fantastic thats what its all about 
between a recording artist and his fans youre supposed to sing it 
just to one just to her 
in april mca records is releasing a compact disc with 25 hit 
singles heartland records sells a conway twitty collection on 
television twittys latest record house on old lonesome road 
came out last may his next of 10 new songs will come out in 
september 
making a record is a good threemonth process with us he 
said well go through between two and threethousand songs in 
that threemonth period 
ive written about 20 of the 54 number one records ive had 
and hundreds of things in albums we compare one song against 
another in that threemonth period my songs if theyre not good 
enough they dont make it 
i always keep them if nobody else records them then for the 
next album we put them back in the pot again 
twitty takes his relationship with his fans seriously which is 
why he doesnt sing medleys or update arrangements in concerts 
i make sure the people in my band whove been with me for 
years play exactly the same little licks that are on the record 
he said i sing them exactly people only hear that song once a 
year and they want to hear it just exactly the way you recorded 
it 
but twitty does sometimes welcome change on his last three 
albums he has taken the advice of producer jimmy bowen who 
suggested i know you do your best to put 10 singles on an album 
i want you to think about four hit songs and the other six being 
pieceofbusiness songs great little songs you would never think 
radio would like 
twitty thought of all the songs hed like to have recorded and 
didnt and instantly agreed it put a new spark in my recording 
life i really have enjoyed it i think it has added some years to 
my career 
through the years twittys tunes have primarily been love 
songs his target was women 
ive always had a lot of men fans he said men have never 
felt threatened by conway twitty my image has never been one of a 
man out to get your woman i say things i think a woman wants to 
hear and men want to say and dont know how to say all he has to 
do is drop a quarter in the jukebox and at the appropriate time 
squeeze her a little bit she gets the message and conway twitty 
has got another hit weve got a fan out of him too 
he and his first wife have four children he and second wife 
dee henry have been married three years 
twitty was in rock n roll from 1956 to 1965 his first no 1 
record in 1958 was a teen ballad he wrote its only make 
believe when he decided to switch to country managers 
promoters booking agents and record company people told him hed 
be going from thousands of dollars to 200 a day 
it took me two years to make the move he said finally i 
had to do something that was not my style i walked out on them i 
realized they were not going to let me go i told them i thought i 
had fulfilled my obligations to them 
the next week i was making 200 a night looking back there 
is no doubt i made the right move i was never sorry not even that 
first week it was time to do that and i just did it 
ive always judged success by if you make a living at 
something you love to do then youre successful if you can make a 
really good living at something you love to do then youre a 
successful happy person

the entry requirements are few 
you have to be an active downhill skier you must be 70 years 
of age says lloyd t lambert founder of the 70plus ski club 
you pay 5 for a lifetime membership 
the claims more than 5500 members across the country 
im not that speedy any more but weve got some really 
really hot shots said lambert 89 who heads the group from his 
home in ballston lake 
senior citizens are staying in shape on the slopes in droves 
these days and the trend shows no signs of slowing with older 
americans keener than ever to stay active skiing is an ideal way 
to exercise through the winter 
its caught on now to where it membership has grown 75 
percent a year said bill vandersluin 59 spokesman for the over 
the hill gang an elderly skiers group based in aurora colo 
one member from los angeles is living proof theres never any 
shortage of energy in the group said vandersluin 
she skis like a demon he said shes 86 and she has no 
grey hair 
the over the hill gang which offers its 2400 members white 
water rafting deep sea fishing and hiking as well as skiing trips 
has a minimum membership age of 50 
about 68 percent of the 18 million to 20 million skiers in the 
united states are 55 or older said chris stoddard a spokesman for 
the united ski industries association the association is a 
national trade group for ski areas and ski equipment suppliers 
the 70plus ski club and the over the hill gang hold ski 
gatherings across the country and provide their members with 
information about where they can ski for free or at discount rates 
three hundred older skiers descended on the catskills in new 
york earlier this month for the 70plus ski clubs annual meeting 
and races at hunter mountain 
lambert got back from a 70plus trip to switzerland last month 
but hes off again for more skiing in july this time to argentina 
injuries among elderly skiers are few and the accidents they 
suffer often have little to do with their age lambert said 
these guys on snow boards have run into a few of our 
members said lambert one had a broken shoulder another had 
broken ribs and another one was bumped around 
injuries on the slopes have been reduced from 77 accidents per 
1000 ski visits in the 1950s to 25 injuries per 1000 visits 
today according to stoddard 
skiing has an image that youre going to fall and break 
something he said that image is just not true 
stoddard said many older skiers avoid injury because they are 
usually experienced and he attributed the overall drop in skiing 
injuries to improvements in boot bindings and snow making and 
grooming 
lambert recalls pine toestrap skies he owned when he first hit 
the slopes in 1915 
you couldnt turn or do anything that you could today because 
you had nothing to hold your heel in place lambert said if 
you wanted to stop you had to fall down or kick the skis off

men can rent the tuxedo cummerbund bow 
tie and black patent leather shoes but women have had to buy their 
formal wear 
not any more 
shops that rent evening prom and even wedding dresses along 
with loads of accessories for a fraction of the price of buying 
are shattering sartorial sexism from coast to coast 
frill seekers in richmond one night stand in new york london 
and philadelphia til midnight in washington dc and dress to 
kill in los angeles offer an alternative to the 12000 
storebought evening gown 
i couldnt understand why there were many places in town for 
men to rent tuxedos but no place for women said frill seekers 
owner chris melson who got the idea after finding prom dresses for 
her daughter expensive 
about 60 of 100 dresses from size 3 to 13 at frill seekers 
which opened last april have designer labels rentals range from 
30 to 125 for dresses that retail for 150 to nearly 1000 
including the cost of dry cleaning 
also rentable are gloves purses jewelry and slips and if the 
renter spills a drink or otherwise damages a dress she and ms 
melson negotiate the cost of the damage 
alan millstein author of fashion network report a monthly 
garment industry newsletter in new york said renting formal wear 
for women may be new in some places but the japanese have been 
renting wedding dresses for years 
they do serve a purpose wear it once and look great and of 
course not make an investment he said 
its like mcdonalds is not for dining but for feeding 
millstein said these clothing emporiums take care of not 
dressing but body covering with some kind of style 
while ms melson operates frill seekers out of a spare bedroom 
the 1800squarefoot one night stand on madison avenue in new york 
carries 700 dresses owner joanna doniger buys dresses new from 
designers a dress that would retail for 3000 rents for 250 she 
said 
a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon and why not 
she said in a telephone interview from new york it will be an 
enormous business in the next few years 
ms doniger opened the shop in london in 1983 and expanded to 
new york in 1987 the idea for the store was born after ms doniger 
experienced a moment of panic one night when she had nothing to 
wear 
men have been renting tuxes for years she said a woman 
wants to wear the thing just once you can fantasize for a 
night and its fun 
cathy baker opened til midnight last september to hit an 
untapped market in washington clients for her 300 evening dresses 
wedding dresses and pageant gowns include politicians wives and 
other capital partygoers 
but many women still are reluctant to rent a dress shop owners 
say 
rental conjures up all sorts of connotations like polyester 
bridesmaid gowns ms baker said and another misconception is 
people think they are renting old dresses but we update every 
season with the latest styles 
the problem is mainly just getting them in the store said 
joan rokahr part owner of dress to kill in los angeles once 
they get in they say this is great this is wonderful im never 
buying another dress 
rentals on dresses that would retail for 900 to 12000 go for 
100 to 350 at dress to kill ms rokahr said her dresses have 
been worn to glitzy hollywood charity balls and entertainment 
industry events even the academy awards

opec members are looking to eastern 
europe as a promising crude oil market as the region loosens 
economic ties with the soviet union its dominant supplier to date 
experts predict oil demand will increase as the emerging 
democracies change the centrally planned economies of their former 
communist rulers into freemarket models of the west 
they are going to depend less and less on the soviet union 
iraqi oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi said in an 
interview 
they must improve their economy and that means they have 
to consume more energy he said the only way to get that is 
from oil and the only way to get that is from opec countries 
experts say more emphasis may be placed on producing consumer 
goods the auto industry often ignored in the past may be 
targeted for improvement and more cars would lead to greater 
demand for gasoline 
these countries have no other way they must improve their 
consumption said irans oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
kuwait plans to set up offices in eastern european capitals 
soviet production shortfalls already have led some nations to turn 
to members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
they are certainly starting to become interested said 
joseph stanislaw managing director of cambridge energy research 
associates in paris it is a natural market for opec to go into 
the soviet union the worlds biggest oil producer long has 
been the dominant crude supplier to its eastbloc allies but 
analysts expect its tight grip to ease with the expiration next 
year of multiyear contracts with several nations 
in negotiating new accords moscow is likely to raise prices and 
demand payment in dollars or other hard currency analysts 
said the east european countries now pay in soviet rubles 
worthless outside the east bloc or by bartering equipment and 
other goods for oil 
once theyre paying in hard currency its a whole new ball 
game said jan vanous research director at planecon a 
washington consulting firm theyll start shopping around 
opec for the first time has a real shot at competing for the 
delivery of oil for domestic consumption he said 
opec secretarygeneral subroto said in a recent interview that a 
hardcurrency requirement would prompt the countries to look for 
convenience which side can supply them at the best price and 
quality 
east european countries also may want to line up other oil 
suppliers in case of disruptions or shortages in the soviet union 
which is undergoing its own political and economic upheavals 
for example the southern azerbaijan region a recent target of 
ethnic strife is a key producer of service equipment for the 
soviet oil and gas industry 
even so analysts said the backward economies of eastern europe 
will not present an enormous market for opec oil any time soon 
stanislaw estimated total oil consumption by poland hungary 
czechoslovakia east germany romania yugoslavia and bulgaria at a 
modest 15 million to 17 million barrels a day 
the 13 opec countries produce more than 23 million barrels of 
oil a day the soviet union pumped 125 million barrels a day last 
year about 350000 barrels less than in 1988 said pierre terzian 
editor of the paris newsletter petrostrategies 
soviet oil exports amounted to 35 million barrels a day last 
year down from 37 million barrels in 1988 and 42 million barrels 
in 1987 he said 
to make up for shortfalls in soviet supplies romania hungary 
and bulgaria have turned to opec oil mostly from iran and iraq 
said peter gignoux director of international energy at shearson 
lehman hutton inc in london 
iraq has supplied crude to eastern europe for some time while 
iran wants to increase business there their oil ministers said 
both countries badly need money from crude sales to repair 
economies damaged by the eightyear gulf war 
kuwait has a reputation for pursuing overseas investments 
aggressively oil minister ali khalifa alsabah recently visited 
hungary and said kuwait was watching changes in the region closely 
alsabah told the middle east economic survey that the 
stateowned kuwait petroleum corp planned to set up small offices 
in each of eastern europes capitals to monitor developments

panamas new civilian government is 
turning to the united states for help in recharging an economy 
wracked by high unemployment sagging productivity and the threat 
of widespread unrest 
we cannot sit and wait national comptroller ruben dario 
carles said every unemployed person has a reason to protest and 
it will be bad if 200000 protest 
an estimated onethird of panamas workers are out of work 
gross domestic product has plummeted the government scrimping to 
keep itself afloat is relying on the united states for aid 
carlos rodriguez a panamanian who is vice president of the 
american chamber of commerce said panama risks strikes unrest and 
a backlash against the new government and the united states if the 
economy does not improve 
for now the government of president guillermo endara enjoys 
wide popularity the us invasion in december ousted gen manuel 
antonio noriega and washington shortly afterward lifted economic 
sanctions 
but the sanctions and the siphoning of money under noriega had 
left panamas economy in tatters the invasion also prompted 
widespread looting and vandalism that temporarily closed about 90 
percent of the countrys businesses 
during a 13day fast that began march 1 endara criticized the 
slowness of promised us aid and the release of government funds 
frozen during the noriega regime 
people cannot eat democracy endara said there could be 
popular unrest unless there are some quick solutions the 
congressional delay of approval endangers our democracy 
the bush administration has proposed a 1 billion aid package 
congress has approved 43 million to rebuild the chorrillo 
neighborhood destroyed in the invasion and the start of credit 
valued by the administration at 500 million 
but a bush administration call for 500 million in cash aid is 
expected to encounter difficulties in congress 
panamanians argue that the country is equipped to use the money 
effectively more so than reforming countries of east european that 
may be competing for assistance 
panama is not a basket case like some other countries it has 
good infrastructure a good entrepreneurial class rodriguez said 
with a dollarbased economy panama was a thriving international 
banking and trade center but it came to a nearhalt amid political 
turmoil following indictments of noriega on drug trafficking 
charges a nineweek bank closure in 1988 and the sanctions 
assets in the cluster of gleaming modern banking towers 
plummeted from 40 billion in june 1987 to less than 15 million 
two years later business has slowed to a trickle on streets that 
once teemed with visitors buying cameras electronic equipment 
watches and tailormade suits 
panamas gross domestic poduct fell 20 percent in 1988 and 
another 75 percent in 1989 much of what flowed into government 
coffers gushed out in corruption officials said 
if you stop the corruption that by itself is income it was 
that bad said second vice president guillermo ford who also is 
the planning minister 
the citys kindergartens for example have 3000 more a month 
since a department head was jailed for stealing from tuition 
unemployment about 20 percent before the invasion and under 10 
percent before the us sanctions were enacted in 1987 is 
estimated at above 30 percent now 
jorge heraza 21 finished high school three years ago with a 
specialty in commercial accounting a seemingly practical career in 
a more than 70 percent service economy he still doesnt have a 
job despite repeated applications 
ousting noriega and installing endara seemed like a good idea 
but they must follow through heraza said they say theyre 
going to give jobs but unemployment with what has happened there 
is more 
the government has been getting by on tax revenue still slow 
but improving and partial release of 390 million in frozen funds 
government officials slashed their own salaries saving 21 
million a year endara cut his pay to 7000 a month from 10000 a 
month 
until it catches up on 540 million in arrears on a 52 billion 
foreign debt panama will be ineligible for new multilateral and 
commercial bank loans 
the governments strategy is to strengthen the private sector 
ford said it plans to privatize stateowned air panama sugar 
mills and cement and citrus processing plants 
some businessmen even suggest that the panama canal to be 
turned over to panama on dec 31 1999 could be operated as a 
concession or its services privatized

fiveyear contracts with wage reductions and 
nostrike clauses are among the concessions united airlines unions 
are offering in their quest to buy parent ual corp for more than 
38 billion 
nonunion employees who would share in the proposed 75 percent 
workers stake also would give up wages and benefits in the event 
of an employee buyout according to documents made public tuesday 
the filings were made by the buyout group with the securities 
and exchange commission in washington 
the group said annual payroll costs for noncontract employees 
would be reduced by 55 million from a 1990 base and reductions 
would remain in effect during the term of labor agreements 
the proposed contracts included in the filings appeared to 
indicate that uniteds three union groups would take 
wageandbenefit cuts of about 10 percent but union spokesmen 
would not confirm the amount of the reduction 
the labor agreements would depend on approval of the buyout by 
ual stockholders the ability of the unions to secure financing and 
ratification of the contracts by the union rankandfile who 
comprise about twothirds of uals work force 
uniteds pilots machinists and flight attendants unions monday 
announced a bid that values ual at more than 38 billion the 
offer is composed of 150 per share in cash 25 per share in debt 
securities and nonvoting common stock in the new company with an 
undetermined value 
analysts have calculated the offers value at 175 to 190 per 
share or as much as 41 billion 
coniston partners a new york investment group and uals largest 
stockholder with an 118 percent stake is backing the unions with 
the threat of a proxy fight aimed at replacing uals board with 
directors who would favor an employee buyout 
uals stock fell 250 tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
closing at 152 a share 
the buyout of the nations secondlargest airline would create 
the countrys biggest employeeowned company 
ual chairman stephen wolf has said the board will consider the 
offer at an upcoming meeting expected to be held this week ual 
spokesman joe hopkins would not confirm a date 
in january the unions said they and the noncontract employees 
would help defray the cost of a takeover with wage and benefit 
concessions worth about 2 billion over five years including about 
300 million in the first year of the takeover 
in a 68 billion pilotmanagement buyout bid that failed last 
october leaders of uniteds pilots union had agreed tentatively to 
a sevenyear nostrike contract with 10 percent pay cuts for most 
pilots 
the pilots also had planned to use retirement funds to buy 200 
million worth of stock in the company 
nonunion ual employees also would have taken 10 percent pay cuts 
as part of the 300ashare plan which collapsed oct 13 
triggering a plunge in the stock market after banks refused to 
finance it 
the documents filed with the sec state that the coniston proxy 
slate would include four employee representatives the three 
coniston principals and eight candidates from the business 
community 
paul tierney jr one of conistons three principal partners 
said the unions would be allowed to pick a new ual chairman if 
coniston wins the proxy fight 
the unions have been negotiating with richard ravitch formerly 
chairman of new yorks metropolitan transportation authority to 
replace wolf but say they have made no decision

general motors corp is looking to 
police departments and taxi companies to help support sales figures 
for its newly redesigned chevrolet caprice fullsize car 
the new 1991 caprice which went on sale to the public earlier 
this month is the preferred car of law enforcement agencies 
nationwide gm needs to maintain or increase those sales to hold 
its share of the fullsize car market 
chevrolet sold about 50000 1990model caprices to police 
agencies and taxi fleets chevrolet general manager jim perkins 
said tuesday 
we expect sales of 1991 caprice police and taxis to remain 
about the same he said chevrolet expects to sell about 200000 
caprices during the 1991 model year the first full year of 
production of the new models 
the new caprice shown off tuesday at gms newly refurbished 
willow run assembly plant west of detroit is much more rounded 
than previous caprice models and from some angles appears similar 
to fords mercury sable 
gm spent 85 million for changes at willow run as part of a 
plant modernization program that united auto workers union vice 
president stephen yokich noted on tuesday 
the uaw and the nations big three automakers begin negotiations 
in july to agree on a contract replacing one that expires sept 14 
the capital investment in this plant and the equipment needed 
to start up a new product like this was very substantial yokich 
said we have to remember however no auto company has ever 
invested so much in capital equipment and still managed to lose so 
much in market share 
during the 1980s gm spent about 77 billion mainly for capital 
improvements in upgrading assembly and component plants between 
the end of 1982 and the end of last year gms share of the 
usmade car market dropped 4 percentage points to 48 percent 
one way to boost market share as the industry shrinks in 1990 is 
to hold or increase fleet sales 
perkins said he expected up to 30000 police versions of caprice 
and up to 25000 taxi versions to be sold during the 1991 model 
year more than half of all the police cars sold last year were 
caprices followed by fords crown victoria also a 
rearwheeldrive fullsize car 
but other players are coming into the police car market and 
theyll make it tougher for the fullsize gm and ford cars to hold 
their own ford is offering a mustang outfitted for police use and 
later this year gm will offer a police option package on its 
chevrolet camaro 
when automakers make police cars they swap out some standard 
equipment and replace it with components more suited to rugged 
driving 
in the caprice chevrolet offers an optional 57liter engine in 
place of the standard 5liter engine and larger tires for 
highspeed driving a variety of options also is available so law 
enforcement agencies can customize a car to their needs 
the local agency equips the vehicles with among other things 
radios cages separating the front and rear seats and sirens 
the mustang and the camaro which can reach 100 mph much quicker 
than their larger cousins are expected to attract state highway 
patrols which might use them to prowl freeways for speeders 
because of their size fullsize caprice and crown victoria cars 
are expected to remain popular with taxi companies and police 
departments which require fourdoors and door space for occupants 
who frequently must get in and out of the vehicle

an adviser to some of corporate 
americas most powerful takeover artists became another symbol of 
wall streets decline when he pleaded quilty to stealing 1 million 
from clients 
donald c carter 41 chairman of the carter organization inc 
waived indictment and pleaded guilty tuesday in state supreme court 
in manhattan to grand larceny and filing a false and fradulent 
personal income tax return 
he then was fired by the firm he founded the carter 
organization said it was unaware about the plead guilty until 
carter revealed it in mondays wall street journal 
in fact the company said that until that time mr carter 
denied that he stole from some of the clients of the carter 
organization 
the carter organization as mr carters former employer said 
it is committed to cooperating with those clients to remedy any 
damage caused by mr carters criminality the statement read 
the company is also committed to ensuring that this kind of 
conduct can never reoccur 
among those carter worked for as a proxy solictor were t boone 
pickens saul steinberg irwin jacobs and sir james goldsmith 
james w wetzler commissioner of the state taxation and finance 
department called carters plea a symbol of the greed that 
motivated so much of the 80s coming a cropper officials made 
the announcement at a news conference here 
ronald goldstock director of the new york state organized crime 
task force which headed the carter investigation said business 
records seized at carters manhattan office and at a brooklyn 
warehouse showed a systematic pattern of greed and fraud 
he said that between 1984 and 1989 carter routinely billed his 
clients for nonexistent or inflated expenses and when questioned 
about the expenses he supplied fraudulent documentation to justify 
them 
the corporate clients he was said to have defrauded included 
union carbide corp shell oil caesars world inc unum an 
insurance company and macandrews amp forbes group inc which owns 
the revlon cosmetics company 
goldstock said the carter investigation was sparked by an 
unrelated probe which he refused to discuss 
carter had faced up to 11 years in prison but justice george f 
roberts promised him a prison term of 16 months to four years and a 
fine of up to 2 million when he is sentenced may 2 
carter also agreed to establish a 1 million escrow fund to make 
restitution to the victims of the theft said goldstock 
in addition to the grand larceny charge carter admitted 
falsifying his 1986 state income tax return by charging up to 10 
million in personal expenses as business expenses 
goldstock said the personal expenses included hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in renovations to his east end avenue home in 
manhattan 
the state estimates that carter owes more than 1 million in 
taxes penalties and interest for 1985 and 1986 said wetzler 
he added that at a time when the state may have to raise taxes 
for ordinary citizens it is inexcusable that welathy people 
not pay their fair share of the tax burden 
carter founded his company 16 years ago and sold it in 1987 to 
britishowned vpi group plc for 75 million he continued to work 
for the company until tuesday when officials announced he had been 
suspended 
a columbia business school dropout the brash and flamboyant 
carter worked as an analyst for carl icahn before going out on his 
own 
he spearheaded frank sinatras successful drive to gain a 
representative on the board of the del webb casino company in 1977

the heads of the nations two largest banking 
companies citicorp and chase manhattan corp say they expect an 
increase in problem real estate loans this year 
citicorp chairman john reed told securities analysts tuesday 
that the commercial real estate market will be difficult for 
awhile and force the nations largest banking company to write 
off more loans than expected 
he said the writeoffs would be higher than the 53 million in 
commercial real estate writeoffs taken in 1989 but declined to be 
more specific 
factors contributing to the poor market he said are 
deterioration in the economy reduced market liquidity that is 
making it harder for investors to find buyers for buildings they 
had hoped to sell and increased regulatory attention to the 
possibility of problem real estate loans 
nonetheless reed said despite the higher writeoffs citicorps 
commercial real estate business would continue to be profitable in 
1990 
citicorp reported it had 173 billion in outstanding commercial 
real estate loans as of dec 31 1989 
in a separate presentation to another group of securities 
analysts earlier in the day chase manhattan president thomas 
labrecque said he expects to see a steady increase in problem real 
estate loans over the next several months as sluggishness in many 
commercial and residential markets continues 
we had expected a cyclical market downswing for two years 
labrecque said we took steps to limit our growth and tighten our 
underwriting and appraisal standards 
chase placed 783 million in domestic real estate loans on a 
nonaccrual basis at the end of 1989 a 49 percent jump from the 
527 million the previous year 
when loans are placed on nonaccrual status banks no longer 
include on their statements the interest and other charges due on 
the loans until the money is actually received 
as the current sluggish real estate environment persists 
labrecque said the number of these nonperforming loans is 
expected to increase moderately in the first quarter and somewhat 
more over the next quarters 
despite the sharp rise in problem loans labrecque told analysts 
overall credit quality in the banks real estate lending business 
was relatively good and should remain profitable 
chases domestic real estate loan portfolio totaled 9 billion 
at the end of 1989 
citicorp is the nations largest banking company with assets of 
2306 billion at the end of 1989 chase is the second largest with 
assets of 10737 billion on dec 31 1989 
looking at the longerterm finacial outlook for citicorp reed 
told the analysts he expected that by the mid to late1990s 
citicorp would earn 5 billion a year and derive 65 percent of its 
earnings from consumer banking 
in 1989 citicorp earned 498 million or 116 a share when 
its results were depressed by a 1 billion addition to its loan 
loss reserve for potentially bad loans to third world countries in 
1988 it earned 186 billion or 536 a share 
the company now gets about 40 percent of its operating earnings 
from consumer banking 
in a separate announcement citicorp said it has changed the 
names of its 252 citicorp savings branches in california florida 
illinois and the district of columbia to citibank federal savings 
bank 
the savings and loans had recently been given permission to 
change their charters from savings and loans to federal savings 
banks 
william j heron jr group head for us consumer banking at 
citicorp said the change reflects our increasing commitment to a 
unified approach to banking activities throughout the country 
he said recent changes in federal laws removed limitations that 
had restricted citicorp from using the name of its flagship new 
york bank citibank in connection with the institutions it had 
acquired in the 1980s

japanese securities firms are halting equitylinked 
financing of japanese companies at home and abroad until the 
collapsing tokyo stock exchange recovers officials said today 
in an attempt to minimize damage and risks to stock and bond 
holders the firms agreed tuesday to suspend stock and bond 
underwriting for at least one month said nobuo kurakazu director 
of securities at daiwa securities co 
the firsttime maneuver also is designed to stop the flow of 
additional shares and not dilute the markets current value the 
moratorium involves new convertible bonds warrants and common 
stocks 
kurakazu said companies will halt underwriting until the stock 
market starts showing signs of stability in order not to harm 
investors 
japans financial markets were closed today for the vernal 
equinox day a national holiday 
we can no longer continue normal sales activities under the 
current market situation where prices of stocks and bonds have 
kept sinking said hiroshi tanaka chief of the underwriting 
division at yamaichi securities co 
it is best to halt the sales rather than keep selling those 
bonds when nobody is interested he said adding that demands for 
company bonds are especially affected 
the tokyo stock exchanges 225issue nikkei stock average has 
lost almost 21 percent of its value since the beginning of the 
year the index has fallen by 8100 points 
the nikkei which plunged 135320 points or 415 percent on 
monday in its thirdlargest singleday fall tumbled another 45605 
points or 148 percent on tuesday its tuesday close of 3080719 
was the lowest since 3067839 on jan 9 1989 
as a result the exchanges total value lost almost 91 trillion 
yen or 600 billion by midmarch the markets total value which 
was 5909 trillion yen 39 trillion at the end of last year 
fell to 4996 trillion yen 33 trillion by last friday 
kurakazu said the underwriting decision also involved 
uncertainty over tuesdays discount rate increase 
the bank of japan raised its official discount rate a key 
lending rate to commercial banks by one percentage point to 525 
percent effective immediately to stem inflation and restabilize 
the financial markets 
analysts have blamed the delayed rate increase for contributing 
to the plunge of the yen and stock and bond prices causing many 
companies to abandon plans to raise capital 
mitsukoshi yasuda trust and banking co and the bank of 
miyazaki have canceled plans to raise capital by issuing new common 
stock 
also sumitomo metal and jujo paper have decided to postpone 
plans for raising capital by issuing convertible bonds according 
to local news reports company officials were not available for 
comment due to a national holiday 
the price of sumitomo metals convertible bonds plunged 21 yen 
in the last month to 78 yen tuesday from 9900 yen feb 20 japan 
broadcasting corp estimated the number of convertible bonds issued 
last year at 248 trillion issues 
tanaka said the number of companies that postponed or canceled 
plans for issuing new common stocks and bonds has increased since 
the begining of march cancellation came especially from 
subsidiaries overseas he added

commercial banks 
the agreement in principle provides a boost to the bush 
administrations debtreduction policy the socalled brady plan

and mexico last month in which banks agreed to cut that countrys 
485 billion debt by some 7 billion the banks were given three 
options reduce debt capital by 35 percent cut interest rates to a 
fixed 625 percent or offer new loans equivalent to 25 percent of

range of options that include permanent debt and debtservice 
reduction a cash buyback of debt and new loans according to 
venezuelan planning minister miguel rodriguez 
negotiations with a representative committee of 16 creditor 
banks are expected to continue until a final package is approved 
rodriguez said he expects to have an agreement with all 300 
creditor banks finalized by july 
robert murphy chairman of the bank committee and a vice 
president at chase manhattan bank said the agreement would be 
attractive to the international financial community 
however neither he nor rodriguez would predict which options 
would prove most popular with the banks they said that until the 
results are in it would be difficult to calculate how much debt 
reduction venezuela would achieve with the package 
the tentative agreement included the following options for 
creditor banks buying back their debt at a reduced 
notyetdetermined price venezuelan debt is currently selling at 
around 40 percent of face value 
exchanging existing debt for new capitalreduced bonds at a 30 
percent discount or interestreduced bonds yielding 675 percent 
providing new money those choosing this option would get two 
series of bonds yielding the london interbank offered rate which 
stands at around 85 percent plus up to 1 percent 
rodriguez said he was hoping for about 1 billion in new money

the popular nutrisystem diet program has come 
under fire from 19 south florida women who say in separate lawsuits 
that they have suffered gall bladder damage from the rapid 
weightloss plan 
the company defends its program as safe and suggests the gall 
bladder problems are coincidental 
all but two of the women ages 17 to 60 have had gall bladder 
operations since 1988 according to the suits filed against the 
pennsylvania company and several florida franchises in dade circuit 
court on monday 
those plaintiffs who did not undergo surgery are suffering from 
gallstones and may need to be hospitalized attorney robert fiore 
said tuesday the 19 suits have been filed by either fiore or a 
second lawyer herman russomanno 
the suits charge negligence arguing that nutrisystem inc 
based in willow grove pa failed to supervise customers 
the conduct on the part of the defendants is tantamount to the 
unauthorized practice of medicine without a license the suits 
charge 
nutrisystem has weightloss centers in all 50 states canada 
the united kingdom and australia it costs 530 to sign up and the 
system provides some of the food to start the plan at a cost of 46 
to 70 
rapid weight loss is known to be linked to a variety of physical 
ailments according to the documents filed 
in particular rapid weight loss increases the saturation of 
bile with cholesterol directly contributing to the formation of 
symptomatic gallstones and gall bladder disease the suits said 
nutrisystem spokesman james millard said the companys 
attorneys had reviewed one of the suits and found it without merit 
the allegations seem to be coincidental to the state of 
obesity millard said we feel our program is an excellent 
program and we stand by its quality its safety and its 
effectiveness 
he described the nutrisystem program as a comprehensive program 
that includes a nutritionally balanced caloriecontrolled meal 
plan that includes behavior education nutritional instruction 
exercise and weight maintenance 
one of the suits by rita kronstat and her husband selig said 
that mrs kronstat lost 25 of her 193 pounds in several weeks but 
then began suffering abdominal pain 
she was diagnosed as suffering from symptomatic gallstones and 
advised to have her gall bladder removed as soon as possible her 
lawsuit said the surgery was performed dec 7 
before signing up for nutrisystem she never had any gallstone 
or gall bladder problems according to the suit

international trade volume could slow slightly 
this year with inflation and rising interest rates in 
industrialized nations hampering trade expansion the worlds main 
trade forum reported thursday 
experts at the general agreement on tariffs and trade also 
reported that the value of international merchandise trade topped 
3 trillion for the first time in 1989 as the united states 
regained its position from west germany as the worlds top exporter 
gatt experts predicted the volume of goods traded 
internationally would grow by 5 percent to 6 percent in 1990 the 
eighth straight year of expansion 
the value of goods traded on world markets last year rose by 75 
percent from 1988 to 31 trillion the report stated 
the report warned of continuing problems faced by heavily 
indebted countries it also said persistent inflation and rising 
interest rates in industrialized countries threatened to dampen 
business investment an important factor in trade expansion 
in 1989 the united states regained its position as the worlds 
leading exporter after three years in second place behind west 
germany the report said 
us exports were worth some 3644 billion ahead of west 
germanys 3414 billion and japans 2752 billion us imports 
totalled 4920 billion compared to west germanys 2698 billion 
and japans 2108 billion 
the report said the value of us exports rose 95 percent during 
the decade while imports shot up 120 percent this compared with a 
world average increase of 86 percent for both imports and exports 
canada had the most significant growth among the biggest trading 
nations moving from 10th to seventh place in the rankings 
canadian exports and imports in 1989 each totaled about 120 
billion respective increases of 107 percent and 112 percent over 
1979 
in contrast to growth in most other areas of the world east 
europe and the soviet union witnessed stagnation and even decline 
in trade last year according to initial estimates cited by gatt 
it said the combined value of imports and exports rose only 1 
percent in the soviet union hungarys merchandise trade contracted 
by 3 percent and bulgarias by 4 percent 
the value of polands trade rose 7 percent because of a surge in 
imports czechoslovakias imports and exports increased by 4 
percent east germanys by 25 percent and romanias by 05 
percent the report said 
even though growth in the overall volume of world trade was 
expected to slow down in 1990 it would still exceed forecast 
output growth of about 3 percent the report said 
looking ahead it said the level and pattern of world trade 
would be affected as east europe and the soviet union increased 
trade with countries outside the region necessary plant and 
infrastructure investments as part of the process of economic 
reform would call for higher imports of capital equipment and 
business services 
traditionally about 60 percent of soviet and east european 
exports and imports have been traded within the region the report 
said 
bulgaria czechoslovakia and east germany have relied most 
heavily on soviet bloc trading partners while poland hungary the 
soviet union and romania sent close to half their merchandise 
exports to countries outside the region 
citing figures for 1988 the report said west european sales to 
the soviet bloc totalled 429 billion while imports from the 
soviet bloc amounted to 461 billion 
it said us trade with east europe and the soviet union 
remained small in 1988 us exports to the region totalled less 
than 5 billion and purchases from these countries less than 3 
billion 
gatt is a marketoriented trade forum that draws up agreements 
to liberalize world trade its 96 members account for more than 
fourfifths of global commerce

jurors began deliberating today on 
whether joseph hazelwood was a reckless drunk or a prudent tanker 
captain conflicting portrayals by the prosecution and defense in 
a full day of intense summations 
superior court judge karl johnstone turned the 7weekold 
criminal case in the nations worst oil spill over to the jury late 
tuesday 
jurors met briefly behind closed doors to elect a foreman and 
returned today to begin reaching a verdict 
assistant district attorney brent cole accused exxon corp of 
maneuvering behind the scenes to win hazelwoods acquittal defense 
attorney dick madson said the oil company might be more interested 
in transferring its own share of the blame to hazelwood skipper at 
the time of the exxon valdez 
cole responded angrily when madson called hazelwood a scapegoat 
a scapegoat exclaimed cole the state of alaska didnt 
put a glass of vodka in captain hazelwoods hand and force him to 
drink it 
the bearded balding hazelwood listened without expression as 
cole called him a gambler and a risktaker who imbibed before 
boarding his ship cole said hazelwood risked his tanker and the 
lives of his crew 
he gambled that drinking would not affect his judgment said 
cole he was wrong because alcohol never improves judgment 
madson pointed out that 21 witnesses testified hazelwood 
appeared sober when he boarded the ship and said many of them 
vouched for his competent seamanship on the night the tanker ran 
aground on a jagged reef spilling nearly 11 million gallons of 
alaska north slope crude oil 
twentyone witnesses said he was not impaired madson said 
what does that mean that means captain hazelwood wasnt impaired 
by consumption of alcohol there has to be proof of impairment 
cole countered that hazelwoods appearance didnt matter and 
told jurors to remember witnesses saw the skipper drinking in a 
valdez bar before boarding the ship 
the accident occurred a year ago saturday the tankers hull was 
ripped open blackening hundreds of miles of shoreline and killing 
fish birds and other wildlife 
hazelwood 43 a veteran mariner from huntington ny is 
charged with one felony criminal mischief and three misdemeanors 
reckless endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and 
negligent discharge of oil if convicted he could receive 7 years 
in prison and 61000 in fines 
his wife and father recently arrived at the trial and listened 
to final arguments from a back row of the courtroom 
madson said alaska has chosen hazelwood as its scapegoat 
theres a reason were here today he said politics and 
money 
cole claimed exxon pressured witnesses to support the skipper 
it doesnt take a brain surgeon to see exxons interest in 
this matter cole said its seeing captain hazelwood get 
acquitted 
but madson said exxon had a different agenda maybe theyre 
afraid the state might charge them with something he said 
exxon spokesman joe tucker in anchorage said tuesday he was not 
authorized to comment on coles remarks and that exxon officials in 
houston were unavailable

the food and drug administration has 
barred government agencies from buying certain drugs from abbott 
laboratories charging the company failed to correct violations of 
quality standards at a suburban chicago plant 
the fda also said it would not approve any new drug applications 
by the north chicagobased pharmaceutical giant that involve 
certain products made in the plant 
in a letter to abbott dated march 14 but not released until 
tuesday the fda said some of the companys products are 
adulterated because of improper manufacturing practices 
the agencys district director in chicago raymond mlecko said 
fda investigators did not find unsterile products at the plant but 
did see violations of federal manufacturing requirements 
the letter warned that the fda was prepared to take more severe 
measures including seizing products and shutting down 
manufacturing operations if abbott did not quickly correct the 
alleged problems 
donald wright abbotts corporate vice president of quality 
assurance said the fda action resulted from a misunderstanding 
about the extent to which the firm has worked to correct the 
problems 
wright said the problems should be remedied soon and would have 
no material effect on abbott 
a health industry analyst michael harshbarger of chicago corp 
said the fda letter had ominous implications 
this is not a slap on the wrist he said 
an fda report in november cited the abbott plant for failure to 
maintain proper sterilty failure to follow up on quality problems 
and in at least one case making improper changes in records 
designed to show that a drug was made in an approved manner 
the drugs involved are an antibiotic called erythrocin 
lactobionate and a batch of an antiinflammatory steroid sold under 
the brand name amethapred that is given to patients in hospitals 
to treat severe arthritis and lupus a chronic inflammation of the 
tissue around the joints 
mlecko said there was no evidence that the problems pose any 
immediate public health risk

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower wednesday on the chicago board of trade in moderate choppy 
trading that reflected a lack of significant supplyanddemand news 
some of the activity was tied to the noontime expiration of 
contracts for march deliveries of wheat corn oats soybeans and 
soybean products as traders switched their positions to later 
contract months to avoid delivery obligations 
the soybean market showed some strength early in the session 
after the brazilian market newsletter safras e mercados lowered its 
maximum estimate for brazils new soybean crop to 202 million 
metric tons from 206 million citing dry weather and tight farm 
credit policies 
private analysts in the united states also have been lowering 
their forecasts for the brazilian crop 
profittaking erased those gains late in the day 
corn futures closed slightly lower amid fading hopes for 
confirmation of a rumored sale of us corn to the soviet union 
slack export sales weighed on wheat prices 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents lower to cent higher 
with may at 359 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 2 cents lower 
with may at 257 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower 
with may at 148 a bushel soybeans were cent to 2 cents lower 
with may at 602 a bushel

japanese investment houses said wednesday they 
temporarily had stopped underwriting new issues of stocks bonds 
and warrants in an attempt to limit risks to investors until the 
sinking tokyo stock market stabilizes 
the unprecedented move which affects capitalraising efforts by 
japanese companies at home and overseas follows a nearly 21 
percent drop so far this year in the tokyo stock exchanges 
225issue nikkei stock average 
securities companies agreed tuesday to halt underwriting of new 
convertible bonds warrants and common stocks for at least one 
month nobuo kurakazu director of the securities division at daiwa 
securities co told the associated press 
many issues have already fallen below 100 yen 65 us cents 
which is abnormal he said 
hiroshi tanaka chief of the underwriting division at yamaichi 
securities co said we can no longer continue normal sales 
activities under the current market situation where prices of 
stocks and bonds have kept sinking 
it is best to halt the sales rather than keep selling those 
bonds when nobody is interested he said adding that demand for 
company bonds had been affected especially hard 
by stopping the flow of additional shares into the market the 
halt also could help prevent further weakening of prices caused by 
dilution 
japans financial markets were closed wednesday for the spring 
equinox holiday 
on monday the nikkei plunged 135320 points or 415 percent 
its thirdlargest daily fall ever it tumbled another 45605 
points or 148 percent on tuesday to 3080719 the lowest since 
it closed at 3067839 on jan 9 1989 
the total value of securities listed on the tokyo exchange has 
diminished by almost 600 billion this year to 33 trillion by 
last friday 
kurakazu said the decision to halt underwriting followed the 
tokyo markets continuing plunges and uncertainty surrounding 
tuesdays discount rate increase 
the bank of japan raised its official discount rate the key 
lending rate to commercial banks by 1 percentage point to 525 
percent in an effort to stem inflation and restabilize financial 
markets 
analysts said the bank was slow in raising the rate they said 
the delay contributed to the plunge of the yen and stock and bond 
prices prompting many companies to give up plans for raising 
capital 
mitsukoshi yasuda trust and banking co and the bank of 
miyazaki recently have canceled plans to raise capital by issuing 
new common stock 
also sumitomo metal and jujo paper have decided to postpone 
plans for raising capital by issuing convertible bonds local news 
reports said company officials were not available for comment on 
wednesday 
the price of sumitomo metals convertibles plunged 21 yen in the 
last month from 9900 yen on feb 20 to 7800 yen tuesday 
japan broadcasting corp estimated some 248 trillion 
convertible bonds were issued last year 
tanaka said the number of companies that postponed or canceled 
their plans for issuing new common stocks and bonds had increased 
since the beginning of march cancellations were especially heavy 
from overseas subsidiaries he said

a judge today barred federal regulators from 
seizing an ailing illinois thrift institution on the grounds the 
chief regulator had been unconstitutionally appointed 
the decision could derail the governments massive savings and 
loan bailout 
us district judge royce c lamberth ordered the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision not to take over olympic 
federal savings and loan association berwyn ill until a new 
chief regulator is constitutionally installed in office 
royce ruled that both salvatore r martoche director of the 
office and his immediate predecessor m danny wall were 
unconstitutionally appointed 
under the bailout law wall inherited his office automatically 
when the predecessor agency he headed was abolished 
olympic argued this inheritance of office violated the 
constitutional provision that the president shall appoint with the 
advice and consent of the senate all officers of the united 
states 
michael robinson a spokesman for the justice department said 
the government asked the judge to stay his order and would appeal 
the ruling 
regulators had not moved to take over olympic but the thrift 
believed it was in imminent danger of seizure lamberths decision 
could dramatically delay the seizure of some 200 other thrifts 
believed close to failure 
though the ruling applies only to olympic it also calls into 
question the legality of the takeover of 137 thrifts with 97 
billion in assets since last aug 9 when president bush signed 
the bailout law 
the ruling likely would not affect the 265 sampls seized before 
aug 9 when wall was the constitutionally appointed chairman of 
the now defunct federal home loan bank board

the senate today narrowly defeated an attempt 
to toughen controls on urban smog as part of a compromise clean air 
bill it was the third major defeat for environmentalists seeking 
to strengthen the nations main air pollution law 
the vote was 53 to 46 
opponents of the smogcontrol measure including senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine argued the overall bill under 
consideration already is a big improvement over current federal law 
and that stronger provisions could block passage this year 
sen john kerry dmass a key sponsor of the proposal argued 
the amendment was needed to assure clean air in many of the cities 
that today suffer from the worst smog problems 
the amendment would have preserved the federal governments 
authority to impose an air pollution reduction plan if states and 
local officials fail to act it also would eliminate exemptions for 
some industrial polluters and broaden the smogcontrolling curbs to 
include smaller polluters 
the vote was the third major setback for environmentalists in 
the clean air debate 
by a 5246 vote tuesday night the senate defeated a proposal to 
require tougher tailpipeemission controls on automobiles greater 
use of clean fuels by fleet operators and production of 1 million 
cars capable of burning alternative fuels 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
defeated amendment a prescription for deadlock on the clean air 
bill 
do we want 13 more years of speeches or do we want a bill do 
we want to make statements or do we want to make law mitchell 
said 
still unresolved was a proposal to give federal aid to coal 
miners who would lose their jobs as a result of the clean air 
measure a plan described by senate leaders as a deal breaker 
sen robert c byrd dwva is seeking 700 million in aid for 
the miners over four years if they lose their jobs because of 
tougher acid rain controls at coalburning powerplants in the 
midwest 
the white house contends the assistance is too expensive 
sen timothy wirth dcolo said tuesday that byrd appears to 
have a majority of the votes for his proposal however an aide 
to mitchell said it was uncertain whether the amendment would pass 
if it came to a vote 
white house officials and senate leaders were trying to work out 
a compromise with byrd 
byrd for more than a decade has fought additional controls on 
sulfur dioxide from utility plants because such curbs would 
threaten the jobs of thousands of coal miners including many in 
west virginia where highsulfur coal predominates 
the clean air bill would set tough new pollution controls on 
industry and automobiles to reduce urban smog cut toxic chemical 
emissions from industry and require electric utilities to reduce 
sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of the 
decade 
the auto pollution control amendment was sponsored by wirth and 
sen pete wilson rcalif wirth argued his amendment was needed 
because autos are the biggest source of pollution in our cities 
but senators backing the compromise bill insisted that passage 
of the tougher controls would threaten the legislation it will 
bust the deal with the white house said sen max baucus dmont 
the vote on the wirth amendment revealed some of the maneuvering 
on the bill sen steven symms ridaho was among some senators 
who voted for the tougher controls after arguing vigorously against 
the legislation for weeks 
senate sources suggested that symms and other senators hoped to 
cripple the compromise bill by adding an amendment the white house 
would not accept 
environmentalists meanwhile said that while a number of votes 
are expected on other amendments intended to strengthen the clean 
air bill the tougher auto pollution curbs were a top priority 
daniel weiss of the sierra club accused the administration of 
ramming down the throats of the senate a bill that does not go 
far enough to control urban smog 
the vote was a good deal for general motors and a terrible 
deal for the general public said gene karpinski of the us 
public interest research group 
the automakers strongly opposed the tougher pollution controls 
saying they would be required to manufacture alternativefuel cars 
that customers might not want to buy the measure also would 
require automakers to meet new tailpipe standards by the year 2003 
although they say the technology to accomplish that does not exist

somewhere out in the dim future a new stock 
market fad is developing waiting to be discovered and exploited 
you may be sure it will be too because the stock market needs 
stories call it excitement to generate inout trading the kind 
that produces the commissions that support the industry 
like astronomers scanning the heavens the investment 
researchers are seeking a star something to generate as much 
activity as the old takeover and junk bond crazes that seem to have 
burned out 
whatever they find will be seized upon by opportunists new 
moneymaking geniuses will be presented to the investing public 
new faces will grace the magazine covers drama will be pumped into 
a dull market 
sudden wealth will parade again and the new stars will shine 
bright theyll offer ways of doing things thatll make 1980s stars 
look like coal theyll offer new concepts and visions theyll 
scorn the old way 
nothing is certain about the future of course but if history 
means very much the expectation just described has a very good 
chance of becoming the reality it has happened over and over so 
why not again 
so many fads have come and gone they could fill a garbage truck 
fast food conglomerates real estate construction natural 
resources south african mining gold energy recessionproof 
stocks and inflationproof stocks 
there was a time when any company with a hardsounding name 
with a k or an x or a z in it was examined as a hightech 
highflyer possibility there was a time when cashrich companies 
were simply takeover possibilities 
every month or so throughout the past 20 years there has been a 
new mutual fund created to seize upon fads within fads someone 
right now for instance is probably hatching a peace dividend fund 
most of the fads just faded 
the rage over fast food stocks diminished after so it seems 
every hamlet in america was inhabited by a hamburger or fried 
chicken outlet and growth thereafter was based on such things as 
service and profits 
the frantic search for companies with hightech names lost its 
appeal when it was discovered that the names had to be accompanied 
by hightech products or the stocks were worth hardly a dime some 
werent 
but as many people recall a lot of the fads went out with a 
blast 
the rush to conglomerate stocks was one of the strongest of all 
movements and it was supported by an outpouring of scholarly 
research much of which concluded that one and one equaled three 
the word synergy came into popular usage otherwise intelligent 
chief executive officers explained to shareholders that the 
acquisition of another company wouldnt just add new revenues but 
would enhance existing ones 
wall street bought the idea and in turn so did the public and 
conglomerates assumed some of the biggest priceearnings ratios 
ever seen in this century the public fed them money and they 
bought even more companies 
then the public discovered that synergism wasnt always there 
that one and one didnt make three that earnings werent enhanced 
and that in some cases the company had no reason for existence 
except to buy other companies 
a couple of conglomerate bankruptcies then caught their 
attention and sadly and probably not wiser they they returned to 
the old mathematics 
the biggest blast of all of course may be the most recent the 
collapse of the junk bond market and the slowing of the takeover 
frenzy in dollar terms it most certainly is the biggest collapse 
of any of the fads 
based on recent history however this collapse is no reason for 
an end to fads the shortterm mentality the greed the urgency of 
the kill still pervade the market 
nobody can say what the new fad will be but you wont have to 
wait long with the geography economics and politics of the world 
rearranged in the last few years the possibilities are many 
how about russian stocks

copper futures prices surged to new fivemonth highs wednesday 
on new yorks commodity exchange on speculation that union workers 
at a large canadian smelter would reject a management contract 
offer setting the stage for a strike 
on other commodity markets precious metals were mixed 
petroleum futures advanced grains and soybeans were mostly lower 
and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
copper futures settled 105 cents to 46 cents higher in new 
york with the contract for delivery in march at 1326 a pound the 
highest nearmonth copper price since oct 13 
about 700 workers at noranda incs horne copper smelter near 
rouyn quebec began voting on managements final contract offer 
wednesday afternoon the company said results of the voting were 
not expected until thursday 
analysts said the heavy buying in the futures market indicated 
traders expected the canadian workers to reject the proposed pact 
which would succeed a threeyear contract that expired feb 22 
workers at the horne smelter went on strike in november 1986 for 
almost four months in support of their contract demands 
a noranda strike at this time would exacerbate an already tight 
supply situation in the copper market analysts said copper users 
already face the possibility of supply disruptions from a 
10dayold strike at perus largest copper company the southern 
peru copper corp where workers walked out on march 12 
the noranda smelter produces about 180000 tons of copper a year 
if you dont get that production especially in a very tight 
market it would be significant said analyst bette raptopoulos 
of prudentialbache securities inc 
peter cardillo commodity trading adviser with josephthal amp co 
said heightened tensions within the soviet union also supported 
copper futures 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev on wednesday ordered citizens 
in the breakaway lithuanian republic to hand over their weapons to 
soviet authorities 
cardillo said copper typically attracts buying on political 
crises 
the gold and silver futures markets registered little reaction 
to the soviet developments gold extended tuesdays steep decline 
while silver futures edged higher on the commodity exchange 
gold settled 40 cents to 140 lower with april at 39250 a 
troy ounce silver was 1 cent to 12 cents higher with march at 
5055 a troy ounce

with refined products up sharply in light of tuesdays weekly 
american petroleum institute inventory report which showed large 
drawdowns in heating oil and gasoline stocks and only a slight rise 
in crude oil inventories 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 19 
cents higher with may at 1996 a barrel heating oil was 24 cent

cents a gallon

board of trade in moderate choppy trading that reflected a lack of 
significant supplyanddemand news

soybean products as traders switched their positions to later 
contract months to avoid delivery obligations 
wheat futures prices settled 1 cents lower to cent higher 
with may at 359 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 2 cents lower 
with may at 257 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower 
with may at 148 a bushel soybeans were cent to 2 cents lower

the senate turned back a third attempt to 
strengthen the compromise clean air bill on wednesday defeating a 
proposal supporters said would close loopholes in the battle 
against urban smog 
opponents argued the amendement which lost on a 5346 vote 
would burden too many small businesses with expensive pollution 
controls and require unnecessary federal involvement in urban air 
pollution plans 
the vote marked the third unsuccessful attempt by a group of 
senators mainly from urban areas with the dirtiest air to add 
tougher environmental controls to a compromise bill worked out 
between senate leaders and the white house 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine argued on each 
vote that the compromise bill already goes far beyond current 
federal pollution control laws and that compromises are needed to 
win approval in the senate 
but sen john kerry dmass one of the key sponsors of the 
proposal argued the amendment would only retain requirements in 
current pollution laws that are necessary to clean up the air in 
scores of cities so they meet federal health standards 
the provisions were weakened during negotiations on the 
compromise legislation 
kerrys proposal would have preserved the federal governments 
authority to impose air pollution reduction plans if states and 
local officials failed to act it also sought to eliminate waivers 
based on expense for some industrial polluters and broaden the 
smogcontrolling curbs to include smaller polluters 
kerry said a clean air bill without the amendment would 
legalize new loopholes for delay in getting cities to meet air 
quality standards 
but mitchell said this is a small business killer 
amendment senate leaders fought all three environmental 
amendments arguing they threaten the agreement with the white 
house and could jeopardize passage of a clean air bill altogether 
environmentalists said they would now focus on the house where 
a clean air bill is still in committee in their attempt to 
strengthen curbs on smogcausing pollutants 
in defeating the kerry amendment the senate voted to shred 
the environmental safety net of the clean air act said daniel 
weiss of the sierra club 
on tuesday night the senate by 5246 rejected a plan to tighten 
automobile emissions controls and require broader use of 
alternative fuels including production of 1 million cleanfuel 
vehicles by the ed of the decade 
earlier a proposal which would have required a reduction in 
toxic chemical emissions from automobiles fell by 6533 
opponents of kerrys smog amendment said the provisions were not 
needed 
sen max baucus dmont said the environmental protection 
agency has for nearly 20 years had authority to force federal 
smogcontrol plans on states and cities but has never done so 
but supporters argued the threat of federal intervention has 
prompted states and local officials to act 
it was under pressure under fear of the threat of federal 
action that authorities in southern california toughened 
pollution control said sen pete wilson rcalif 
and others said federal oversight may be the only way to deal 
with pollution that affects several states a regional plan to curb 
smog in the chicago area which also affected air quality in 
wisconsin came about only by the epa forcing the threat of a 
federal implementation plan said sen robert kastenrwis 
another provision of the amendment called for emission controls 
to apply to industrial polluters that emit more than 25 tons of 
pollution a year instead of the 100 tons in the compromise 
agreement kerry argued the higher cutoff would allow polluters 
responsible for nearly half of the industrial smogcausing 
pollutants in cities to avoid the tougher controls 
the amendment also would have eliminated a provision in the 
compromise bill to allow states to waive federal air quality 
standards if pollution controls would cost more than 5000 a ton

british conglomerate bat industries plc said 
wednesday it might favor management bids for its us retailers 
including the saks fifth avenue and marshall field chains but not 
at stockholders expense 
te company also posted a 38 percent jump in its 1989 net profit 
boosted by record earnings from the groups tobacco interests and a 
near doubling of earnings at its financial services division 
bat has put its us retail chains on the auction block as part 
of a defensive strategy against a 21 billion hostile bid from 
hoylake investments ltd an investor group led by britishfrench 
financier sir james goldsmith 
bat chairman patrick sheehy said at a news conference that he 
had received a first round of offers for saks fifth avenue which 
operates 46 stores and marshall field amp co with 23 stores and 
that he expects to announce the winning bids by the end of april 
sheehy said he also expects to announce the successful bidders 
for bats other us retailers breuners and iveys in the next 
couple of weeks breuners operates 61 furniture and home 
furnishings stores on the west coast and iveys has 23 department 
stores in north and south carolina and florida 
management of all four chains have proposed buying their 
companies and if all things were equal we would favor a 
management bid sheehy said he cited continuity and concern for 
the retailers communities as the reason 
in a statement issued after the news conference sheehy said 
bat welcomes these management initiatives but its primary 
obligation must be to shareholders 
bat said its net profit for the 12 months ended dec 31 came to 
the equivalent of 207 billion up 38 percent from 15 billion in 
1988 last years profit included a 197 million onetime gain from 
restructurings earnings per share came to 123 compared with 
101 dollars 
annual sales increased 25 percent to 35 billion from 28 
billion 
the company didnt break out full quarterly results it isnt 
required to under british law 
sheehy described the results as excellent in light of the 
distractions forced on us by hoylake 
the performance from financial services and tobacco is 
particularly significant because they are the businesses which will 
dominate the continuing group in the future sheehy said 
under bats restructuring designed to fight off the hoylake bid 
the company is shrinking itself in two areas tobacco and financial 
services in addition to selling the retailers bat will float its 
big paper interests as a new company later this year 
the hoylake bid has been suspended while us state insurance 
regulators review the effect a change of ownership would have on 
bats farmers insurance group inc of los angeles

energy futures prices jumped wednesday boosted 
by the latest industry statistics that showed a decline in oil 
product inventories 
heating oil for april delivery surged 119 cents to 5554 cents 
a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange the may heating oil 
contract advanced 074 cent to 5351 cents while contracts for 
later delivery had smaller increases 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in april gained 063 
cent to finish at 5794 cents a gallon may unleaded gasoline rose 
124 cents to 6245 cents and june added 102 cents to match at 
6245 cents 
crude oil which got support from the product markets posted 
smaller gains despite negative api statistics 
the may contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of crude oil rose 19 cents to 1996 a barrel june rose 15 
cents to 2020 and july advanced 12 cents to 2036 a 42gallon 
barrel 
analysts said the american petroleum institute weekly inventory 
report showed a sharp decline in gasoline and heating oil stocks 
despite the seasonally weak demand period and strong crude oil 
production by opec 
the report from api the oil industry trade association that 
represents major oil refiners showed that total gasoline stocks 
fell 26 million barrels in the week ended march 16 to 241 million 
barrels unleaded gasoline stocks fell 27 million barrels to 1828 
million barrels 
distillate fuel supplies dropped 42 million barrels to 1059 
million while crude oil inventories rose 188000 barrels to 3509 
the general trend in the market was up all day said richard 
redoglio energy analyst with merrill lynch energy futures the 
apis set the tone for the day 
analysts attributed the decline in inventories to refinery 
turnarounds when oil companies selectively slow or shut down 
refineries for annual maintenance before the spring and summer 
travel rush 
demand for crude oil usually slows during this period because 
refiners dont need as much to make gasoline and other products

takeover strategist carl icahns proposal to 
split usx corps energy and steel businesses would weaken the 
companys borrowing power and make it more vulnerable to business 
downturns usx said wednesday 
icahn usxs largest shareholder wants the company to 
incorporate its steel division into an independent publicly traded 
compay to be known as us steel corp and spin off 80 percent of 
it 
usx management opposes the proposal but has agreed to put it to 
a nonbinding vote of shareholders at its may 7 annual meeting in 
findlay ohio 
icahns plan is a simplistic approach to a complicated 
issue the companys directors said in a proxy statement mailed 
to usxs 144000 shareholders wednesday the statement concerns 
issues to be voted on at the annual meeting 
the directors recommended shareholders reject the proposal 
saying it is unnecessary and unwise 
about 65 percent of usxs revenue comes from its energy 
division while about 31 percent comes from steel said usx 
spokesman william keslar 
the company said a spinoff would involve complex tax legal 
and business issues usx chairman charles a corry told wall 
street analysts last week that splitting the company would result 
in tax difficulties 
icahn who has a 1326 percent stake in usx has long been 
unhappy with usx management and believes the companys stock price 
is too low he had argued in favor of selling marathon 
icahn chairman of trans world airlines inc has said he will 
spend 5 million to 10 million on an intensive campaign to 
persuade shareholders to approve the resolution 
usx said in the past decade usx acquired about 10 billion in 
assets mostly energy related disposed of 7 billion of assets 
and businesses and wrote off about 35 billion mostly in steel 
usx said it has emerged as a strong energy company while 
remaining the largest and among the most profitable domestic 
integrated steel companies 
the company said approval of icahns proposal could limit usxs 
flexibility in considering other alternatives that may be in the 
best interest of shareholders

dont tell scottish farmer john keddie 
the last thing saudi arabia needs is sand hes selling a pile of 
it to the desert kingdom 
the saudis have a lot of sand but it is the wrong shape he 
said 
the saudis want tons of keddies sand to use in filtration 
systems for water supplies and in swimming pool filters 
their sand is too round ours is cuboid with the corners 
rubbed off ours is also very hard so it doesnt break down in the 
filters said the farmer 
keddie grows oilseed rape and wheat on 600 acres at alloa near 
the forth river in southeast scotland 
he said he investigated the potential of his local sand two 
years ago and made his first sale for glassmaking when he found he 
could no longer keep going by farming alone

the boston co which revealed last year it had 
overstated profits announced wednesday that george w phillips 
would resign as chairman replaced by one of the companys 
executives 
the action came in the aftermath of a toplevel shakeup at 
boston cos parent firm shearson lehman hutton inc which has 
named a new chairman and chief executive 
boston co said john laird has been proposed as new chairman and 
chief executive officer effective april 20 
laird 47 joined the company last september after working as an 
executive at american express which acquired controlling interest 
in shearson in 1981 
john was very successful while at american express and at all 
times was supportive of american express traditional values 
howard l clark jr shearson lehmans chief executive said in a 
statement 
clark also served as an executive at american express 
the boston co the parent of boston safe deposit amp trust co 
reported in january 1989 that it had overstated profits for the 
first three quarters of 1988 by 30 million 
at the time shearson officials said the overstatement involved 
no misuse of company or client funds 
nonetheless boston cos parent firm apparently saw no need to 
make changes until shearsons new leadership stepped in said 
perrin long who follows the financial industry for lipper 
analytical services in new york 
the former shearson management might have been dragging 
their feet he said 
in the company statement phillips 52 said he looked back at 
his 28 years with the boston co with considerable pride 
however i look forward to new challenges and take great 
comfort in the strong management team which i leave behind at the 
company he said 
william j nutt will continue as president of the boston co and 
chairman and chief executive officer of boston safe deposit amp trust

the chairman of a senate subcommittee that 
oversees the securities and exchange commission said wednesday he 
is willing to add a curb on program trading to pending legislation 
sen christopher dodd dconn also said he favors giving the 
sec authority to regulate stockindex futures 
legislation that would give the sec new powers to halt trading 
in emergencies and keep tabs on the financial health of brokerage 
houses parent companies is awaiting floor action in both the house 
and senate 
but the house version contains a provision allowing the sec to 
restrain program trading the computerized trading of large blocks 
of stocks based on price differences between the securities and 
stockindex futures markets the senate version does not 
dodd said that after talking with sec chairman richard c 
breeden who did not seek but says he can live with the program 
trading amendement if thats the case then we can either add 
something on the floor as a floor amendment or wait until 
conference with the house on a final verison of a bill 
dodd chairman of the senate banking committees subcommittee on 
securities said he doesnt want to dismember the commodity 
futures trading commission which currently oversees stockindex 
futures 
rather he told a news conference in his senate office my 
inclination is to be supportive of taking stockindex futures and 
moving them over under the jurisdiction of the sec 
dodd conceded that such a move would meet opposition by 
congressional supporters of the cftc which is under the control of 
house and senate agriculture committees 
while from a theoretical standpoint it has made some sense to 
me to move in that direction our job now is that the committee 
must examine the practicalities of that dodd said 
stockindex futures are financial products that allow investors 
to speculate on stock indexes such as the standard amp poors 500 
without buying the underlying stocks 
the senate banking committee has scheduled a hearing next week 
on which federal agency should set minimum standards for margins 
the down payments investors must make to purchase securities or 
futures on credit 
the federal reserve now sets margins for the stock markets while 
the futures exchanges themselves set margins in their industry 
critics argue that wide disparities between securities and 
futures margins have caused or least worsened heavy trading in 
stockindex futures some people believe the disparity causes sharp 
price fluctuations in the markets 
witnesses at the march 29 hearing are scheduled to include sec 
chairman richard c breeden and cftc chairman wendy gramm as well 
as fed chairman alan greenspan 
some house members are exploring possible legislation to merge 
both agencies into one super agency dodd called that plan an 
interesting discussion but i certainly havent drawn any conclusion 
that it makes any sense at all

continental airlines has selected wells rich 
greene to handle its 40 million to 50 million advertising account 
the selection announced tuesday followed a review that 
involved five agencies in the wake of continentals decision in 
january to end its threeyear association with another new 
yorkbased ad agency nw ayer 
the other agencies considered for the assignment were j walter 
thompson lintasnew york tbwa advertising inc and hal riney amp 
partners inc 
james v odonnell senior vice president for marketing programs 
at houstonbased continental said wells rich greene won the 
assignment because they seemed to offer us what we were looking 
for 
he said the agency offered creative excellence as well as a 
level of enthusiasm and commitment needed for what normally is a 
demanding and timeconsuming job in addition he said the company 
felt the agency could help it shape its services to better satisfy 
customer demand 
odonnell said the airline is working to increase its share of 
the business travel market and to expand international service 
wells rich greene previously worked for continental airlines in 
1981 and 1982 and also has worked at various times for braniff 
pan am and twa odonnell said 
but he said it was not that work as much as wells richs recent 
work for mci communications corp telephone service hertz rental 
cars and international business machines corp that convinced 
continental to hire the agency 
he said the first advertising work from continentals new agency 
should start showing up in may 
odonnell declined to comment on reports that thompson dropped 
out of the running for the account because it demanded that 
continental pay in advance for media placement

western union co told federal 
regulators wednesday it may have to seek bankruptcy court 
protection if it cannot meet mounting debt interest payments 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission western 
union said if it cannot raise additional funds it probably will 
not be able to make 51 million in interest payments on 530 
million in outstanding notes due june 15 
the notes which carry interest rates of 1925 percent and 16 
percent are due to mature june 15 1991 failure to meet interest 
payments would result in default 
western union also said in the filing that the sec is conducting 
an inquiry into the timing of writedowns against company earnings 
in the first quarter of 1988 western union said it is cooperating 
with the inquiry 
company spokesman warren bechtel said the sec has questioned 
actions leading up to the restructuring charge which he said took 
place under previous management 
bechtel also said that as part of its agreement with us trust 
co of new york the trustee overseeing the 1925 percent notes 
western unions consolidated capital must not fall below a certain 
level 
if that requirement is not met for two consecutive quarters 
western union must repurchase 100 million of worth of its 
outstanding notes he said 
western union told the sec it could fall below the preordained 
level by march 31 the end of the first quarter 
but its just a possiblity down the road bechtel said 
its not something that exists 
bechtel said the company wants to restructure its debt before 
the june 15 deadline on the 51 million in interest payments 48 
million on 500 million in 1925 percent notes and 3 million on 
the 16 percent notes the payments are due twice a year 
western union said in the filing it may offer to exchange the 
notes for new securities with lower interest rates and longer 
repayment schedules 
if it cannot restructure western union may use the options of 
raising money through a public offering of stock or by selling its 
assets quickly the company said in the filing 
without the restructuring the company could default and that 
could force western union to seek protection under the us 
bankruptcy code the company said 
western union took special charges of 603 million in the 1988 
first quarter connected with the planned unloading of the companys 
microwave voiceswitching facilities 
western union has exited the business of providing 
communications facilities to focus on specialized business and 
consumer services but the company has continued to struggle 
reporting 32 million in losses in 1989

shawmut national corp revised its 1989 earnings 
to show a 1289 million loss after federal regulators found the 
banks reserves for losses from real estate loans were inadequate 
according to a published report thursday 
shawmut one of new englands largest banking companies in 
january reported a profit of 2017 million for last year 
more than 170 federal bank examiners spent six weeks studying 
the banks records before the company decided that its reserves to 
protect against bad real estate loans were too small the new york 
times reported 
the move was the latest sign that the government is being more 
critical than usual in judging bank real estate loans examinations 
of real estate lending led to a 11 billion loss at bank of new 
england corp earlier this year 
after the review shawmut which is based in boston and hartford 
and has more than 400 branches nearly doubled the size of its 
reserves for loan losses at the end of 1989 to 739 million from 
383 million the times said 
increases in loan loss reserves are subtracted from earnings or 
from capital in the case of a loss the banks nonperforming loans 
which are not paying interest or face other troubles rose to 
1045 billion from 5356 million 
the bank was surprised by the federal examiners findings the 
newspaper said shawmut had increased its reserves to cover losses 
on real estate loans for commercial projects eliminating almost 
all of its fourthquarter profits 
shawmut said it expects to earn about 40 million or 54 cents a 
share in the first quarter it also warned that nonperforming 
loans would rise along with reserves for loan losses
