government supporters used clubs and 
machetes friday to chase away about 150 sandinista peasants who 
seized a cabinet ministers ranch a union leader said four people 
were reported hurt 
the seizure of the ranch had represented the latest challenge to 
the usbacked government by the leftist sandinista opposition 
the peasants were retaliating for takeovers in recent weeks of 
sandinista cooperative farms 
leopoldo siles blanco regional secretary of the prosandinista 
farm workers association told reporters late friday that about 315 
antisandinista peasants retook the ranch belonging to agriculture 
minister roberto rondon 
rondons ranch near juigalpa 120 miles southeast of managua 
was seized by members of the sandinistacontrolled association on 
wednesday 
siles blanco said four of his people were injured he gave no 
details 
police had no immediate comment 
this action is not going to frighten members of the 
association and in the next few hours they might take over other 
ranches in the area siles blanco said 
in a second takeover thursday night about 60 sandinistas seized 
a private ranch also in the juigalpa area 
the government of president violeta barrios de chamorro also 
faced other threats friday from the sandinista opposition 
in an effort to stave off a general strike the government late 
friday increased salaries for about 65000 government employees 
labor minister francisco rosales announced at a news conference 
a 60 percent increase for employees making 35 to 71 a month and a 
flat 36 for those making more than 71 
rosales said the increases were part of an agreement reached 
with the sandinistas to raise government salaries in august to 
compensate for inflation six people were killed and about 100 
injured in clashes between sandinista supporters and opponents in 
the last sandinistaled strike in july the strikers erected 
barricades paralyzing managua and disrupting the rest of the 
nation 
on thursday the 150000member national workers front 
threatened its third labor action since the united national 
opposition coalition of mrs chamorro took office on april 25 they 
defeated the sandinistas in february elections 
lucio jimenez leader of the national workers front said 
thursday that his federation plans a walkout of all sandinista 
unions because more than 1000 government employees were fired 
despite promises nobody would be laid off 
jimenez said currency devaluations over the last three months 
have cut the purchasing power of the 150000 government workers by 
90 percent despite pay raises 
inflation and low farm production are the two biggest problems 
mrs chamorro inherited from the antius sandinistas who governed 
nicaragua for a decade and battled usbacked contra rebels 
mrs chamorro has been trying to return nicaragua to a free 
market economy but strikes and strike threats have undermined her 
efforts 
her government managed to eliminate government subsidies and 
price controls but this sent prices for staples skyrocketing

well over 1 million japanese perhaps many 
more live with a burden inherited from feudal times that affects 
their entire lives they are called burakumin 
to the outsider japan looks remarkably homogeneous the 
archipelagos 123 million people share language physical 
appearance and customs legally all are equal 
but for the burakumin the invisible minority the homogeneity 
of this society is a tantalizing myth 
they are descended from people who were designated as hereditary 
outcasts in the 17th century and were officially liberated by the 
meiji government in 1871 just eight years after lincolns 
emancipation proclamation freed the slaves in the united states 
more than a century later most burakumin still live in and take 
their name from the buraku hamlets or neighborhoods where the 
outcasts were settled 
they still face discrimination in employment marriage and 
virtually all aspects of their treatment by japanese lucky enough 
to be born elsewhere said sue sumii 88 who has spent 70 years 
fighting discrimination against the burakumin 
a translation of the river with no bridge the first novel 
in the authors sixvolume series was issued by charles e tuttle 
co this spring in japan the united states britain and australia 
it was first published in japanese 31 years ago 
the book opens in 1908 and ms sumii says the sentiments 
revealed in it have hardly changed 
there are about five families living in a buraku at the edge 
of this town and no one lets their kids go play there she said 
in an interview 
those families werent welcome in the neighborhood 
association people living in the buraku were left out of the 
postwar land reform so many are still tenant farmers things 
havent changed much at all 
according to government statistics 117 million burakumin live 
in 4603 buraku areas the buraku liberation league the largest 
advocacy group says there are about 3 million living in 6000 
buraku neighborhoods and many others try to hide their background 
ms sumii grew up in western japan where many buraku live she 
said she learned from childhood friends how it felt to live on the 
wrong side of the bridgeless river dividing burakumin from 
other japanese 
her storys hero is a bright 8yearold named koji who wonders 
why all the people in his village are called eta a nowtaboo 
word that means great filth 
koji wonders why the people are poor although they work hard 
and why other japanese say they stink 
how did we get to be eta he asks we arent eta 
because we want to be we dont even know what it means 
japans worship of its imperial family is at the root of 
discrimination ms sumii said many historians say they dont know 
how some people came to be outcasts but ms sumii believes the 
custom originated in the 7th century when the land came under 
imperial control 
when they distributed the land it went only to lawabiding 
citizens she said bad citizens were people opposed to the 
emperor 
in the 17th century the tokugawa shogunate divided society into 
four castes at the top were the samurai or warriors followed by 
farmers artisans and merchants outside the caste system were two 
groups the eta and the hinin nonhumans 
birth as an outcaste has traditionally evoked little 
sympathy buddhists believed it was a sign of retribution for 
wrongs committed in a past life ms sumii said 
because they were physically identical to other japanese in 
many places the burakumin were forced to wear inferior clothes or 
shoes 
they were forced into communities on marginal land where most 
modern buraku still live buraku areas often were left blank on old 
maps 
burakumin were relegated to jobs linked with death such as 
butchering leather tanning shoemaking gravedigging and 
cremation those activities were considered impure by buddhism 
which condemns the killing of any creature and by japans 
indigenous shinto religion which shuns contact with the dead 
when the meiji government liberated the burakumin in 1871 
it also began a system of family registers that include background 
and birthplaces 
family registers can be used to identify people from the buraku 
and private companies have been found to use illegally published 
lists of buraku communities to discriminate in hiring 
families often hire detectives to investigate the family 
backgrounds of marriage prospects discovery that a person is from 
a buraku can lead to a broken engagement or divorce 
even today the situation has not basically changed 
etsuhiro honbe a buraku resident wrote in the buraku liberation 
news although there are fewer cases of blatant discrimination 
it has changed into something more cunning spread like a trap 
ready to catch you 
in december a court ordered the brother and sisterinlaw of a 
man married to a woman from a buraku to pay the woman 7 million yen 
about 47000 for destroying the marriage after they 
discovered the wifes background 
taboos about burakumin are so ingrained that the subject rarely 
enters polite conversation only in august 1989 did a ose who do not have 
a proven track record in the 
industry

iraqi president saddam hussein seemed 
determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial 
ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring kuwait 
the invasion unprecedented in modern arab history reflected 
the brutality saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since 
coming to power in 1979 
the sentence for criticizing saddam is death and the president 
considered kuwaits oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in 
the price of oil a personal affront to iraq 
iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better 
than cutting means of living oh god almighty be witness that we 
have warned them he said last month after prices tumbled below 
14 per barrel 
he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing iraq 
14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned 
by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
he also accused kuwait of stealing 24 billion by pumping oil 
from a disputed field that straddled their border and demanded 
that kuwait write off an estimated 15 billion it loaned iraq 
during the persian gulf war 
saddam was reported to be incensed that kuwait was demanding 
repayment for the wartime loans saddam said he fought the war to 
protect the arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in persian mainly shiite 
moslem iran 
never mind that iraq started the war in 1980 by invading iran 
after a series of border skirmishes along the shattalarab 
waterway iraqs only outlet to the gulf 
despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory the 
long conflict stalled iraqs development dragging on for eight 
years it has still not formally ended 
the war bills kept the government from delivering material 
benefits promised to the iraqi people directly after the war the 
1990 budget slashed funds for imports and iraqis were told to brace 
for another year of austerity private investment has failed to 
take hold 
iraq ended the war an estimated 70 billion in debt its main 
gulf port of basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure 
damaged tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners of war languish in 
iranian prisons and an estimated 500000 iraqis were killed or 
wounded 
despite its puny size kuwaits oil reserves almost match iraqs 
100 billion barrels 
by controlling kuwait saddam could help solve the financial 
hangover from the persian gulf war and fulfill iraqs longstanding 
wish for more gulf coastline 
iraqs 100000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks 
were believed part of a pressure campaign to make kuwait capitulate 
to iraqs demands 
but kuwaits pledge two weeks ago to obey new opec quotas and 
saddams promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak that he would 
not invade lulled the arab world into the sense the crisis was over 
homage to the cause of arab unity has been paramount in middle 
east politics since postwar independence from colonial powers 
although a civil war in yemen in the 1960s brought egyptian and 
saudi arabian intervention on opposing sides no arab state has 
ever directly deposed the government of a fellow arab league member 
despite iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition 
liberate kuwait it has long coveted the tiny emirate 
the iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in 
1961 and threatened to attack then but backed down when britain 
landed troops in kuwait 
the invasion shook kuwaits neighbors along the gulf it proved 
the decadeold gulf cooperation council that groups saudi arabia 
bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and kuwait was 
toothless the gcc did not issue a statement much less implement 
its mutual defense treaty 
while iraq was unlikely to invade saudi arabia it could use the 
precedent of kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy 
issues bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what 
happened to kuwait when it balked at iraqi demands 
also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs the fall 
of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable 
in a series of bellicose statements in recent months saddam has 
sought to focus domestic attention outside iraq 
in march he threatened to burn half of israel with iraqs 
chemical weapons banned under international law if iraq was 
attacked it was a popular stance among arabs frustrated with the 
lack of progress toward peace and a palestinian nation in the 
arabisraeli conflict 
then britain arrested several people on charges they were 
smuggling nuclear triggers into baghdad weeks later police in 
europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of 
firing chemical or nuclear shells into israel 
saddam cried foul claiming the west was trying to wreck the 
scientific progress of the arabs 
saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late egyptian 
president gamal abdel nassar as the leader of the arab world 
his relentless personality cult has dubbed him the knight of 
the arabs for kuwait on thursday he was a dark knight 
asked the reason for the invasion kuwaits ambassador to 
washington sheik saud nasir alsabah said at a news conference 
ambition hegemony control of the whole area there is not any 
reason for it

it was billed as a march for freedom by 
dozens of computer wizards but perhaps all they were saying was 
give pcs a chance 
the demonstrators led by one of americas renowned computer 
programmers marched through cambridge on thursday to protest 
restrictive use of copyright and patent laws to protect computer 
programs or software 
im not an activist im not one of those people said nick 
papadakis who helps manage the computer science laboratory at the 
massachusetts institute of technology im by trade a programmer 
and thats why im here 
about 200 people marched from the mit campus to the headquarters 
of lotus development corp carrying signs bearing such slogans as 
innovation not litigation 
the demonstrators were led by richard stallman a preeminent 
programmer who was awarded a 240000 genius grant from the 
macarthur foundation last month 
stallman heads a group called the league for programming 
freedom whose mission is to limit the use of copyright and patent 
laws on software to specific programs 
the protesters chose lotus as their target because the company 
recently won a federal lawsuit to protect the copyright on its 
popular 123 spreadsheet program 
lotus argued that competitors were trying to copy the programs 
look and feel the actual keyboard commands and images used in 
the program lotus said if these elements were not protected 
inventive people might be discouraged from developing new software 
for fear that someone else might steal the idea 
a federal judge in boston sided with lotus arguments 
the protesters claimed thursday that these laws arent a form of 
protection but restriction they said lawsuits such as those 
brought by lotus threaten the careers of computer programmers as 
well as the future of americas computer industry 
if the auto industry worked the same way henry ford would 
have been suing everyone who made a car with four wheels said 
kevin mcbride a programmer who came down from new hampshire to 
join the demonstrators 
many of the protesters voiced similar complaints copyright 
lawsuits such as those brought by lotus stifle innovation and force 
other companies to create entirely new systems that must be learned 
from scratch 
if this country wants a computerliterate work force we have 
to make computers easy to use said stan kugell president of 
fairfield computer corp a software firm in newton new ideas 
are built on top of old ideas 
tom lemberg general counsel for lotus suggested the protesters 
should also picket stores that sell books and records since they 
like software represent the expression of an idea 
the underlying question is why do we have copyrights 
lemberg said we have copyrights to protect creators to provide 
incentives to innovate 
but stallman insisted the real goal of lotus is to create 
captive customers 
stallman said his group still hopes a court will limit the 
extent of copyright laws but he said the main purpose of the 
demonstration was to heighten public awareness and ultimately draw 
attention from congress 
this makes me think about the minutemen stallman said 
let this be the shot heard round the world

posters of him mark the entrance to every 
iraqi village radio and television broadcasts call him 
fatherleader even childrens nursery rhymes sing his praises 
iraqi president saddam hussein is the center of a powerful 
personality cult that hails him as a stern father an arab leader 
a warrior the last of those was in the forefront thursday with 
saddams rapid invasion of iraqs small persian gulf neighbor 
kuwait 
the effective ruler of iraq since 1968 saddam established a 
ruthless dictatorship his rule has brought the longest period of 
stability to iraq a coupplagued country created after world war i 
with a diverse population of shiite and sunni moslems christians 
and kurds 
saddam sees his carefully cultivated image as crucial to iraqi 
unity in a 1983 interview with kuwaiti journalists at a low 
point in iraqs bloody eightyear war with iran he said he must 
be a symbol of all iraqis 
iraqi poems incessantly praise saddam pictures of a smiling 
saddam are on posters everywhere and photos of him adorn the front 
page of every newspaper radio and television broadcasts call him 
fatherleader or knight of the arab nation 
an iraqigovernment advertisement in the new york times compared 
saddam to hammurabi the great king of babylon on the euphrates 
river who first codified laws nearly 4000 years ago 
the personality cult is backed up by a pervasive apparatus of 
oppression that included four police forces four intelligence 
services and according to human rights organizations the use of 
torture summary execution and imprisonment without legal process 
with frequent purges saddam took firm control of the army one 
former ruler had called a factory of coups it became a capital 
offense for an officer to be involved in any political activity 
other than functions of the ruling baath party 
after saddam came to power as strongman behind gen ahmed hasan 
albakr in 1968 about 50 high military and civilian officials were 
executed 
in 1982 amid widespread disappointment as iran drove the iraqis 
out of captured iranian territory there were two attempts to 
assassinate saddam another purge followed 
after the iraniraq war saddam brutally subdued rebellious 
kurdish guerrillas using chemical weapons against some kurdish 
settlements he created a depopulated strip along the borders with 
turkey and iran that cut kurdish fighters off from outside supplies 
intelligence reports indicate he has spent billions of dollars 
some estimates say 50 billion on arms chemical weaponry and 
testing of sophisticated artillery capable of lobbing 
nucleartipped artillery shells at enemies hundreds of miles away 
saddam and most of his ruling entourage are sunni moslems 
several from his hometown of tikrit he uses carrotandstick 
tactics to control the shiite moslems who form the majority of 
iraqs 17 million population the iranians are overwhelmingly 
shiite 
he spent lavish amounts of money to restore shiite shrines at 
najaf and karbala but when an iranianbacked shiite organization 
dawa or the call was formed to disrupt his rule he responded 
harshly in 1984 an estimated 600 members of dawa were executed 
in may 1983 he arrested 90 members of the prominent shiite 
family alhakim because one of them was making antiiraqi 
broadcasts from iran when the broadcasts continued he executed 
six members of the family in front of the others 
the war with iraq which iraq started in 1980 became part of 
saddams personality cult though it gained no territory or other 
advantage for iraq and stalled vigorous oilfueled economic 
development for eight years 
in the wars last battles iraqi forces drove iranians out of 
captured iraqi territory leading to the 1988 ceasefire the media 
refers to the struggle as saddams qadissiya a reference to a 
7thcentury victory of arabs over persians 
saddam was born april 28 1937 in tikrit 75 miles north of 
baghdad on the tigris river the son of a poor peasant at 20 he 
joined the thenunderground baath party 
his tough ambition and leadership qualities won him appointment 
to a baath team assigned to assassinate iraqs thenruler 
abdulkarim qassem in 1959 the squad sprayed qassems car with 
machine gun fire but he escaped saddam wounded in the leg also 
escaped 
his fearlessness having his wound operated on in a baghdad 
hideout his flight across desert to syria and then egypt are 
glorified in iraqi books and films 
he worked underground until the baaths seizure of power in 
1968 in 1979 he took full control from albakr 
from that year saddam has been president chairman of the 
council of ministers commanderinchief chairman of the 
revolutionary command council and leader of the iraqi wing of the 
baath party 
even before the kuwait invasion he flexed his muscles 
earlier this year saddam threatened to destroy half of israel 
with internationally outlawed chemical weapons if israel tried to 
attack any iraqi military facilities 
obsessed about security he ordered the march 15 execution of 
iranianborn londonbased journalist farzad bazoft who had tried 
to gather information about a massive explosion at a 
militaryindustrial complex outside baghdad

kuwait became part of the ottoman empire in the 16th century 
during the later years of ottoman rule kuwait became a 
semiautonomous arab monarchy with local administration controlled 
by a sheikh of the sabah family which continues to be the ruling 
dynasty 
in 1899 fearing an extension of turkish control the ruler of 
kuwait made a treaty with the united kingdom accepting british 
protection while surrendering control over external relations the 
sheikhdom remained a selfgoverning british protectorate until it 
gained independence in 1961 
of all the gulf states kuwait has been most vullnerable to 
regional disruption immediately after independence british troops 
were called on to support the country against territorial claims by 
iraq the force remained until 1963 and relations between the 
countries were stable until 1973 when iraq occupied a kuwaiti 
outpost on their common border substantial donations to iraq 
subsequently ensured kuwaits territorial security 
continued financial aid to iraq during its war with iran and 
the protection of the united states for its oil tankers in the 
persian gulf kept kuwait relatively safe during the gulf war

conspiring with the united states and israel to weaken iraqs 
economy and undermine its military buildup

warships and aircraft are holding a shortnotice exercise in

thousands maybe hundreds of thousands 
of motorcyclists are converging on this small unassuming town from 
all points of the compass and theyre finding the welcome mat out 
every year since 1940 the town of 7000 on the edge of western 
south dakotas black hills has played host to motorcyclists out to 
enjoy races tours and general communal good times 
the weeklong 50th black hills motor classic starting monday is 
expected to draw anywhere from 140000 to 400000 to a town that 
on a normal day you can drive through in less than five minutes 
most of the visitors own harleydavidsons 
its an extremely smalltowntype atmosphere when the rallys 
not here said marcy myhre executive director of the black hills 
motor classic board and nineyear sturgis resident 
this year its going to be exceptionally big said randy 
billings of phoenix who is here with his wife karen every 
harley rider i know says hes coming up 
last years rally attracted only an estimated 60000 people at 
least partly because of this years anniversary said ron paull of 
spokane wash he and his wife jean are running a tshirt stand 
for spokanes latus motors harleydavidson for the fourth year 
everyone we talked to said oh my buddy didnt show up 
because hes waiting for next year paull said 
during the rally main street and two other thoroughfares are 
taken over by vendors like the paulls selling every kind of biker 
paraphernalia imaginable from tshirts to knife cases 
by wednesday main street was a study in blue jeans black 
tshirts and leather 
while hells angels from ohio roared down main street the 
paulls talked about how they first came to the rally as part of a 
christian bike group they said that in the five years theyve 
attended theyve met people from france austria australia south 
africa and west germany lots of west germans 
the rallys reputation has hit the mainstream public 
consciousness only recently 
it was mentioned in an episode of the abc series roseanne 
last season roseanne barr and her tv husband were visited by biker 
friends and one was asked if he would go to this years rally 
the response everybody and their dog are going to be there 
in 1986 a crew from the british broadcasting corp filmed a 
documentary on the rally in 1988 actor mickey rourke rode his 
harley in from california 
last year millionaire harley lover malcolm forbes showed up 
with his green and gold motorcycle saying sturgis is a mecca for 
anyone who loves harleys forbes died feb 25 
some rallygoers belong to established groups such as hells 
angels banditos and sons of silence 
a man was shot during one rally but thats beyond the norm 
said police chief jim bush 
it goes pretty well usually said bush a 12year veteran of 
the 10member force whos in his first year as chief weve never 
had a whole lot of great big problems 
however with the predictions of huge crowds a state task force 
has been working with local officials since october to make sure 
theres enough support for law enforcement traffic control 
sanitation and firefighting 
a few businesses have complained that not enough is done to 
protect them during rally time 
despite that i think overall businesses feel good about the 
rally myhre said 
most people i think accept it bush said theres money 
to be made and they like the idea of the community being known 
throughout the world

federal agents in nightvision 
goggles prowled feathery marijuana patches in a federal invasion 
that has brought a panamatrained army unit and claims of civil 
rights violations to the mountains of northern california 
the national guard and bureau of land management took reporters 
on a helicopter tour thursday of the region 180 miles northeast of 
san francisco where government is conducting its largest drug raid 
ever on public lands 
it is also the first time the army has been used for a marijuana 
raid in the continental united states 
the army contingent includes seven helicopters and 58 aviators 
and maintenance personnel from the 7th infantry division the fort 
ordbased unit that saw action in the panama invasion last december 
officials wouldnt say if the pilots were the same who flew 
missions against deposed panamanian leader manuel noriega who 
surrendered to us troops in january and is on trial for drug 
charges in miami 
operation green sweep began sunday and will continue through 
next week in the king mountain range at the edge of the emerald 
triangle so dubbed because much emeraldcolored marijuana is 
grown in the region 
the king range is basically one big garden said craig 
macgill a blm agent in charge of ground operations officials 
offered no estimate at the value of the marijuana grown here but 
say it may be in the billions 
more than 200 troops and agents swept in by ground and air at 
the start of the surprise operation they sealed off a 640acre 
area near the city of garberville and civilian air traffic below 
5000 feet was barred in a surrounding 1200squaremile area 
macgill said 16 raids have turned up 14 gardens containing 682 
plants worth more than 2 million no growers have been arrested 
about 200 protesters blocked the gate to the operations base 
camp thursday and one of the protesters was arrested 
local law enforcement officials privately have said the 
involvement of the military was unnecessary humboldt sheriff dave 
renner has disassociated himself from the operation calling it 
illadvised and counterproductive 
blm director delos jamison the senior official present said 
the raid sends a message to marijuana growers and international 
allies in the drug war that the united states is serious 
some reports have said the bush administration which is 
pressuring bolivia peru and colombia to halt cultivation of coca 
plants in the andes is embarassed by the lush marijuana growth on 
its own public lands 
on thursday visitors were shown a plot containing about 20 
plants in a steep ravine where blm agents in full battle dress and 
camouflage paint stood guard with loaded assault weapons each of 
the plants had a street value of up to 3000 officials said 
maj gen robert thrasher the state national guard commander 
said federal agents and guard troops began hiding overnight 
wednesday around undisturbed gardens and used nightvision goggles 
in hopes of spotting the growers 
jamison discounted residents claims of being held at gunpoint 
by soldiers bearing m16 assault rifles and being buzzed at low 
altitudes by helicopters 
he questioned whether some of the protesters were actually pot 
growers 
i think the locals here that are really protesting maybe 
were pulling up some of their plants i dont know jamison said 
as part of the operation officials have removed trip wires 
intended as boobytraps to protect illegal gardens 
authorities said they plan to restore the forest to its pristine 
state removing the sophisticated drip and gravityflow irrigation 
systems some of them on batteryoperated timers set up by pot 
growers

a federal judge sentenced a former president 
of the indianapolis league of women voters to nine years in prison 
thursday for her role in a drugsmuggling ring allegedly operated 
by her sons 
linda l leary 59 pleaded guilty in february to helping her 
sons operate a 50 million marijuana smuggling ring in the late 
1970s and early 1980s 
us district judge larry j mckinney sentenced leary to nine 
years for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 
marijuana he sentenced her to a concurrent fiveyear term for 
racketeering 
the racketeering charge stemmed from learys control of a trust 
account in the cayman islands used to launder marijuana profits 
mckinney gave leary credit for more than a year of prison time 
already served and ordered her to forfeit about 200000 in assets 
obtained through drug money 
the judge said he would recommend to the federal bureau of 
prisons that leary serve the remainder of her sentence at the 
federal correctional institute in lexington ky where she has 
been since february 
mckinney told leary he had received several letters from people 
who depicted her as a caring woman whod been involved in 
childcare centers innercity school immunization programs and 
similar projects in povertystricken areas 
he said it was incredibly ironic that she simultaneously was 
part of a conspiracy that brought marijuana into those 
neighborhoods 
its hard for me to look at this record and make some 
conclusion as to what in the world is going on in your mind the 
judge said 
defense attorney bernard l pylitt had argued for leniency 
saying leary was a devoted mother and grandmother who closed her 
eyes to right and wrong because she loved her sons 
im here to consider more than just one mother mckinney 
said later im here to represent a lot of mothers and fathers 
and kids 
a tearful leary asked the judge to provide her with a chance to 
try to build a life with value 
under the plea agreement leary could be required to testify 
against her sons paul b heilbrunn 35 and richard s heilbrunn 
38 the heilbrunns are scheduled to go on trial feb 13 
leary is a former president of the league of women voters and of 
the indianapolis chapter of the national council of jewish women 
she and her sons fled to austria in 1985 after learning a 
federal grand jury was looking into allegations the heilbrunns were 
directing a multistate smuggling operation 
in 1987 the grand jury returned indictments against leary her 
sons and more than 30 other people 
leary and her sons were arrested in may 1989 in austria they 
were extradited to the united states last december

its harder work being a snake than scientists 
once believed 
three university of california irvine scientists studying the 
energy cost of locomotion report that it takes as much energy for a 
snake to undulate along the ground as does for an animal with legs 
to walk 
this says bruce jayne a coauthor of a study published today in 
science is contrary to what scientists have long believed 
our findings do not support the widely held notion that the 
energetic cost of terrestrial locomotion by limbless animals is 
less than that of limbed animals he said 
in plain language it is as hard to wiggle along as it is to 
walk along or it takes as much energy to slither as it does to 
stroll 
to find out how hard a snake has to work to get from one place 
to another jayne and his colleagues got a group of black racer 
snakes and figured out a way to put them through an aerobic workout 
first the threefootlong snakes were fitted with little clear 
plastic masks leading from each mask was a hose that would collect 
the exhaled reptilian breath 
then the snakes one by one were put on a treadmill or 
perhaps it was a slithermill 
anyway once placed on the device a snake crawled like crazy to 
keep up with the surface moving under it as it worked the snakes 
exhaled breath was drawn through the hose and into a machine that 
measured the oxygen content 
how much oxygen was depleted from the breath said jayne was a 
measure of the amount of energy the snake needed to slither along 
the scientists then compared the results with similar studies of 
limbed animals such as lizards of the same mass or weight the 
energy used by both the footed and the fanged was about the same 
they discovered 
jayne said the study casts doubt on a longheld notion about the 
evolution of limbless land animals such as snakes and some legless 
lizards 
one explanation for the evolutionary loss of limbs has been 
that it was energetically less expensive he said scientists 
said jayne have suggested that being legless gave some animals an 
advantage because it was thought to require less energy to move 
like a snake than to walk on legs 
now he said that theory no longer seems valid 
jayne said the undulating motion of a snake on a flat surface is 
only one of several ways the reptile can move 
another method is used when a snake crawls through a tunnel 
wider than its body but not wide enough to slither 
for such a place snakes use what is called a concertina motion 
this movement involves bunching up the lower body and then 
extending the head forward then the upper body is bunched up and 
the tail pulled forward 
to test the energy need for this motion jayne and his team 
built a tunnel treadmill and the snakes worked out as before with 
their exhaled breath measured 
concertina locomotion is very expensive in energy use 
said jayne he said it was far and away more expensive than 
virtually all other kinds of locomotion 
jayne said the black racers used in the experiments lived up to 
their names in a short bursts he said the snakes were able to 
slither at more than four miles an hour typically though they 
worked at a speed of half a mile an hour or less for the 
concertina locomotion the typical speed dropped to less than 200 
feet an hour 
the scientists got their test subjects from an animals supply 
house but black racers are common snakes in the southeastern 
united states they eat small rodents birds and lizards and 
typically keep away from humans they are not poisonous but as 
jayne learned they can bite 
sometimes when i would get them out of their cages they would 
nip me he said 
how do you get a snake to start a treadmill workout 
you could just touch their tail or wave your hand and off 
theyd go said the scientist 
jaynes coauthors in the study were albert bennett and michael 
walton science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

the family of a 56yearold texan who was 
one of eight oil field workers rounded up by iraqi soldiers 
invading kuwait waited anxiously thursday for news of him 
we are holding out for whatever information we can get 
david amos son of charles amos said at his home in rural 
northeast texas 
state department officials told members of charles amos family 
that hed been moved by soldiers who invaded kuwait on thursday 
morning members of the gilmer mans family told tyler television 
station kltvtv and the longview newsjournal 
we were set to have a family reunion this weekend and dad was 
going to fly out of kuwait early thursday morning said his 
daughter karen amos but we got the call from the state 
department about 2 pm 
we are not sure if it is better that he was taken by the 
iraqis and is away from the fighting or if it would be better if 
he were free in kuwait david amos said we are just hoping 
beyond hope that he is ok 
the whereabouts of the eight were unknown the state department 
said in a statement 
amos is an employee of santa fe drilling co in california the 
television station said 
larry neal a spokesman for us sen phil gramm rtexas said 
state department sources indicated most of the oil field workers 
were employed by santa fe drilling 
state department officials told the amos family that the other 
oil field workers moved by the iraqi troops included five 
americans two canadians and one briton kltv said 
charles amos has been traveling overseas for more than 20 years 
his son said gilmer is a small city in northeast texas rosewood 
is about 15 miles west of gilmer

iraq has far more troops in and near kuwait 
than are necessary to occupy the country which has us officials 
worried about president saddam husseins intentions toward 
neighboring saudi arabia 
its very dangerous for everybody said rep bob livingston 
rla a member of the house intelligence committee 
members of congress who attended classified briefings late 
thursday said they believed the united states is seeking not only 
to enlist support among allies for a global trade embargo aimed at 
baghdad but also is asking which allies would be prepared to 
commit military force to defend saudi arabia should saddam decide 
to invade 
the 120000 troops massed along iraqs southern border for the 
invasion of kuwait could easily be aimed next at saudi arabia and 
us intelligence has reported the remobilization of iraqi militia 
and security units said lawmakers who attended the briefings 
meanwhile congress welcomed bushs moves thursday to divorce 
the united states economically from iraq and to freeze assets of 
iraq and kuwait the house voted 4160 to write those sanctions 
into law and the senate approved 970 a resolution praising bushs 
move and calling for a global boycott of iraqi oil 
saudi arabia is the source of 15 percent of the us oil supply 
making it the largest single overseas supplier i think it would 
be a direct threat to the security of this country if saudi 
arabia were invaded said senate intelligence committee chairman 
david boren dokla theres great nervousness in the whole 
region 
but while intelligence reports clearly indicated the possibility 
of an invasion the analysis presented to lawmakers said the 
military overkill could be simply an attempt by saddam to 
intimidate saudi arabia into adhering to oilproduction policies 
dictated from baghdad and to deter wouldbe liberators of kuwait 
one intelligence source said while us collection of 
information through satellites and intercepts was good there was 
little direct human intelligence of the sort that could shed 
light on saddams intentions 
he is as inscrutable as the sphinx but far more dangerous 
said rep stephen solarz dny we have to prepare for 
worstcase eventualities the use of force should be a last resort 
but it may be a necessary resort 
sen frank murkowski ralaska an intelligence committee member 
who has met with saddam said of the 53yearold leader there is 
no doubt in my mind that he will go for the brass ring 
boren said us intelligence has produced a vivid portrait of 
saddam an emotional but pragmatic man deeply nationalistic and 
with a powerful drive to be the dominant figure among oilproducing 
arab states he also had a deep desire to punish kuwait which had 
provided aid to iraq during its eightyear war with iran but had 
cut off that aid 
without help from outside saudi arabia and its neighbors could 
offer little resistance to an advance by saddam said rep matthew 
mchugh dny a member of the house intelligence committee the 
forces arrayed against him are not much of a deterrent he said 
president bush sent the aircraft carrier independence steaming 
toward the persian gulf but it was several days away us 
military options for any immediate response to a further invasion 
were limited it would be difficult to get ground forces into the 
region in large enough numbers to counter the potent iraqi force 
said pentagon analysts 
the united states would be forced to rely more on longrange air 
attacks with conventional bombs said sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee 
the resolution passed by the senate expressed support for 
multilateral military action if the economic pressure does not 
force iraq out of its neighbors territory 
lawmakers said they believed the american public would support a 
total cutoff of us economic ties with iraq even if it meant a 
shortterm increase in fuel prices because of fears that a 
ruthless ruler could gain a longterm stranglehold on persian gulf 
oil supplies 
youre talking about something that could totally unravel the 
whole middle east said sen patrick leahy dvt talk about 
the analogy of the fuse being lit its being lit in kuwait 
some democrats welcomed bushs tough embargo but questioned why 
he had not acted sooner they said a policy of appeasement by 
bush and president reagan his predecessor might have emboldened 
saddam to invade kuwait 
the administration finally as a result of the invasion 
has a good policy said rep howard berman dcalif

nearly one in four american infants is born to an 
unmarried mother six times as many as four decades ago federal 
health officials say 
among black infants the rate is more than six in 10 the 
national centers for disease control reported thursday 
infant mortality rates are higher among children born to single 
mothers who often provide less financial security than some 
married parents the cdc said 
twentyfour percent of us infants were born to unmarried women 
in 1987 the latest year for which statistics are available the 
cdc said in 1950 the figure was 4 percent 
the percentage of black infants born to unmarried mothers was 62 
percent compared with 17 percent of white infants both are up 
from 1983 when 59 percent of black births were to single mothers 
compared with 13 percent of white births the cdc said 
these figures are alarming said evelyn lowery president of 
sclc women a branch of the southern christian leadership 
conference the problems are not getting better theyre getting 
worse 
in its weekly report the atlantabased cdc said single 
motherhood is a signal but not a direct cause of possible health 
problems for the child 
marital status confers neither risk nor protection to the 
infant the cdc said rather the principal benefits of 
marriage to infant survival are economic and social support 
our effort at teen pregnancy education has got to continue 
said mrs lowery the wife of sclc president joseph lowery many 
of these young people are from single parent homes 
us infant mortality rates are higher for infants born to 
unmarried mothers than for children of marriage for both whites 
and blacks the cdc said citing new analysis of 1983 statistics 
for whites the infant mortality rate was 131 per 1000 children 
of unmarried mothers compared to 78 for children of married 
mothers for blacks the nonmarriage infant mortality rate was 
196 compared to 146 
but when talking about children of teenage mothers the 
benefits of marriage cited by the cdc may not be there 
mortality rates for infants of married mothers under 18 tend to be 
even worse than for unmarried mothers under 18 probably because of 
a severe lack of economic and social support in struggling teen 
marriages the cdc said 
married teenagers are more likely to establish 
independent households thereby estranging themselves from 
financial and childcare support from relatives the agency said 
in general unmarried mothers often are poor and adverse 
pregnancy outcomes are correlated with poverty conditions the 
cdc said 
the census bureau has reported that 36 percent of black families 
with a child under 18 are classified as living in poverty compared 
with 12 percent of similar white families

with the census bureau engaged in mopup 
counting operations a private research firm says the final totals 
could be a big boost for states like florida while hurting new 
york connecticut and minnesota 
while preliminary population estimates had shown florida gaining 
three seats in the house of representatives the sunshine state 
could add as many as five seats the population reference bureau 
said thursday 
meanwhile new york which had been expected to lose three 
seats could drop four according to the calculations by population 
specialists william p ohare and carl haub 
connecticut and minnesota which had been expected to retain 
their current number of seats could each lose one they added 
the official report on how many seats each state gets will be 
announced on dec 31 when the census bureau reports its official 
results to president bush 
meanwhile however many groups have done preliminary 
calculations based on census estimates of the population 
haub and ohare did that but they went one step further adding 
in figures for us servicemen and women stationed overseas and 
including estimates for potential errors in the census estimates 
the calculations of service personnel are based on pentagon 
estimates of the number of people from each state overseas 
to estimate error in the preliminary population estimates 
ohare and haub looked back at the 1980 census and compared the 
final totals that year with the preliminary estimates the 
difference is known as the error of closure 
they calculated that error for each state in 1980 and then 
applied the same percentage to the 1990 state population estimates 
while counting methods and success vary from census to census 
the new totals do provide an estimate of shifts in house seats if 
the error is the same this time as a decade ago 
the distribution of the 435 house seats is the prime 
constitutional purpose of the census a national count taken in 
years that end in zero 
because the number of seats does not change when one state 
becomes eligible for an added seat another state has to lose one 
the actual distribution is calculated through a complex formula 
known as the method of equal proportions

israel cuba is an ideological ally of sorts for the soviets and is 
confronted by a large and implacably hostile enemy force 
it is perhaps no less difficult for the soviets to turn their 
back on cuba than it is for the united states to abandon israel an 
ideological ally virtually surrounded by an enemy force no less 
hostile than the one cuba faces to the north 
if cuba is a domestic political issue in the united states it 
has the same status in the soviet union one faction in the soviet 
hierarchy sees cuba as a dead weight a 5 billion annual drain on 
soviet resources that can no longer be justified while the ussr 
is undergoing economic decline 
another faction argues that the soviets cannot abandon cuba at a 
time when the island is under us threat such a step it is said 
would be inappropriate in the case of a country that has been 
unbending in its support of the kremlin for decades 
thousands of cuban soldiers have died over the years while 
fighting in support of soviet strategic objectives 
but now doubts have arisen about the durability of sovietcuban 
ties one source of concern for cuba is the stated soviet intention 
of carrying out all international transactions in hard currency as 
of jan 1 1991 
whether an exception will be made for cuba has not been 
disclosed castro is taking no chances warning cubans to prepare 
for the worst if soviet oil supplies are ended virtually all 
construction relating to social services will be cut off as will 
production of clothing for adults and most of havanas bus service 
with hard currency in extremely short supply the government is 
pushing ahead with ambitious plans to increase its dollar holdings 
particularly in tourism but it would take years to offset an 
abrupt cut in soviet assistance and many now wonder how much time 
castro has before his people turn on his system many cubans 
contend that food has never been more scarce than it is now 
if castro is in political trouble at home there was little 
evidence of it last week when 500000 cubans gathered in havana to 
hear castro speak there was not a hint of trouble 
he acknowledged that some deliveries from the soviet union have 
been slowed but was careful not to blame gorbachev indeed he has 
been generous lately in his comments on gorbachev who is perhaps 
the only international figure who can boast being friendly with 
both fidel castro and george bush

the dispute over compensating vietnam veterans 
for a host of cancers and other ailments believed to be linked to 
agent orange exposure is back in federal court 
in a lawsuit filed here thursday two veterans groups asked that 
federal scientists be forced to complete a study on the health 
effects of agent orange on vietnam veterans and their children 
the suit said the reagan administration ordered the study 
canceled in 1987 four years after it began because of concerns 
that civilian claims against government and industry would follow a 
decision to compensate veterans 
the suit was filed in us district court by the american 
legion vietnam veterans of america five individual veterans and 
four surviving spouses 
it said that without the study mandated by congress in 1979 it 
is impossible to persuade the veterans affairs department to award 
disability and death payments to thousands of veterans who were 
exposed to the dioxincontaminated defoliant 
the herbicide used to destroy ground cover and crops has been 
blamed by veterans groups for 19 cancers and a variety of other 
health problems including birth defects 
the va this year decided to award compensation for two rare 
cancers softtissue sarcoma and nonhodgkins lymphoma 
the softtissue sarcoma decision was based on the 
recommendations of an advisory panel acting under a court order to 
reconsider the scientific evidence the lymphoma decision was based 
on a centers for disease control study of vietnam veterans that 
only indirectly looked at agent orange exposure 
veterans secretary edward j derwinski said the lawsuit will set 
back his effort to resolve the agent orange dispute he began that 
effort shortly after he took office by deciding not to appeal a may 
1989 federal court ruling that va standards on agent orange 
disability claims were too strict 
the ruling in san francisco came as a result of a lawsuit filed 
by the vietnam veterans of america 
now these organizations have acted to return to the courtroom 
with litigation aimed at forcing the scientific conclusions they 
want derwinski said their suit impugns the integrity of 
respected scientists at the us centers for disease control whose 
work thus far has added much to what we know about the health of 
vietnam veterans 
the cdc in canceling the study said there was no 
scientifically valid way to document who was exposed the american 
legion and independent scientists say records of troop movements 
can be matched with spraying records to find the likely exposed 
veterans

afghan refugees are increasingly 
blaming moslem guerrillas they once hailed as heroes for the 
12yearold civil war that keeps them from going home 
there is no peace because these people are not united said 
a refugee named feramoz referring to the seven guerrilla groups 
that received support from the united states saudi arabia and 
other sympathetic arab states 
while the superpowers seek a compromise in the afghan war 
resentment is growing among refugees over the lethal infighting 
among the guerrilla groups and the opulent lifestyles of their 
leaders in peshawar near the afghan border 
a twoday summit between us secretary of state james a baker 
iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze whose 
government continues to back afghan president najibullah after the 
soviet pullout in february last year ended thursday with little 
indication of progress on afghanistan 
that lowered expectations of a quick settlement that could allow 
the repatriation of an estimated 38 million afghans who live in 
driedmud huts and weatherworn tents in refugee camps across 
pakistans rugged northwest frontier province 
were forced to live like this what can we do asked 
feramoz who uses only one name 
guerrilla leaders are rumored to have made fortunes during the 
long war siphoning off weapons money and supplies earmarked for 
the war effort and using the proceeds to build colonialstyle homes 
and buy fourwheel drive vehicles 
the united nations last week launched a cashandfood program 
for refugees who agree to return to afghanistan but few have 
accepted 
refugees say islamic clerics have been issuing threats from 
mosques and condemning those who return to afghanistan as infidels 
there have also been reports of guerrilla leaders forcing returning 
refugees back to the camps 
those who wanted to go back are being stopped at the border by 
mujahedeen islamic holy warriors said sadar gul an islamic 
cleric who preaches in the nasir baugh camp dominated by gulbuddin 
hekmatyars hezbeislami or party of islam 
the mujahedeen leaders once lionized are now seen by many as 
bickering warlords who have lost the faith of their backers and the 
support of most of the refugees 
we have been cheated of our victory said aga shah a young 
afghan who longed for the days when soviet soldiers were fighting 
alongside kabuls communiststyle government because the presence 
of a foreign force brought unity to the armed opposition 
when the russians were there we were happy because all moslems 
were united he said now they are all fighting for power 
moscow withdrew its combat troops in february 1989 after nine 
years of direct military involvement 
now its just afghans killing afghans said hamed gailani 
whose father heads a proroyalist national islamic front of 
afghanistan guerrilla group 
the guerrillas governmentinexile once seen as a replacement 
to president najibullah has tested washingtons patience some 
say to the breaking point 
a us senate intelligence committee has voted to slash 100 
million from its military allotment to the guerrilla fighters who 
last year reportedly received 300 million 
washington has agreed that najibullah the sovietinstalled 
leader can remain president providing he cedes power over his 
military secret police and state media 
gailani said the only solution to peace is the return of 
afghanistans former monarch zahir shah who was overthrown by his 
cousin mohammad daoud in 1973 zahir shah has been living in exile 
in rome 
but islamic radicals within the rebel leadership condemn the 
former king saying he opened afghanistans door to communism and 
then remained silent throughout the war

foreign competitors are moving in quickly to 
sell to iraq grain and other commodities following president bushs 
order banning trade with the oilrich middle east country an 
agriculture department analyst says 
john b parker of the departments economic research service 
said bushs embargo order thursday probably was not a complete 
surprise to iraqi traders 
they had already been shifting heavily to competitors of the 
united states in anticipation of something like this parker 
said in a telephone interview they bought a lot of rice from 
thailand and vietnam a lot of wheat from australia and canada and 
had started probing argentina and the european community 
parker said this shifting of iraq to other agricultural 
suppliers occurred over the last three or four months 
iraq he said bought about 808 million worth of us 
agricultural commodities in 1988 but sales dropped last year to 
749 million usda projections showed exports were expected to drop 
to around 700 million this year 
meanwhile the department announced late thursday it has 
suspended all programs involving business with iraq including 
credit arrangements and export subsidy benefits 
re anderson jr administrator of usdas foreign agricultural 
service said the suspension of programs used by iraq will be in 
effect until further notice 
additionally he said the department will not approve 
applications and issue credit guarantees for any sale of 
agricultural commodities for iraq that were not exported before 
thursday 
the bush trade embargo raised memories among farm groups of the 
one imposed by president carter in 1980 to punish the soviet union 
for its invasion of afghanistan 
but that embargo was directed mostly at sales of agricultural 
products to the soviets the trade ban imposed by bush applies 
across the board except for humanitarian aid 
paul drazek of the american farm bureau federation said his 
organization probably will not oppose the iraqi trade ban since 
agriculture was not singled out

a bug hunter from the soviet union is winding 
up a fiveweek us tour in search of insects that destroy ragweed 
the notorious plant that triggers hay fever in millions of people 
the agriculture department says entomologist oleg kovalev of the 
zoological institute of the soviet unions academy of sciences has 
found a few likely candidates to unleash on ragweed back home 
kovalev has visited 10 states in his search and will conclude 
aug 7 at the usdas main research center in beltsville md 
the departments agricultural research service said thursday 
that kovalevs search for antiragweed bugs has taken him to 
arizona california florida georgia kansas maryland missouri 
nebraska pennsylvania and virginia 
r dean plowman head of the research agency said kovalevs 
tour is part of a reciprocal cooperative agreement with moscow 
american and soviet scientists can now expand joint studies 
and explorations of natural pest controls plowman said this 
will give both countries a wider choice of workable alternatives to 
chemical controls for plant diseases weeds and insects 
ragweed entered the soviet union in the early part of this 
century and gained a larger foothold in world war ii when so much 
of the land was churned up by battles 
kovalev and usda entomologist stephen d hight collected a 
number of insects that attack ragweeds including a chrysomelid 
beetle a relative of the destructive colorado potato beetle 
further testing will be required to ensure the chrysomelid 
doesnt attack crops

consumer and business groups want to know why 
american telephone amp telegraph co apparently pocketed as much as 
200 million of a governmentordered 500 million price reduction 
last month but a regulator says the utility acted properly 
the groups on thursday petitioned the federal communications 
commission to consider rule changes that would require atampt to 
reveal how it figured that in response to an fcc order it had to 
cut prices only about 300 million rather than about 500 million 
fcc chairman alfred sikes told a house subcommittee that atampt 
has fully flowed through its share of access price decreases to 
its price caps 
he said atampt had dropped prices so much voluntarily before july 
1 that it needed only to reduce prices an additional 300 million 
an atampt corporate vice president tom norris labeled any 
allegations of impropriety as preposterous and said the company 
would fight any move to force it to disclose more information about 
its rate filings 
the petition was filed on the same day that democratic members 
of the house telecommunications subcommittee urged the fcc not to 
make a multibilliondollar mistake by too aggressively 
deregulating the longdistance marketplace 
at the subcommittee hearing sikes was asked to defend 
commission proposals to loosen further federal oversight of atampt 
and impose a new pricebased regulatory system on the interstate 
longdistance earnings of the nations local telephone companies 
lawmakers said they feared the fcc had not sufficiently studied 
recent changes in the longdistance business and the impact that a 
major deregulatory change on atampt last year has had on the 
marketplace 
sikes declined to delay action on the proposed regulatory 
changes both of which could happen before 1991 but he said he 
would make a report to congress on the current state of the 
marketplace 
the petition to the fcc dealt with the commissions order that 
local phone companies on july 1 of this year reduce by 11 billion 
the charges they levied on longdistance carriers to connect with 
local telephone networks 
under the rateofreturn regulation that the fcc abandoned in 
1989 atampt was required to pass on most if not all of its share 
of these savings to customers such actions have been the primary 
reason longdistance prices have declined more than 40 percent 
since 1984 
the price cap regulatory scheme that the fcc adopted in july 
1989 restricts atampts prices instead of its earnings to give it an 
incentive to hold down costs and prices 
atampt doesnt necessarily have to pass through all of the 
access charge reductions to customers in fact atampt boosted 
some small business prices on july 27 
atampts share of the 11 billion access charge reduction was 
about 520 million according to the july 30 issue of business week 
magazine but the companys july 1 prices cuts were just 300 
million 
the petition by the consumer federation of america the 
international communications association and the national 
association of state utility consumer advocates asked the fcc to 
look into the apparent discrepancy of at least 140 million and 
perhaps as much as 200 million 
the groups noting that the fcc had estimated consumers would 
save 900 million over four years under price caps said atampt 
should be required to file data supporting the rate cuts to 
ensure that ratepayers are realizing all of the savings the 
commission promised

union pilots who struck eastern airlines are 
entitled to replace trainees hired to help the carrier rebuild a 
federal judge said 
thursdays ruling by us district judge edward davis apparently 
affects only those who were in training when time the pilots ended 
their walkout said ej breen spokesman for the air line pilots 
association 
still breen said its clearly a major victory 
all but 200 of the 3600 union pilots walked off the job in 
sympathy with machinists who struck the miamibased airline in 
march 1989 pilots ended their sympathy walkout in november but 
fewer than 50 have been called back to eastern pilots association 
officials say the machinists are still striking 
at least 404 pilots were in training when the pilots returned to 
work the pilots association says the airline estimates only 180 
jobs are affected by the ruling eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
said further hearings likely will be determine the exact number of 
affected jobs breen said 
eastern said in a statement it would appeal the decision the 
airline predicted the ruling wouldnt immediately affect current 
employees or operations 
many pilots took jobs with other airlines after the strike began 
march 4 1989 but about 1400 former eastern pilots may still be 
interested in returning pilots association spokesman lou baldwin 
said 
davis ruling stems from the associations challenge of 
easterns claim that the formerly striking pilots were not needed 
davis agreed that the federal railway labor act guarantees 
returning strikers job rights ahead of newly hired trainees 
davis said eastern violated the railway labor act by hiring 
pilot trainees not already qualified to fly regular flights the 
act was devised to provide uninterrupted transportation 
service the ruling said 
eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike 
began it presently operates about 800 flights down from its 
prestrike service of 1040 
ms ceremsak said she does not believe davis ruling must 
receive bankruptcy court approval 
if the ruling is upheld on appeal all returning pilots would 
need to go through several weeks of recertification training under 
the federal aviation administration eastern officials said 
eastern currently has about 1900 pilots including those 
trained before the strike was settled pilots hired from other 
airlines and union pilots who later crossed picket lines 
baldwin said the eastern pilots trainees annual pay is about 
27000 the average prestrike pay at eastern for fully accredited 
pilots was about 65000 he said

shelling was reported at kuwaits main military 
barracks friday a day after iraqi troops overran the oilrich 
persian gulf sheikdom and caused a storm of criticism worldwide 
iraqi soldiers also were reported surging through the southern 
oilfields near the saudi arabian border 
iraq which said it set up a provisional kuwaiti government 
warned foreign governments it would turn the rich sultanate into a 
graveyard if they came to kuwaits aid 
a us aircraft carrier was steaming toward the gulf to join a 
flotilla of other us warships 
residents speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity said 
they heard shelling throughout the night in the northern area of 
shuwaikh where the barracks are located the report indicated that 
resistance was stiffer than the first day of the invasion 
residents in the capital woke up to what one described as as 
very active gunshots and louder explosions than at any time since 
iraqi president saddam hussein launched the invasion early thursday 
artillery shelling also occurred on the gulf coast 16 miles 
from shuwaikh with two military vehicles on fire the residents 
said it was not immediately clear what was going on in that area 
there was no word on casualties in the latest fighting 
diplomats said at least 200 kuwaitis were killed or wounded the day 
before 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah fled to 
neighboring saudi arabia his government pledged in a radio 
broadcast early friday to win back the country but with the huge 
imbalance of armed forces that seemed impossible iraq has 1 
million soldiers kuwait has 20300 
iraqis occupied all government buildings in kuwait city and 
strengthened their hold on the capital friday as they moved south 
to the oil installations at mina alahmadi officials said iraqi 
soldiers swept through the oilfields early friday according to 
residents and lloyds insurance service in london 
saudi arabia issued a statement through the official saudi press 
agency saying it was following the situation with extreme concern 
iraq said its troops entered at the request of revolutionaries 
it said had staged a coup kuwaiti and other diplomats called the 
coup report a charade 
the move by iraqi president saddam hussein brought worldwide 
condemnation and sanctions 
the soviet union iraqs biggest arms supplier said it was 
suspending weapons shipments to iraq president bush called the 
invasion naked aggression he froze control of iraqi assets in 
the united states and blocked most iraqi imports including its 
most important revenue source oil fellow arab states though 
failed to take action 
iraq responded by freezing repayment of iraqi debts to the 
united states the official iraqi news agency reported the total 
size of the debt is unclear last year washington provided 1 
billion in agricultural credits to iraq 
iraqi soldiers rounded up and moved a few american oil field 
workers from their work places near the border of kuwait and their 
whereabouts are unknown a state department official said in 
washington the official like many other sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the pentagon earlier thursday ordered an aircraft carrier into 
the region bush said military intervention was not under 
discussion but later noted that if americans in kuwait are 
threatened or harmed i have certain responsibilities 
about 3000 americans are in kuwait a white house spokesman 
said no reports surfaced of american casualties 
kuwait through its us ambassador appealed for us military 
intervention

figh near the soviet embassy was short and fierce a column 
of iraqi tanks surrounded the palace of crown prince prime minister 
saad alabdullah alsabah and shelled it for about half an hour

firing from the palace they drew up in a march formation and a 
column of tanks moved along the bank toward salmiya where several 
yacht clubs are situated 
sheik fahd alahmed alsabah a brother of the emir was killed 
trying to defend the royal palace in dasman diplomats in the 
persian gulf confirmed

invaders purify our beloved country from their treachery and send 
them fleeing back crown prince saad said in a later broadcast 
from an undisclosed site 
in other developments 
the un security council voted 140 to condemn the invasion 
and demanded immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops the vote carries 
no enforcement powers 
the state department said secretary of state james a baker iii 
would fly to moscow on friday to issue a rare joint statement about 
the crisis with his soviet counterpart eduard a shevardnadze 
the invasion created turmoil in world financial markets with 
the price of oil gold and the dollar rising steeply 
in baghdad the revolutionary command council led by saddam 
issued a statement saying iraq intervened in support of the 
provisional government of free kuwait it said the government was 
made up of revolutionary youths

try to challenge us and will make iraq and kuwait a graveyard for 
those who launch any aggression a statement on official baghdad

thousands of residents attempted to flee in their cars iraqi 
troops set up roadblocks and shot at cars that did not stop

president bush envisions needing 500000 fewer 
troops by 1995 in a restructured fastresponse us military but 
he wants to move full speed ahead on major weapons programs 
including the b2 stealth bomber and trident submarine 
bush in a major speech on defense policy in aspen colo on 
thursday said iraqs brutal aggression against kuwait 
demonstrates that the world remains a dangerous place 
even in a world where democracy and freedom have made great 
gains threats remain bush told an aspen institute symposium 
terrorism hostage taking renegade regimes and unpredictable 
rulers all require a strong and engaged america 
on a trip cut short by the iraqi invasion the president 
announced his support for a 25 percent reduction in americas 21 
million active duty military personnel over the next five years 
that would be the lowest level since 1950 
bush said the threat of a sudden soviet invasion of western 
europe was more remote than ever in the postwar period and 
the cold war is now drawing to a close 
with the emergence of democracy in eastern europe the warsaw 
pact has lost its military meaning he said 
an administration official said 200000 of the 1 million 
civilian jobs in the defense department would be cut by the 
mid1990s in addition to the 500000 uniformed positions 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
predicted that military bases at home and overseas will be 
reduced and restructured dramatically as part of the troop 
reduction 
the possibility of a 25 percent military cut has been raised 
previously by defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff some members of congress 
favor even deeper retrenchment 
what we need are not merely reductions but restructuring 
said bush outlining his vision of a military that would continue 
strategic modernization this would include building all 75 
radarevading b2 bombers and 18 trident missile submarines in his 
defense plan pressing ahead with the mobile midgetman missile and 
putting the silobased mx missile on rails 
bush said a restructured military must be tailored to respond 
rapidly to crises anywhere in the world 
a new emphasis on flexibility and versatility must guide our 
efforts he said these threats can as weve seen just in the 
last 24 hours arise suddenly unpredictably and from unexpected 
quarters 
the events of the past day underscore also the vital need for 
a defense structure which not only preserves our security but 
provides the resources for supporting the legitimate selfdefense 
needs of our friends and allies the president said 
the house armed services committee voted tuesday to trim the 21 
million active duty personnel by 129500 by the fall of 1991 more 
than triple bushs proposal for a cut of 40000 
the committee proposing to slash bushs 307 billion military 
budget proposal by 24 billion also recommended ending the b2 
bomber program at the 15 planes already authorized making deep 
cuts in the star wars antimissile program and halting plans for the 
mobile nuclear missiles 
working on its 289 billion version of the 1991 defense bill 
thursday the senate rejected a proposal to end the b2 program at 
15 planes but imposed restrictions on it until critical tests on 
the plane have been conducted 
cheney has said a 25 percent troop reduction could save 86 
billion over five years as the pentagon retired six army divisions 
111 navy ships and 11 air force tactical fighter wings and removed 
442000 personnel from active duty 
cheney may announce new proposed military base closings as early 
as next week 
before his aspen speech bush conferred with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher also attending the aspen institute 
symposium her defense minister tom king last week announced 
plans to reduce the size of the british army by 25 percent over 
five to seven years

peace corps volunteers will return to the 
philippines when their safety can be assured the corps director 
said after the release of a worker detained for 50 days by filipino 
communist guerrillas 
timothy swanson a 26yearold volunteer from cheyenne wyo 
was released thursday by new peoples army insurgents and he 
appeared to be physically unharmed corps director paul coverdell 
said 
the programs suspension june 27 was not intended to be 
permanent and i think there are valid reasons for us to begin 
discussions to find a way volunteers can return to that country in 
safety coverdell said 
however he said until we can verify that safety they cannot 
return he did not list specific conditions 
us officials suspended the philippines program after learning 
that the new peoples army had targeted volunteers for attack 
manila headquarters did not learn swanson had been abducted from 
his home in negros province on june 13 until it summoned 
participants to return to america two weeks later 
the reason for the kidnapping remains unknown coverdell said 
the peace corps began philippine operations 30 years ago until 
it abducted swanson the new peoples army left all foreign 
volunteers alone coverdell said 
their release of swanson and of fumio mizuno a detained member 
of a japanese service organization may suggest that they have 
reverted to the earlier handsoff policy he said but it is too 
early to know as yet

airports as a way of financing new gates runways and other 
construction designed to cut increasing congestion and delays 
fees would be limited to 3 per passenger at each airport with 
a ceiling of 12 per passenger for one roundtrip 
this bill will bring our air transport system into the 21st 
century said rep lawrence coughlin rpa as the house voted 
252171 thursday to defeat an effort to drop the user fees from the 
legislation 
the house then approved the bill 40515 
the measure would authorize 17 billion over two years for 
airport operations and development it calls for spending more than 
6 billion in the aviation trust fund over the next five years to 
upgrade airports 
the senate has taken no action on the plan 
house members clashed over the provision authorizing local 
airports to impose fees on passengers whether to impose such fees 
would be a decision made by local officials subject to regulation 
by the federal department of transportation 
improvements are needed to ease crowding and delays caused by an 
increase in airline passengers from 266 million in 1978 to 480 
million last year authorities are forecasting an increase to 750 
million within 10 years 
rep dan rostenkowski dill and other chicagoans said that a 
third major airport to service the city could not be built without 
the passenger charge the new airport is estimated to cost 49 
billion 
but critics said the fees would benefit only a few cities with 
major construction projects on the drawing board especially 
chicago and that most travelers would reap no benefits from the 
airport improvements 
aviation passengers are being taken for a ride by the white 
house and congress said rep norman mineta dcalif 
a study by airport associations has suggested that 10 billion a 
year would be needed for the next five years to overcome congestion 
at many of the nations major airports the transportation 
department has generally accepted the estimate 
rep william f clinger jr rpa said the critics had 
provided no alternative way to meet the costs 
they can hope the tooth fairy will under cover of night 
extend the runway or build the new terminal clinger said

two quirky series with cult 
followings were among television series showered with emmy award 
nominations 
but once again heavyweight housewife roseanne barr failed to 
impress the academy of television arts amp sciences 
abcs offbeat twin peaks the critically acclaimed but 
poorly rated saga of sex murder and cherry pie in a fictional 
pacific northwest logging town snared an industryleading 14 emmy 
nominations thursday 
the simpsons fox broadcasting cos cartoon chronicle of a 
grumbling american family collected five nominations three for 
primetime series and two for a christmas special 
twin peaks was nominated as outstanding drama series the 
shows executive producers david lynch and mark frost shared a 
nomination for best writing lynch the auteur filmmaker also was 
nominated for best drama directing 
were just delighted to be in the position we have suddenly 
found ourselves in said frost frankly the whole thing has 
sort of been out of left field and this is the icing on the cake 
the emmy nominations also could bring added respectability to 
the simpsons featuring wisecracking 10yearold bart simpson 
who vaulted to national prominence with a rebellious attitude and 
resurrected american slang phrases like dont have a cow man 
the show has been criticized for its often cynical portrayal of the 
american family 
simpsons executive producer james l brooks said he was in 
a sleepy sweaty puddle when awakened with news of the academy of 
television arts amp sciences nominations announced during a predawn 
ceremony by actor louis gosset jr and china beach star dana 
delany 
abcs toprated roseanne received two selections one for 
costar john goodman as best supporting actor but barr was snubbed 
by academy voters who also ignored the controversial comic in last 
years nominations 
it always takes the industry a few years to catch up with 
anything groundbreaking said barrs husband tom arnold 
barr wouldnt comment earlier this week she told talk show host 
sally jessy raphael that last years snub really my hurt 
feelings but she expected the same this year 
abcs highly rated americas funniest home videos also was 
ignored by the academy proving that top nielsen figures dont 
automatically translate into emmy nominations 
nbcs legal eagles on la law received 13 nominations the 
networks longrunning comedy cheers and cbss hit murphy 
brown both amassed 12 nominations each 
the simpsons was nominated in the category of outstanding 
animated program for programming one hour or less where 
competition included garfield and charlie brown specials 
abc won 95 nominations overall tying it for first with nbc abc 
finished last in the 1989 nominations a position held this year by 
cbs with 73 selections 
upstart fox earned 26 more than double its 12 nominations last 
year another notable fox nominee was in living color a 
highly praised sketch comedy show featuring mostly black performers 
kyle maclachlan the cherry pieloving fbi agent on twin 
peaks was nominated for best actor in a drama series piper 
laurie earned a lead drama actress nomination 
other nominees for best drama series were abcs china beach 
and thirtysomething and nbcs la law and quantum 
leap 
six programs honored thursday wont be on television next 
season foxs the tracey ullman show which earned 13 
nominations cbs newhart beauty and the beast the 
famous teddy z the equalizer and mancuso fbi 
one nomination went to the late muppets creator jim henson who 
was named for directing a variety or music program 
other nominees for best dramatic actor were peter falk of abcs 
columbo edward woodward from cbs the equalizer robert 
loggia in nbcs mancuso fbi and scott bakula of quantum 
leap 
dramatic actress choices included last years winner dana 
delany of china beach jill eikenberry from la law 
angela lansbury for cbs murder she wrote and patricia wettig 
in thirtysomething 
winners will be announced sept 16 at a ceremony in pasadena 
scheduled for broadcast on fox

three times the number of membership cards turned in during all of 
1989 
in addition 125000 members were expelled 120000 died and 
150000 stopped paying their membership dues or participating in 
party activities he told tass on wednesday 
in the first six months of this year 125000 new members have 
signed up for a net loss of 765000 members said pugo chairman 
of the partys central control committee 
pugo said many people had joined the party to promote their 
careers soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has moved to 
separate the government from party jobs and affairs since taking 
office in 1985 
as a result the communist party has lost much prestigious along 
with its constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society 
the figures are not large enough to speak about a catastrophe 
or an extraordinary situation in the party pugo told tass it 
is not large enough to cause great concern 
pugo could not say how many people have quit since the partys 
28th congress ended july 13 yeltsin stunned the meeting by 
announcing he was quitting the party to concentrating on governing 
the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
other leading reformers including the mayors of both moscow and 
leningrad have also quit 
party officials said between 120000 and 130000 people resigned 
from the party last year

an army commando recaptured after escaping 
police custody en route to court to face two rape charges has 
linked himself to nine more rapes in three other states state 
police said 
master sgt marshall l brown 37 was captured unarmed by 
police early thursday in a stolen car in an east providence parking 
lot police found brown through a tip from a confidential source 
the former green beret and ranger escaped monday after freeing 
himself from handcuffs while being taken from a jail to the 
courthouse for a hearing on two charges he raped two cranston 
ri women he faces life in prison if convicted on those charges 
he also had been charged with two rapes in north carolina where 
he was a member of the army special forces stationed at fort bragg 
after he was recaptured brown gave state police information 
linking him to five rapes in north carolina and four others in 
texas and arizona lt brian andrews said brown was cooperative 
andrews said but he stopped short of calling browns remarks a 
confession 
it was not clear whether the five north carolina rapes included 
the two for which brown already had been charged 
brown of spring lake nc was attending a nineweek course at 
the naval education and training center in newport when cranston 
police arrested him on june 11 1989 
the alleged rapes outside rhode island occurred between november 
1988 and may 1989 said attorney general james e oneil he 
declined to be more specific 
oneil said additional charges of escape and theft were expected 
to be filed as early as today 
brown most recently was a member of the delta force the secret 
antiterrorist group and took part in the failed raid to free us 
hostages from iran in 1980

us rep floyd flake and his wife face federal 
charges they embezzled more than 140000 from a 
governmentsubsidized housing project for the elderly and the 
church where flake is pastor 
the indictment unsealed thursday after a twoyear 
investigation prompted denials of any wrongdoing and at least one 
allegation that some black elected officials appear to be targets 
of selective prosecution 
us attorney andrew maloney replied we go wherever the 
evidence takes us 
flake 45 was indicted on 17 counts of conspiracy fraud and 
tax evasion and his wife margarett 42 was indicted on nine 
counts maloney said 
the democrat who represents new yorks predominantly black 6th 
district in queens was charged with diverting 141700 from church 
and housing funds for personal use and failing to report it as 
taxable income 
flake said he had cooperated with the investigation and accused 
the prosecutor of attempting to substitute his judgment on how a 
church should manage its affairs and how a pastor should fulfill 
his special duties 
flakes lawyer gustave h newman said the money was used for 
churchrelated activities and that the case would not affect 
the congressmans plans to seek reelection to a third house term 
in november 
mrs flakes attorney theodore v wells jr said his client 
was added to the indictment simply because she signed joint tax 
returns 
the indictment will give further credence to the perception 
that minority politicians dont get evenhanded treatment wells 
said similar accusations have surfaced recently regarding 
washington mayor marion barry and los angeles mayor tom bradley 
flake is pastor of the allen african methodist church which was 
founded in the 1830s and has a 6000member congregation it built 
the 300unit allen senior citizens apartments in 1981 with a 10 
million federal loan 
the church operates the complex with a 100000 monthly subsidy 
from the department of housing and urban development the 
indictment charged that between 1983 and 1987 the flakes embezzled 
75000 from the complex 
maloney said the money was siphoned from money set aside to 
transport the elderly residents to local stores banks and 
restaurants 
the indictment alleged that flake took another 66700 from a 
special church ministerial expense fund account for his own use 
between 1983 and 1988 
if convicted on all 17 counts flake could be sentenced to a 
maximum of 87 years in prison and fined up to 395 million his 
wife could face penalties of 55 years in prison and fines of up to 
21 million 
the investigation began based on information from sources 
including an alleged paramour of flake maloney said refusing 
to disclose further details

shares on the tokyo stock exchange plummeted as the 
dollar strengthened against the japanese yen today because of 
uncertainties over the iraqkuwait conflict traders said 
the dollar finished trading at 14935 yen up 045 yen from 
thursdays close of 14890 yen after opening at 14977 yen the 
us currency ranged between 14890 yen and 15035 yen 
on the stock market 225issue nikkei stock average shed 72942 
points or 241 percent ending the day at 2951576 it lost 
59281 points thursday 
the drop is because of nothing else but concern over the 
iraqkuwait situation said kenji maeshiro an analyst with 
yamaichi securities co 
the index dropped more than 600 points early in the morning and 
then narrowed the loss to 29171 at the end of the morning session 
it fell back again in the afternoon on a rumor that iraqi troops 
were heading for the border of saudi arabia maeshiro said 
he said largescale arbitrage selling to take profits from price 
differences between the spot and the future markets also fueled the 
plunge in the last 30 minutes of the afternoon session as a result 
of the lastminute massive selling the index ended at the days 
low 
because rumors come out one after another market players just 
could not figure out what was really happening over there and 
growing uncertainties and fears prompted selling maeshiro said 
iraq invaded kuwait and took control of its capital thursday 
japanese participants are sensitive to middle east conditions 
because japan could be hurt more than any other major 
industrialized nation by disruptions in oil supplies 
maeshiro said alreadyrising oil prices also discouraged buying 
because of predictions that higher oil prices would lead to 
inflation and delay possible us action to lower interest rates to 
revitalize its economy 
north sea brent crude oil prices moved sharply higher today as 
the market continued to react to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
by 3 pm brent crude oil for september delivery was at 2300 
to 2330 a barrel or higher than the 2200 late thursday in new 
york earlier thursday in tokyo september brent was valued at 
2260 a barrel 
stock trading was thin with first section volume destimated at 
430 million shares up from thursdays 400 million 
in currency dealings dollaryen trading continued to fluctuate 
nervously as market players were influenced by rumors about the 
middle east said toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new 
japan securities co 
following its overnight strength against the yen in new york 
the dollar opened higher and continued to rise as market players 
saw little movement toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict 
between iraq and kuwait 
participants tended to buy the dollar because they think the 
dollar is a safe investment kanai said the dollar had been 
falling recently because of gloomy predictions for us economic 
growth 
its difficult to find any factor now to buy the yen said 
yuichi tsuchiko a dealer with fuji bank 
with uncertain prospects in the middle east coupled with rising 
oil prices and a slump in the tokyo stock market tsuchiko said 
many market players adopted a waitandsee position japan depends 
on imports for nearly all its oil needs 
the yield of benchmark no 119 10year japanese government bonds 
closed at 7705 percent up from thursdays 7615 percent finish 
their price ended at 8472 points down from thursdays 8511

guerrillas in the philippines wasnt harmed during 50 days of 
captivity but he had to endure droning marxist propaganda and 
tales of jungle ambush his parents said

said he became fed up with guerrillas rebel yells and communist 
indoctrination

said he got so sick of revolutionary music and stories of ambush he 
started to complain so they stopped 
mrs swanson said her son sounded a little tired but otherwise 
was in good spirits 
when he went into the peace corps he wanted a little 
adventure well he got it she said its just so sad that the 
world is not a place where people can help each other and not be 
suspect 
president bush who met briefly with the swansons when he 
visited cheyenne on july 20 called to congratulate the family 
after the release 
we thought it was very nice of him to call larry swanson 
said 
mrs swanson said her son was expected to return to the united 
states on sunday or monday he was scheduled for a medical 
examination today and debriefing by philippine authorities 
swanson was abducted him in the middle of the night june 13 on 
negros a philippine island led by three armed rebels he hiked 
for several days into the back country before reaching camp she 
said 
he said he was treated well he had no restraints he said he 
was treated pretty much as one of them she said apparently 
they wanted him to see what their life was like they may have been 
trying to indoctrinate him 
toward the end of swansons captivity the situation became 
tiresome his mother said 
his basic feeling at least during the latter part of his 
captivity was mainly boredom she said he was sick to death of 
the thing 
swanson was released by the rebels shortly after a japanese aid 
worker who had been held since may 29 was freed 
the united states suspended all peace corps operations in the 
philippines on june 27 and sent volunteers home because of alleged 
reports that the rebels planned to target them 
us officials said they were unaware of swansons kidnapping 
when the order was issued and learned of it june 30 when they tried 
to contact him 
the captives mother was proud of her son for joining the peace 
corps 
im not sorry he did what he did she said i believe he 
was doing the right thing im so proud of that kid i guess i 
should call him a man

shelling and gunfire today shook portions of 
kuwaits capital where invading iraqi troops sought to consolidate 
their hold on the persian gulf nation world reaction toughened 
against iraq 
the us aircraft carrier independence headed to the region and 
president bush refused to rule out direct us military 
intervention calling iraqs lightning attack thursday on its 
smaller southern neighbor naked aggression 
france said it planned to send a second warship to the gulf 
world oil prices jumped sharply thursday and us lawmakers 
demanded a worldwide boycott of iraqi oil 
the invasion followed weeks of threats by iraqi president saddam 
hussein in a dispute with kuwait over oil land and money iraq 
threatened to turn the rich sheikdom into a graveyard if anyone 
tried to intervene and said it installed a government to replace 
the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah who fled the country 
the 21member arab league scheduled a closed meeting today while 
arab leaders held urgent consultations on how to respond to the 
crisis 
there was no further word on casualties diplomats said at least 
200 kuwaitis were killed or wounded the day before most of them 
from the government emiri guard 
shelling in kuwait city occurred at the countrys main military 
barracks in the northern area of shuwaikh and was heard throughout 
the night indicating resistance was stiffer than the first day of 
the invasion 
there was also artillery shelling on the gulf coast 16 miles 
from shuwaikh and two military vehicles were on fire the 
residents said speaking by phone on condition of anonymity 
a british embassy official quoted by the british news agency 
press association today reported explosions and gunfire along the 
seafront in kuwait city and around key installations including the 
emirs palace 
a curfew was in force all ports were sealed the airport 
remained closed and the three main land crossings into kuwait were 
impassable said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
by this afternoon gulfbased diplomats speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the fighting had abated 
telephone operators in the gulf nation of bahrain who previously 
had been able to reach kuwait said this afternoon that lines 
appeared to have been cut off 
the sheiks government vowed to fight to win back the country a 
seemingly impossible task since iraq has 1 million soldiers in its 
army and kuwait has 20000 
his radio station beaming from an unknown location reported 
that the emir was taking charge of directing the resistance from a 
safe place 
meanwhile a spokesman at the us embassy said three americans 
had been seized by the iraqis from the shuaiba oil refinery 
he indicated that the iraqis had taken them to help run the 
refinery and not as any particular threat to the americans 
within kuwait 
the spokesman who could not be named under embassy rules said 
the iraqis were not hostile to americans soldiers escorted 
americans they met on the streets to their homes and were 
treating them very well he said 
nearly 4000 americans are among the large expatriate community 
in kuwait where more than 60 percent of the 19 million residents 
are foreigners iraq has 17 million residents 
iraq recently accused kuwait of stealing oil it claimed its 
troops entered kuwait at the request of revolutionaries who it said 
had staged a coup kuwaiti and other diplomats said the coup report 
was a farce 
iraqi troops backed by 350 tanks and air cover swept into kuwait 
before dawn thursday meeting brave but ultimately ineffective 
resistance from the vastly outnumbered kuwaitis said the 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
iraqi soldiers were making sweeps today through the southern 
oilfields near saudi arabia according to residents and lloyds 
insurance service in london 
izzat ibrahim deputy chairman of iraqs ruling revolutionary 
command council flew to saudi arabia today on an official visit 
the iraq news agency reported the two oil giants have a 
nonaggression pact 
in the united states members of congress after briefings by 
intelligence officials expressed fears that iraqs next target 
could be saudi arabia 
however a wellinformed diplomatic source in the gulf reported 
no movement of iraqi troops into saudi arabia or directly across 
the iraqsaudi arabian border 
the invasion of kuwait brought universal condemnation and 
sanctions 
the un security council on thursday denounced the occupation 
and demanded that iraq withdraw its troops immediately 
more countries joined the united states in denouncing the 
invasion including south korea new zealand malaysia thailand 
indonesia china singapore 
the soviet union iraqs biggest arms supplier announced a 
suspension of shipments to iraq the united states froze iraqi 
assets and blocked most iraqi imports including its most important 
revenue source oil 
the united states britain and france froze kuwaiti assets 
thursday to protect the holdings from iraqi occupiers japan and 
west germany were among other nations that followed suit today 
officials said 
iraq responded to the american moves by freezing repayment of 
iraqi debts to the united states the official iraqi news agency 
reported the total size of the debt is unclear last year the 
united states provided 1 billion in agricultural credits to iraq 
iraq began threatening kuwait two weeks ago after accusing it of 
stealing oil from a border region claimed by both nations it also 
accused kuwait of depriving it of oil revenues by cheating on opec 
oil cartel production quotas thus driving down oil prices 
talks to resolve the dispute broke down wednesday and diplomats 
said iraq had moved about 100000 soldiers to the kuwait border 
it was unclear whether the takeover would slow or halt kuwaits 
oil production but it seemed to signal an important shift in the 
balance of world oil power 
private analysts said thursday in the united states countries 
dependent on imported oil now face new economic risks the united 
states gets half its oil from abroad 10 percent of which comes 
from iraq and kuwait 
by grabbing control of kuwait saddam added about 94 billion 
barrels of oil reserves to his countrys own 100 billion barrels 
second only to saudi arabia according to the american petroleum 
institute an industry trade group 
iraq larger than california has coveted new jerseysized 
kuwait for decades their common border was left undemarcated upon 
kuwaits independence from britain in 1961

france will station a second warship in the persian 
gulf because of iraqs invasion of neighboring kuwait acting 
premier pierre beregovoy said today 
beregovoy said a second gunboat or corvette will be sent to 
the region but he did not say when it would be dispatched 
france had planned to replace one ship with the other beregovoy 
said in a radio interview he is finance minister but acting head 
of government while prime minister michel rocard is on vacation 
the government decided to leave the first gunboat in place and 
the one that was supposed to replace it will join it in the gulf 
beregovoy told radiotelevision luxembourg in an interview 
broadcast in france he did not say when the second ship would 
arrive 
iraqi troops and tanks swarmed across the border into oilrich 
kuwait early thursday shelling parts of kuwait city and sending 
the countrys leaders fleeing to saudi arabia the un security 
council denounced the invasion 
we must now examine under what conditions the decisions of the 
united nations can be respected that is the immediate withdrawal 
of iraqi forces from kuwait beregovoy said 
he noted that france acted along with other western nations in 
freezing assets of iraq and kuwait the latter mainly to protect 
them from seizure by iraq and by halting arms sales to iraq

the swiss have lived up to their 
triggerhappy reputation at the symphony of shots expending 
4450000 bullets in a barrage of gunfire at the federal shooting 
fest 
the biggest recreational shooting contest of its kind worldwide 
has ended in the industrial city of winterthur 220 miles northeast 
of geneva and organizers called it a blazing success 
for 17 days through last sunday more than 80000 men and women 
took turns blasting away at 463 targets on 16 shooting ranges from 
730 am to 630 pm winterthur has demonstrated that the 
interest in our sport is unbroken said hans zuercher central 
secretary of the federal shooters association 
it was a refreshing contrast from the gloom and doom that has 
been spreading in the past few years said willy loretan a swiss 
parliamentary deputy 
its high time for us swiss to show more joy and optimism we 
do not want to be viewed any longer as european champions of 
humorlessness he said 
the tagesanzeiger newspaper of zurich described it as a 
symphony of shots 
target shooting is highly popular in switzerland although a 
national referendum last november showed an ebbing of popular 
support for the citizens army the main promoter of marksmanship 
shooting has been a hallowed tradition among the swiss ever 
since as legend has it william tell sent an arrow through an 
apple on his sons head about 700 years ago 
the 580000 organized shooters in a nation of 67 million have 
plenty of opportunity to practice their marksmanship 
even the tiniest village has easy access to one of the 3000 
ranges scattered throughout the country on almost every weekend 
from april to september firing echoes through alpine valleys 
part of the practice is obligatory every soldier of the swiss 
militia army between the ages of 20 and 42 annually is required to 
achieve a certain minimum score in shooting at targets during 
offduty practice 
this system means 423000 automatic rifles are kept in swiss 
homes every militia man discharged at age 50 can keep his weapon 
as private property allowing him to continue practice unless he 
decides to sell the rifle on the secondhand market 
it makes for a lot of guns in a nation pledged to permanent 
neutrality which last saw fighting 143 years ago in a onemonth 
civil war that claimed 138 dead yet military weapons are rarely 
used to commit crimes in this largely violencefree country 
participants at wintherthur ranged in age from 16 to 95yearold 
sepp walker who scored above average with his carbine 
overall best marksman was malcolm cooper britains double 
olympic gold medalist in shooting 
his foreign passport barred him from becoming a king the 
title bestowed on the top finishers in the various categories of 
the competition 
attention focused on the debut of the 22inch model 90 automatic 
rifle with which the army is replacing its current 33yearold 
version 
tests suggest that what swiss newspapers described as a wonder 
weapon is of very high precision 
demand for the private nonautomatic version which sells for 
680 has outstripped supply delivery time is more than a month 
so far more than 22000 have been sold compared with 30000 
delivered to the army 
its lighter and handier than the 57 model said zuercher 
that is one reason why there is increasing interest in 
marksmanship among women and girls there is a definite trend 
one of the 3400 female participants 18yearold corinne haas 
turned in a better performance with the new rifle than two swiss 
army generals

the government struggled to 
restore order and prepared to search the parliament building for 
bombs following the surrender of moslem radicals who held 
government officials hostage 
security forces on thursday fired warning shots at looters still 
plaguing the capital a state of emergency imposed during the 
sixday hostage standoff that ended wednesday remained in effect 
government spokesman gregory shaw said a regional security force 
of 300 led by a jamaican colonel was to arrive today to guard 
installations thereby freeing local forces to patrol he did not 
specify which countries were involved 
soldiers said they would send demolition experts into the 
parliament building which they have stayed out of because they 
feared timedelayed explosives during the standoff the radicals 
threatened to blow up their hostages 
the government says at least 30 people died before the hostages 
were freed wednesday and authorities expect to find more bodies in 
the legislative building and the burnedout police headquarters 
a government cabinet minister held by moslem radicals said 
thursday she repeatedly believed i was going to die 
they decided that all of us were expendable she said 
jennifer johnson minister of sports and culture went on state 
television to discuss her hostage ordeal 
the moslem rebels launched their revolt last friday by storming 
parliament and broadcast buildings in the capital and rebel leader 
abu bakr declared his forces to be in control of the caribbean 
island off northeast venezuela 
however the uprising never attracted popular support and 
government forces surrounded the rebels and their captives the 
standoff ended wednesday with the release of the hostages and the 
surrender of 112 rebels 
prime minister arthur nr robinson still recovering in a 
hospital from several ailments including a gunshot to the leg was 
freed tuesday 
bakr and his followers were being held at the chaguaramas 
military headquarters about 10 miles from the capital 
shaw said the government was studying what charges to bring 
against them he indicated they could be accused of murder 
kidnapping or treason which carries the death penalty 
bakr is a former policeman who converted to islam and considers 
himself a champion of the downtrodden he had accused robinson of 
corruption and blamed him for widespread poverty in this once 
oilrich nation of 13 million people

newspapers should hire more black and other 
minority journalists to accurately reflect the countrys racial 
composition says the vice president of the national association of 
black journalists 
america is browner and tanner and is going to continue to be 
in the future and the industry must reflect that perspective and 
diverse view of the world through the people it hires denise 
johnson said thursday 
johnson made her comments at the associations annual 
convention which some 2000 people are attending 
hiring rates for minorities in journalism have increased little 
in recent years according to a report by the american society of 
newspaper editors released at the conventions start on wednesday 
the report found that 4 percent of newsroom employees including 
reporters editors artists and photographers were minorities in 
1978 compared to 786 percent this year blacks now account for 4 
percent of the newsroom population the highest percentage among 
all minority groups 
if you look at the percentages and how slowly the industry has 
moved to respond to a very rapidly changing population the 
progress isnt nearly as impressive said johnson an editorial 
writer and columnist for the saint paul minn pioneer press 
the report also said that 4 percent of newspapers across the 
united states employ no minorities 
most institutions in this country are still pretty much 
dominated by white middleage males and i think the tendency on 
their part is to look out over the staff of people they direct and 
take under their wing a person who reminds them of themselves 
johnson said 
editors surveyed by the asne said the most frequent reasons for 
not hiring more minorities include the lack of qualified journalism 
graduates poor starting salaries and a lack of commitment to 
affirmativeaction hiring 
the study queried more than 300 newspaper editors said 
cornelius foote jr minority affairs director of the asne

peasants loyal to the former leftist 
sandinista government have seized a ranch belonging to the minister 
of agriculture protesting the takeover of sandinista cooperatives 
by backers of the new government 
the prosandinista newspaper barricada published a picture 
thursday of the peasants hoisting machetes at the ranchs main gate 
the hacienda owned by agriculture minister roberto rondon a 
member of the new conservative government was seized wednesday 
about 10 miles northeast of juigalpa in chontales province about 
100 miles southeast of managua 
we will stay at the hacienda until the government returns 
various haciendas that government sympathizers have invaded here 
and in other regions vowed carlos espinoza a member of the 
association of field workers 
espinoza also said thursday that government sympathizers and 
former contra rebels have threatened to take over another 
sandinista cooperative 
the seizures follow complaints that the new government of 
violeta barrios de chamorro that assumed power from the sandinistas 
in april is not responding quickly enough to demands for land 
distribution 
when the government took power it said lands confiscated by the 
sandinistas would be returned to their previous owners 
the decree angered the sandinistas and provoked a strike in july 
that grew into fullscale riots killing at least seven people and 
injuring 100 
as part of the settlement the government agreed to suspend the 
decree 
gustavo tablada director of the institute for agrarian reform 
said a resolution to the dispute is being sought through dialogue 
and not coercion 
the seizures began july 19 when peasants sympathetic to the 
national opposition union which carried mrs chamorro to the 
presidency in free elections took over two haciendas in la 
concepcion 25 miles east of managua 
progovernment peasants invaded the haciendas the day sandinista 
cooperative workers traveled to managua to commemorate the 11th 
anniversary of the revolution that brought the sandinistas to power 
when they returned they found the progovernment sympathizers 
armed with machetes and rifles taking cover in trenches 
a fight followed in which an opposition union sympathizer was 
shot to death witnesses said 
on july 27 progovernment peasants and recently demobilized 
contra rebels took over another hacienda about 60 miles southeast 
of juigalpa

unusually hot weather in europe 
has killed five people in spain and caused greeces worst drought 
in 100 years 
between late june and late july temperatures of up to 109 
degrees were recorded twice in the southern region of andalusia 
where three people died because of the heat two more deaths 
occurred in the northwestern city of vigo 
those have been the only fatalities reported so far and 
temperatures in most southern european nations remain well below 
record levels 
dutch forecasters insisted thursday that the nation was not 
facing what could be officially termed a heat wave 
but temperatures of well over 86 degrees have hit france 
britain and the netherlands whose residents normally use the 
holiday season to flee their rainprone climes for sunnier weather 
in southern europe 
the hot weather has been news on front pages in france and the 
netherlands where it was the lead story in several thursday 
morning newspapers 
heat becomes nuisance said a headline in the rotterdam 
newspaper algemeen dagblad amsterdams de telegraaf said dutch 
learning to cope with heat 
a third newspaper trouw used up almost half of its front page 
quoting what it called an interior environmental physicist 
the expert j vorenkamp explained his window discipline 
theory opening windows at night and keeping them closed at day to 
make the most of a buildings natural insulation 
in england authorities blamed the heat for stopping the famous 
big ben bell in londons houses of parliament for more than three 
hours wednesday 
at colchester zoo in england visitors were asked to bring leaves 
to feed its two baby elephants tania and zola because normal feed 
supplies of willow sweet chestnut poplar and oak leaves had been 
destroyed in the drought 
more serious however is the drought that has been afflicting 
much of the continent since the spring 
in greece authorities described the drought situation as the 
worst in 100 years and set up a plan to ship water to athens by 
supertanker if the need should arise 
although water rates in the greek capital have been tripled in 
an effort to cut consumption reservoirs are expected to run dry by 
november when the rainy season usually starts 
in italy rainfall from jan 1 to july 20 this year was nearly 
40 percent below the average of the last 30 years according to a 
weather bureau spokesman lt col paolo ernani 
the national weather service reported that temperatures in italy 
during late july and early august were 72 degrees higher than 
average 
forest fires fanned by the drought raged in portugal and spain 
where many were believed to have been set by arsonists 
portuguese national fire service chief cristiano santos said his 
men were exhausted after fighting fires that have destroyed more 
than 61750 acres of forest bush and farm land since midjune 
santos told portugals lusa news agency there were 27 percent 
more fires between june 15 and july 23 than during the same period 
last year

lava from kilauea volcano crept along 
the black sand beach closing one of the islands most popular 
beaches to tourists and forcing some residents from their homes 
a lava flow about 500 yards wide engulfed about half of kaimu 
bay and the beach on the southeast coast of the island of hawaii 
glenn sodayasu of the hawaii county civil defense agency said 
thursday night 
the inland part of the flow was some 350 yards away from the 
closest of nine houses that have been evacuated he said residents 
of 40 other homes nearby were told to prepare to leave 
its a stressful time for these people who have to move out 
of their homes civil defense spokesman wendell hatada said 
theyve lived there most of their lives mostly and a lot of 
them have lived there for generations 
visitors were prohibited from the area so residents could move 
their belongings without throngs of tourists clogging the narrow 
twolane road 
the area is one of the islands best surfing spots with the 
exotic beach a favorite of residents tourists and photographers 
it is used often as a backdrop for commercials

iraqs conquest of kuwait increases the chances 
of another arabisraeli conflict and heightens jordans importance 
as a buffer state israeli analysts say 
amatzia baram an iraq specialist at haifa university said 
today that the israelis had warned us defense secretary richard 
cheney last month that an iraqi military strike against kuwait was 
likely baram said the americans apparently discounted the warnings 
as selfserving 
but defense ministry spokesman dan naveh denied the report 
saying defense minister moshe arens raised the subject of possible 
iraqi aggression but did not specifically mention kuwait when he 
met with cheney in washington 
naveh however said israel never ruled out the possibility of 
an invasion 
the hadashot daily quoted a senior military intelligence 
officer brig gen dani rothschild as saying israel expected an 
attack after iraqi leader saddam hussein moved thousands of troops 
to the kuwaiti border last month 
you dont consolidate forces like that in order to do 
nothing rothschild was quoted as telling a parliamentary 
committee thursday the day of the invasion but rothschild and 
other intelligence officials reportedly said that the timing and 
scale of the invasion were unexpected 
experts said thursday that the crisis could bring israel 
together with moderate arab countries and the united states in a 
tacit alliance to limit iraqs future reach 
iraq one of the jewish states fiercest foes had escalated its 
antiisraeli rhetoric before taking on neighboring kuwait in a 
dispute over oil borders and money 
israel is concerned that jordan which shares a 225mile border 
with israel may be the next target for iraqi president saddam 
hussein in his quest for expanded influence in the region 
jordan has taken on tremendous importance as a buffer state 
now for israel said joseph alpher of tel aviv universitys 
jaffee center for strategic studies 
dore gold also of the jaffee center said iraq has 
demonstrated what happens to countries that try to oppose it 
if jordan sees the other arab states and the united states are 
not supporting it against iraq it will not stand up to iraq he 
said jordan will then do anything saddam hussein requests 
an iraqi force backed by 350 tanks and warplanes invaded its 
oilrich neighbor early thursday morning the invading army quickly 
assumed control of the small emirate and set up a provisional 
government 
politicians seemed to have hope thursday that the united states 
and other western leaders would take israeli fears of iraq more 
seriously than in the past 
the character of saddam hussein has been revealed to the west 
and the democratic countries that had illusions about the man 
said arens speaking on israel radio 
iraq has threatened it would attack israel with chemical weapons 
if israel attacked any arab nation 
the invasion may also lead to greater strategic cooperation 
between israel and the united states said eliyahu benelissar 
chairman of the parliaments defense and foreign affairs committee 
and a prominent member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc 
other analysts said the conflict would reduce us pressure on 
israel to make painful concessions in order to move the stalled 
peace process with the palestinians forward 
this is the biggest present iraq could give israel said 
reserve brig gen aharon levran a strategic analyst saddam has 
created a new focus of conflict and worry in the region

a former indianapolis civic leader received 
a nineyear prison sentence after a federal judge told her he 
couldnt understand how she could participate in sending marijuana 
to the same kinds of poor neighborhoods she helped 
its hard for me to look at this record and make some 
conclusion as to what in the world is going on in your mind us 
district judge larry j mckinney told linda leary on thursday 
leary 59 pleaded guilty in february to being involved in a 50 
million marijuana smuggling ring in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
her sons paul b heilbrunn 35 and richard s heilbrunn 38 
are accused of running the operation and are scheduled for a feb 
13 trial 
mckinney said he had received several letters from people who 
depicted leary as a caring woman involved in childcare centers 
innercity school immunization programs and similar projects in 
povertystricken areas 
he said it is incredibly ironic that at the same time she 
also was part of a conspiracy that brought marijuana into poor 
neighborhoods 
a tearful leary asked the judge to give her a chance to try to 
build a life with value 
she added that she has to live with the problems shes caused 
her family 
they have been so hurt and so troubled by all of this and i 
cant undo that said leary former president of the indianapolis 
league of women voters and of the indianapolis chapter of the 
national council of jewish women 
her lawyer bernard l pylitt had argued for leniency saying 
leary was a devoted mother and grandmother who closed her eyes to 
right and wrong because she loved her sons 
im here to consider more than just one mother mckinney 
responded later im here to represent a lot of mothers and 
fathers and kids 
mckinney sentenced leary to nine years for conspiracy to possess 
with intent to distribute marijuana and to a concurrent fiveyear 
term on a racketeering charge the second charge stemmed from her 
control over a trust account in the cayman islands that was used to 
launder marijuana profits 
mckinney also gave leary credit for more than one year of prison 
time she already has served and ordered her to forfeit about 
200000 in assets obtained through drug money 
the judge said he would recommend to the bureau of prisons that 
leary serve the rest of her sentence at the federal correctional 
institute in lexington ky where she has been held since february 
under the plea agreement leary could be required to testify 
against her sons 
thursdays sentencing modified a temporary 20year sentence 
mckinney ordered for leary in february so that she could go to the 
kentucky prison for medical evaluation 
leary and her sons fled to austria in 1985 after learning that a 
federal grand jury was probing allegations the heilbrunns were 
directing a multistate smuggling operation leary her sons and 
more than 30 other people were indicted nov 20 1987 
she and the heilbrunns were arrested in may 1989 in austria 
they were extradited to the united states last december

an intimate relationship with a woman lay 
minister who claims another priest fathered her child led to the 
resignation of atlanta archbishop eugene a marino the nations 
highestranking black roman catholic 
marino resigned june 1 after the church began investigating his 
relationship with vicki r long said bishop james p lyke 
appointed acting administrator of the atlanta archdiocese 
lyke declined to say thursday whether marino would have been 
asked to quit or whether the relationship was a sexual one 
i assume that as the result of a twoyear relationship xyz 
would have happened he said at a news conference 
the relationship first reported wednesday came to the 
attention of church officials in the spring with an anonymous tip 
lyke said an investigation began may 3 and marino agreed to 
relinquish administration of the archdiocese until the 
investigation was complete he said 
at the time it was announced that marino had relinquished his 
duties because of stress and a near heart attack 
church officials later said marino resigned on july 10 but lyke 
said thursday he actually submitted his resignation to vatican 
officials june 1 
lyke said church officials were not lying when they announced 
that marino had resigned for personal reasons and to seek 
appropriate spiritual medical and psychological therapy 
that was true lyke said what was not announced was that 
the personal reasons involved an intimate relationship with a 
woman entered into shortly after his arrival in atlanta in may 
1988 and sustained during the next two years 
lyke would not reveal details but said ms long a catholic 
from suburban riverdale has made a monetary claim against the 
archdiocese he would not disclose the amount she has sought 
the archdiocese granted ms long charity payments earlier 
this year for medical bills but lyke would not say how much when 
or why 
ms long had been receiving 1500 monthly payments apparently 
from marino and lyke emphasized that those payments were not 
church money he refused to speculate on how the archbishop could 
have afforded such an amount 
church officials have declined to say where marino is he was 
last said to be recuperating in new york 
ms long refused to comment wednesday when asked about the 
allegations she could not be reached thursday because her 
telephone number is unlisted members of st john the evangelist 
church where she is a member declined to reveal her whereabouts 
in 1987 ms long filed a 23 million lawsuit charging that a 
catholic priest from columbus fathered her child blood tests 
concluded that the priest the rev donal keohane with whom she 
had a fouryear relationship did not father the child born in may 
1986 but the church is paying child support 
certainly priests are tremendously vulnerable from the inside 
because of their own sexual drives and from the outside because 
they become very attractive sexual targets said aw richard 
sipe a former benedictine monk now practicing psychotherapy in 
baltimore 
sipe conducted a 25year study of priests to be published next 
month that concluded that half of all priests break celibacy vows 
the unusual thing with this is its being discussed he 
said noting that church officials usually dont comment on church 
scandals 
the revelations have triggered anew the continuing debate over 
whether celibacy a discipline required of roman catholic priests 
since the middle ages is appropriate in the 20th century 
celibacy has not always been enforced three times in the 10th 
century popes were elected who were the sons of priests or former 
popes 
the rev thomas reese at georgetown university said the most 
recent bishop to leave the church and marry was james shannon an 
auxiliary bishop of st paul minn in the late 1960s 
in 1971 the national federation of priests councils voted in 
favor of making celibacy optional and support groups for women and 
priests who have had sexual relationships are starting one in 
pennsylvania has about 1200 members threefourths of whom are 
priests

the jury in marion barrys drug and perjury 
trial began its first full day of deliberations today after a 
sixweek trial at which the mayors defense team admitted that he 
occasionally used cocaine 
no one can suffer any more pain or shame or hurt than me 
barry said outside the us district court building thursday in 
closing arguments the government accused him of having lived 
above the law 
barry engaged in occasional cocaine use but the government 
failed to prove the drug possession conspiracy and perjury charges 
against him defense lawyer r kenneth mundy told the jury in 
closing arguments 
the jury of two whites and 10 blacks spent about an hour 
deliberating thursday after being instructed not to consider 
politics or race when deciding the 14 criminal charges 
the ninewoman threeman jurys first decision thursday was 
selecting a foreman edward eagles one of the two whites 
the mayor said he is rather anxious obviously with the fate 
of marion barry in the hands of 12 people 
barrys public antidrug stance was someone trying in his own 
frailty to say this is wrong said mundy adding that the 
mayors accusers are facile liars and little lucifers 
charles lewis a convicted cocaine dealer is the eternal 
salesperson selling himself to the jury the defense attorney 
said 
restaurateur hassan mohammadi who testified he and barry used 
cocaine together is a frequent government witness who played the 
notes to the tune that the government wrote for him mundy said 
mundy asserted the mayor was a victim of entrapment by the fbi 
which had an undercover agent supply the crack cocaine that barry 
smoked in a videotaped sting operation that culminated in his 
arrest jan 18 
the exhaustive federal investigation of barrys drug use 
amounted to using a sledgehammer to kill a fly the defense 
lawyer said 
if mr barrys drug use were so rampant he could have been 
discovered in a more traditional way mundy said the cure is 
manyfold worse than the ailment 
assistant us attorney richard roberts responded by saying that 
marion barry lived above the law 
he lived one step ahead of anyone who was looking at him 
roberts added 
the mayor lied to the public the sad fact is marion 
barry was out to get himself said the prosecutor who urged the 
jury to return a guilty verdict on all counts 
roberts who is black scoffed at suggestions that the mayor was 
the victim of a political or racial vendetta 
roberts urged the jurors to remember the 10 government witnesses 
who testified about barrys alleged cocaine use and not join his 
conspiracy of silence and deceit 
mr barry is asking you to shut your eyes cover your ears to 
close your mind roberts said really hes asking you to 
insult your intelligence by forgetting the facts

a federal judge has started to examine 
redistricting plans that could radically shift the power balance in 
the nations most populous county 
us district judge david kenyon began reviewing alternative 
district maps thursday after he tossed out a county plan as 
illogical and insensitive to minorities 
the judge examined plans submitted by the american civil 
liberties union the justice department and the mexican american 
legal defense and educational fund all plaintiffs in the federal 
lawsuit against los angeles county 
those plans seek to create a hispanic majority district but 
without an incumbent they could overturn the conservative majority 
and possibly lead to profound changes in financing in such areas as 
health and social services programs 
civil rights lawyers today planned to discuss how the plans 
would be implemented 
the county board of supervisors was ordered to redraw the 
districts after kenyon found supervisors violated the federal 
voting rights act by conspiring in 1981 to draw district lines that 
diluted hispanic voting strength 
but the remapping effort approved by the fivemember boards 
conservative majority was not in good faith kenyon ruled wednesday 
though hispanics make up about 35 percent of the countys 87 
million residents the fivemember board has not had an elected 
hispanic member in 115 years

iraqs capture of kuwaiti oil fields is 
awakening the united states to a shift in the balance of global oil 
power and the prospect of higher prices analysts say 
us dependence on oil from the volatile persian gulf has grown 
rapidly in recent years as american production has fallen that 
leaves the united states increasingly vulnerable to supply 
disruptions and gives the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries more influence over prices 
in 1985 the united states relied on the gulf countries for about 
10 percent of imports this year the gulf share of the american 
market is about 25 percent 
onehalf of all us oil supplies are imported while britain 
and other nonopec oil exporters had snatched part of the american 
market from the middle east producers in the early 1980s some of 
that nonopec supply is drying up 
i dont think the average american has understood how rapidly 
our dependence has increased sen david boren dokla chairman 
of the senate intelligence committee said thursday weve really 
been asleep at the switch in terms of the national security 
implications of relying heavily on middle east oil exporters 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas called today for new incentives for 
domestic oil production including tax breaks for those who squeeze 
oil from formations now considered unrecoverable 
this weeks news makes our vulnerability more evident and our 
response more urgent said bentsen chairman of the taxwriting 
senate finance committee by failing to learn from this history 
we are condemning ourselves to repeat it 
iraqi president saddam husseins quick strike into kuwait 
highlighted us vulnerability to oil market pressures and to the 
possibility that opec with iraq in a leading role may regain 
its pricefixing clout analysts said 
in a nights work hussein has irrevocably altered not only 
the balance of power in the middle east but the supply and demand 
balance in the world oil market said christopher flavin vice 
president for research at the worldwatch institute in washington 
iraq immediately doubled its share of world oil reserves by 
taking control of kuwait which estimates its reserves at 94 
billion barrels iraq now ranks second in the world to saudi 
arabia which has estimated reserves of 255 billion barrels the 
united states holds 26 billion barrels 
flavin said the bush administration has little prospect for 
stopping iraq from further military conquests in the gulf despite 
the importance of oil to the us economy 
ironically any effort by the united states to directly 
prevent iraqi military action would itself provoke the kind of 
conflict almost certain to disrupt oil supplies and quite possibly 
throw the world into a severe recession flavin said 
with iraq now playing the role of enforcer opec may be in a 
position to tighten world oil supplies over the coming decade 
possibly enabling the cartel to raise its prices and make them 
stick analysts said 
perhaps most troubling for the united states and other large 
oilconsuming nations oil market clout is becoming increasingly 
concentrated in the gulf where no nation has enough military might 
or political leverage to challenge iraqi ambitions 
all of the opec countries at least all of those in the middle 
east will be intimidated by iraq said sen j bennett johnston 
dla chairman of the senate energy and natural resources 
committee iraq will be able to set such prices it wants 
throughout the eight years of the iraniraq war which ended in 
1988 both countries were neutralized on the oil scene leaving 
saudi arabia and kuwait to dominate in opec and ensuring that the 
west would again become hooked on the cartels oil 
after emerging victorious over iran iraq began seeking to 
convert its regional military predominance into added oil clout 
the invasion of kuwait was the first dramatic proof to analysts 
that baghdad is intent on supplanting saudi arabia as the main 
power in opec and leading a drive toward higher oil prices

florida agricultural officials today declared an 
end to a 3month medfly infestation with a slap at california for 
taking so long to get rid of its pests 
helicopters sprayed up to 20 square miles of suburban miami with 
malathion in eight aerial treatments to kill mediterranean fruit 
flies considered the most destructive farm pest because it can 
attack 250 fruits and vegetables 
californias yearold infestation has spread to more than 900 
square miles with limited aerial pesticide spraying at a cost of 
more than 38 million said florida agriculture commissioner doyle 
conner 
it is absolutely vital to move quickly and aggressively which 
is exactly what we did he said 
floridas 16 million eradication effort began after a fly was 
trapped near miami international airport on april 16 by may 21 23 
medflies were found at 21 locations 
the bottom line is that weve turned back a serious threat to 
our food supply in an environmentally sound program involving a 
limited geographic area conner said 
unlike california where malathion spraying produced a public 
outcry the spraying in virginia gardens miami springs and parts 
of hialeah went on with little fuss

senators clashed today over a contentious 
amendment to allow abortions in military hospitals as one 
republican lawmaker charged the measure would facilitate a 
procedure many americans find repugnant 
two members of the senate armed services committee sens tim 
wirth dcolo and john glenn dohio tried to add the provision 
to the 289 billion defense bill for the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 
the senate is rushing to finish the legislation before it breaks 
for its august recess on thursday lawmakers left intact president 
bushs budget request for the b2 bomber but imposed restrictions 
on the 46 billion 
during debate on the senate floor today wirth told of a navy 
petty officer and his wife who while pregnant with her first child 
learned that the fetus was severely deformed 
despite recommendations from us and japanese physicians that 
they have an abortion the woman was unable to obtain one at us 
facilities in japan where the midway was stationed 
instead they used all their savings 2400 to have an 
abortion performed by a japanese doctor 
this is not a complex issue it does not get into public 
funding for abortion wirth said 
the amendment would reverse a 2yearold regulation that bans 
abortions in military hospitals except when the life of the mother 
is endangered under the provision abortions for military 
personnel and their dependents would have to be paid for by the 
individual 
this unsettles a longsettled policy with regard to government 
involvement in abortions said sen gordon humphrey rnh who 
complained that the provision would make it easier for an 
individual to have a procedure that many americans find 
repugnant 
on thursday the senate met the challenge from bush to save the 
b2 bomber as republicans argued that iraqs invasion of kuwait is 
a sobering reminder against wholesale cuts in military spending 
in the house meantime speaker thomas s foley dwash was 
trying to force a prerecess vote today on campaign spending 
limits but was meeting stiff opposition from colleagues who object 
to having only 90 minutes of debate 
the house also faced votes on final passage of a bill to 
strengthen oil spill liability laws and on a major civil rights 
bill 
the senate on thursday endorsed bushs b2 budget request for 
fiscal 1991 beginning oct 1 by a 5345 margin but it also 
voted 972 to restrict use of the 46 billion earmarked for the 
radarevading plane until critical tests have been met 
earlier this week the house armed services committee dealt a 
serious blow to the embattled plane as it approved a 283 billion 
defense bill that would halt production of the batwinged planes at 
the 15 in development the president wants a 75plane fleet 
opponents of the aircraft argued that with the demise of the 
warsaw pact as a military alliance and the budget deficit 
increasing spending billions on the strategic bomber was 
questionable 
republican sen william cohen of maine proposed stalling the b2 
program at the 15 planes until the air force could certify that the 
aircraft had met certain tests 
lets fund what we have on line right now but no more b2s 
until you prove them cohen argued 
the senator cited the increasing cost of the plane which could 
skyrocket to more than 1 billion apiece and the justice 
departments recommendation that the government prohibit the 
planes manufacturer northrop corp from future defense contracts 
amid charges of fraud and mismanagement 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
conceded that the aircraft could cause sticker shock but argued 
that the changes in the soviet threat is no reason to abandon the 
b2 
these changes do not mean the millennium has arrived he 
republicans used iraqs invasion and control of kuwait to drive 
home their point that the end of the cold war in eastern europe did 
not justify deep cuts in the nations defenses 
we need a wakeup call we need to be alerted that were not 
going to be able to control the events in the world said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas 
across the capitol house speaker foley said he wanted to bring 
a pair of competing democratic campaign finance proposals along 
with a republican substitute to the floor for quick votes today 
but rep anthony beilenson dcalif and others called the plan 
for only 90 minutes of debate ridiculous and unfair 
the senate by a largely partyline 5940 vote wednesday night 
approved a democratic bill that would cap senate candidates 
campaign spending at 2 million to 10 million based on their 
states population 
the house also moved toward a vote today on a major cvil rights 
bill that bush has threatened to veto because the administration 
believes it could lead to hiring quotas 
the bill advanced thursday night with approval of a cap on 
damages courts can award female victims of job discrimination 
the oil spill legislation before the house increases federal 
liability limits but still allows states to enact tougher laws the 
bill had languished for years but was given new life after the 
march 1989 exxon valdez oil spill in alaska considered the worst 
in us history

parliament today elected arpad goencz 
a prominant writer and former political prisoner as president in a 
move that completed the countrys break with its communist past 
goencz had been sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 
1956 anticommunist uprising that was crushed by soviet troops 
all my life i have served and will serve the nations 
independence free thought free speech free ideas and social 
justice goencz told lawmakers after his election i serve 
hungarian democracy 
goencz 68 had been appointed interim president may 2 by the 
newly elected democratic parliament 
todays parliamentary vote came less than a week after the 
failure of a referendum that would have mandated a popular vote for 
the post of president 
goencz is the first president of the republic of hungary which 
was declared last year after the communists agreed to relinquish 
power and compete in multiparty elections 
of 310 deputies present and voting 295 voted for goencz the 
only candidate for the post in a secret ballot there are 386 
deputies in the unicameral legislature 
his election was expected after the failure of the referendum on 
holding a popular vote participation by more than 50 percent of 
the electorate was required for approval but fewer than 14 percent 
went to the polls 
goencz referred indirectly to the failed referendum saying the 
parties who supported him in parliament represented the majority of 
the hungarian people 
thus i can consider myself someone chosen not only by 
parliament but the whole of the people he said in his 
acceptance speech 
the referendum was sponsored by the socialist party heir to the 
now disbanded communist party which has only a small minority in 
parliament 
a referendum victory would have meant a chance for the party to 
regain some of its lost political prestige former premier miklos 
nemeth who ran as an independent in the march parliamentary 
elections still enjoys considerable popularity and observers said 
he would have had a good chance of becoming president in a direct 
election 
in a similar referendum in november hungarians voted 
overwhelmingly in favor of postponing the election of the president 
until after the parliamentary elections that meant the president 
would be elected by parliament the parliamentary elections were 
held march 25 and a runoff on april 8 
goencz who headed the hungarian writers union before his 
election as interim president in may spent six years in jail after 
soviet troops crushed the 1956 revolt against stalinism and rule 
from moscow he won a reprieve on his life sentence under a 1963 
amnesty 
he worked translating britsh and american novels into hungarian 
and eventually published several novels and short stories 
goencz is the third intellectual and former dissident to assume 
an eastern european presidency 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel a prominent playwright was 
jailed and harassed for years before his election in bulgaria on 
wednesday zhelyu zhelev a respected leader of the opposition and 
a man of letters was elected the countrys first noncommunist 
president 
goencz was one of the founding members of the reformist league 
of free democrats with 94 seats in parliament the free democrats 
are the second largest party in parliament after the hungarian 
democratic forum the senior party in the coalition government 
in a brief acceptance speech after his election goencz 
suggested his varied past would enable him as president to 
understand a broad strata of hungarian society 
i have been lucky to live as a worker as a peasant and as a 
free intellectual thus i am not suitable to serve class 
interests he said

speaker thomas s foley wants to force a 
prevacation vote on limiting house members campaign spending but 
is meeting stiff opposition from his fellow democrats as well as 
republicans 
rep anthony beilenson dcalif called ridiculous and 
unfair his party leaders plan to allow only 90 minutes of debate 
and then a vote today before the house begins a monthlong recess 
foley dwash said thursday he wanted to bring a pair of 
competing democratic campaign finance proposals along with a 
republican substitute to the floor for quick votes today 
the senate by a largely partyline 5940 vote wednesday night 
approved a democratic bill that would cap senate candidates 
campaign spending at 2 million to 10 million based on their 
states population 
the senate bill also would end the practice by which senators 
can annually pocket 27000 in speaking fees from special interest 
groups prohibit incumbents from mailing newsletters to voters at 
government expense in election years and ban corporate labor and 
trade association political action committees 
house democratic leaders want to cap spending on house races at 
550000 but have been reluctant to curb pacs which provided 52 
percent of the money raised by democratic incumbents in their last 
campaigns in 1988 
one democratic proposal would limit pac donations to 275000 or 
50 percent of the spending ceiling the other would cut them to 40 
percent or 220000 
although any changes in the law would not take effect until 
after this years election several democrats dont like what they 
portend at a party caucus earlier this week some cited how they 
had already spent 300000 in fending off opponents in primaries 
and under the proposed ceilings would have only 250000 left to 
run their general election campaigns in the fall 
i dont know of a single person in the house who is not for 
campaign finance reform said rep al swift dwash author of 
one of his partys two proposals and i also know there are 435 
plans to achieve that end 
citizen action groups such as common cause and public citizen 
while generally praising the senates bill have vehemently 
criticized house democrats reluctance to give up pacs 
because of that opposition democratic leaders just want to get 
the vote over with said house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia 
they know all the reform groups are going to be enraged at 
them he said so they want to take their beating and go home

a student who led a 53day 
antigovernment rally has been freed after six weeks detention and 
today denied charges that he incited protesters to violence 
marian munteanu whose beating and detention drew domestic and 
international protest was released thursday night in an interview 
in his apartment today he called his time in jail a nightmare 
and pledged to continue working with the student movement 
these six weeks of detention have aged me many years i am 
physically weak i feel 80 years old he said 
munteanu 28 the president of the bucharest student union was 
a leader of an antigovernment rally that police violently 
dispersed june 13 after 53 days 
the authorities decision to use force against the peaceful 
protesters led to angry riots more violence broke out when miners 
loyal to president ion iliescu came to the capital to help restore 
order six people were killed and scores injured in three days of 
unrest in the capital 
munteanu was hospitalized after being badly beaten by miners and 
then arrested days later 
his release came shortly after the prosecutorgeneral issued a 
statement saying the circumstances that led to munteanus 
preventive detention had changed and his release would no 
longer represent a threat to public order 
demonstrations demanding munteanus release were held in 
bucharest and in the central town of sibiu earlier this week 
last month prosecutors said munteanu and some 80 others would 
be tried for inciting violence but munteanu said he had not 
been informed that the decision to try him was final 
he maintained that on june 13 the day demonstrators attacked 
police headquarters with firebombs he asked the people not to go 
to police headquarters but unfortunately they allowed themselves 
to be maneuvered i dont know by whom 
he said he hoped the parliamentary commission appointed to 
investigate the events would uncover the truth 
munteanu said he did not contest the right of iliescu who won 
a massive victory in the may 20 elections to rule romania 
one of the demands of the protesters was the exclusion of all 
former communists from power iliescu was a communist functionary 
for a time under communist dictator nicolae ceausescu he 
eventually fell into disfavor with ceausescu who was driven from 
power and executed in the december revolution 
iliescu has repeatedly stated his rejection of communist ideals 
and his commitment to democracy 
but the governments not doing enough to remove the residue of 
communism in romania or to reveal the truth about what has been 
happening since the revolution munteanu said 
he said he would continue to be associated with the student 
movement to ensure they students and intellectuals are 
understood and tolerated 
munteanu said he still suffers headaches from his clubbing that 
doctors said could last two to three years

just when surfers and swimmers thought it 
may have been as safe as usual to go in the water this weekend a 
judge rejected an attempt to stop a sharkfishing tournament 
a group known as safe harbors and recreational choices filed a 
lawsuit wednesday to stop the columbia riverpacific ocean shark 
tournament scheduled for today and saturday off the northern 
oregon coast 
clatsop county circuit judge pat dooley refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order thursday because the suit was filed so 
close to the start of the tournament 
it would be a complete misuse of my discretion to issue an 
order on this short notice dooley said 
competitors plan to chum or toss ground fish and blood into the 
water to attract sharks tournament opponents said the event could 
draw sharks close to shore increasing the danger that swimmers or 
surfers might be attacked 
it would increase the risk potential however small it may 
be said california biologist mark marks a graduate student at 
humboldt state university who specializes in shark studies 
undoubtedly this kind of behavior is not conducive to safe 
swimming 
ron miller a charter boat owner and vice president of the 
tournament said in a telephone interview after the hearing that 
the entire episode had been blown out of proportion 
the whole thing has gotten the media into a feeding frenzy 
he said its just a handful of guys going out fishing 
organizers said when they announced the tournament that they 
hoped for 200 boats they said prizes would run to 80000 with a 
35000 top prize 
but miller said thursday that only about a dozen boats were 
expected 
prizes will be much lower based on a percentage of the 600 per 
boat entry fee he said individuals were being allowed to enter for 
10 each and could make their own arrangements to go out on a boat 
most of the boats planned to go 60 to 100 miles offshore and 
some will combine an albacore tuna fishing trip with the shark 
hunt miller said

cambodias khmer rouge guerrillas 
agreed today to discuss speedy formation of a council that would 
help govern cambodia until elections could be held in the 
vietnamcontrolled country 
the cambodian factions agreed to form the council during talks 
two months ago in tokyo but the khmer rouge complained it was not 
being treated as an equal and boycotted the agreement 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan agreed to new discussions in a 
broadcast over his groups radio monitored in bangkok 
however premier hun sen of the vietnameseinstalled government 
has said the formation of the council already has been decided and 
has refused resistance calls for new talks on it 
khieu samphan said the group will follow the urging of southeast 
asian foreign ministers and participate in the meeting of all 
cambodian parties to discuss the composition of the supreme 
national council in a reconciliation spirit to most speedily set up 
this council 
in a july 23 joint statement the ministers of the association 
of southeast asian nations or asean called for the urgent 
formation of the council 
they noted that some proposals have called for the council to 
work with the united nations in governing cambodia in the period 
before elections 
the council would comprise representatives of the threeparty 
guerrilla coalition and the government vietnam installed in 
cambodia after a late 1978 invasion 
after the tokyo talks representatives were named by the 
vietnameseinstalled government and the khmer rouges two guerrilla 
allies the forces of prince norodom sihanouk and of son sanns 
khmer peoples national liberation front but the khmer rouge 
refused to name any representatives 
in todays broadcast khieu samphan called the council the 
only legitimate organ of cambodia and the sole authority in the 
transition period he said it would cooperate with the united 
nations in the interim administration 
however the government wants interim authority and a largely 
symbolic council 
khieu samphan said his group agreed that no one cambodian 
party would be allowed to seize or maintain power through the force 
of arms no one cambodian party could dominate other cambodian 
parties and that no party is to be discarded 
he apparently was reacting to the international isolation of the 
khmer rouge and to fears by various western countries that it 
would try to retake power militarily the khmer rouge killed 
hundreds of thousands of people in fanatical communist policies in 
cambodia before vietnams invasion ended its nearly fouryear reign 
the groups isolation grew after the united states announced 
last month it was withdrawing recognition of the guerrilla 
coalitions un seat

fish might be contaminated shipping has 
been halted and a 12mile slick remains on galveston bay from a 
500000gallon oil spill but gov bill clements says things arent 
so bad 
were fortunate clements a former oil man said after 
viewing the spill thursday its not near as serious a problem as 
was first anticipated 
clements declaration that spills effects were greatly 
exaggerated angered fishermen and local officials less willing to 
downplay potential economic and environmental damage 
the spill occurred saturday when the greek tanker shinoussa 
collided with two barges in the houston shipping channel one of 
the barges nearly sank 
last night salvage crews moved the barge a short distance to 
put it out of the channel and onto a ledge in shallower waters in 
the bay coast guard chief warrant officer rick meidt said today 
it was not very far they just had to get it to a slightly 
more stable location he said 
the ship channel was reopened this morning to allow one 
deepdraft ship out of the area to determine if its wake would 
cause further damage to the barge he said 
but the ship passed without incident and the coast guard planned 
to allow another vessel to pass later 
were taking it slow and easy meidt said 
the spill occurred in one of the barges three cargo tanks 
since then salvage crews have pumped out a tank that had 20000 
gallons of oil about 200000 gallons is believed to still be in 
another tank a third tank is believed to be empty workers planned 
to inspect both tanks today 
meidt also reported that additional oil has washed ashore at 
houston point a marshland north of the slick 
a hearing into the cause of the crash resumed today in houston 
the bay pilot assigned to the greek freighter was scheduled to 
testify 
coast guard officials were worried about a crack in the barge 
that occurred during the accident 
were still concerned about the structural integrity of the 
barge coast guard petty officer mark sedwick said it could 
break apart 
ship owners were losing at least 15 million per day while the 
channel was closed officials said earlier in the week the coast 
guard took over cleanup efforts thursday because apex towing co 
owner of the two barges damaged in the collision was nearing its 
insurance liability limit 
cleanup crews used skimmers and vacuum trucks to suck up oil off 
the waters surface and workers also dumped oileating microbes on 
an oilsoiled marsh 
the state health department imposed a fishing ban thursday 
because of fears that fish shrimp and other marine life could be 
contaminated by the spill it idled multimilliondollar commercial 
and sport industries as worried shrimpers await the aug 15 opening 
of the fall season 
clements said the ban could be lifted soon critics were 
skeptical 
i hope hes right but realistically i think hes full of 
baloney said cl standley past president of professional 
involvement of seafood concerned enterprises 
i think it could possibly be weeks and if it is thats going 
to be devastating he said 
the spill once 17 miles long thinned to about 12 miles by 
afternoon clements said he had trouble finding any oil during a 
flyover by helicopter saying that much of the oil evaporated 
before reaching sensitive marshlands 
at least one official disputed clements contention 
obviously much of the oil has sunk to the bottom of the bay 
endangering all the marine and bird life and devastating a 
productive commercial and recreational fishery said texas 
general land commissioner garry mauro 
coast guard officials however said samples taken from the bay 
bottom by the army corps of engineers had not yet revealed signs of 
oil except in one small sample 
wayne johnson a galveston county commissioner also criticized 
clements 
im outraged he came out here and declared victory and went 
back to austin johnson said 
i dont like this idea of declaring victory and calling off 
the troops said state sen chet brooks this war is far from 
over 
in 1947 clements founded sedco inc an oil supply firm that 
specialized in offshore drilling it made the gulf of mexico oil 
rig that exploded in 1979 and spilled about 100 million gallons of 
oil the company settled lawsuits by fishermen and businesses 
seeking 350 million for 21 million

the advisory council to the national endowment 
for the arts broke with its chairman today voting overwhelmingly 
to drop an antiobscenity pledge for artists that it likened to 
mccarthy era loyalty oaths 
the council vote is not binding on the endowment nea chairman 
john e frohnmayer said im going to consider it and take my 
action in due course 
the 19 members of the national council on the 
one member said that requiring artists who get grants to pledge 
that their works will not be obscene amounts to a loyalty oath 
reminiscentarts voted after of the mccarthy era 
only two dissenting votes were recorded 
frohnmayer responding to a controversy over federal grants that 
go towards controversial art had inserted congressional language 
barring obscenity into the conditions that grant recipients must 
promise to obey before they can receive federal funds 
congress imposed the obscenity ban on the endowment last october 
after conservative lawmakers led by sen jesse helms rnc 
complained that an exhibition of sexually explicit works by 
photographer robert mapplethorpe contained obscenity and should not 
be financed by taxpayers money

investigators have concluded that the rev bruce 
ritter engaged in sexual misconduct with young men at the shelter 
for young runaways that he founded covenant house announced today 
the fourmonth inquiry ordered by the covenant house board of 
directors discovered cumulative evidence supporting the 
allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of father ritter 
covenant house said 
if ritter had not resigned as covenant house president in 
february the statement added the termination of his 
relationship would have been required 
the fourmonth investigation was conducted by robert j mcguire 
a former city police commissioner covenant house officials said 
his full report would be issued later in the day 
the findings first were reported by the new york times today 
some covenant house residents told investigators they spurned 
sexual overtures the priest made toward them while others 
described sexual activities they engaged in with ritter the times 
said quoting people who had read the report 
ritter 63 who founded the shelter that annually serves 28000 
youths has vehemently denied the allegations of sexual 
impropriety he is believed to be living in new jersey and is 
considering leaving the franciscan order 
a statement today from ritters lawyer stanley arkin said the 
report gives emphasis to an alleged few sporadic incidents 
washing away more than 20 years of uncompromising and unstinting 
accomplishment 
noting that ritter has resigned from covenant house arkin 
added revisiting these allegations now is wholly unnecessary 
either for covenant house or for the public 
the investigation found no evidence ritter misappropriated funds 
at covenant house which runs shelters in 15 us cities canada 
and central america 
the manhattan district attorney found some questionable 
financial transactions but no charges were brought against 
ritter the state attorney generals office is still investigating 
the organizations finances 
but the covenant house statement said the board should have been 
made aware of loans by ritter to two senior staff members of 
contracts between covenant house and ritters niece and of a secret 
personal fund where ritter deposited most of his 98000 salary 
the fund called the franciscan charitable trust had 
accumulated nearly 1 million plans now call for it to be 
liquidated with the assets going to covenant house as ritter says 
he intended all along 
in december a 26yearold drifter from texas kevin lee kite 
accused ritter of luring him into a sexual relationship that 
public accusation was followed by similar allegations by two 
others including darryl bassile 31 who mcguire concluded was the 
most credible of ritters accusers 
more than half of the organizations 17 board members have 
resigned since the allegations surfaced donations have fallen the 
86 million budget was cut back 14 million and a fourth of the 
420person staff was laid off 
sister mary rose mcgeady a social services worker and associate 
director of catholic charities in the roman catholic diocese of 
brooklyn was named to replace ritter on sept 1

its not the heat but a faulty bearing that has 
stopped the clock of big ben three times this week the government 
said friday 
the hands of the famous clock on the tower of the houses of 
parliament stopped at 511 am friday which is about where they 
snagged on wednesday and thursday nights 
we believe as a result of investigations carried out this 
morning that the problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern 
face of the clock and that once that bearing has been replaced or 
lubricated that the problem will go away said toby sargent 
spokesman for the department of environment 
big ben is the name of the bell that tolls the hours but the 
name is informally applied to the clock as well 
sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock 
broke down during the hottest days of the london summer on 
thursday the temperature reached 97 degrees

a third us aircraft carrier was being 
readied today to head toward the troubled mideast to bolster us 
forces already scattered outside the persian gulf region the 
pentagon said 
the move comes a day after iraq invaded kuwait however 
pentagon officials said the uss saratoga had been scheduled to 
relieve the uss eisenhower which was deployed in the mideast in 
march 
the aircraft carrier independence already is headed from the 
indian ocean toward the persian gulf to strengthen the eightship 
us navy presence already there 
the saratoga based in mayport fla earlier had been scheduled 
to relieve the uss eisenhower and will leave tuesday in addition 
a marine amphibious readiness group aboard the assault ship uss 
inchon was scheduled to sail to the region monday for a total 
deployment of 15000 sailors and marines 
this has been planned for months said defense department 
spokesman pete williams 
he declined to tie saratogas movement to the mideast crisis 
but said it was possible that the saratoga and eisenhower might 
overlap for a time and remain in the mediterranean 
in brussels today a source said the united states told its nato 
allies that it has prepared contingency plans in case iraqi troops 
push beyond kuwait 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said american 
officials did not explain what actions were under consideration 
president bush has said no options military or otherwise 
have been ruled in or out but if the 3000 americans in kuwait 
came into harms way the president said it would affect the united 
states in a very dramatic way 
if they are threatened or harmed i have certain 
responsibilities bush said after conferring thursday with 
british prime minister margaret thatcher in aspen colo 
the state department said today that invading iraqi troops 
rounded up at least eight american oil field workers near the 
border of kuwait 
adm william j crowe jr the former chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff told nbc today that the united states could 
dominate the gulf from a naval standpoint 
we can keep the iraqis off the water we can dominate them in 
the air he said but added that putting us troops on the 
ground would be a major problem 
top pentagon military officers and intelligence analysts 
insisted they were not caught off guard by iraqs sudden sweep into 
its southern arab neighbor but the independence was thousands of 
miles away from the tense region 
military sources said the independence was several days from 
reaching a staging area outside gulf waters but it will serve as a 
potent symbol of us military strength with its squadrons of fa18 
jet fighters f4 attack aircraft and a6e bombers 
meanwhile members of congress and others worried that iraqi 
president saddam hussein could aim next at an invasion of saudi 
arabia the 120000 iraqi troops massed along iraqs southern 
border for the invasion of kuwait could easily be sent there next 
said lawmakers who attended classified briefings late thursday 
us forces in the gulf had come to kuwaits aid during the 
eightyear iraniraq war when it reflagged the oilrich nations 
tankers in 1988 and protected them from attack from iran 
but it would be difficult for the united states to parry iraqs 
drive with a major assault of troops pentagon military sources say 
even though marine and army forces stand ready for use in 
western europe and at bases in the indian ocean and the pacific it 
would take massive numbers of flights access to air bases and 
numerous ships to supply such an endeavor 
our forces are very far away it would take weeks for them to 
get there one highranking military officer said 
a massive landing force would be needed to counter iraqs 
wartested soldiers and their thousands of tanks and sophisticated 
weaponry 
iraq is a third world nation with first world weapons one 
senior intelligence analyst said they are the prussians of the 
middle east they have mechanized armament you wouldnt believe 
they kicked the stuffing out of the iranians with it 
flying us ground combat forces into the persian gulf from 
european bases would be extremely difficult in view of libyan air 
defenses and problems posed by getting permission to fly over egypt 
and other nations in the region another source said 
inside the gulf the us military presence is represented by 
eight warships of the joint task force middle east led by the 
command ship uss lasalle those vessels include a cruiser 
destroyer and frigates that lack the punch of the carrier groups 
attack and bomber aircraft 
us carriers stay out of the persian gulf not only because of 
their size but to increase their security against attack

a black man attacked by a white man yelling 
racial slurs has been awarded 475000 in damages under a rarely 
used state law that forbids racial intimidation 
a cook county circuit court jury on thursday made the award to 
mack green 55 one of the first beneficiaries of the illinois 
ethnic intimidation act according to his lawyers 
the law adopted in 1982 but rarely used allows victims of 
racial religious or ethnic hostility to file civil lawsuits 
against their assailants independent of criminal prosecution 
during a oneday trial green testified that he was attacked by 
stephen windy 30 on jan 22 1988 after his tow truck broke down 
in a predominantly white neighborhood on chicagos south side 
according to the lawsuit windy tried to set the truck on fire 
grabbed a piece of lumber from the back of the truck shattered 
windows and tossed a gas can at green 
windy pleaded guilty to criminal charges of attempted arson 
damage to property and ethnic intimidation in 1988 
he was given a years probation ordered to pay for truck 
repairs and required to perform 60 hours of community service 
windy representing himself in the civil trial argued he had 
been punished already by the criminal case and that green was not 
physically injured during the attack 
he could not immediately be reached for comment after the 
verdict 
greens attorney frederick sperling said the civil suit 
sends a clear message that anyone engaging in racial or religious 
violence will have a steep price to pay

the senate rushing to adjourn for the summer 
today sidestepped a potentially volatile fight over abortion as it 
laid aside a measure that would have allowed abortions in military 
hospitals 
sen tim wirth dcolo chief sponsor of the provision 
withdrew his amendment after the senate fell two votes short of 
curtailing debate clearing the way for the senate to move ahead on 
a 289 billion defense bill for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
this is not a complex issue it does not get into public 
funding for abortion wirth said 
the amendment would have reversed a 2yearold regulation that 
bans abortions in military hospitals except when the life of the 
mother is endangered under the provision abortions for military 
personnel and their dependents would have to be paid by the 
individual 
this unsettles a longsettled policy with regard to government 
involvement in abortions said sen gordon humphrey rnh who 
complained that the provision would make it easier for an 
individual to have a procedure that many americans find 
repugnant 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas said that if the measure 
was included in the defense bill president bush would veto the 
legislation 
on thursday the senate met the challenge from bush to save the 
b2 bomber as republicans argued that iraqs invasion of kuwait is 
a sobering reminder against wholesale cuts in military spending 
in the house meantime speaker thomas s foley dwash was 
trying to force a prerecess vote today on campaign spending 
limits but was meeting stiff opposition from colleagues who object 
to having only 90 minutes of debate 
the house also faced votes on final passage of a bill to 
strengthen oil spill liability laws and on a major civil rights 
bill 
the senate on thursday endorsed bushs b2 budget request for 
fiscal 1991 oct 1 by a 5345 margin but it also voted 972 to 
restrict use of the 46 billion earmarked for the radarevading 
plane until critical tests have been met 
earlier this week the house armed services committee dealt a 
serious blow o the embattled plane as it approved a 283 billion 
defense bill that would halt production of the batwinged planes at 
the 15 in development the president wants a 75plane fleet 
opponents of the aircraft argued that with the demise of the 
warsaw pact as a military alliance and the budget deficit 
increasing spending billions on the strategic bomber was 
questionable 
republican sen william cohen of maine proposed stalling the b2 
program at the 15 planes until the air force could certify that the 
aircraft had met certain tests 
lets fund what we have on line right now but no more b2s 
until you prove them cohen argued 
the senator cited the increasing cost of the plane which could 
skyrocket to more than 1 billion apiece and the justice 
departments recommendation that the government prohibit the 
planes manufacturer northrop corp from future defense contracts 
amid charges of fraud and mismanagement 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
conceded that the aircraft could cause sticker shock but argued 
that the changes in the soviet threat is no reason to abandon the 
b2 
these changes do not mean the millennium has arrived he 
republicans used iraqs invasion and control of kuwait to drive 
home their point that the end of the cold war in eastern europe did 
not justify deep cuts in the nations defenses 
we need a wakeup call we need to be alerted that were not 
going to be able to control the events in the world said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas 
across the capitol house speaker foley said he wanted to bring 
a pair of competing democratic campaign finance proposals along 
with a republican substitute to the floor for quick votes today 
but rep anthony beilenson dcalif and others called the plan 
for only 90 minutes of debate ridiculous and unfair 
the senate by a largely partyline 5940 vote wednesday night 
approved a democratic bill that would cap senate candidates 
campaign spending at 2 million to 10 million based on their 
states population 
the house also moved toward a vote today on a major civil rights 
bill that bush has threatened to veto because the administration 
believes it could lead to hiring quotas 
the bill advanced thursday night with approval of a cap on 
damages courts can award female victims of job discrimination 
the oil spill legislation before the house increases federal 
liability limits but still allows states to enact tougher laws the 
bill had languished for years but was given new life after the 
march 1989 exxon valdez oil spill in alaska considered the worst 
in us history 
legislation to require infants and toddlers to use child safety 
seats on airline flights cleared the senate on a voice vote late 
thursday the bill goes to the house 
the measure sponsored by sen christopher bond rmo would 
direct the federal aviation administration to require the seats on 
domestic airline flights it would be left to the faa to determine 
a height and weight limit for children needing the seats 
currently infants under 2 can fly free by traveling on the laps 
of a parent or guardian 
the airline industry and consumer safety groups support 
mandatory child restraints 
on another aviation issue the house approved a bill that would 
tax airline travelers with a passenger facilities charge at each 
airport where they embark the fees would raise 1 billion a year 
for airport improvement 
the measure which now goes to the senate was part of a 185 
billion bill twoyear funding of faa operations and airport 
development

egypt and a council representing saudi 
arabia and five other smaller arab nations today condemned iraqs 
invasion of kuwait and called on baghdad to immediately withdraw 
its troops 
in its denunciation egypt warned that the invasion could have 
dangerous consequences throughout the middle east 
the statement by the gulf cooperation council which includes 
saudi arabia bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and 
kuwait contained the first condemnation by saudi arabia which 
borders kuwait 
egypt in a statement issued by its foreign ministry spoke of 
its surprise at iraqs lightning invasion of its small persian gulf 
neighbor 
thursdays invasion came only days after egyptian president 
hosni mubarak stepped in to try to mediate the iraqkuwait dispute 
iraq allowed him to believe his efforts were succeeding 
the egyptian condemnation came as an emergency arab league 
council was preparing to reconvene in cairo to discuss the crisis 
the council at kuwaits request met thursday for six hours but 
issued no statement and adjourned its meeting for 24 hours 
on the day of the invasion the arab world was conspicuously 
silent except to warn against foreign intervention in kuwait 
egyptian government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
have said mubarak and other arab leaders were initially reluctant 
to condemn iraq because they hoped the situation could be resolved 
without the use of more force 
but their silence made it appear to the rest of the world that 
they feared the wrath of iraqi president saddam hussein if they 
speak against him 
meanwhile king hussein of jordan held talks today in baghdad 
with saddam and said upon his return that an arab summit would be 
held in saudi arabia on sunday to discuss the invasion speaking on 
staterun radio and television he did not say which leaders would 
attend 
later egypts middle east news agency quoted the kuwaiti 
minister for cabinet affairs abdelrahman elawadi as releasing a 
list of leaders who would attend saddams name was not among them 
jordan has not taken a stand on the invasion but state 
newspapers supported iraq and said the united states should not 
intervene militarily in our arab region 
the egyptian sources said neither mubarak nor king fahd of saudi 
arabia who are leading a diplomatic campaign to try to end the 
crisis believed iraqs claim that it invaded at the request of 
kuwaiti revolutionaries who had already overthrown the government 
other nations strongly condemned the invasion the united states 
and the soviet union imposed sanctions on iraq and the united 
nations demanded iraqs immediate and unconditional withdrawal from 
kuwait a call heard from many nations including china iran 
australia and algeria 
some palestinian leaders in the israelioccupied lands expressed 
support today for the invasion but others expressed fears it would 
divert attention from the palestinian struggle against israel 
libya warned that any foreign intervention would be considered 
an aggressive act 
king hussein on thursday met mubarak for five hours in the 
mediterranean port of alexandria in egypt the two conferred by 
phone with king fahd saddam and other arab leaders and with 
president bush no details of the discussion were divulged and no 
statement was issued afterward 
in saudi arabia a statement by the official saudi press agency 
said fahd was following the situation with extreme concern and that 
he was in intensive contacts seeking to calm the situation and 
restore matters to normalcy 
only salim hoss prime minister of wartorn and ineffectual 
lebanon has condemned the invasion 
the iraqikuwaiti conflict erupted july 17 when saddam accused 
his small gulf neighbor of pumping 14 billion worth of oil from 
iraqi territories he also accused kuwait and the united arab 
emirates of overproduction which had created a glut in the world 
oil market and threatened to take military action 
mubarak who has just recently cemented egypts return to the 
arab fold immediately flew to iraq kuwait and saudi arabia on 
july 25 he proudly announced that his mediation efforts had 
succeeded and that the two parties would meet in saudi arabia to 
discuss their conflict 
a meeting did take place on tuesday but the talks collapsed 
less than 48 hours later thousands of iraqi troops crossed the 
border and overran kuwait 
egypts role as political leader in the arab world was frozen 
following the late president anwar sadats 1977 trip to jerusalem 
which led to the usbrokered egyptianisraeli peace treaty in 
1979 
since becoming president in 1981 mubarak has worked hard to 
restore his countrys status in the arab world jordan was the 
first of the arab nations to resume diplomatic ties with cairo in 
1984 and today egypt boasts close relations with all countries 
including hardliners syria and libya

the united states today alerted its 
nato allies that it has prepared contingency plans in case iraqi 
troops push beyond kuwaiti territory an alliance source said 
the united states informed the allies that it was aware that 
iraq may have designs beyond kuwait and informed the allies that it 
has drawn up contingency plans of action to respond to that 
eventuality said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said american officials did not explain what actions were 
under consideration 
they made their remarks during a special meeting of the 
political committee of the north atlantic treaty organization 
which is made up of top officials from each of the alliances 16 
member nations 
during the meeting he said the allies expressed very strongly 
broad support for moving toward some coordinated action through 
the united nations there was a sense he said that the allies 
were prepared to move quickly 
natos political committee which meets regularly held a 
special meeting on thursday to discuss the iraqi invasion and was 
expected to do so again on monday 
at the thursday meeting the united states urged the allies to 
begin a commerical embargo including arms shipments and to freeze 
iraqi assets and take measures to prevent baghdad from taking 
kuwaiti assets sources said 
on friday the allies reviewed what action their governments had 
taken to protest iraqs aggression against its persian gulf 
neighbor said the nato source some had moved to freeze kuwaiti 
assets but most were not yet prepared to join in a broader trade 
embargo said the source 
those nations which are members of the european community were 
waiting to see what joint action might be recommended by the 
trading bloc 
eleven of the communitys 12 members belong to nato only 
neutral ireland remains outside

swift action to freeze kuwaiti assets 
overseas after iraqs invasion of its oilrich neighbor will 
prevent strongman saddam hussein from reaping immediate economic 
benefits 
if western nations also take additional moves to cut iraqs oil 
lifeline baghdads already strapped economy will be dealt a harsh 
blow 
the united states took the lead by freezing billions of dollars 
of kuwaiti and iraqi assets banning imports of iraqi oil and 
imposing other trade sanctions oil accounts for 97 percent of 
iraqs exports to the united states 
kuwait had about 42 billion invested in the united states at 
the end of 1989 and iraq had almost nothing invested according to 
the us department of commerce 
britain and france froze kuwaiti assets to keep the countrys 
new iraqiinstalled government from seizing them japan west 
germany italy belgium and luxembourg have announced plans to do 
so 
the netherlands was considering an assets freeze but there were 
no immediate indications whether the dutch were prepared to bar 
iraqi oil from the major european port of rotterdam a potentially 
crippling blow 
senior officials from the 12 european community nations were to 
meet in rome on saturday to discuss economic and other sanctions 
against iraq an ec source said friday 
but so far only the us and french governments have blocked 
iraqs assets in their countries and the united states has been 
the only country to move firmly against iraqs oil 
analysts stress that speed was essential in any successful move 
to prevent kuwaits 100 billion of assets overseas from getting 
into the hands of the new kuwaiti government 
the priority today is to freeze kuwaiti assets said andrew 
cunningham associate editor at the nicosiabased middle east 
economic survey 
if you dont do it now theyll get the assets he said 
in contrast the united states and its allies have slightly more 
time at their disposal to shape a collective policy to isolate 
iraqs own economy 
iraq is in an extremely vulnerable position cunningham 
said adding that baghdad relies significantly on western credits 
but oil is the main thing 
iraq uses three export routes for its oil pipelines across 
saudi arabia and turkey and the persian gulf sea outlet the 
pipelines were built during the eightyear iraniraq war when 
baghdads traditional oil route through the gulf was repeatedly 
attacked by iran 
after the war saddam hoped to found an ambitious reconstruction 
program on oil income but sagging oil prices undermined recovery 
efforts 
the uncertainties after saddams invasion of kuwait are pushing 
up oil prices but with a big question mark over his ability to 
sell it this may not be a benefit 
it was unclear whether the invasion would slow or halt kuwaits 
oil production iraqi control of kuwaits 94 billion barrels of 
crude oil reserves added to baghdads own 100 billion will be of 
little use to the iraqis if they cannot market their oil 
the war with iran left saddam a foreign debt from 60 billion to 
70 billion including about 30 billion to kuwait saudi arabia 
and other oilrich arab countries that helped finance his war 
a desire to erase part of the debt burden was one reason behind 
saddams sudden invasion 
iraq is saddled with overcentralized state industries and an 
annual inflation rate conservatively estimated at 15 percent 
despite saddams attempts to revitalize the economy by selling 
off 22 billion worth of public companies to private individuals 
and removing some price controls the recovery has been anemic 
using fear as a weapon to push for efficiency saddam has fired 
state officials for inefficiency or corruption but the hopedfor 
economic boom did not materialize 
iraq also announced plans to slash public expenditure and it 
discharged more than 200000 soldiers from the army although with 
the remobilization in the wake of the invasion this saving will be 
eliminated 
iraq relies significantly on financial credits from the west 
baghdad responded to the us sanctions by freezing repayment of 
24 billion in iraqi debts to the united states a move it is 
certain to duplicate against any other countries that block iraqi 
credits 
suspending repayments helps iraq in the short term but in the 
long run cunningham said they have been a net receiver of funds 
not a net payer so the cutoff is sure to hurt 
in addition key western technicians and consultants are likely 
to be ordered out of iraq further crippling the economy

iraq will suffer little from president bushs 
order freezing its us assets but the freeze on kuwaits us 
investments should prevent iraq from looting them government 
officials and private analysts say 
bushs response to the iraqi invasion of kuwait also included a 
trade embargo against iraq that shuts off the source of more than 
7 percent of us oil imports while blocking exports primarily 
food to a 1 billionayear trading partner 
the embargo prompted the customs service to seize more than 13 
million gallons of iraqi crude oil after it was unloaded from a 
tanker in international waters off texas customs spokeswoman 
sharon goodson 
the asset freeze announced thursday will be implemented by the 
treasury department which spent much of the day trying to identify 
kuwaiti and iraqi assets in the united states or under us control 
abroad department officials said they received hundreds of calls 
from financial and business concerns likely to be affected by the 
asset freeze and trade embargo 
the latest government figures supported speculation by private 
analysts that kuwaits us holdings are extensive iraqs slim 
commerce department figures show 42 billion in kuwaiti direct 
investment in the united states at the end of last year the 
comparable figure for iraq was essentially nothing 
direct investment includes real property and stock holdings of 
more than 10 percent of a corporations shares but excludes 
smaller stock holdings bank deposits and holdings of government 
bonds 
in march us banks reported 125 billion in holdings 
including us government bonds of eight oilproducing middle 
eastern countries lumped together in government statistics 
this is not going to be anything more than a minor financial 
burden on the iraqis said stephen d cohen an international 
economist who lectures at the american university school of 
international service 
once kuwaits us assets are frozen iraq will be unable to 
draw cash from or sell them even if it gains control of kuwaits 
central bank and other financial institutions administration 
officials said 
a handful of analysts contacted thursday said it was unlikely 
iraq would attempt to dip into kuwaiti assets 
i dont think the iraqis are trying to kidnap the kuwaiti 
treasury said cohen 
while it appears to have few holdings in the united states iraq 
owes the us government 224 billion according to treasury 
department figures iraq responded to the us announcement by 
freezing repayment of that debt to the united states the official 
iraqi news agency reported 
private analysts said any successful effort to pressure iraq 
with economic sanctions would depend on cooperation from allies in 
europe where the oilproducing nations of the middle east make 
most of their foreign investments 
ralph c bryant a former federal reserve official now with the 
brookings institution said any extended attempt to impose an asset 
freeze might bring legal cases because of murky laws on whether the 
united states can prevent overseas branches of us banks from 
releasing deposits to their owners 
bushs decision to impose a trade embargo put iraq in the 
company of south africa libya cuba vietnam north korea and 
cambodia among nations under some form of us trade sanctions 
us imports from iraq totaled 24 billion in 1989 23 
billion of that in crude oil at 450000 barrels a day in the first 
five months of 1990 the total was more than 600000 barrels a day 
us exports to iraq totaled 11 billion in 1989 mostly wheat 
rice and other agricultural products

the professional golfers association 
tour reacting to threats of protest and sponsor pullouts at the 
pga championship said today it will prohibit tournaments at clubs 
where membership even raises a question of discrimination 
the policy would affect tournaments on the pga tour the senior

concerning the national championship which starts thursday and 
its site the previously allwhite shoal creek country club in 
birmingham ala 
bowing to pressure from civil rights groups and planned 
demonstrations shoal creek awarded honorary membership to a black

north korea upset by rival south 
koreas moves to improve ties with the soviet union indicated 
friday it might boycott historic talks between the two koreas 
prime ministers 
a south korean government delegation is in moscow discussing 
issues that seoul officials say include economic cooperation and 
establishing diplomatic ties 
north koreas official communist party newspaper rodong sinmun 
hinted at the possibility of a boycott of the prime ministers 
talks in a commentary carried by the korean central news agency and 
monitored in tokyo 
the newspaper denounced the south korean delegations visit to 
moscow as a divisive act going against the desire for 
reunification 
it said if seoul and moscow open formal relations it would 
perpetuate the division of the korean peninsula bitterly divided 
since 1945 
the soviet union is a close ally and arms provider for north 
korea 
in an unprecedented move last month the rival korean states 
signed an accord setting up the first talks between their prime 
ministers 
the first meeting is to be held in seoul beginning sept 4 and 
the second is scheduled beginning oct 16 in north koreas capital 
of pyongyang 
before signing the agreement north koreas chief delegate paik 
nam jun issued a veiled warning that any attempt by seoul to 
improve ties with moscow would hurt the prime ministers talks 
the seoul government believes expanded ties with communist 
nations will help open north koreas closed society and thus ease 
tension on the peninsula 
south korea has made great strides in improving ties with 
socialist countries since the 1988 olympics in seoul it has opened 
formal relations with all east european nations except albania and 
east germany 
north korea also charged that the seoul government is trying to 
disrupt a unification rally to be held with south korean dissidents 
at the border village of panmunjom on aug 15 
in seoul about 1500 radical students and dissidents held a 
demonstration pledging support for the aug 15 rally they called 
for an end to the us military presence in south korea and the 
signing of a peace treaty to replace an armistice agreement that 
ended the 195053 korean war 
the protesters said the stationing of 43000 us troops in 
south korea under a mutual defense treaty hurts efforts to unify 
the peninsula 
they also demanded efforts by the two korean governments to open 
their border and allow free travel for the 62 million people on the 
two sides 
south korea has proposed a trial fiveday border opening in 
midaugust for unrestricted free travel north korea has in effect 
rejected the suggestion

leaders of both germanys on friday urged 
joint elections two months earlier than planned and the countries 
agreed to make berlin their united capital 
the early election plan ran into immediate objections from the 
leftist social democrats who form part of the east german 
coalition government but are the opposition in west germany 
the soviets said it could disrupt international talks on german 
unification 
east germanys prime minister lothar de maiziere made the 
proposal to advance allgerman elections from dec 2 to oct 14 
west german chancellor helmut kohl welcomed it saying the 
earlier vote corresponds with the wishes of the people in east 
germany and also in west germany kohls comments came in a 
statement released by his office in bonn he was on vacation in 
austria 
under pressure for early unification de maiziere said he sought 
unity that was as quick as possible but as good as needed and 
hoped early elections would improve the climate for investment 
he said the allgerman elections should create political 
clarity and with that also economic security 
the dec 2 date was informally approved by political groups in 
both germanys and it may take complicated parliamentary 
maneuvering to move up the vote 
social democrats in both germanys immediately criticized the 
proposal oskar lafontaine the social democrats challenger to 
kohl in the upcoming election called the latest proposal a 
transparent manipulation attempt for kohl and de maiziere to 
quickly capitalize on their popularity 
he said the proposal for earlier elections breached an agreement 
that was reached with the social democrats on a dec 2 election 
date 
the east german social democrats de maizieres coalition 
partners accused the prime minister of election fraud and 
trying to improve the chances of the christian democrats both de 
maizieres and kohls party 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitsky said 
the call for early elections was an unexpected turn that could 
disrupt international talks on german unity the soviet union has 
been east germanys largest military and trading partner 
the decision on making berlin the new capital came as 
negotiators for the two germanys ironed out remaining points of 
joining the two countries 
the announcement in east berlin left open the question of 
whether all government offices would move there 
the capital of germany is berlin the question of the seat of 
government will be settled after unification the statement said 
the terse declaration which is expected to win easy approval in 
both countries parliaments is unlikely to calm the storm 
surrounding the capital 
east germans joined by the west berlin goverment are demanding 
the entire government return to the historic capital of germany and 
prussia 
others object with some saying that berlins shameful 12year 
tenure as the seat of nazi tyranny tainted the city in the worlds 
eyes 
currently east berlin is the capital of east germany and bonn 
is west germanys capital 
in another development west germanys defense minister said 
west german officers will run what is now the east german military 
after unification 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said west german officers 
would take charge of east german units in a unified army he also 
said the future army will be made up of 320000 of the current west 
german armed forces with 50000 from the east german military 
kohl had said the combined german armed forces would be at 
370000 he made the comment during a meeting with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in southern russia last month 
de maizieres appeal came just one day after the two germanys 
signed a treaty for the first elections in a unified germany in 
nearly 60 years 
pressure for quicker unification has been building as east 
germany makes the difficult transition from communism to capitalism 
the shift from a centrally planned economy to the free market 
has already put more than 250000 east germans out of work experts 
say 3 million could be left jobless as companies and factories are 
unable to compete in the new market now that they are losing state 
subsidies 
de maiziere said the allgerman vote should coincide with east 
german elections that will create five state governments to mirror 
west germanys federal system according to law those states can 
then immediately seek unity with west germany 
the allgerman vote will be the first ballot in a united germany 
since march 1933 when adolf hitlers national socialists won a 
plurality of seats in the reichstag

after watching a sexually explicit movie 
in court a jury agreed that the xrated spermbusters may be 
pornographic but its not obscene 
walter m epler a clerk at pussy cat adult bookstore in largo 
was acquitted thursday on a misdemeanor charge of distributing 
obscene material he was charged after renting a spermbusters 
videotape to an undercover sheriffs detective 
its wasting tax dollars to be trying to persecute this type 
of movie said stephen bennett a computer consultant who served 
as foreman of the sixmember pinellas county court jury 
epler was one of 15 people arrested last month in pinellas 
county sheriff everett rices crackdown on xrated videos during 
which deputies also seized 39 videotapes from several adult 
bookstores 
he was the first to be tried 
epler did not dispute renting the film to the detective so the 
case centered on whether spermbusters was obscene 
defense attorney frank de la grana called it an average 
allamerican xrated film 
you are a barometer for this community de la grana told the 
jury of three men and three women the panel included a banker an 
electrician an assembly worker a factory foreman and an analyst 
the jurors who ranged in age from 29 to 50 all said they had 
seen xrated films before 
the movie was billed as a parody of the hit ghostbusters 
although the connection was obscure many scenes featured sexual 
intercourse and male and female genitalia 
i realized why we had to view it but its not something that 
you expect when you come in to do jury duty said bennett 
prosecutors argued that spermbusters fit the us supreme 
courts threepart test for obscene material by appealing to 
prurient interests depicting sex in a patently offensive way and 
lacking any serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value 
art come on ladies and gentlemen said assistant state 
attorney joe mueller was there even a plot 
but de la grana said the availability and demand for such movies 
in the western florida county was one way of measuring contemporary 
community standards the supreme court has held that such standards 
should apply in judging offensiveness 
bennett said jurors did not consider the film art and were 
divided over whether it appealed to purient interests defined as a 
shameful or morbid interest in sex 
but they agreed the movie was not patently offensive he said 
such a description fits depictions of child pornography bestiality 
or sadomasochism 
i do agree there is some limit he said but i dont think 
this film went beyond that limit

economic weakness the market was hit with more bad economic news

219000 in july surprising analysts who had been looking for a 
modest increase the civilian unemployment rate jumped threetenths

but market participants had their eye on iraq concerned that 
while kuwaits oil reserves may not be critical to world supplies 
further moves by iraq could threaten oil from saudi arabia and 
other nations 
the real concern is how far will iraq go in the middle east 
ackerman said theres an absence of superpower intervention 
obviously theres a lot of nervousness worldwide 
the dow industrials fell 3466 points thursday on fears that a 
possible disruption of oil supplies could spark inflation and

sweaters made of manmade fibers in south 
korea are being sold in the united states at less than fair market 
value the commerce department said friday 
the finding clears the way for the international trade 
commission to consider whether to impose import duties that would 
bring prices for the cutrate sweaters into line with americanmade 
garments 
the national knitwear amp sportswear association in new york had 
filed complaints last september against sweater manufacturers in 
south korea hong kong and taiwan 
the department ruled on july 21 that sweaters from hong kong 
were being dumped in the united states it is scheduled to rule 
aug 17 on the imports from taiwan 
if the itc finds the south korean products are harming us 
industry the government can impose duties on the imports to make 
their prices comparable with those of us companies 
the department said imports represent 72 percent of the 13 
billion us sweater market and the three countries represent 55 
percent of the imports it said the value of the sweaters imported 
from south korea in 1989 was 4761 million from hong kong 2088

the house approved a landmark civil rights 
bill today brushing off a lastminute veto threat by president 
bush who contends the minorityhiring provisions in the 
legislation would lead to quotas 
stand up for what you know is right stand up for americas 
values rep richard gephardt dmo urged as the house approved 
the bill 272154 
the measure goes to a housesenate conference committee where 
prospects for compromise appear good the senate two weeks ago 
approved a version similar in all but a few features 
approval came minutes after release of a letter from bush 
threatening a veto and offering to sign an alternative version that 
he called a sound practical compromise 
he said that without changes the bill will have the effect of 
forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion 
it will also foster divisiveness and litigation rather than 
conciliation and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights 
bush said 
the alternative was rejected however as the house pressed 
ahead with the measure that would effectively overturn five supreme 
court decisions last year and that tops the civil rights 
communitys congressional list 
major provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to barriers to reopening courtapproved fairhiring 
agreements 
the alternative version proposed by rep john lafalce dny 
and praised by bush would have tempered language designed to make 
it easier to win job bias suits against employers based on 
statistics 
it also would have capped at 100000 punitive damages for 
intentional discrimination that courts could award to women 
religious minorities and the disabled the bill places no limit on 
such damages 
the lafalce plan represented the major effort of critics to 
change the bill it was rejected 238188 
lawmakers spoke of fierce lastminute lobbying on the plan 
the pressures have been enormous the intimidation has belied 
the vision and hope of civil rights but in the end it is my face 
in that mirror said rep nancy johnson rconn a supporter of 
lafalce 
democrats were harshly critical of the amendment 
it rips the heart out said judiciary chairman jack brooks 
dtexas we need some truth in labeling around here you cant 
just slap on the label civil rights 
the bills chief house sponsor said thursday night it was 
strengthened against the alternative version after supporters 
adopted their own version of cap on damages for women religious 
minorities and the disabled 
the southern democrats voted with us on this cap and most of 
them will now be with us so i think well have a whopping good 
vote said rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the 
education and labor committee 
the cap approved 289134 would limit punitive damages for 
women who are victims of intentional job discrimination to 150000 
or the amount of compensatory damages whichever is larger 
womens rights groups say there should be no cap because 
unlimited punitive damages are allowed in cases of racial 
discrimination 
sponsors supported a similar cap when the senate passed the 
measure but were outmaneuvered doing the job in the house was 
regarded as crucial to the longrun efforts of sponsors to send the 
bill to bush 
in the short run hawkins said the buttressing of southern 
democratic support cleared the way for defeat of the lafalce 
amendment 
the lafalce plan was similar to a proposal sponsored in the 
senate by sen nancy kassebaum rkan but which never was brought 
to a vote

the soviet union and the united states today 
demanded that all countries cut off arms supplies to iraq because 
of its invasion of kuwait and the soviet foreign minister 
predicted iraq would soon withdraw from kuwait 
the minister eduard shevardnadze and secretary of state james 
a baker iii read a joint statement demanding the arms cutoff to 
reporters after a hastily scheduled onehour meeting at a moscow 
airport 
the ussoviet statement a rare case of superpower cooperation 
in pursuit of peace noted that the soviet union had cut off arms 
supplies to iraq on thursday and that united states had frozen 
iraqi assets the two superpowers also demanded in the statement 
that iraq withdraw its troops from kuwait 
shevardnadze also told reporters we have been assured that 
very soon the iraqis will pull out their troops he said the 
soviets until this week iraqs largest arms supplier learned this 
through contacts in baghdad 
after iraq overran kuwait thursday ostensibly because a dispute 
over oil and a border region it said its forces could withdraw 
within a week or two but fighting continued today in kuwait 
especially in oil fields near the border with saudi arabia 
prompting fears that iraq would expand its invasion 
shevardnadze said the soviet leadership had sent a message to 
iraqi leader saddam hussein on thursday but he did not reveal the 
contents 
the ussoviet statement demanded that other countries stop 
sending arms to iraq but it did not mention by name the middle 
east nations other major weapons suppliers 
shevardnadze opened the news conference by saying the kremlins 
decision to cut off its arms supplies to iraq was difficult it 
wasnt so easy for us to make the kind of statement we made 
yesterday because soviet relations with iraq had been good for 
decades he said 
shevardnadze said the invasion contradicts the principles of 
new political thinking and the principles of civilized relations 
between nations 
a report on soviet tv news said the statement contains an 
appeal to the international public to come out together in 
condemnation of the act of aggression washington and moscow have 
condemned the invasion on their own 
bakers plane arrived in moscow from mongolia today more than an 
hour late because a tire blew when it landed for refueling in the 
siberian city of irkutsk baker cut short his state visit to 
mongolia for the moscow talks 
before leaving the mongolian capital of ulan bator baker told 
reporters i just hope that the united states and soviet union 
could join in a joint statement regarding this matter the fact i 
think of our doing that would be quite unique and rather 
significant 
in mongolia baker said the united states is offering that 
communist country 11 million and special trade status to help 
transform the economy into a democratic freemarket system 
baker completed the official portion of his trip a sign of the 
united states interest in promoting ties with the longtime soviet 
satellite before leaving ahead of schedule to stop in moscow he 
had planned to spend the weekend hunting and fishing in mongolias 
gobi desert 
bakers visit to mongolia was the first by a top us official 
since vice president henry wallace came in 1944

iraqi capital baghdad that iraqi troops would soon withdraw from

in washington the state department said iraqi troops were 
within 5 to 10 miles of the saudi border the department also said 
14 americans are now known to be missing in kuwait and washington

statement issued in moscow demanded an international cutoff of 
arms supplies to iraq and pressed for an early iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait

today followed the superpowers in announcing measures aimed at 
pressuring iraq to withdraw from kuwait egypt joined in the 
condemnation 
in other developments 
a missile landed on saudi territory near the convergence of the 
saudi iraqi and kuwaiti borders diplomats in saudi arabia said 
no injuries or damage were reported 
fourteen american oil workers were missing in the wake of the 
invasion state department spokesman richard boucher said the us 
embassy in baghdad has pressed the foreign ministry to account for 
them on an immediate basis but so far iraq had not responded 
jordans king hussein said an arab summit would be held in 
saudi arabia on sunday to discuss the crisis

superpower cooperation issued a joint statement in moscow calling 
for all nations to stop shipping arms to iraq and pressing for a

shevardnadze predicted that withdrawal would occur soon 
iraqi troops backed by 350 tanks and air cover swept into kuwait 
before dawn thursday and penetrated as far as kuwaits southern oil 
fields near the border with saudi arabia the worlds biggest 
producer of oil 
a wellinformed diplomatic source said there had been no 
movement of iraqi troops across the saudi frontier today but some 
members of congress expressed fears thursday that saudi arabia 
could be the next target of iraqs president saddam hussein 
the state department said today iraqi troops were within five to 
10 miles of the saudi border their presence there clearly raises 
significant concern said boucher 
the nato source speaking in brussels on condition of anonymity 
said the united states informed allies during a special meeting 
that it was aware that iraq may have designs beyond kuwait and 
informed the allies that it has drawn up contingency plans of 
action to respond to that eventuality he said american officials 
did not explain what actions were under consideration 
details of the situation in kuwait an oilrich sheikdom on the 
persian gulf were hard to come by telephone operators in bahrain 
said it appeared phone lines were cut this afternoon

impassable said a british embassy official reached by telephone 
in the morning 
diplomats said shelling was heard through the night at the 
countrys main military barracks in shuwaikh in the northern part 
of kuwait city 
residents woke to what one described as as very active 
gunshots and louder explosions than at any time since the 
invasion there was also shelling on the coast 16 miles from 
shuwaikh and two military vehicles were on fire said residents 
reached by telephone 
the british embassy official quoted by the british news agency 
press association reported explosions and gunfire along the 
seafront and around key installations including the emirs palace 
the reports indicated stiffer resistance than on the first day 
of the invasion when iraqi quickly soldiers seized all government 
buildings in kuwait city 
however kuwaits entire military has about 20300 soldiers 
most of whom have never seen combat iraqs armed forces number 1 
million and are battledhardened after eight years of war with iran 
iraqi president saddam hussein invaded kuwait after two weeks of 
threats stemming from a dispute over oil and land saddam accused 
kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides 
claim he also blamed kuwait for a drop in world oil prices saying 
it cheated on opec production levels oil is iraqs main revenue 
source and the invasion could double iraqs oil supplies 
within hours of the assault kuwaits ruler sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah had fled his palace reportedly for saudi arabia 
despite seemingly impossible odds the sheiks government vowed 
to fight to win back the country his radio station beaming from 
an unknown location appealed for help from the arab world 
in a break with its major arab neighbors who remained 
conspicuously silent egypt today strongly condemned the invasion 
and called for the immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops 
the official iraq news agency today said massive

from the governments emiri guard

officials refused to identify the company 
there are about 3000 americans living in kuwait where an 
estimated 60 percent of the 19 million people are foreigners most 
of the americans work in the oil business

iraqikuwaiti dispute collapsed it drew immediate worldwide 
condemnation and harsh sanctions

weapons sales to baghdad bush froze iraqi assets and blocked most 
iraqi imports including the allimportant oil he also froze

the white house today pressed iraq for 
information about americans missing in kuwait and said iraqs 
ruthlessness and disregard for international law raised serious 
concerns that its conquering troops might move next into saudi 
arabia 
we are extremely concerned about the possibility of iraq 
broadening its invasions plans to any other country they are 
close enough to the saudi border to indicate cause for concern but 
we dont know what their intentions or motives are white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
on capitol hill rep les aspin chairman of the hous armed 
services committee said that since thursdays invasion iraq has 
moved two additional military units from their positions along the 
iranian border to the staging area near the junction of kuwait 
iraq and saudi arabia 
i think it means war if iraqi forces cross into saudi 
arabia aspin said i say that not as a threat but as a 
prediction the world cannot sit back and watch a person like 
saddam hussein take over half of the oil reserves in the world 
the united states informed western allies today that it did not 
rule out military action should iraqi troops push beyond kuwaiti 
territory fitzwater told reporters 
president bush spent 75 minutes this morning with top advisers 
reviewing intelligence on the tense situation in the middle east 
and the progress in implementing us economic sanctions against 
iraq including a trade embargo that already had led to the seizure 
of iraqi crude oil fitzwater said 
also discussed was the potential impact of the sanctions on us 
oil supplies and prices with a consensus emerging that the harm 
would be moderate or slight fitzwater said 
the immediate efforts were aimed at a diplomatic solution to the 
crisis but fitzwater said there was no indication iraq planned to 
heed international demands that it withdraw from kuwait 
at this point we have received only scorn from iraq and no 
indication that they intend to comply fitzwater said 
the state department today said 14 americans were missing in 
kuwait and believed to be held by iraqi troops 
spokesman richard boucher said some iraqi forces were positioned 
5 miles to 10 miles from the saudi border saudi diplomats also 
reported a missile landing in the border area but reported no 
injuries 
as tensions rose in the troubled region the state department 
advised the 3000 americans in kuwait and the 500 in iraq to leave 
as quickly as possible in kuwait however airports and ports are 
closed 
fitzwater said the us ambassador to the united nations thomas 
pickering was pushing for un sanctions against iraq that include 
the full range of action by air sea or land forces that may be 
necessary to maintain or restore international peace or security 
including blockade 
fitzwater said the administration had demanded from the iraqi 
ambassador to the united states a full and immediate accounting of 
american citizens missing in kuwait 
in moscow where the united states and the soviet union issued a 
rare joint statement condemning the invasion soviet officials 
predicted iraq would soon withdraw its troops 
fitzwater was not as optimistic 
clearly the actions of iraq at this point indicate a 
ruthlessness and disregard for international law that must make us 
concerned about all the other countries in the region and their 
security the white house spokesman said 
as bush mulled his options an irate congress pressed for a 
worldwide embargo on iraqi oil and some members worried aloud about 
the potential for iraqi leader hussein to strike against other 
oilproducing nations 
if theres an intention of iraq to overrun saudi arabia then 
i think this would call for a direct military response by the 
united states western europe maybe even the soviet union house 
speaker thomas s foley said today on nbc this would be an 
action that could not be ignored 
bushs immediate military options are considered limited because 
us forces in the area lack sufficient attack power to mount a 
formidable challenge to the battletested iraqis 
one aircraft carrier the uss independence was ordered thursday 
to head to the persian gulf to add firepower to the us presence 
but was said to be several days away the pentagon today said 
another carrier the uss saratoga and the assault ship uss inchon 
were to head for the mediterranean within the next few days for 
deployments the defense department said had been planned for months 
the administration also dispatched an embassy official in 
baghdad to iraqs foreign ministry to ask about the americans 
missing since wednesday the state department said the official 
would remind them of their commitment to safeguard american 
lives 
the president warned thursday that any harm to american citizens 
would drastically change the us posture toward iraq which 
continued today to consolidated its control over the oilrich 
kuwait emirate 
iraqs invasion was a dash of cold water to international 
diplomats still basking in the end of the cold war no superpower 
appeared to be influencing iraq today secretary of state james a 
baker iii was in moscow for the unusual joint ussoviet 
declaration against the invasion 
bush said he hoped an international effort could persuade saddam 
to restore kuwaits autonomy 
were not ruling any options in but were not ruling any 
options out the president said thursday when asked whether he 
was ready to use military might to force a withdrawal of the iraqi 
invasion that sent worldwide oil prices upward 
bush spoke by telephone with saudi arabias king fahd and 
fitzwater said they agreed that the attack on kuwait was 
absolutely unacceptable 
pentagon officials said it would take at least several weeks to 
deploy a signifcant counterforce 
the aircraft carrier independence with jet fighters attack 
aircraft and bombers aboard and six escort ships were dispatched 
to the persian gulf from the indian ocean a journey of several 
thousand miles the navy already has eight warships in the gulf 
but they lack attack and bomber aircraft and pose no significant 
threat to the iraqi force 
the saratoga based in florida was to head for the 
mediterranean on tuesday the inchon now at norfolk va carries 
a marine amphibious assault group and is due to leave for the 
mediterranean on monday the pentagon said although said to be 
routine those deployments would significantly add to the us 
forces in the area 
bush returned after midnight from a visit to colorado where he 
met with british prime minister margaret thatcher both leaders 
pressed for worldwide sanctions against iraq bush dropped plans 
for a weekend at camp david returning instead to the white house 
the congress moved quickly to support bushs economic sanctions 
even as some members doubted they would deter hussein 
the senate in a 970 vote endorsing sanctions urged bush to 
help organize an international economic boycott the house voted 
4160 to cut off iraqs 200 million a year in exportimport bank 
credits and tighten restrictions on us exports with possible 
military applications 
the presidents order froze all iraqi assets and banned nearly 
all commerce including the 588000 barrels of iraqi oil purchased 
daily by the united states the impact was felt immediately as the 
customs service seized more than 13 million gallons of iraqi crude 
off the coast of texas 
iraq swiftly retaliated saying it would suspend payments on its 
24 billion debt to the united states 
the united states gets half of its oil from abroad and 10 
percent from iraq and kuwait america imported about 24 billion 
in oil and other goods last year from iraq us exports to iraq 
chiefly agricultural commodities totaled 117 billion in 1989

the iraqi invasion of kuwait created new 
worries friday for the families of americans held hostage in 
lebanon because of a complicated link between the captives and a 
group of kuwaiti prisoners 
what has always frustrated the families is that anything that 
happens in the middle east has a ripple effect said peggy say 
the sister of terry anderson the longest held of the six us 
hostages in lebanon 
say and others said they are concerned because the fate of 15 
prisoners in kuwait the socalled dawa prisoners are connected 
to american hostages in lebanon 
experts say that imad mugniyeh a moslem shiite accused of 
masterminding american kidnappings in lebanon is the 
brotherinlaw of mustafa yousef badreddin one of the prisoners in 
kuwait 
badreddin and 14 others are serving life sentences in kuwait for 
the 1983 bombings of the us and french embassies in kuwait 
mugniyeh who operates under cover of the shadowy islamic jihad 
movement has insisted the american hostages in lebanon will not be 
freed until the kuwaiti prisoners are released 
the status of the kuwaiti prisoners was unclear after iraqi 
troops overran the oilrich emirate but one report said the 
prisoners had been taken to baghdad the capital of iraq according 
to shireen hunter a middle east expert at the center for strategic 
and international studies 
the state department said it could not confirm the report 
we dont want to speculate on where the prisoners are said 
joe reap a department spokesman we have no idea what effect 
this might have on the hostages in lebanon he said 
its a crapshoot said bill foley who works with the 
journalists committee to free terry anderson a group formed to 
seek freedom for anderson and the others anderson who was seized 
in march 1985 is a correspondent for the associated press 
but hunter said moving the prisoners to baghdad would 
complicate the situation even more because the prisoners are no 
friends of iraqi president saddam hussein 
if any harm came to the kuwaiti prisoners the fear is that 
islamic jihad might retaliate against the americans on the other 
hand hunter said removing the kuwaiti prisoners from kuwait might 
actually bode well for the hosages 
the prisoners are thought to be proiranian even though 12 of 
them are iraqis who belong to the fundamentalist shiite dawa 
islamiya movement the other three including badreddin are 
lebanese 
the volatile nature of politics in the middle east is upsetting 
to families of the us hostages because it keeps them on emotional 
tenterhooks say said the iraqi invasion is just another example

a 65yearold epileptic man stranded in 
the arizona desert survived for nearly three days by eating cactus 
and crawling in search of shade his daughterinlaw said 
manuel cantu of wittmann became so desperate that he tried to 
blow up his disabled car with a gunshot to the gas tank in hopes 
someone would see the fire said diane cantu 
cantu who was reported missing monday was rescued thursday 
after a rancher heard his call for help on a citizens band radio a 
spokesman for the maricopa county sheriffs office said 
he was treated for dehydration and sunburn at phoenix general 
hospital and medical center but was in good condition friday

since march physicians throughout texas 
have reported 149 cases of a mysterious new illness called 
palestine syndrome the malady mostly strikes children and is 
characterized by high fever and temporary arthritis 
dr jeffrey w jundt a physician at scott and white memorial 
hospital who first identified the illness said thursday that 
experts still know little of its origins and are uncertain of how 
or if it can be prevented or cured 
it has not been fatal and victims recover completely jundt 
said but some patients have been hospitalized as long as six 
months 
we have no idea whether its increasing but were not being 
swamped with cases said jeffrey taylor with the texas department 
of health there are some new ones that have onset in july and 
we are following up on those 
the illness was named after a town about midway between dallas 
and houston where it was first encountered last march 
although the ailment is named for palestine so far only four 
confirmed cases have come from there taylor said cases have been 
identified in 34 texas counties most in the north central and 
eastern sections of the state 
scott and white hospital spokeswoman charlene lee said the 
hospital has received inquiries about palestine syndrome from other 
sections of the country the federal centers for disease control 
are investigating but there is no nationwide accounting of how 
many people have the illness 
jundt prefers to call palestine fever the star complex an 
acronym for its major symptoms sore throat temperature greater 
than 100 degrees for seven days arthritis in three different 
joints and a hivelike rash 
symptoms have been reported in 149 people including three 
adults of those 54 cases have been confirmed and 25 of them have 
been recommended for aggressive blood sample studies by the state 
health department and the cdc 
most of the confirmed cases have been in children under age 15 
but some have been in women in their 20s and 30s so far no cases 
have been confirmed in adult males 
the illness does not appear to be contagious 
doctors are testing bodily secretions including saliva urine 
and nasal secretions taken from the 25 patients in hopes of 
isolating viral particles that could help identify other viruses 
that might be associated with the syndrome 
five of the 25 patients in the survey group tested positive for 
the rubella virus and two were positive for parvo virus which is 
commonly associated with puppies but causes arthritis jundt said 
like the progression of the syndrome itself the recovery period 
is variable he said once the virus runs its course recurrent 
episodes are considered unlikely although there have been 
exceptions

norwegian troops watched soviet soldiers 
march across the heavilyguarded frontier into this natocountry 
friday but the only shots fired by either side were at a soccer 
goal 
in the spirit of glasnost the norwegians invited the soviets to 
cross the border closed to them for 46 years for a friendly 
soccer game in the arctic border village of kirkenes norway not a 
goal was scored in the match 
we wanted to ease the tension a little bit said norwegian 
border commissioner hugo overgaard 
the opposing soldiers mainly young conscripts usually scowl 
and grab for weapons upon sighting each other anywhere along the 
120mile fenced frontier in the far north 
this summer was marked by border incidents including soviet 
troops chasing and shooting at fishermen in norwegian territory 
the tensions seemed to fade when the uniformed soldiers met on 
the border slapped each others backs and exchanged smiles and 
addresses reported the norwegian news agency ntb 
this is the high point of my military service said border 
guard igor gerasimov one of 11 soviet players i hope the border 
can be even more open in the future he told ntb 
the norwegian and soviet troops marched into kirkenes a 15 
minute walk from the border to look around before the game 
its small but interesting said gerasimov there are so 
many products for sale the 19yearold soldier returned to base 
with the other soviets after the game 
everything went great to be honest the thing i worried most 
about was the games final score something like 90 would have 
been terrible the border commissioner said the game ended in a 
perfect zerozero tie he said 
the game wont change much on the border however he said 
the soldiers still wont be allowed to talk or wave at each 
other overgaard said but they can smile

aardu the wallaby on the lam for 11 
days was back in his cage at the stone zoo on friday after 
zookeepers lured him home with a hint of female companionship 
zoo officials found aardu at about 730 am trapped in a cage 
in a nearby wooded area that they had baited with straw carrying 
the scent of female wallabies back at the zoo the small cousin of 
the kangaroo was sound asleep when about 20 reporters appeared at 
his cage for a news conference 
i think he had a lot of food but he certainly wasnt happy 
being alone especially without females said mark goldstein 
executive director of metro parks zoos which operates the zoo in 
this northern suburb of boston 
aardu bounded out of his cage july 23 and headed for the 
middlesex fells a 3000acre wooded preserve nearby zoo officials 
said the 18monthold aardu a hardy vegetarian could have 
survived for months in the woods if necessary 
whether he will survive state budget cuts is another matter the 
zoo is due to close in april 1991 ilyas bhatti commissioner of 
the metropolitan district commission said it was unclear whether 
aardu could be transferred to another zoo 
state rep paul casey said he was worried aardu might be put to 
death 
if thats the case id rather aardu had remained free casey 
said at least he has a fighting chance out in the fells 
goldstein said officials were exploring the possibility of 
keeping the zoo operating by making it a nonprofit organization

iraq said today its troops will begin 
withdrawing from kuwait in two days baghdad radio announced 
an iraqi government spokesman said all iraqi troops in kuwait 
will be withdrawn according to a timetable beginning sunday said 
the radio broadcast monitored in cyprus 
in amman jordan a senior iraqi diplomat said we believe 
that the national government in kuwait can take over all the 
responsibilities now and they are capable of defending their 
national security 
the broadcast which was also carried by a station calling 
itself the provisional government of kuwait radio said the 
alsabah royal family that ruled kuwait for almost 250 years will 
never return to power 
the bygone regime is finished forever and will never come 
back the spokesman said 
iraq said it sent its troops into kuwait thursday to provide 
security for the provisional government and would withdraw when the 
situation stabilized 
the international diplomatic community scorned the claim the 
british ambassador to the united nations accused baghdad of setting 
up a puppet regime in kuwait 
earlier today an iraqi missile slammed into saudi arabia and 
thousands of iraqi troops pushed to within a few miles of the saudi 
border heightening world concerns that their invasion would not 
stop in kuwait 
iraqs invasion followed two weeks of threats and accusations 
against its small persian gulf neighbor on july 17 saddam accused 
kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides 
claim 
saddam also blamed kuwait for a fall in oil prices saying it 
contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its opec production 
quotas 
details from kuwait today were sketchy public communication was 
severed and a radio station opposed to the invasion was knocked off 
the air its last message was a desperate appeal from kuwait for 
fellow arabs to rush rush to their help

an underground warehouse raided by 
mexican police may have been used to store drugs later smuggled 
into arizona through an elaborate tunnel authorities said 
like the tunnel the warehouse was concealed beneath rooms that 
could be raised by sophisticated hydraulic lifts mexican federal 
police said police seized 5 tons of marijuana in the raid sunday 
but men guarding the cache escaped 
the tunnel which linked agua prieta mexico and douglas 
ariz was discovered in may authorities said it was used to 
smuggle cocaine and marijuana 
nogales a border town is about 80 miles west of agua prieta 
about 15 agents were met with gunfire during the raid but no 
one was wounded mario alberto torrijos head of the nogales office 
of the federal judicial police said thursday 
the tunnel and warehouses including a similar one found 
recently in guadalajara are probably linked mexican police said 
drugs may have been stored in the nogales warehouse before being 
smuggled through the tunnel they said 
the hydraulic system in nogales the first one discovered here 
was more sophisticated than in the tunnel torrijos said 
we were at the agua prieta tunnel and when the covers were 
down you could still smell the drugs he said when we close 
this chamber it is so hermetically sealed you cant smell the 
marijuana 
a small office which could be lifted about six feet sat atop 
two underground rooms one 22 feet by 22 feet and the other 22 feet 
by 36 feet police said 
the movable office was next to a 10000squarefoot paper plant 
with the whole complex surrounded by a concrete block wall the 
large warehouse contained several hundred rolls of toilet paper 
but no drugs said torrijos 
agents found 5 tons of marijuana wrapped in 601 plastic 
packages in one of the underground rooms said mario torrijos 
rascon police group chief in nogales 
police also seized three shotguns four automatic weapons two 
silencers two rifles and a radio transmitter he said 
in mexico city the attorney general said in a statement that 
two agua prieta men were arrested in the case and an american and 
another mexican were being sought it was unclear however whether 
they were the escaped guards 
the underground cache sat on the fouracre rios paper 
distributing co site in nogales casas palenque neighborhood a 
residential and industrial area 
torrijos said investigators were trying to determine who owned 
the property 
an informants tip led police to the stash he said

coast guard officials said friday a barge 
that collided with a tanker in the houston ship channel may have 
spilled 700000 gallons or nearly all of its cargo into galveston 
bay 
the coast guard had said earlier that 500000 gallons of oil 
spewed into the bay after the accident but officials considered 
adjusting that estimate after salvage crews found nothing in a 
oncesubmerged cargo tank they expected to contain about 200000 
gallons of oil 
it looks like a lot of the oil may have escaped from it 
coast guard capt thomas greene said 
greene said officials were rechecking ship manifests to 
determine exactly how much oil was aboard the vessel 
it could be close to 700000 gallons spilled but im not 
willing to say that yet the total capacity of that barge was 
750000 gallons theyre telling us they had 716000 gallons 
actually on board greene said at a press conference at eagle 
point a real estate development where oil has washed ashore 
the state health department meanwhile announced that a ban on 
fishing in the bay begun thursday would be partially lifted 
saturday in several areas apparently unaffected by the oil 
the accident occurred a week ago when the greek tanker shinoussa 
collided with two barges in the houston ship channel causing one 
barge to nearly sink oil from both barges bubbled into the 
seafoodrich bay threatening sensitive marshes birds and other 
wildlife 
the oil has washed ashore on several beaches the latest was 
houston point a marshy area north of the leading edge of the 
12mile oil slick where oil was reported friday morning 
coast guard officials say they are perplexed by what appeared to 
be relatively small amounts of oil spotted on flyovers this week 
while part of the oil may have evaporated greene said another 
possibility is that some sank just below the surface tests have 
shown no evidence that the oil has reached the bottom he said 
cleanup crews continued scooping oil off the surface friday 
while salvage team worked on the damaged barge 
oileating microbes were poured into a small marshy area near 
pelican island adjacent to galveston island on thursday 
afternoon there was no word friday on whether the microbes were 
gobbling up the oil as intended 
the spill has halted traffic in the houston ship channel for 
most of the week limited traffic was allowed friday morning after 
the damaged barge was lifted out of the channel into shallower 
waters in the bay 
it was not very far they just had to get it to a slightly 
more stable location said chief warrant officer rick meidt 
one deepdraft ship was allowed out of the channel friday 
morning in part to find out if a large ships wake would further 
damage the barge meidt said 
the ship passed without incident and at least one other ship was 
permitted to pass through the area 
were taking it slow and easy meidt said 
greene said that for the first time officials were able to see 
the damage on the ruptured barge and it is extensive after the 
shinoussa struck the barge it appears to have plowed into the 
center of it he said 
its completely bashed in for probably 100 feet greene said 
an investigative hearing into the accident resumed friday 
morning in houston the second mate of the shinoussa testified the 
tankers pilot was racing before the accident and then tried 
to cover up how fast the ship was traveling later he softened the 
accusation saying he had never been told to lie about the tankers 
speed 
the pilot raymond fincher has denied speeding through the 
channel

jurors in mayor marion barrys drug and 
perjury trial spent their first full day of deliberations friday in 
the relative calm of the us courthouse after a wild drug sting at 
their hotel the night before 
like a scene from a movie there were helicopters search dogs 
and an escape car ramming police cruisers 
the presiding judge in the barry case said he was assured by 
us marshals that our jurors were oblivious to the sting but 
the mayors lawyer still said he might ask for a mistrial in 
connection with it 
the barry jury has been secretly staying at the hotel in 
suburban maryland for the past 6 weeks but reporters covering the 
drug sting story and its aftermath discovered that the jury was 
there raising the possibility it would have to be moved 
the jurors meanwhile said they would deliberate saturday in an 
effort to move toward a verdict as quickly as possible they began 
deliberation late thursday 
barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession counts 
including one in connection with a hotel sting in which the fbi 
videotaped him smoking from a crack cocaine pipe he also faces 
three perjury charges and a misdemeanor conspiracy charge 
the mayor shrugged off questions about the trial friday saying 
only i feel fantastic 
he spoke to about 200 teenagers at a youth forum then returned 
to his district building office for a meeting with top staff 
members and cabinet officials it was the first time barry visited 
city hall without having to rush back to the federal courthouse 
since jury selection in his trial began june 4 
thursday nights unconnected drug sting was aimed at brian 
tribble a former friend of the late university of maryland 
basketball star len bias who died in june 1986 of cocaine 
poisoning authorities said 
peter gruden special agent in charge of the federal drug 
enforcement administrations washington field office said he was 
pretty sure that it was not known by the dea that the barry 
jury was sequestered at the hotel 
tribble was lured to the hotel to purchase cocaine but as 
authorities moved in he fled officials said an associate was 
taken into custody and faced arraignment on drug possession charges 
tribble drove off rammed two police vehicles blocking his 
escape drove back to the hotel and fled into a wooded area said 
prince georges county police who were called in 
police brought in search dogs and helicopters equipped with 
infrared lights to search the area but tribble was still free 
friday 
the district of columbia police department also took part in the 
sting operation said lt reginald smith who added that 
information on where the jury was staying was only available on a 
need to know basis 
the fbi also assisted in the operation 
during a brief court session friday barry lawyer r kenneth 
mundy said he wanted a representation on the record that the 
jurors werent made aware of the sting operation of the night 
before 
jackson said he was assured they werent aware of it 
mundy said someone would have had to ask them a question about 
the sting in order to make the determination that they hadnt been 
aware of it 
they may have been aware there was a commotion said jackson 
mundy was asked later outside court whether he might ask for a 
mistrial because of the incident yes he said without 
elaboration 
during the day friday the jury asked for complete sets of the 
32page instruction booklet read to them thursday by us district 
court judge thomas penfield jackson jurors also asked to see a 
huge magnetic calendar in the courtroom on which the prosecution 
listed the times barry was accused of using drugs 
jackson also said he would allow the jury to return piecemeal 
portions of the verdict rather than waiting until it reached a 
conclusion on all 14 charges

drinking water in many small communities 
violates federal health requirements and in some cases violations 
are being hidden by improper tests or falsified records a 
congressional study concluded friday 
the general accounting office said an investigation of 
compliance to drinking water standards at 75 community water 
systems in six states showed many local authorities are not 
complying with the federal requirements 
the study also said that efforts by the environmental protection 
agency to uncover violations and take enforcement actions against 
the local water officials frequently are ineffective 
we found that many water systems particularly smaller 
systems are violating requirements for monitoring water quality 
and meeting drinking water standards richard hembra the gaos 
director for environmental issues told a house government 
operations subcommittee 
the environmental protection agency acknowledged problems with 
getting small community water systems to comply with federal clean 
water requirements 
the small communities is where the biggest compliance problems 
lie because of a shortage of money and technical people to 
operate water systems testified lajuana wilcher the epas 
assistant administrator for water issues 
she also acknowledged that some violations of federal drinking 
water standards go unreported because of erroneous information from 
local officials or inadequate monitoring by states 
nevertheless ms wilcher maintained that said the most serious 
violations have been resolved and in that available reports showed 
that 73 percent of the community water systems serving 183 million 
people were complying with federal health standards for drinking 
water in 1989 
according to the gao report however those statistics may 
overstate compliance nationwide 
the gao study said investigators found that local water 
officials frequently test water samples incorrectly because 
employees are not adequately trained to deal with increasingly 
technical federal regulations 
at other times the gao report said samples are deliberately 
falsified 
while the extent of this problem is unknown we found that 
falsifying data and manipulating test results are relatively easy 
to accomplish and ample evidence exists that the practices are 
occurring hembra told the house subcommittee on environment 
energy and natural resources 
the gao report cited examples where local water officials were 
told to eliminate bacteria by boiling or microwaving water samples 
before conducting tests in other cases employees were told to 
specifically search for samples that would pass a test while in 
yet other cases employees admitted they simply put false 
information on reports 
how much credence can you give these compliance figures 
giving the gao findings rep mike synar dokla chairman of 
the subcommittee asked the epa officials 
certainly not 100 percent responded ms wilcher 
the gao report examined water systems in massachusetts vermont 
oklahoma texas oregon and washington it did not identify the 
individual communities

a 73yearold political newcomer said he 
was thinking of conceding the republican senate primary until he 
learned friday that the race was closer than he thought 
i dont have too many fingernails left i guess ill have to 
start chewing my toenails candidate ralph brown said 
it will be monday at the earliest before tennesseans learn who 
won thursdays gop contest between brown and conservative political 
economist william hawkins who was leading by only 158 votes 
scattered precincts remain uncounted around the state and in 
one county madison election officials said they wouldnt begin 
counting statewide races until next week 
madison county officials said their ballot was extremely long 
and county races took priority over the senate race 
were going to count it as soon as we can but weve got every 
county position except for tax assessor to count first county 
registrar spence dupree said 
with 96 percent of the states precincts reporting hawkins had 
50979 votes to browns 50821 businessman patrick hales trailed 
with 29743 votes 
the winner will face the democratic incumbent sen albert gore 
jr 
state election coordinator will burns said the delays underline 
the need for a statewide computerized election system 
in other races us rep harold ford the states only black 
congressman defeated state rep pam gaia in a democratic primary 
despite the cloud of federal bank fraud charges hanging over his 
head 
ford 45 will face republican aaron c davis a 79yearold 
political newcomer in the general election 
dwight henry a freshman state legislator from cookeville beat 
five opponents in the republican gubernatorial primary after 
returning to the race during the last week of the campaign 
he will face the incumbent governor ned mcwherter who like 
gore received a large complimentary vote in an uncontested 
democratic primary 
brown who estimated he had spent about 250 on his senate 
primary campaign said he was told by a television station that 
hawkins had won thursdays election 
he said he was considering conceding when he learned at least 33 
of 95 uncounted precincts would probably not be tabulated until 
monday 
hawkins a 41yearold former college professor said he hadnt 
expected the race to be so close and thought that some voters who 
had not paid much attention voted for brown because he came first 
on the ballot 
i wouldnt deny that brown said

an emergency arab league council friday 
issued a strongly worded statement condeming iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and demanding the immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops 
but a statement issued at the end of the twoday meeting said 
the arab league rejected foreign intervention in the crisis 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid said 14 of the leagues 21 
members voted for the condemnation while one member abstained 
sudan palestine jordan and yemen voted against it he said 
libyas representative was not present and iraq did not have the 
right to vote he said 
in iraq jordans king hussein met with president sadaam 
hussein the jordanian leader announced there would be an emergency 
arab minisummit in saudi arabia on sunday to discuss the crisis 
although the united states the soviet union and other western 
countries swiftly condemned iraq and imposed sanctions on that 
nation most arab countries said little or nothing about the 
invasion until friday 
in its statement the arab league denounced the invasion and 
said it rejects and does not recognize anything resulting from 
it 
the statement handed out to reporters at the end of a twoday 
emergency meeting in cairo apparently meant that the league 
continues to recognize kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmad alsabah 
as the countrys ruler 
we condemn the bloodshed and the destruction of buildings and 
we call on iraq to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its 
troops the statement said 
it also said the league rejects any foreign intervention or 
attempted intervention in arab affairs 
egypt was the first major arab country to condemn thursdays 
invasion 
egyptian government officials said neither president hosni 
mubarak nor other arab leaders believed iraqs claim that it 
intervened to help kuwaiti revolutionaries but they said the arab 
leaders initially held back criticism in hopes of containing the 
crisis and preserving arab unity 
first we demand that iraq withdraw its forces from kuwaiti 
territories second iraq must stop trying to change the government 
in kuwait by force and leave such internal issues to kuwaiti people 
to decide by their own free will said the egyptian foreign 
ministry statement on friday 
egypt also called for the two countries to negotiate their 
differences 
the statement said the invasion could have dangerous 
repercussions in the region but did not elaborate 
another group of arab nations that includes saudi arabia later 
issued a similar condemnation the group the gulf cooperation 
council also includes qatar oman bahrain the united arab 
emirates and kuwait 
we strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that 
one arab state took against another arab state the groups 
statement said after its representatives met in cairo 
several hundred kuwaitis stranded in cairo by the invasion 
gathered in the lobby of the downtown semiramis hotel where the 
arab league council met 
the kuwaitis urged the arab representatives to help their 
country and carried pictures of the emir he is believed to have 
fled to saudi arabia 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat and 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi met in libya to discuss the crisis 
the libyan news agency reported 
the agency said they decided arafat would fly to iraq in an 
effort to settle the dispute 
also in cairo the middle east news agency quoted irans chief 
delegate to the organization of islamic conference hojatoleslam 
mohammad ali taskhiri as condemning the iraqi attack he 
reportedly said his country still recognizes the emirs government 
iran and iraq fought an 8year war that ended in a ceasefire in 
1988 but they have not yet negotiated a longterm settlement

the time off that daniel wynkoop took 
after his junior year at yale stretched to nearly 65 years 
but finally at age 85 hes no longer a college dropout 
at the start of wynkoops senior year he was forced to leave 
the school because he had gotten married over the summer the 
summer of 1925 
he could have returned the next year as a married student but 
ended up waiting more than 60 years to complete the seven credits 
he needed for a yale degree 
i finally had the time and the money i asked my brother a 
1928 yale graduate what i ought to do with it and he said why 
dont you finish school so i did said wynkoop a retired 
encyclopedia salesman who lives in st petersburg fla 
his three years at yale qualified him as an alumnus and he 
attended reunions over the years with other old blues from the 
class of 1926 but wynkoop wanted a degree 
so he signed up for yale summer school completing five courses 
over three summers and was credited for a spanish class he took at 
st petersburg fla junior college 
a widower who was married three times wynkoop plans to 
participate in graduation ceremonies next may with the class of 
1991 he has nine children and 25 grandchildren 
wynkoop who checked out friday from his dormitory at calhoun 
college one of yales residential colleges said he kept his nose 
in the books during his second life at yale 
i had a nice couple of guys who said do you want to go get a 
couple of beers i said no ive been on the wagon since i came 
here and ill stay that way 
he broke the rule once when a yale administrator invited him to 
lunch at morys the storied yale dining club 
most of the more than 1000 students enrolled in yales summer 
and special programs are in the teens and early 20s wynkoop also 
had to adjust to women students who were first admitted in 1969 
you know those girls are not bad looking he said adding 
that they would have distracted him his first time around 
wynkoop who majored in english took courses this summer on 
detective stories and on radicalism since the 1960s which was 
difficult because thats a subject with which i have very little 
sympathy 
an earlier philosophy course was his favorite 
i had a peculiar position in the class he said because 
of my age i had a different point of view on moral questions 
wynkoop said he feels sorry for people who ask him why he 
bothered going back to school 
if they dont know you cant tell them he said its 
because i want to drink deeper of the cup of life

veteran and his election opponent faced off in their first 
televised forum with the incumbent democrat suffering what he 
later described as a selfinflicted wound 
appearing wednesday on wjartv with rep claudine schneider 
rri pell hesitated when asked to identify the last legislation 
he personally pushed that directly benefited rhode islanders 
i couldnt give you a specific answer he said my 
memorys not as good as it should be 
the station later reported that pell explained he had been 
trying to think of a bill that would affect only rhode island 
miss schneider was asked to name the last bill that youve 
sponsored and were the prime mover on that directly benefits rhode 
island in some way 
the 10year congresswoman had a quick answer a bill regulating 
and eventually banning garbage dumping at sea 
my bill later became the committee bill she said 
but she acknowledged she was not the prime mover of the 
bill and the version she first sponsored was changed in ways she 
opposed before it emerged from her oceanrelated committee 
in the house of representatives working with 434 other 
people there are no bills that have my name on them because 
thats just the way the system works she said

iraqi troops moved into kuwait on thursday they are believed to 
control almost all of kuwait and it was not clear from the abc

soviet rescuers on friday brought ashore 
21 survivors of the wreck of a cargo ship and the saved sailors 
said they felt very lucky to have lived through hurricane 
bertha 
the corazon broke into pieces tuesday in the atlantic ocean 
about 400 miles east of new york six of its crew died and three 
of the bodies were left at sea said elizabeth brannan a coast 
guard spokeswoman from boston 
the soviet captain said his crew fought 30foot waves and heavy 
winds to save the stricken sailors 
what made the whole operation complicated was the wind and the 
height of the waves as well as the rainstorms very little 
visibility said vladimir pushnoy captain of the of the mv 
leonid leonidov 
crew members from the corazon wore yellow vests that were hard 
to see in the foamy water pushnoy said at a news conference friday 
after the rusty soviet fishing boat docked in portland harbor 
friday afternoon the corazons survivors many of them from greece 
and the philippines stood on the deck and told their story to 
reporters 
we are very lucky said pantelis potiris of greece the 
corazons cook it was very bad very rough 
one survivor gave a thumbs up sign and said the russians are 
good 
an apprentice officer rolando arellano of manila philippines 
said he spent four to six hours floating in the water after his 
life raft capsized one of his countrymen died trying to get off 
the corazon he said 
when i jumped in the life raft i found one filipino 
floating arellano said he hit the ships hull 
the dead included a first officer a second officer an 
assistant officer and a radio man aboard the ship 
i hope only to stay alive arellano said i always pray to 
god we are thinking of our family and to save ourselves 
arellano said he would return to the sea because it is the only 
life he knows 
after the corazon sent out a distress signal tuesday afternoon 
the us and canadian coast guards helped leonid leonidov and other 
ships find the survivors 
two other ships in the area got close to corazon crew members 
but couldnt get them aboard 
pushnoy said his fishing support ship was able to pull off the 
rescue because his 46member crew is used to working in open sea 
and tying up with other vessels the last man rescued had been in 
the water 10 hours he said 
the leonid leonidov had been headed for the gulf of maine to 
pick up fish being processed by another soviet vessel the riga 
which is spending the summer off the maine coast 
the corazon a 593foot freighter that was registered in malta 
had been carrying tons of cement from greece to new york

british prime minister margaret 
thatcher touring a star wars test site during an outbreak of war 
in the persian gulf said friday the project had helped force 
sweeping changes in the soviet union 
despite the thaw in superpower relations that some claim has 
rendered the multibillion dollar strategic defense initiative 
irrelevant mrs thatcher said iraqs invasion of kuwait proved the 
importance of a strong military 
there will always be evil in human nature and we never know 
where it will come from she said we must always keep our 
technology sharp 
thatcher said sdi had forced soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
to realize his army could not keep up with the united states 
without draining the countrys resources she said 
i believe it convinced the soviet union they can never achieve 
their aim by military might because they knew they could never 
succeed she said 
the sdi site known as the national test bed is developing 
military spacebased technology in the united states projects 
under way would use lasers to shoot down enemy missiles in space 
and incoming nuclear warheads 
thatcher told about 1000 sdi workers she was amazed how far the 
project had come since its inception in 1984 during the reagan 
administration 
among british contributions to the sdi program are filters that 
can block soviet attempts to jam military satellites with laser 
beams and a neutron generator that can determine the payloads of 
military missiles 
thatcher watched a display the brilliant pebbles project 
one of the most successful developments in the star wars arsenal 
the device fires rockets at incoming warheads 
star wars criticized from the start by some who say it is 
unworkable is under increasing scrutiny because of us budget 
constraints and warming superpower relations 
thatcher later toured cheyenne mountain headquarters for norad 
which tracks soviet missiles airplanes and submarines world wide 
she also visited the national center for atmospheric research in 
boulder where scientists are studying global warming an issue 
that has been of special concern to thatcher who was trained as a 
chemist

president bushs cutoff of iraqi oil imports 
is costing iraq its no 1 customer but the sanction is unlikely to 
take a lasting toll on baghdad unless japan and other major oil 
importing countries join the embargo 
anything short of a concerted buyer boycott by the oil importing 
nations would be little more than a temporary inconvenience for 
iraq 
a solo american boycott would leave iraq free to sell usbound 
oil to japan or another customer although it might be forced to 
take a slightly lower price in order to move the oil quickly in a 
glutted world market 
but the inconvenience could be felt as much by american oil 
companies as by the iraqi government the embargo announced by bush 
thursday following iraqs invasion of kuwait bars the import of 
iraqi oil but it apparently does not stop american oil companies 
from continuing to buy iraqi oil and ship it to their nonamerican 
affiliates or simply swapping it on the world market 
among the major us oil companies that buy iraqi oil exxon 
corp for example could divert its iraqi purchases to its western 
european affiliates for refining 
the united states among the dozens of countries which condemned 
iraqs takeover of kuwait on friday was the only nation to have 
barred imports of iraqi oil although european governments were 
reported to be considering boycotts 
japans kyodo news service reported tokyo also was contemplating 
a ban 
bush acknowledged the difficulty of making his sanctions work 
i dont say they would work but we are putting them on 
there he told reporters before leaving the white house for a 
weekend at his camp david md retreat 
a bush administration source said officials were considering 
expanding the american action to include kuwaiti oil since it now 
is under iraqi control the source involved in roundtheclock 
monitoring of the persian gulf crisis discussed the 
administrations thinking on condition he not be identified 
later though the tresury department issued a statement 
exempting oil in transit from both kuwait and iran from the 
presidents embargo thus including kuwait a white house spokesman 
said the president had not amended his order and was leaving it up 
to treasury as to precisely what was covered 
of kuwaits 18 million barrels a day of oil exports about 
120000 barrels a day are bought by the united states the rest 
goes to western europe and the far east 
kuwaiti oil expors ground to a halt shortly after the invasion 
although the bush administration source said it appeared all 
kuwaiti oil facilities had escaped war damage 
the us market is more important to iraq than is iraqi oil to 
america the united states buys about 25 percent of iraqs oil 
exports making it baghdads no 1 customer 
us purchases from iraq have soared in recent years jumping 
from about 100000 barrels a day in 1987 to about 600000 a day 
last month even so the iraqi oil represents only about 35 
percent of total american oil consumption and about 76 percent of 
us imports according to the american petroleum institute 
although an international boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti oil would 
seriously damage baghdads economy and set back its efforts to 
rebuild following its costly 198088 war with iran the sanctions 
may also carry a price for the rest of the world 
the approximately 45 million barrels a day of combined iraqi 
and kuwaiti oil exports if removed from the world market would 
leave at least a temporary shortfall in global supplies that almost 
certainly would drive up consumer prices 
henson moore the deputy secretary of energy told reporters 
thursday evening that the administration was not worried about a 
potential price rise resulting from a global boycott against iraq 
should the oil from iraq and kuwait go off the market not be 
sold to anybody there is enough excess oil production capacity 
in the world to offset that loss moore said 
it seems unlikely however that the countries with the most 
unused production capacity mostly gulf arab nations including 
saudi arabia would risk antagonizing iraq by helping shield the 
united states from a price increase

customs agents seized 479000 
barrels of iraqi crude oil from one tanker and blocked another 
offshore but both cargos apparently will be released since they 
were bought before an embargo was announced 
the treasury department said friday that oil loaded before 
president bush announced a trade embargo thursday against iraq and 
kuwait may be delivered 
treasury spokesmen were not available to comment on specifics 
but the exception appeared to cover both the cargoes seized in 
texas 
the customs service along with the us coast guard seized the 
oil at the port of corpus christi on thursday afternoon hours 
after president bushs embargo went into effect at 5 am 
the oil was being unloaded from the hellespont dignity sailing 
under a swedish flag at a coastal corp refinery facility said 
patricia mccauley district customs director in houstonthe cargo 
had been unloaded at sea from a norwegian mother ship the berge 
banker 
that ship remained in the gulf of mexico outside us 
territorial waters ms mccauley said 
another tanker destined for a fina oil and chemical co 
refinery in port arthur was halted offshore a customs spokeswoman 
was unable to provide the name of that ship its owners or its 
registry 
fina was trying to persuade the government to let the company 
take delivery spokesman rick hagar said from the companys dallas 
headquarters friday past embargoes affected only new shipments 
made after the prohibitions took effect he said 
crude oil that was on the water already paid for already 
bought was permitted into the united states thats what were 
asking for in this case he said 
the treasury announcement appeared to be an answer to finas 
request the treasury statement said importation of iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil would be permitted if the cargoes were loaded before 
thursday and landed by oct 1 
fina has refineries in big spring and port arthur and a terminal 
in corpus christi 
president bush issued the embargo after iraq invaded kuwait 
thursday the embargo covers iraqi vessels and goods as well as 
ships flying iraqi or kuwaiti flags the order also prohibits 
dealings between us and iraqi companies 
in the past three months there have been 50 shipments of iraqi 
oil arriving in houston ms mccauley said 
some iraqi goods in the port of houston also have been detained 
ms mccauley said she did not elaborate but very little ship 
traffic is moving in or out of houston because of an oil spill 
cleanup in galveston bay

the united states asked the un security 
council on friday to impose sweeping military trade and economic 
sanctions on iraq for its invasion of kuwait 
us ambassador thomas pickering said the members of the 
15nation council expressed strong interest in applying 
comprehensive mandatory sanctions 
if approved it would be the first time since 1967 that the 
security council imposed such wideranging sanctions from arms to 
trade upon a state 
it was not known if the entire council was ready to approve such 
penalties 
i detect strong interest in sanctions and we will be 
moving rapidly to discussion of a text a resolution could be 
passed in 24 hours pickering said after council consultations 
we want to put teeth into the security councils demand 
thursday that iraq withdraw its troops from kuwait pickering 
said 
the council on thursday condemned the invasion demanded iraqs 
immediate and unconditional withdrawal and called for urgent 
negotiations between iraq and kuwait to resolve their differences 
a us government official who later briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity said the white house would press for 
sanctions despite iraqs announcement late friday its soldiers 
would begin leaving kuwait on sunday 
he expressed skepticism about iraqs announcement that it would 
start a troop pullout 
consultations continued with the security council and other 
nations in an effort to reach consensus on a resolution imposing 
sanctions the measures would be designed to punish iraq and to 
force it to withdraw completely and without conditions 
the official said washington may call for an emergency council 
meeting this weekend but said differences existed 
pickering told reporters that sanction efforts were not 
incompatible with arab league peace moves and that sanctions would 
reinforce other settlement efforts 
he said the united states proposed farreaching detailed 
economic financial and military sanctions anything you can 
think of including an embargo on sales of arms military 
equipment supplies and training 
the us official told the briefing that proposed sanctions 
probably would cover pipeline exports of iraqi oil by saudi arabia 
and turkey removal of advisers and technicians from iraq and 
severing of commercial airline links he said a us draft does not 
mention freezing iraqi or kuwaiti assets abroad 
asked about iraqs statement that kuwaits royal family should 
not return the official said iraq should leave kuwait whole 
free sovereign intact and its government returned 
he said sanctions would be lifted if iraq withdraws and the 
status quo is restored 
pickering told reporters our us view is that we should 
move rapidly to sanctions if iraq doesnt show and it hasnt 
signs of compliance 
the us envoy said one or two members not identified had 
reservations 
diplomats said china and yemen an arab state were not 
supportive china as a permanent member could veto the measure 
the security council rarely imposes sanctions but improved 
ussoviet relations make them a possibility 
the five permanent members with veto power are the united 
states britain china france and the soviet union ambassadors of 
the five have been consulting informally on strategy to end the 
crisis 
the soviet union was expected to concur since foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii on 
friday issued a joint demand in moscow for an arms embargo against 
iraq 
security council resolutions are considered legally binding upon 
its members although they often are flouted 
the un charter provides that the security council may call 
upon members to impose sanctions including economic sanctions and 
interruption of travel and communications and severing diplomatic 
relations 
in extreme cases the council may employ blockades and military 
operations by the air sea or land forces of un members 
it was believed only the fifth time in the councils 45 years 
that it has issued such a threat of sanctions 
the most recent case was the council action demanding a 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war in 1987 earlier times led to arms 
embargos against formerly whiterun rhodesia in 1967 and south 
africa in 1977 there was also a warning about sanctions in the 
first arabisraeli war in 1948 
the last un embargo came in 1967 on rhodesia it was lifted in 
1979 as the former british colony prepared for independence and 
majority rule as zimbabwe

virginia gov l douglas wilder said friday 
that negative media focus on the private lives of black politicians 
does not mean there is a white conspiracy against leading blacks 
recent stories including those on the drug trial of washington 
dc mayor marion barry only leave that impression wilder said 
wilder himself has been the focus of stories saying he has used 
a state helicopter to spend weekends with socialite patricia kluge 
if i thought that there was a conspiracy i couldnt exist 
wilder said i couldnt have existed in the courtroom where being 
an africanamerican lawyer i was asking for justice from a jury 
that was all white and judges who were all white but i found 
justice 
during his first six months in office the nations first black 
elected governor has come under criticism for his busy travel 
schedule and recently for his friendship with mrs kluge estranged 
wife of americas richest man john kluge 
the governor last winter appointed mrs kluge a former nude 
model and high school dropout to the board of visitors of the 
university of virginia 
wilder made his remarks at a news conference following a speech 
to about 2000 black journalists the national association of black 
journalists is holding its annual convention at the century plaza 
hotel through sunday 
wilder called for journalists to go beyond problems of the black 
community and focus on problems that blacks and whites have in 
common 
we do the public a disservice we limit our perspective if 
we think of ourselves as black officials or as black 
journalists he said 
problems like the savings and loan bailout that will cost an 
estimated 14 trillion affect everyone he said 
think of the inner city schools that could have been helped 
with that money think of the prenatal health care the resources 
for the fight against drugs all lost forever he said 
wilder called for blacks to unite and not to be pitted against 
one another 
he urged the journalists to bring good news of the black 
community to the rest of the world 
you and i know that there is a great deal of good in our 
communities which goes unnoticed and unappreciated simply because 
the public is not made aware of it he said 
a study released at the beginning of the convention implies that 
black journalists influence is limited by their numbers 
the study released at the conference by the american society of 
newspaper editors found that only 4 percent of reporters editors 
artists and photographers in 1990 are minorities said denise 
johnson vice president of the black journalists association 
the report also said that 4 percent of newspapers across the 
united states employ only whites 
blacks make up about 123 percent of the population 
america is browner and tanner and is going to continue to be 
in the future and the industry must reflect that perspective and 
diverse view of the world through the people it hires johnson 
said 
most institutions in this country are still pretty much 
dominated by white middleage males and i think the tendency on 
their part is to look out over the staff of people they direct and 
take under their wing a person who reminds them of themselves 
johnson said

president bush warned iraq on friday not to 
tamper with us vital interests by trying to add oilrich 
saudi arabia to its conquest of kuwait he said the united states 
was willing to help in any way we possibly can to stop iraqi 
aggression 
the white house said all options including military force were 
under consideration 
the state department said iraqi troops hardened by eight years 
of war with iran were positioned 5 miles to 10 miles from the 
saudi border and spokesman richard boucher said their presence 
there clearly raises significant concern 
the united states buys 12 million barrels of oil a day from 
saudi arabia or about onesixth of all american oil imports bush 
said there is a shortterm surplus of crude oil but that longrun 
economic effects on the free world could be devastating if 
supplies are curtailed 
when you look at vital interests of the united states the 
relationship with saudi arabia and its independence and its freedom 
come under the heading of very very important bush said 
if they ask for specific help it depends on what it is but 
id be inclined to help in any way we possibly can the president 
told reporters as he left the white house for a weekend at camp 
david 
at the united nations the us delegate to the security council 
proposed a sweeping program of international sanctions described 
by one official as anything you can think of 
an iraqi government spokesman was reported by baghdad radio as 
saying his nations troops would begin withdrawing from kuwait on 
sunday but the broadcast also said the alsabah royal family that 
has ruled kuwait for almost 250 years would never return to power 
the white house appeared skeptical we need to wait and see 
there are many questions associated with it said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater we asked for immediate and 
unconditional withdrawal if there are strings we need to see what 
they are 
iraq said it sent its troops into kuwait thursday merely to 
provide security for a provisional government a contention 
dismissed in washington and other western capitals 
a senior us official aboard the plane of secretary of state 
james a baker iii speaking to reporters on condition that his 
name not be used on the return from moscow said the invasion came 
despite warnings from the united states against it there was a 
general warning at several different levels including very 
high levels the official said 
house speaker thomas s foley said an iraqi invasion of saudi 
arabia would call for a direct military response by the united 
states western europe maybe even the soviet union this would be 
an action that could not be ignored 
house armed service committee chairman les aspin dwis said 
bluntly i think it means war if iraq expands its invasion i 
say that not as a threat but as a prediction the world cannot sit 
back and watch a person like iraqi president saddam hussein take 
over half of the oil reserves in the world 
bush said he viewed iraqs invasion of kuwait and the threat to 
other persian gulf countries as a matter of grave concern to this 
country and internationally as well what iraq has done violates 
every norm of international law 
asked what the united states would do if iraq invades saudi 
arabia the president said im not discussing options but i 
would simply say the status quo is unacceptable and further 
expansion would be even more unacceptable 
the pentagon said a third us aircraft carrier was being 
readied to head to the mideast to bolster us forces already 
scattered outside the persian gulf region officials said the uss 
saratoga would relieve the uss eisenhower which was deployed in 
the mideast in march 
the aircraft carrier independence already is headed from the 
indian ocean toward the persian gulf to strengthen the eightship 
us navy presence already there 
military sources said the independence was several days from 
reaching a staging area outside gulf waters pentagon sources said 
it would be difficult for the united states to parry iraqs drive 
with a major assault of troops 
defense secretary dick cheney met with bush at the white house 
and the president was given a spectrum of options for military 
action including offering warfighting hardware to kuwaits 
neighbors as well as more aggressive moves such as a naval blockade 
or tactical air strikes on iraq pentagon sources said 
with tensions rising the state department advised the 3000 
americans in kuwait and the 500 in iraq to leave as quickly as 
possible in kuwait however airports and ports were closed 
iraq also began jamming shortwave radio broadcasts from the 
voice of america on friday the agency said 
the administration said 14 americans were known missing and 
believed to be in iraqi hands the united states demanded that they 
be accounted for and freed fitzwater said 
the americans are oil workers who were taken from three 
different oil fields near the iraqikuwait border boucher said 
fitzwater said the united states could not confirm reports that 
americans were being rounded up or held in various places 
he said iraqi troops have been stationed around the us embassy 
in kuwait but they have not gone inside there is no indication 
they intend to do that 
in the early hours of the invasion which began before dawn 
thursday iraqi officials promised us embassy officials in 
baghdad that americans would not be harmed boucher said we 
reminded them of their commitment to safeguard the safety of 
americans he said 
in an unprecedented step the united states and soviet union 
jointly demanded that all countries cut off arms supplies to iraq 
the statement was issued in moscow by secretary of state james a 
baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze after a 
hastily scheduled meeting 
shevardnadze whose country has been iraqs biggest arms 
supplier predicted that baghdad soon would withdraw from kuwait 
fitzwater said the actions of iraq at this point indicate a 
ruthlessness and disregard for international law that must make us 
concerned about all the other countries in the region and their 
security 
nato sources in brussels said the united states alerted western

the senate rebuffed an attempt friday to cut 
nearly four times as many us troops from the us military as 
president bush proposed to cut in his 1991 military budget 
despite arguments that the cold war has ended and the united 
states faces severe money problems the senate rejected an 
amendment to cut 130000 troops including 80000 in europe the 
vote was 5940 
in proposing a 307 billion defense bill for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 bush called for about 40000 troops to be cut 
overall the senate armed services committee adopted a 289 billion 
military budget last month that would cut troop strength by 
100000 including 50000 in europe 
the chairman of the senate armed services panel sen sam nunn 
dga warned that a deeper cut in the nations 21 million 
military personnel than the total adopted by his committee would 
force the pentagon to send out the pink slips 
in a speech on thursday bush called for a 25 percent reduction 
in troop strength over five years about 500000 through 1995 
but cautioned against drastic reductions in the nations mlitary 
late friday the senate agreed to consider five amendments on 
the strategic defense initiative on saturday in hopes of completing 
the legislation and adjourning for the summer recess 
on other issues on the defense agenda the senate 
the senate rejected 5443 an amendment imposing a oneyear 
moratorium on closing or realigning military bases on the list 
defense secretary dick cheney proposed in january unless congress 
decides otherwise 
sen dale bumpers dark angrily cited statistics from a 
democratic study showing that 99 percent of the 44000 civilian 
jobs that would be lost from cheneys january list of potential 
base closings were in democratic congressional districts 
you dont have to be a rocket scientist to know this didnt 
happen by coincidence bumpers said of what he perceived as a 
partisan list from republican cheney 
but sen john warner of virginia ranking gop member on the 
armed services panel argued that cheney has tried to defend his 
action in cutting back military personnel and now were about to 
handcuff him 
rejected an amendment to increase the pay raise for military 
personnel included in the 1991 defense bill from 35 percent to 41 
percent the measure failed 6732 
approved by voice vote a measure providing 5 million to 
washington oregon and idaho for the creation of a registry to 
monitor and notify individuals of the potential adverse effects of 
radiation released from the hanford nuclear reservation in hanford 
wash from 1944 to 1972 
approval of the measure came in the midst of a flurry of 
activity on the senate floor in which 17 amendments were briefly 
described and adopted by voice vote in a mere 21 minutes 
rejected 5245 an amendment to freeze funds for the armys 
kinetic energy antisatellite rocket program at this years 74 
million in the new budget bush proposed a 181 percent increase to 
208 million for the program 
turned down an attempt to mothball three of the navys four 
battleships one more than bush has proposed in his fiscal 1991 
budget and the total adopted by the house armed services committee 
in its 283 billion defense bill the vote was 5544 
lawmakers have questioned the necessity of maintaining the 
1940vintage vessels especially since the gun turret explosion 
last year aboard the uss iowa that killed 47 sailors 
cheney has proposed retiring the uss iowa and the uss new 
jersey bumpers proposed adding either the uss missouri or the uss 
wisconsin to the list 
sen john mccain rariz a former navy pilot said he doesnt 
have to make the case for the battleship saddam hussein has made 
the case for the battleship referring to the iraqi leader who 
engineered the invasion of kuwait 
bumpers responded where are the four battleships we have are 
they steaming to the persian gulf 
nunn complained that the navy had promised a new and 
innovative use for the battleships when they were taken out of 
mothballs several years ago 
weve wasted an enormous amount of money with four and now 
were left with two and no innovative way to use them nunn said 
the best solution is to cut one battleship 
in rushing to complete work on the defense bill before the 
summer recess the senate also sidestepped a potentially volatile 
fight by setting aside an amendment to allow abortions in military 
hospitals for personnel and their dependents willing to pay for the 
procedure 
sen timothy wirth dcolo chief sponsor of the provision 
withdrew his amendment after the senate fell two votes short of 
limiting debate

breastfed babies have more active immune systems 
after one year than babies who have been fed formula canadian 
researchers reported in the medical journal the lancet 
researchers at the university of alberta department of 
pediatrics compared the immune response systems of 57 infants who 
were breastfed with those of 24 bottlefed infants 
the children were found through the edmonton board of public 
health clinics by drs henry pabst and donald spady they were 
given a vaccine for meningitis and severe pneumonia at two four 
and six months according to the article in the current issue of 
lancet 
the report said there were no significant differences in 
measured antibody levels between the two groups before the age of 
seven months 
but after seven months the antibody levels were significantly 
higher in the breastfed infants than the formulafed babies the 
report said 
these findings are strong evidence that breastfeeding 
enhances the active immune response in the first year of life and 
therefore the feeding method must be taken into account in the 
evaluation of vaccine studies in infants the report said 
spady said thursday that it is well known that breastfed babies 
are more healthy than formulafed babies but this is the first 
study to show that their immune systems are stronger and more 
efficient after several months 
it demonstrates that the baby who is breastfed is able to 
mount a more effective immune response spady said in a telephone 
interview 
there is something in the milk that seems to stimulate their 
immune systems to work more effectively he said adding that 
further research will focus on what component of milk stimulates 
the improved response 
the report said breastfed infants were changed to formula 
feeding at an average age of 4 to 5 months but spady said some of 
the breastfed infants were weaned as early as one month

a couple who allegedly stole more than 100 
prints by audobon goya and other artists while working as 
volunteers in the state art museum were arrested in vermont police 
said thursday 
michael richard moskaluk 43 and romona e arnold 33 were 
arrested wednesday and held by the us marshall in burlington vt 
louisiana authorities were seeking their extradition to face at 
least 60 counts of felony theft 
moskaluk was arrested after allegedly trying to sell a dealer a 
print by the john james audubon the 19th century artist and 
naturalist although the print was not one of the stolen works the 
art dealer reported moskaluks offer to the fbi and the tip led to 
the arrest said sgt g hamilton mixon iii 
moskaluk and arnold worked as volunteers at the presbytere 
branch of the museum in new orleans french quarter they 
disappeared about two weeks ago as police were preparing to arrest 
them 
a search of moskaluks house revealed shipping receipts linking 
him to the stolen art police said 
moskaluk has five previous felony convictions including ones 
for art theft police said 
police have recovered all 60 stolen audubon prints but cannot 
return them to the museum immediately because theyre needed as 
evidence said mixon 
fortyeight prints and illustrations by other artists also are 
missing they included two goya prints five lithographs by george 
catlin a 19th century illustrator of western indians and 19 
scenes of mexico or the mexican war by carlos nebel some of those 
works have yet to be traced 
the sooner we send out the word that these things are back the 
happier ill be said director james sefcik whether we get 
something back this week or not remains to be seen i sure hope 
so 
state police said much of the museums art was sold through art 
dealers in france canada chicago philadelphia and new york 
officials said the prints brought as much as 2 million 
the art dealers who purchased the works claimed not to know they 
were stolen and will not be charged police said 
the thefts were discovered about two months ago after an exhibit 
of audubons drawings of louisiana birds 
the stolen audubon prints were part of a complete set of 425 
acquired by the museum 150 years ago shortly after audubon 
finished the socalled elephant folio of prints 2 feet by 3 feet

pennsylvanias abortion law is 
constitutionally sound and should be upheld a state attorney said 
thursday in closing arguments on a court challenge to the toughest 
such statute in any state 
an attorney representing a group of abortion clinics and doctors 
opposed to the law countered that its restrictions would strip 
women of dignity potentially endanger their health and have a 
chilling effect on doctors who perform abortions 
there can be no doubt the challenged provisions burden womens 
rights to abortion said thomas zemaitis a lawyer for the 
clinics 
the conflicting assessments came in closing arguments before 
senior us district judge daniel h huyett iii who has been asked 
to overturn key sections of the law on constitutional grounds 
pennsylvanias law is the most stringent on the books of any 
state only guam a us territory in the pacific has adopted more 
stringent controls 
the case has generated national interest because it might 
eventually provide a way to challenge roe vs wade the landmark 
1973 decision that established abortion as a constitutional right 
lawyers expect a ruling in about a month huyett has blocked 
disputed sections of the law until he rules 
among the disputed provisions are requirements that women notify 
their husbands if they want an abortion and wait 24 hours before 
getting an abortion and for minors to obtain the consent of at 
least one parent or a court order before receiving an abortion 
some of the contested sections of the law are redrafted from a 
1982 statute much of which was struck down by the us supreme 
court in 1986 
senior deputy attorney general kate l mershimer argued that 
there had been important abortion rulings since the roe case 
including a july 1989 supreme court decision in webster vs 
reproductive health sercives inc a missouri case that gave states 
greater leeway to restrict abortion 
ms mershimer made a pointbypoint review of each disputed 
section prefacing her remarks by saying we believe our law 
remains constitutional 
zemaitis said testimony had shown how the law would place undue 
restrictions controls that are far out of step with the roe ruling 
he said the provisions hardly promote an interest in womens 
health they harm womens health 
zemaitis said the state was demeaning women by forcing them 
to wait 24 hours for abortions and suggested that the section was 
written simply to discourage abortions 
thats what this provision is all about if we keep women tied 
up 24 hours theyll change their minds he said 
both mershimer and zemaitis have expressed confidence their side 
would win 
most of the witnesses in the trial have been doctors or 
psychologists the trial has been largely devoid of the 
emotionalism and protests that have typified the national debate 
over abortion the courtroom with seating for about 15 was only 
occasionally filled to capacity

the avianca jet given emergency clearance to 
land here this week was not dangerously low on fuel preliminary 
reports indicate 
air traffic controllers mindful of januarys fatal crash of a 
fuelstarved avianca jet approaching kennedy airport declared a 
fuel emergency on an avianca jet tuesday night although the planes 
crew said it was unnecessary 
the crew aboard avianca flight 20 from bogota colombia told 
air traffic controllers the plane had 15 minutes of fuel left when 
it was about 30 miles south of kennedy 
the controllers put numerous other planes in a holding pattern 
to give the avianca jet a straightin approach and the boeing 767 
landed safely at 924 pm about 12 minutes after its crew radioed 
the tower 
preliminary reports show the plane had at least 13700 pounds of 
fuel in its tanks when it landed which would have kept it in the 
air for about two hours said federal aviation administration 
spokeswoman diane spitaliere 
when the pilot told the control tower he had only 15 minutes of 
fuel left he was probably referring to the amount left before the 
plane would have to start using its reserve fuel said spitaliere 
international flights are required to carry enough reserve fuel 
to reach an alternate airport plus 45 minutes for possible delays 
the faa was waiting for a report on exactly how much fuel the 
plane had she said 
an avianca boeing 707 crashed jan 25 in a wooded area of cove 
neck on the approach to the airport after the crew failed to 
properly alert air traffic controllers that the plane was out of 
fuel the crash killed 73 people and injured 85

the state supreme court on thursday upheld 
a ruling that damage lawsuits against boeing co from the 1985 
crash of a boeing 747 owned by japan air lines should be heard by 
japanese courts 
the jal 747sr slammed into a mountainside on a flight from 
tokyo to osaka on aug 12 1985 killing 520 of the 524 people 
aboard 
in 1987 king county superior court judge gary little dismissed 
the claims on condition that boeing submit to jurisdiction in 
japan waive any statuteoflimitations defenses admit liability 
for compensatory damages and accept the judgment on liability in 
japan 
little granted plaintiffs in the case the right to return to 
superior court for trial on damages if the actions cannot be 
handled expeditiously in japan 
the lawsuits were filed against boeing and jal on behalf of the 
estates of 78 victims including 71 japanese citizens 
before dismissing the damage claims the trial court found that 
boeing had admitted botching part of its 1978 repairs on the aft 
pressure bulkhead of the aircraft which separates the pressurized 
section of the plane from tail section boeing admitted its bungled 
repair caused the crash 
attorneys for the plaintiffs appealed on technical grounds and 
argued that dismissal of the damage claims was fundamentally unfair 
the high court confirmed the trial courts finding that the 
plaintiffs would get an adequate hearing in japan 
plaintiffs have not challenged this finding and indeed 
concede that japanese law provides full compensation justice 
barbara durham wrote for the court 
durham said the trial court had found that virtually all of the 
witnesses documents and other evidence pertaining to the issue of 
damages are in japan favoring trial there 
japanese courts tend to provide smaller rewards in damage

the end of the cold war may produce a 
peace dividend in europe and the united states but the nations of 
southeast asia are going the other way 
defense officials reject the term arms race but all members 
of the association of southeast asian nations except the 
philippines are strengthening their military forces 
most blame uncertain conditions in the region translation the 
likely reduction of us forces compels the six asean members to 
consider providing their own defense 
it has dawned on asean that whatever happens to american bases 
in the philippines reductions in washingtons defense budget will 
mean a smaller us military presence in asia 
a buildup of strategic weapons like missiles and advanced 
fighters is occurring because military commanders are looking to 
control borders and sea lanes 
the relatively stable regional environment which we have long 
taken for granted is now being reshaped abu hassan omar the 
malaysian foreign minister said in a policy statement 
this could pose new challenges for all of us in the region 
especially since a stable security environment has been an 
important underpinning of the regions rapid economic growth 
no reductions in defense spending are contemplated by brunei 
indonesia malaysia singapore the philippines or thailand the 
six asean members 
most are revising their military structures and weapons 
procurement programs to meet what they see as a shifting security 
environment that remains complex and potentially troublesome 
if the united states significantly cuts back its military 
forces in the region this will not be a signal for singapore also 
to reduce our forces said lee hsien loong deputy defense 
minister of singapore 
it will be reason for concern over a potentially destabilizing 
change in the regional balance of power 
lee 37 is the eldest son of prime minister lee kuan yew he 
also serves as trade minister and many expect him to become prime 
minister eventually 
singapore openly supports a continued us military presence in 
the region and a senior us state department official said in 
late july that brunei had joined singapore in offering access to 
the us armed forces 
an arrangement is being negotiated for increased use of 
singapores facilities by american planes and warships details of 
the arrangement with brunei which the us official described as 
an enhanced security relationship have not been disclosed 
officials in several other capitals agree privately with such 
support but are noncommittal in public 
abu hassan put it this way malaysia appreciates the us role 
in the region and it is our sincere hope that the us and the 
philippines will find an amicable solution 
what is more important however is that the close and 
extensive bilateral relations between the us and the asean 
countries which have served our mutual interests be maintained 
malaysias military budget has grown with the economy by 20 
percent in the last two years a memo of understanding signed with 
britain in 1988 covers the purchase of tornado fighters 
antiaircraft missiles and navy corvettes 
brunei with money no object because of its oil riches is

tight military budgets have been the rule in indonesia while the 
country worked its way out of recession but it followed singapore 
in buying usbuilt f16 jet fighters planes of both countries 
use a new firing range in sumatra 
defense spending in singapore is about 6 percent of its gross 
domestic product the sum of all goods and services sold in a 
nation that amounts to the equivalent of 19 billion this year 
for a nation of 27 million people 
diplomats said thailands military budget increased 16 percent 
over last year to 21 billion the thai air force also has f16s 
and plans to buy flight simulators jointly with indonesia and 
singapore for pilot training 
bilateral land sea and air exercises between forces of asean 
members have become common although it is not a military alliance 
foreign secretary raul manglapus of the philippines thinks it is 
time for asean to discuss regional security 
if after sitting down we should decide not to do anything and 
to consider this matter as a purely bilateral matter between us and 
each of the superpowers let that be but at least we will know 
what we are thinking about he told foreign correspondents last 
month in manila 
some officials worry about what will happen in the region as 
us and soviet forces are reduced 
without a persuasive us presence there will be a power 
vacuum which other powers would scramble to fill lee hsien 
loong of singapore said in march 
he gave india as an example and said the japanese too were 
modernizing their forces as an economic superpower it has an 
understandable interest in the state of the region lee said of 
japan 
diplomats say other asean members consider china a greater 
regional threat than india 
the spratleys are a possible powder key china malaysia the 
philippines and vietnam have conflicting claims to the tiny islands 
in the south china sea which are being explored for oil china and 
vietnam came to blows over them in 1988

there have been shows about the hunt for 
elephants submarines bad guys lost tykes and even the elusive 
butterfly of love and now for something completely different 
the beer hunter 
its a sixpart serenade to suds written and hosted by michael 
jackson a british writer and beer expert a man of firm views he 
believes beer is far more than a belch propellant 
it is as varied as wine it is as noble as wine it is as 
complex as wine says jackson whose seven books on the subject 
include the new world guide to beer 
his series premiering aug 23 on cables discovery channel 
studies beer varieties in holland germany belgium great britain 
canada and the united states his american visit reports on san 
franciscos famed anchor steam beer 
jackson who lives in london said hes been writing about beer 
for 16 years he began in journalism 14 years earlier he noted in 
passing that in those days newspaper journalists drank a lot of 
beer 
there are rumors that some still do he was told 
not so many now he said a bit wistfully it worries me 
sometimes when i see these nondrinking journalists i dont see 
how they can function 
jackson took up the cause of beer when he noticed how people 
partook of and talked about beer yet they only wrote about wine 
no doubt considering beer one of the lesser grogs suitable only 
for drinking 
i felt right from square one that beer didnt get the respect 
it deserved said the writer 
he dedicated himself to raising beer criticism and reportage to 
the high indeed mystical level devoted to the world of grappa 
stompa which is italian for grapes that have been stomped on 
there are a variety of wines such as chardonnay cabernet 
sauterne and port he noted but beer is equally diverse there are 
belgian brews with winey tartness fruitytasting ales soft spicy 
dark lagers and so on 
jacksons crusade to make this known and enlighten minds and 
palates has not been without controversy in england where there is 
an organization called the campaign for real ale 
there is debate within that group he said whether some of 
the writers ie me are making beer too elitist 
sometimes no help is needed in new york and los angeles for 
example some citizens they are called yuppies try to be beer 
elitists they invariably cause snickers because no matter where 
they are they always ask barkeeps 
ehhhh what kinds of beer do you have 
but new york and los angeles are very unsophisticated cities 
in terms of beer jackson contends if you want to see people 
who know about beer you have to go to seattle or portland or san 
francisco 
in those cities he said theres been a renaissance of 
serious interest in beer that started in the mid70s with the 
opening of several small breweries in northern california and then 
spread to the pacific northwest 
jackson may well be envied by many journalists particularly 
those who after work like to knock back a round or two of old 
frothingslosh 
a few who take aboard more have been known to propose marriage 
confide dark secrets weep fall off a bar stool or even sing 
the beer that made milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me 
but for jackson moderation is all his tippling is purely 
professional he does admit that getting sloshed is a hazard but 
i dont think ive ever fallen prey to it when ive been tasting 
he did have a small problem when filming the german part of 
the beer hunter at a beer festival he said his director said 
things like can we do that again where you swallow that pint of 
beer can we just do it again 
by 9 pm jackson still was being asked for another take the 
script called for him to conclude things with a cosmic statement on 
beer but he noticed he was approaching a condition known as 
unclear 
i said hey john im just too drunk to do this and he 
said you dont seem drunk to me i said thats because youre 
drunk 
jackson gave it a try though he succeeded this time 
i saw it on the rushes and thought i looked terrible he 
said but nobodys commented on it

good military and business strategy dictates 
avoidance of any action that places one in a position where others 
can call the moves 
us economic policy seems never to learn the lesson 
billions of dollars in loans to less developed countries someday 
may be witten off as uncollectible because of this threat 
american borrowers already pay an interest premium beyond what 
rates otherwise might be 
political leaders have failed to deal effectively with decades 
of budget deficits much of the money corporate and governmental 
is borrowed abroad should foreigners withdraw it suddenly the 
us economy would suffer 
these are just two instances of how vulnerable the united states 
economy is to actions over which is has relatively little control 
the latest of course is the mideast uproar which threatens 
higher domestic oil prices 
higher domestic prices could 
be the difference between an economy growing weakly as now 
and an economy tipped into recession 
fuel inflation moreover an inflation that domestic policy 
could do little to contain demandpull inflation in which an 
excess of demand pulls prices higher can be dealt with internally 
imported inflation may not 
the type of inflation produced by high imported oil prices is 
costpush increased costs to importers are passed to refiners to 
distributors to the companies that buy it to the customers of 
those companies 
while such inflation would mean distressingly higher heating oil 
and gasoline prices it could be devastating to industries some of 
which already are operating on low margins because of global 
competition 
conceivably the higher costs of fuel could mean less air travel 
at a time when airlines are seeking more passengers it could mean 
considerably less driving which in turn could become translated 
into fewer automobile sales 
should higher oil prices stick it would be a serious blow to a 
resolution of the us imbalance of payments that problem perhaps 
overly simplified is that the united states buys more abroad than 
it sells there 
one reason for this imbalance is the growth of oil imports 
which now account for nearly 50 percent of us supplies a record 
high volume that is still growing now it will be growing at even 
higher prices 
the one aspect of higher oil prices a very tentative one at 
this point is that conceivably it could spur domestic exploration 
and development which has been eroding at a pace faster than usage 
is growing 
june domestic crude oil production was just 71 million barrels 
a day a little more than four years ago the country was producing 
91 million barrels a day the shortfall has been made up by 
increased imports 
because of its dependency on oil imports us options in the 
iraqkuwait dispute are limited consider the extent of the 
involvement domestic interest rates the inflation rate balance 
of payments budget deficit 
the situation didnt develop without warning few people who 
lived through the 1970s oilimport problems will ever forget them 
in fact they and their leaders vowed not to forget and then did 
when the price of imported oil soared back then it pitched the 
american economy into chaos and some economists trace to it our 
current problems with inflation high interest rates and chronic 
imbalance of payments 
the warning flag has been flying high and flapping loudly since 
the 1970s but somehow it has been ignored 
ironically some of those other problems the ones that have so 
consumed the interest of policymakers and diverted their attention 
from oil might have had their origins in the very thing theyve 
ignored 
that is in americas dependence on imported oil

thanks to rising oil prices and the flareup of 
trouble in the middle east some old stars of the stock market are 
back for a muchdelayed encore 
even before iraqs invasion of kuwait on thursday the skimpy 
list of new york stock exchange issues making new 52week highs 
gave prominent places to names like schlumberger and halliburton 
from the oil service industry 
and as the hostilities set off an explosive reaction in markets 
around the world oilservice issues racked up further gains 
until about a year ago it had been a long dry spell for 
investors in oil service companies which specialize in providing 
equipment and services such as construction and testing for oil and 
gas producers 
the collapse in oil prices of the mid1980s while helping the 
rest of the economy and the overall stock market to prosper drove 
the oilservice industry into the red in 1986 and 1987 a 
subsequent recovery was slow and tortuous 
oilservice stocks lagged through most of the 1980s while the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials kept soaring to new heights 
schlumberger for example had become a glamour name in the 
portfolios of investing institutions by the time it hit a record 
high of 8725 a share adjusted for splits in late 1980 
then it lapsed into a long decline that drove it as low as 
2737 in 1986 and 26 in the october 1987 crash from its ticker 
symbol slb some wall street traders took to calling it slob 
since early 1989 however the shares have more than doubled 
from 32 to the neighborhood of 67 
similarly halliburton after falling from 87 in 1980 to 1750 
in 1986 has rallied back above 55 
baker hughes the product of a 1987 merger between the 
oilservice companies baker international and hughes tool co has 
since jumped from 1112 to around 33 
some of that dramatic revival has stemmed from an improvement in 
conditions that has already shown up on the industrys bottom line 
few analysts dispute that further profit recovery is in store 
with worldwide oil and gas exploration activity on the upswing 
as a result of rising crude prices companies that provide 
equipment and services to the international oil industry are likely 
to prosper in coming years says standard amp poors weekly 
publication the outlook in a current report on the group 
at the same time however some analysts question whether the 
reallive fundamentals are strong enough to justify the degree of 
enthusiasm traders have shown lately for the stocks 
the oilservice group has become a favorite of speculators they 
note as a means of trying to profit from swings in the price of 
oil 
furthermore they note the experience of the 80s has shown 
that unpredictable shifts in middle east politics can be volatile 
downward as well as upward for oilservice investors 
the value line investment survey in its latest quarterly review 
of the industry cautions we havent made a case for the kind of 
boom apparently anticipated in the prices of some of this sectors 
stocks 
in an analysis published recently as iraq was beginning to 
menace kuwait edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache 
securities concluded 
this development does raise the risk of another oil crisis 
especially since the united states is so dependent on foreign oil 
once again 
but lets not get hysterical instead lets keep a close 
watch on events in the persian gulf

in the political poker game over a 
deficitcutting deal president bush has shown most of his hand 
and the democrats have yet to turn over a card 
that frustrates the white house irks republican negotiators 
makes some gop congressional candidates downright angry and not 
just at democrats 
bush moved from never to maybe to ok on a tax increase three 
abrupt steps in 12 weeks without notice to the republican 
candidates who feel at risk 
gop campaigners who had gone to the voters with their own 
versions of the nonewtaxes position that served bush in 1988 
suddenly came up short one major issue even when theyd disagreed 
with him about the acceptability of a tax increase they felt the 
issue had been blurred 
that internal strain was worse for the fact that the white house 
made no effort to create a republican consensus for the presidents 
changing position when he called the budget summit and said he 
would negotiate without preconditions dropping the no tax barrier 
without actually saying so the word went to congressional leaders 
both parties 
when he made it explicit saying tax revenue increases would 
have to be part of a deficitcutting deal it was by written 
statement no immediate explanation 
and when the administration got specific 10 days ago outlining 
a 54billion deficit reduction plan replete with taxes one a 
ceiling on deductions for state and local income taxes it went to 
gop summit negotiators no notice to the rank and file 
in a way the major advantage of the party in the white house 
has become a liability the democrats the congressional party 
dont speak with one voice they have to fashion bargaining 
positions with a consensus among house senate and committee 
leaders they talked privately about a democratic budget plan to 
put on the negotiating table but couldnt come to terms and didnt 
push it 
at the same time the administration put together a 54billion 
package of spending cuts and tax increases and budget director 
richard g darman presented it to the republican bargaining team 
late in july they agreed or at least acquiesced but their 
consent built no consensus behind the white house plan 
and that problem quickly got worse 
according to the white house the republican plan was prepared 
to be presented simultaneously with a democratic package 
there wasnt any 
besides sen bob packwood rore went public with the 
administration plan saying that a provision to limit the federal 
deductibility of state income taxes ought to satisfy the democrats 
who wanted to increase taxes on the rich that and a proposal for 
steep tax increases on beer and wine stirred an immediate 
backlash especially among governors who saw it as a threat to 
state revenue sources 
the question of whod go first on unpleasant tax and spending 
steps and thus take the political onus has been a sticking point 
all along and the democrats insisted they had not signed off on 
any deal to deliver simultaneous budgetcutting plans 
rep richard a gephardt dmo the majority leader said 
there may have been some miscommunication about what was going to 
happen 
so it seems 
we have been dealing with the democrats in good faith bush 
told restive congressional republicans on wednesday we have a 
plan we are prepared to share with them when they present theirs 
but it already had been shared with the democrats and everybody 
else although not formally presented to the budget summit 
and bushs message to the republicans varied depending on who 
was describing it he said he would veto appropriations bills 
exceeding his original budget although he doesnt have any to veto 
just now and that he said he would enforce sharp automatic cuts 
in federal spending potentially about 100 billion worth unless 
there is a settlement before oct 1 when the new budget year 
begins 
but his own aides differed on how tough a campaign stance hell 
take with the democrats on spending and the deficits with 
intensified budget negotiations due after labor day it may not 
make a lot of difference republican candidates have drawn their 
own lines on the issue thats one reason house republicans voted 
in a july 18 caucus against any new taxes or higher rates on old 
ones rejecting a position bush had just accepted 
theyre the ones with reelection bids on the line this year 
and some of them suspect their political interests are being risked 
in the administration quest for a fiveyear 500billion deficit 
reduction agreement a deal that would last past the next 
presidential campaign

africa needed something to cheer about after the world recession 
of the 1970s and its own debt crisis in the 1980s 
the end of the cold war might have been just the thing but the 
hopedfor peace dividend has not materialized and political 
pluralism is bad news to many african leaders 
according to world bank figures a 10 percent cut in military 
spending would allow the industrialized world to double its 
official aid programs 
that could mean better water supplies for guinea more bread in 
mozambique and new schools and hospitals in the congo 
instead of the money african leaders might have expected 
however they are increasingly worried about stiff competition from 
eastern europes new democracies for western interest aid and 
investment 
they fear eastern europes constant tugging at western heart and 
purse strings will divert badly needed capital and condemn the 
worlds poorest continent to further decades of misery 
what squaring up to the competition means in many cases is shock 
therapy for statedominated economies that are lumbering and often 
corrupt 
economic reform aims to attract more western capital to africa 
but also may force political reform on governments with little or 
no popular support 
african leaders are worried firstly about official aid 
flows and secondly about private investment said roy laishley 
managing editor of africa recovery a un quarterly publication 
although western officials are quick to reassure africa it will 
not be forgotten not all the signs are good analysts estimate aid 
must grow by 4 percent annually to produce a 1 percent increase in 
living standards for ordinary people of the third world 
africa is the only continent where the struggle against poverty 
is a total failure according to the world banks 1990 development 
report 
by the year 2000 subsaharan africa will account for more than 
30 percent of the developing worlds poor compared with 16 percent 
in 1985 even if aid continues to grow at current rates the report 
said 
the bank the largest source of aid to developing countries 
said last month its lending had decreased in the past year for the 
first time since 1985 
moeen a qureshi senior vice president for operations said the 
decline from 213 billion for the year ending in june 1988 to 
207 billion 12 months later was partly due to a reduction in 
loans to china 
world bank loans to africa rose slightly to 393 billion from 
392 billion but qureshi said the bank would be playing a much 
greater role in financing eastern european countries such as 
poland hungary bulgaria and czechoslovakia 
world bank lending is expected to rise again over the next year 
western nations cut development aid for poor nations to 465 
billion last year from 481 billion in 1988 according to the 
organization for economic cooperation and development 
an oecd statement traced the decline to special factors in the 
timing of payments to multilateral institutions mainly the world 
bank 
joseph wheeler chairman of the organizations development 
assistance committee said third world aid remained a high priority 
and the decrease did not involve shift of funds to eastern europe 
officials of the european community point out that the 625 
million of aid set aside this year for poland hungary yugoslavia 
czechosolvakia bulgaria and east germany is only 5 percent of the 
15 billion fiveyear lome iv agreement channeling assistance to 
african caribbean and pacific nations 
the latest of the lome packages named for the capital of togo 
represents a 46 percent nominal increase and a 20 percent rise in 
real terms said xavier prats an ec spokesman for development 
third world populations expanding rapidly however and lome iv 
still means only about 2 in new aid per person per year for 
19901995 analysts say that compares with an annual 20 per 
person for a threeyear ec program in poland and hungary 
european community aid to those countries and bulgaria 
czechoslovakia east germany and yugoslavia is expected to reach 
125 billion a year by 1992 and the ec will be a major backer of 
a new european bank for reconstruction and development 
in addition to aid theres a need for additional investment 
in africa and thats certainly being undermined by the eagerness 
of the business community to look east and compete for future 
positions in eastern europe said jos lemmers director of the 
council of europes center for global interdependence and 
solidarity 
barber b conable president of the world bank said on a recent 
visit to west germany the developing nations must work harder to 
attract investments otherwise money will go to eastern europe 
private capital goes where the most attractive opportunities 
are he said 
that now appears to be africas main problem 
because of easier opportunities in eastern europe fewer western 
investors are willing to brave the unpredictable often 
anticapitalist african business climate unless political leaders 
offer sweeping economic reforms analysts say 
president kenneth kaunda decided recently to double the price of 
flour and other basic commodities to shore up zambias flagging 
economy zambians protested violently and security forces arrested 
an army officer for plotting a coup 
i would say some of the reforms african nations are using to 
attract foreign investment are dangerous a un africa 
specialist said on condition of anonymity 
its a high political risk to take to implement austerity 
measures at a time when very poor people already have next to no 
money in their pockets 
prodemocracy protests have taken place in several african 
nations this year 
many western aid experts are critical of demands by some donors 
that continued aid be linked to political reform 
what is essential is to have greater respect of human 
rights an ec official said also on condition of anonymity 
that doesnt mean just transplanting westernstyle democracies to 
africa they are not always practical and often not possible 
lemmers center at the council of europe is sponsoring a series 
of eastwestsouth conferences scheduled to begin in budapest 
hungary this year 
he said africa could benefit from the end of the cold war 
citing new market potential in eastern europe for third world 
agricultural products 
instead of laying the blame for africas economic ills solely at 
the door of the former european colonial powers african leaders 
now seem more willing to shoulder some of the responsibility 
president quett masire of botswana described the new attitude as 
a turning point for the continent 
we are willing to go to the doctor and ask for the right 
medication he said recently after a 70nation conference on 
africa in the netherlands masire and robert mcnamara former 
president of the world bank were cochairmen

the european communitys effort to 
revive the economies of eastern europe causes anxiety among 
southeast asian nations that seek aid and investment 
while welcoming the emergence of democracy in the former soviet 
bloc some members of the association of southeast asian nations 
worry that resources will be diverted to that region at their 
expense 
indonesia malaysia thailand singapore brunei and the 
philippines make up the assocition a loose grouping formed in 1967 
to foster regional economic and cultural development 
all six are apprehensive that removal of most trade barriers 
among the 12 european community nations in 1992 will hurt their 
exportdriven economies and seek assurances that eastern europes 
restoration will not be at their expense 
aseans fear is that the communitys assistance to these 
countries would result in the diversion of its assistance from 
other developing countries especially asean said foreign 
minister abu hassan omar of malaysia 
the communitys investment in asean has been lagging behind 
those of japan and the united states he said at a news 
conference 
with the opening of eastern and central europelion 
investment by ec countries in asean member nations is far behind 
that of japan and the united states and has grown at a slower 
rate asean officials say europeans favor investments within the ec 
or in north america and fear the pattern will reinforced by the 
unified market 
some in asean feel the region risks becoming japans economic 
backyard if european trade and investment goes elsewhere prime 
minister lee kuan yew of singapore expressed that view on a recent 
trip to europe 
he said returns on investments in eastern europe might not equal 
those on money put into nations of the pacific rim many of which 
are booming 
to make east european work forces highly productive and 
competitive that cannot be done overnight lee declared 
officials of asean said rechanneled aid and investment would be 
direct losses and eastern europe also might become a lowcost 
trading competitor 
indonesia appears most vulnerable to such a diversion it 
remains heavily dependent on help from abroad and expects more than 
onequarter of revenue for the 199091 fiscal year to come from 
foreign aid 
more than 45 billion will reach it this year from the 
intergovernmental group on indonesia an organization of 13 donor 
countries the world bank and similar agencies

hundreds of colombians have died and the 
united states has spent millions of dollars in a yearlong effort 
to destroy the medellin cartel but the war goes on and the cocaine 
still flows north 
a presidential candidate was shot down at a rally the night of 
aug 18 1989 and the government shocked and outraged declared 
war on drug gangs that had become so powerful they threatened to 
take over the country 
luis carlos galan who spoke out against the cocaine barons was 
standing on a wooden platform acknowledging the cheers and applause 
of thousands of people when hired killers opened fire with machine 
guns 
his death began a chain of events that terrorized colombia and 
revealed the horror a voracious us appetite for cocaine could 
create 
a year later the war rages on increasingly it appears 
unwinnable but the government has scored some victories 
national police have seized a record 40 tons of cocaine so far 
this year in raids on jungle laboratories more than the 33 tons 
captured in all of 1989 
cocaine delivered in miami costs 35000 a kilogram or 22 
pounds before last august the price had been as low as 10000 
officials say the higher prices indicate success in reducing the 
supply but the flow has not been stopped 
galans murder awakened colombians from a slumber that had 
permitted drug traffickers free rein president virgilio barco 
issued his declaration of war and the worlds attention focused on 
this south american country 
at the rally the initial reaction to the shots was like the 
response to an earthquake when people know something is terribly 
wrong but do not realize immediately that the ground is heaving 
beneath them 
because of the noisy scene the rapid gunfire made popping 
sounds like small firecrackers not even galans bodyguards 
understood immediately panic and screams began when galan fell 
mortally wounded 
two more presidential candidates were murdered soon afterward 
and the drug gangs bombed a packed airliner killing all 107 people 
aboard in several cities car bombs exploded at restaurants 
supermarkets schools and in the streets 
some bombs in bogota the capital were so powerful they left 
huge clouds hanging over the city of 6 million people 
colombians had viewed terrorism in places like lebanon or israel 
as distant wars among fanatics 
now they had their own terrorists not religious or political 
fanatics with ageold grievances but drug traffickers who killed 
other people coldly to protect their business 
the medellin cartel largest of the cocaine gangs was taking in 
billions of dollars a year by 1989 and warning public officials to 
get out of the way those who couldnt be intimidated were murdered 
we now know that the cartel is like a monstrous octopus in the 
ocean with only the top of its head visible a source involved 
in planning the antidrug war told the associated press the 
tentacles extend to the united states and around the world he 
said referring to bank deposits bribes and murder 
like virtually every other person involved in fighting the 
medellin cartel the source would speak only on condition of 
anonymity 
with galans death and the government crackdown that followed 
the world opened its eyes to the danger of the drug gangs 
president bush sent 65 million worth of military aid to 
colombia from a special fund available to him 
in february he met with the presidents of colombia bolivia and 
peru which provide most of the worlds cocaine in the colombian 
port city of cartagena bush agreed to increase economic aid to the 
impoverished andean nations to help them and their farmers find 
alternate sources of income 
at another summit in britain western european nations 
recognized the high price colombia was paying in the drug war and 
agreed to help 
justice minister roberto salazar noted that other countries were 
realizing the drug trade was international not a colombian problem 
the world began to recognize that colombia is providing 90 
percent of leadership in fighting the drug scourge he said in an 
interview 
because of police raids drug traffickers have moved many 
cocaine processing operations to neighboring brazil and ecuador 
salazar said and the labs being destroyed are so rudimentary they 
can be replaced in a few days 
another problem is the billions of dollars available for bribes 
if a cop in new york or miami making 30000 a year can be 
bribed by drug traffickers there then imagine how easy it is to 
bribe one here who makes only about 2000 an agent of the us 
drug enforcement administration told the ap 
most of the war on traffickers falls to the 80000man national 
police force led by gen miguel gomez 52 who has a university 
degree in education 
fortunately weve got an honest cop at the top a us 
diplomat said 
gomez has dismissed half a dozen colonels several dozen other 
officers and hundreds of ordinary policemen in an effort to clean 
up the force 
a source close to the search for bribe takers said a police 
colonel can make 15000 a month in payoffs 
gomez said he had only 22 helicopters for raiding labs and 
fighting the cocaine gangs and needed 20 more 
salazar the justice minister said the struggle involves much 
more than police or military action 
some countries allow the shipment of cocaineprocessing 
chemicals to colombia he said and the drug lords can buy all the 
weapons they want on the international arms market 
huge arms shipments destined for colombias drug traffickers 
have been seized in the past year but many others obviously get 
through raids on cartel hideouts over the years have turned up 
hundreds of thousands of weapons 
foreign governments appear either unable or unwilling to stop 
the laundering of drug money salazar said in the interview 
industrialized countries must strengthen regulation of banks he 
said and praised us requirements that banks report all accounts 
worth more than 5000 
when they can pick up cellular phones and transfer millions of 
dollars they can own half the world salazar said of the cocaine 
barons 
he said the success of colombias war on the cartels depends in 
large part on how much of their assets are seized elsewhere 
president barcos government negotiated an agreement with the 
united states that allows colombia to share in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars of traffickers assets seized in the united 
states 
cesar gaviria the new president pledged before his 
inauguration aug 7 to press the antidrug war but has said 
colombia will not fight it alone 
gaviria has not indicated whether he will continue barcos 
policy of extraditing trafficking suspects twenty have been sent 
to the united states for trial in the past year but none are 
believed to be major figures 
salazar said colombia must consider reforming its justice system 
so the suspects can be tried at home in the past judges have been 
bribed or coerced into letting drug traffickers go 
drugtrafficking cases should be handled by special judges who 
live and work in protected areas the justice minister said

pablo escobar a former car thief who 
became a billionaire cocaine trafficker remains at large in the 
colombian andes where the fear and loyalty of peasants protect him 
there may never have been a manhunt like the one for escobar 
who runs the drug gang that smuggles most of the cocaine sold in 
the united states 
speculation that security forces didnt really want to catch 
escobar and other members of the medellin cartel ended dec 15 
when the army tracked down and killed gonzalo rodriguez gacha the 
cartels no 2 man 
police killed all five of rodriguezs bodyguards and his 
17yearold son freddy who was carrying weapons 
rodriguez ran into a banana plantation firing at a helicopter 
gunship pursuing him and the helicopter riddled the cocaine 
trafficker with bullets 
some observers say police do not intend to take escobar alive 
because his men could might kidnap government officials and hold 
them hostage until their boss was freed 
the search appears relentless 
police set up roadblocks and soldiers raid suspected hideouts 
using sophisticated us radio monitoring and tracking devices 
they try to trace transmissions believed to come from escobars 
bodyguards 
colombias 80000 national police have mounted several major 
operations based on tips about where escobar could be found 
security forces seem to have come close three times in the last 
year 
several weeks ago the army thought it had escobar surrounded 
when soldiers broke into a shack they found it empty but a coffee 
pot was steaming and there was evidence escobar had been hiding out 
there 
a wanted poster with escobars photograph has appeared regularly 
on television 
although the government has offered 500000 for his capture it 
is doubtful many colombians are eager to cash in escobar and his 
cohorts have killed at least hundreds of people perhaps thousands 
also many poor colombians hold escobar in high regard he 
approaches sainthool in a neighborhood of medellin the cartels 
headquarters where he replaced slum shacks with houses of brick 
and cinder block 
gen miguel gomez chief of the national police said escobar 
was moving from hideout to hideout in the northwestern state of 
antioquia 
escobars genorosity to peasants makes information on the drug 
lords whereabouts hard to come by 
he owns every pair of eyes in antioquia a foreign diplomat 
said 
asked about escobars ability to elude the dragnet gen gomez 
said we have our own methods and we will succeed

for practical everyday purposes the debate 
about whether the economy is in recession or just this side of it 
is all but meaningless 
recession is a technical statistical arbitrary definition it 
isnt a line that when crossed rearranges the perspective any more 
than the autumnal equinox brings a sudden change to fall weather 
for many people it is a rather academic event occurring when 
the economy suffers two consecutive quarters of shrinking gross 
national product and that means you are at least six months into 
it before you know it 
in fact there have been recessions that werent demonstrated 
until they were over and recessions so mild they might have 
represented better times than during some officially designated 
growth periods 
some recessions sneak up gradually as some economists believe 
is happening now and others explode as in 1973 when president 
ford was campaigning to whip inflation now not realizing that 
a deep recession had begun 
there have been recessions that skipped some geographical and 
occupational areas and a recession in the mid1980s that 
encompassed most of the nation but never qualified as one because 
good times in a few states skewed the averages 
at one extreme there have been recessions so deep unemployment 
rose to 25 percent and so long they ruined most of a decade as in 
the late unlamented 1930s and at the other extreme recessions 
that came and departed silently 
far more important than the technical definitions are 1 the 
strength or weakness of the economy and 2 whether it is gaining 
strength or losing it right now the economy is weak and it is 
losing strength 
real gross national product rose at an annual rate of just 12 
percent during the second quarter of the year the fifth straight 
quarter of less than 2 percent growth rates a healthy economy 
would grow twice as fast 
for probably the only time since the recession of the early 
1980s the major private sectors of the economy consumer 
spending business fixed investment housing construction and net 
exports declined simultaneously 
in the same quarter real disposable personal income rose at an 
anemic annual rate of less than 1 percent consumer confidence is 
unsteady big ticket sales are off some housing values are down 
homebuilding is depressed 
some perhaps most of this is a consequence of what is called 
the federal reserves tight money policy restrict the flow of 
money to the economy and the price of it interest rates goes up 
or remains high 
tight money means tougher borrowing conditions the intent of 
which is to suppress activity in real estate for example easy 
money policies of the mid1980s had led to bad loans an excess of 
construction and bankruptcies 
tight money however is a blunt instrument hurting bad risks 
and good together it is the weapon now being used by the fed to 
bring down what are seen as inflationary pressures but it could 
create new ones 
small business for example is complaining that it is bearing 
the brunt of the slowdown effort and a survey by the us chamber 
of commerce tends to confirm that claim 
the survey found that 20 percent of all businesses seeking 
credit in the past six months had trouble borrowing but that for 
smaller commpanies those with sales of less than 1 million the 
percentage rose to 274 
small companies are generally the innovators and job creators 
they are the price cutters they are risktakers capable of 
failing to be sure but also of growing swiftly they are the 
future competition for giant companies 
for them the source of future economic growth the recession 
has already begun no matter that the official declaration of 
recession has not been made

alfred checchi is trying to make northwest 
airlines bigger and friendlier but he has been battling a sluggish 
industry and some isolated turbulence in his first year as chairman 
on the aug 3 anniversary of the day checchis group finalized a 
365 billion buyout of the nations fourthlargest carrier 
northwest is eyeing growth despite an industrywide slump 
with eyes on eastern airlines atlanta hub and possibly other 
eastern jewels checchi has discussed the idea of buying the 
carriers assets out of bankruptcy court proceedings 
they barely had the northwest deal done before they started 
looking at the landscape for acquisitions said duane woerth 
head of the union representing northwests 5600 pilots hes 
changed the focus from top to bottom 
in the past 18 months northwest has gone from being a 
conservatively managed takeover target with a fat balance sheet to 
a highly leveraged aggressor headed by industry novices 
racked with labor strife and performance problems under former 
chairman steven rothmeier northwest under checchi is at peace with 
its unions and winning back customers who had come to know it as 
northworst 
but along the way there have been distractions 
three northwest pilots were arrested march 8 and accused of 
flying a passenger jet while under the influence of alcohol 
northwest also has said it is one of many airlines being 
investigated by the justice department for possible industry price 
fixing 
checchi and other top executives at the airline have been 
declining interviews for weeks but he repeatedly has said he 
intends to double the carriers size in five years and make it 
americas most preferred airline 
theyve improved the morale and the spirit of the people but 
i dont think theyve made any money said mort beyer an 
aviation consultant in arlington va my impression is that their 
costs will be increasing faster than their revenues i continue to 
watch it with concern 
since the takeover checchi has filled eight of the top 10 posts 
at northwest and has lost a lead fleet manager to united airlines 
former chief financial officer william trubeck also has resigned 
but will act indefinitely as a consultant five new executives had 
no airline management experience checchi director gary l wilson 
chief executive officer fred rentschler president frederic malek 
and chief financial officer john dasburg 
rentschler had been chief executive at beatrice cos and 
dasburg malek wilson and checchi had worked together at marriott 
corp where wilson was checchis boss 
they are primarily deal makers cliff ehrlich senior vice 
president of human resources at marriott said of checchi and 
wilson i think they wake up in the morning thinking about deals 
and go to bed thinking about deals 
checchi has said the airline is healthy despite a 72 million 
operating loss in the final quarter of last year and a 90 million 
operating loss in the first quarter of this year nevertheless the 
335 billion takeover debt has been slashed to about 2 billion 
putting the airline three years ahead of its sevenyear repayment 
schedule spokesman doug miller said 
but most of the payments have been made from cash reserves by 
selling and leasing back some planes and restructuring real estate 
beyer said 
that cant go on forever he said they need better cash 
flows and the outlook for the year is down the industry has had 
25 billion in operating losses in the past nine months but 
nobody pays attention to that 
mike hamilton an analyst for the leuthhold group of 
minneapolis said northwest could afford an acquisition but only 
at the right price 
i dont think hell get them easterns assets at bargain 
prices hamilton said but there is nothing lost in trying 
eastern assets would fit northwest by adding passenger loads 
expanding maintenance space and feeding northwests pacific rim 
routes but labor trouble could break out if checchi hires from the 
nonunion ranks at eastern said guy cook president of 
international association of machinists district lodge 143 
we will war with them if they come up with stupid ideas 
cook said but at this point i have no reason to war with them 
checchi hasnt been tested by contract talks but woerth and 
cook say relations are vastly improved for 40 years northwest 
workers considered themselves pawns of draconian managers cook 
said now they sense some cooperation 
in the old days for example a collision of ground vehicles 
triggered automatic threeday suspensions cook said a new 
disciplinary program instead emphasizes good performances he said 
what i notice is the people throughout the company are more 
proud of the airline woerth said 
meanwhile travelers have observed a more punctual and reliable 
airline northwest recently completed six months of ontime 
performance even with or ahead of comparable carriers according 
to us transportation department reports in addition fewer bags 
have been lost 
the improvements dovetail with a fiveyear plan to invest 422 
million to improve food service seat space cabin decor and speed 
of maintenance 
when it was northwest orient it was a class airline said 
jim maggio whose new york firm is a travel agent for general 
motors acceptance corp theyre getting back to that 
hamilton said the pilots arrests and other incidents could have 
left bigger stains on the company but checchis management team 
moved swiftly including firing the pilots trial of the pilots 
began this week in federal court 
the one thing they have is a lot of common sense hamilton 
said theyll make a mistake but they dont make the same 
mistake twice

iraqs invasion of neighboring kuwait will 
likely mean higher energy costs for much of the nation but the 
federal government says the longterm effect wont be significant 
oil experts say its difficult to predict exactly how much 
prices will rise but that higher costs on the wholesale side will 
trickle down to consumers 
concern that oil production and shipments might be disrupted in 
the middle east the source of about a quarter of us oil imports 
already has caused wholesale energy prices to soar 
in futures trading crude oil jumped more than 150 a 42gallon 
barrel while unleaded gasoline and heating oil gained more than 3 
cents a gallon 
trilby lundberg manager of a biweekly survey of gasoline prices 
that bears her name said spot checks show that some wholsale 
gasoline distributors have raised their prices around a dime a 
gallon from wednesday due to the recent increases in prices from 
their suppliers 
iraq invaded and seized control of its much smaller neighbor at 
the northern tip of the persian gulf early thursday the attack 
followed weeks of tension between the two countries over iraqi 
accusations that kuwait stole oil from its territory and was 
costing it billions of dollars in revenue by overproducing and 
helping depress the price of oil 
in response to the invasion president bush embargoed iraqs 
588000 barrels a day of oil imports to this country a cutoff that 
analysts said could be made up from other countries 
henson moore the deputy secretary of energy told reporters in 
washington that american consumers had little reason to worry 
mainly because an excess world supply of oil would cushion the loss 
of iraqi and kuwaiti imports for an indefinite period 
we do not see any imminent threat to the united states 
as a result of the loss of iraqi oil moore told a news conference 
at department headquarters nor do we see any longterm 
significant increase in prices 
john easton the assistant energy secretary for international 
affairs and energy emergencies told the news conference that the 
international energy agency the 21nation organization of oil 
consuming countries had tentatively scheduled a meeting of its 
board of governors next week in paris to consider the iraqi 
situation 
wholesale prices already had been rising in recent days in 
reaction to an agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries of which kuwait and iraq are members to restrain crude 
production in order to raise the price of its oil to a target of 
21 a barrel 
on thursday the september contract for west texas intermediate 
the benchmark grade of us crude jumped 157 to settle at 2311 
a 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange the 
nearmonth contract for the crude had traded in the low 16 range 
earlier this summer 
among refined petroleum products unleaded gasoline for 
september delivery settled up 38 cents to 6807 cents a gallon 
heating oil settled up 35 cents to 6469 cents a gallon 
the general rule of thumb according to industry experts is 
every dollar rise in the barrel of crude oil means a rise of two 
cents to a nickel at the pumps 
peter beutel a trader and vice president for merrill lynch 
energy futures predicted home heating oil prices would rise at 
least a nickel a gallon by the fall due to the impact of the 
invasion he said prices at the gas pumps could rise between 5 and 
10 cents a gallon by labor day one of the heaviest driving times 
of the year for americans 
the average national price of a gallon of gas including taxes 
was around 118 cents by late july according to the biweekly 
lundberg survey of nearly 13000 service stations 
edward ryan an oil trader with dean witter reynolds inc said 
consumers should be spared an immediate increase in energy prices 
because of the current world glut of crude partly due to high 
production of the opec 
in the united states alone supplies of unleaded gasoline are up 
about 10 percent from a year ago to 1672 million barrels from 
1563 million according to figures from the commodities brokerage 
refco inc crude stocks are up to 3387 million barrels from 3306 
million 
you may not see the impact on the consumer level for at least 
four to eight weeks ryan said the current supplies on hand 
are adequate and i just dont see retail prices reacting in the 
same way as on the wholesale level 
john h oconnell an energy analyst at refco said the oil 
companies could absorb some of the increase 
i think the oil companies will be cautious about passing it 
price hike on to the consumers for fear it might hurt 
consumption he said

workers at pratt amp whitneys east 
hartford plant say theyre not surprised at the companys plan to 
trim its work force to make up for a drop in defense business 
people would have had to have had their heads in the sand not 
to expect this said john makowiec of east longmeadow mass a 
work leader who has been employed by pratt for 30 years 
tom leduc of enfield a millwright who has been with the 
company 25 years said there is always talk about reducing the work 
force so there is no point in worrying 
people now just wait until their time comes he said 
the aerospace giant announced thursday it will eliminate 4000 
jobs by the end of 1993 mostly through attrition because of an 
expected dropoff in its military engine business 
the action will reduce the size of the jet enginemakers us 
work force by about 11 percent with pratt amp whitneys florida 
operations suffering the greatest impact 
although it has a 20 billion backlog of orders for commercial 
engines the company said that would not offset the projected 
decline in defense contracts 
pratt amp whitney said half of the job reductions will take place 
at its connecticut maine and georgia operations which employ 
28300 people with connecticut bearing the brunt of the cutbacks 
the company makes all of its commercial and military engines in 
connecticut where it has a work force of 25400 at plants in east 
hartford southington north haven and middletown it is the 
states largest private employer 
the other 2000 jobs will be eliminated from pratt amp whitneys 
west palm beach operations where 8400 are employed mostly in 
military engineering and testing 
we think that this shrinkage reflects where we see the defense 
department going said curtis linke a spokesman for pratt amp 
whitney a division of united technologies corp 
with easing world tensions the budget ax is expected to come 
down on prattpowered air force planes such as the f16 jet 
fighter the advanced tactical fighter and the c17 transport 
the military business is still very viable for us it is just 
getting smaller linke said 
orders for commercial engines continue to be strong but 
deliveries are spread out over the next decade the company said 
in 1989 pratt amp whitney earned 25 billion from its defense 
sales or about 36 percent of its business commercial engine sales 
accounted for 34 billion in revenues or 49 percent revenues 
from engines built for general aviation totalled 1 billion 
pratt amp whitney normally loses about 6 percent of its work force 
through attrition each year but some layoffs will also be 
necessary because attrition never takes places in exactly the 
right places linke said 
the company said up to 300 workers could be laid off in florida 
this fall and oconnor said an undetermined number of layoffs are 
also likely in connecticut 
the cutbacks will be the second big work force reduction in two 
years the company eliminated 2650 salaried jobs in 1988 and 1989 
citing intense competition 
the machinists union which represents workers at all four 
connecticut plants said company officials had agreed to meet with 
union leaders in two weeks to discuss ways of avoiding layoffs 
romegialli said the union will push a number of proposals 
including an expansion of the companys early retirement program 
and the transfer of affected workers to other divisions of united 
technologies

insurance industry analysts say a move 
by europes largest insurance company to buy firemans fund 
insurance co would give the firm a strong position in the us 
market 
allianz ag and firemans parent company fund america companies 
announced agreement on the 33 billion cash deal thursday 
allianz true to their statement is interested in a bigger 
presence in the largest insurance market in the world said james 
ramenda an insurance analyst with northington partners in avon 
conn 
clearly the us market is more than half of the world 
market and you cant in this day and age be isolated from that 
said bob branche managing director of branche research group near 
philadelphia 
firemans fund a nationwide property and casualty insurance 
company is the principal subsidiary of fund american and had 
gross premiums in 1989 totaling 32 billion 
allianz based in munich west germany had a worldwide premium 
value of 20 billion in 1989 and has 223 subsidiaries in 45 
countries allianz already operates in 20 states company officials 
said 
analysts agreed that the purchase would help allianz prepare for 
europes economic changes scheduled for 1992 when the common 
market countries plan to ease trade barriers 
with 1992 and its promise of increased competition looming 
diversification makes a lot of sense ramenda said 
the 33 billion price tag which is almost three times 
firemans funds book value was the price allianz had to pay for a 
larger share of the us market ramenda said 
foreign buyers need to find friendly deals in the us 
market because hostile deals can be blocked easily at the state 
regulatory level he said 
the price simply testifies to firemans funds negotiating 
ability ramenda said 
under the agreement allianz will acquire 100 percent of 
firemans fund insurance stock fund american will buy back 
firemans funds common stock portfolio and other longterm 
investments for 22 billion in cash 
when the transaction is closed fund american will repurchase 
all 300000 shares of convertible preferred stock of fund american 
now owned by ifint sa a luxembourg corporation for 434 million 
in cash plus unpaid dividends 
fund american also plans to offer shareholders 800 million in 
assets either through dividends or a tender offer the company 
said 
the sale will convert fund american from an insurance company to 
an investment company said thomas sargent an insurance analyst 
with conning amp co of hartford 
firemans fund headquartered in novato calif was founded in 
1863 in 1968 it was acquired by the american express co and in 
1985 became an independent company during what was then the largest 
initial public offering in the history of the new york stock 
exchange 
the companys revenues increased from 33 billion in 1985 to 
43 billion in 1987 but slipped to 329 billion last year net 
income also peaked at 404 million in 1987 last years profits 
fell to 116 million from 279 million in 1988 
joyce culbert an insurance analyst with sg warburg and co in 
new york said she couldnt understand firemans funds appeal to 
allianz since the us company has been fighting rising claims 
costs and flat premium prices 
the question is what do you do to make it better and do the 
germans know something that firemans fund chairman jack byrne 
doesnt know culbert said 
but ramenda said allianz would simply ride out firemans 
problems until the us insurance market begins to improve 
probably in 1992 
the us markets highly competitive he said so its 
unlikely that any one player could buck the cycle 
wolfgang muller a member of the board of management of allianz 
said in a statement that his company can add value to firemans 
fund insurance through our international capabilities but any 
advances would come carefully and slowly 
the transaction which is subject to approval by insurance and 
other regulatory authorities and fund american stockholders is 
expected to be completed early next year

rise 36 percent 
general motors corp has not announced tentative 1991 prices 
generally the prices announced in midsummer are for dealers 
placing large orders especially for rentalcar company fleets 
there is a chance that prices will change before the vehicles are 
offered for retail sale 
chrysler motors chairman bennett bidwell said thursday that part 
of the companys pricing strategy includes reducing the 
significance of cash rebates and lowinterest financing in buying 
and selling a car 
we would hope to deescalate the use of incentives bidwell 
said adding however no one certainly not chrysler is going 
to turn this parade around 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca blamed incentive costs which have 
been averaging more than 1000 for every car and truck it sells 
for causing a drop in secondquarter earnings to 180 million down 
472 percent from the same time last year 
gm which reported a 40 percent profit decline and ford whose 
profits fell by 45 percent said they also were hurt by the cost of 
incentives as well as by economic problems in brazil 
gm wont say precisely how much it spent on incentives during 
the quarter ford put its average cost at 1050 per vehicle 
chrysler will lower by 1100 the sticker price on the dodge 
monaco le the dodge dynasty will cost 560 more than this year 
all the comparisons involve comparably equipped vehicles 
popular optional equipment on one model years vehicles often is 
included as standard equipment on later models that boosts the 
price and makes yeartoyear comparisons difficult 
also muddying yeartoyear comparisons is padding the automaker 
builds into prices for incentives 
weve allowed allowances for rebates and incentives in the 91 
prices bidwell said

the makers of latenight televisions 
infomercials are forming their industrys first trade 
association 
its a watershed infomercial marketer greg renker said 
thursday in announcing the formation of the national infomercial 
marketing association to work with congress and the staff of the 
federal trade commission in developing advertising standards for 
the industry 
it gives us legitimacy in the eyes of capitol hill and 
consumers and it establishes us as a longterm industry said 
renker whose palm desert califbased guthyrenker corp markets 
selfhelp and motivational courses 
infomercials or programlength commercials have had a 
checkered history since they were introduced in the mid80s often 
masking as talk shows or investigative news specials that 
actually hawked a product 
thousands of complaints over the years prompted us rep norman 
sisisky dva to hold hearings on the industry before the house 
small business subcommittee that he chairs leaders of the 
infomercial industry met with sisisky last week as they worked to 
form the association 
if this is a sincere effort to address the problem of 
infomercial advertising abuses it is a welcome development and a 
victory for consumers sisisky said thursday 
the infomercial marketers also met separately with barry cutler 
director of the ftcs bureau of consumer protection which has 
filed six law enforcement actions against infomercial makers in 
the past few months 
we want to encourage the ftc to nail infomercial producers who 
make false and misleading claims or are deceptive renker said 
we want to discourage them from lumping us all into the same 
category and creating laws and regulations that hurt our sales 
effectiveness in the long term 
the biggest players in the industry attended the washington 
meetings and are joining the association which plans to hold its 
first meeting on sept 13 in washington dc 
in addition to guthyrenker they included new york citybased 
synchronal corp and the phildelphiaarea based companies american 
telecast quantum marketing international inc and media arts 
international inc 
one of the frustrating elements of our new association is that 
the television stations are the gatekeepers renker said they 
must take responsibility for the programming time that they sell 
and it is incumbent on them to recognize association members and to 
scrutinize those who do not have a proven track record in the 
industry

the nations unemployment rate jumped to 55 
percent in july the highest jobless rate in two years the 
government said today in a report providing mounting evidence of a 
weak economy 
the labor department said that julys 03 percentage point rise 
up from the june jobless rate of 52 percent put the american 
unemployment rate at its highest level since it hit 56 percent in 
august 1988 
the sharp increase in unemployment was due largely to the 
economys loss of 219000 jobs the government said though about 
160000 of those americans who lost jobs were temporary census 
workers laid off by the government private industry payrolls also 
lost 45000 jobs 
the report shows that the economy appears to be caving in to a 
fullfledged recession said allen sinai chief economist at the 
boston co 
other analysts said the unemployment data showed an economy 
skirting the edge of a recession 
the economy is just hung up on a rock on the middle of the 
road its still an economy thats inching ahead but at a glacial 
pace were close to the edge it wouldnt take much of a breeze 
to push us over said robert dederick chief economist at the 
northern trust co of chicago 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
noted that weak job growth had spread to the nations service 
sector 
that sector had been the major engine of job growth during the 
current economic expansion but that engine seems to have sputtered 
in july mrs norwood said 
on wall street today the stock market sold off sharply in 
early trading the dow jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 
5371 points to 281089 
job losses in the private sector were largely due to the 
continuing deterioration in the nations construction and 
manufacturing sectors the government said 
many analysts were bracing for even worse unemployment news in 
the months ahead as the impact of a prolonged period of economic 
sluggishness begins to force the jobless rate higher 
todays report provides the first indication of whether the 
economy fared any better so far in the third quarter than earlier 
in the year analysts were disturbed by government data last week 
that showed the economy grew at an annual rate of just 12 percent 
from april through june 
the unemployment rate is derived from a household survey by the 
labor department while job growth numbers are figured from a 
separate survey of business establishments the job growth survey 
is often considered a more reliable indicator of economic activity 
construction payrolls fell by 50000 jobs after seasonal 
adjustment posting the fifth consecutive decline to reflect 
continued weakness in the housing market the government said the 
number of jobs in the construction industry is more than 100000 
below the level of last fall the government said 
the nations manufacturing slump continued in july but factory 
job losses were not as great as they have been in the past last 
month factory payrolls fell by 7000 jobs marking the 15th time 
in 16 months that manufacturing jobs declined 
since reaching a postrecession peak in march 1989 nearly 
350000 factory jobs have been lost 
meanwhile the service sector which has been carrying the 
economy in past months began to show weakness as well the 
government said service sector jobs fell by 160000 but that 
number included temporary census workers 
still several industries within the service sector lost small 
numbers of jobs including wholesale trade finance insurance and 
real estate and business services retail trade added 20000 jobs 
health services which had added an average of 50000 jobs each 
month in the first half of this year expanded by only half that 
amount in july by adding 25000 new jobs 
labor costs which have been rising and are being blamed for 
worsening the nations inflation problems continued to speed up 
average hourly earnings posted a 06 percent rise in july to 
1009 up from the 1003 the average worker earned per hour in 
june 
the labor departments household survey showed that overall 
total civilian employment was about 118 million in july down from 
the 1184 million employed in june 
the jobless numbered 68 million up from 64 million employed 
in june 
the average manufacturing work week was down slightly in july 
falling from 41 hours to 409 hours manufacturing overtime was 37 
hours in july a slight decline from junes average of 38 overtime 
hours 
last months 55 percent unemployment rate pushed it beyond the 
level it has held for more than a year since september 1988 the 
jobless rate before last month had fluctuated within a tenth of a 
percentage point of 53 percent except for march 1989 when it hit 
a 15year low of 5 percent

the boss needs you to contact a client in 
another part of the country right away but you dont have the 
phone number at your finger tips relax directory assistance can 
dial it for you 
and if youre expecting an important call at home you can tell 
whether a call is for you instead of your spouse by obtaining a 
personalized telephone ring 
these are just some of the newer services the nations six 
regional telephone companies are offering or plan to offer their 
customers many more are on the way due to changing lifestyles and 
the socalled baby bells hunt for more revenue amid heightened 
competition in the deregulated phone markets 
it is a major new source of revenue said marianne bye an 
industry analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc its also a 
high margin area for the company meaning that it costs them very 
little to provide 
bell atlantic corp in philadelphia has been a leader in 
providing these services including the controversial caller id 
feature industry analysts say but similar services can be found 
anywhere since the baby bells use basically the same technology and 
get the computer software from the same vendors they say 
clayton brown an analyst with ag edwards amp sons said 
telephone companies are only limited by the sophistication of their 
network 
little by little as they improve their network they can 
offer more and more services which will enhance their revenue a 
bit more brown said 
for st louisbased southwestern bell telephone co which 
serves 95 million homes and businesses in missouri kansas 
arkansas oklahoma and texas addon services make up about 13 
percent of billed revenue more than half of its customers choose 
to have at least one of the custom features according to the 
company 
its a significant revenue stream said david martin a 
southwestern bell spokesman they cover their costs many times 
over 
bellsouth corp based in atlanta anticipates about 65 million 
in revenue this year from its addon services spokesman terry 
johnson said the company expects that amount to more than triple in 
two years and increase sixfold by 1994 as technology improves and 
regulatory matters are resolved 
other companies werent able to provide a revenue breakdown 
the most popular feature the baby bells say is call 
waiting which tells customers using a phone that theres another 
incoming call and allows them to answer it this feature is 
available throughout most of the country call forwarding 
threeway calling and speed calling also are gaining in 
popularilty and availability experts say at southwestern bell 
for instance theyre available in about 90 percent of the 
companys territory 
costs usually range from 2 to 10 a month according to the 
companies 
the most controversial feature is caller id which displays 
incoming numbers on a small video device as a way to thwart 
unwanted callers promoted by bell atlantic the feature costs 
around 650 a month plus another 60 to 80 for a small viewing 
device that flashes an incoming number before the phone is answered 
businesses love this service but it has come under fire from 
privacy advocates and some states a pennsylvania court for 
instance has outlawed it as a violation of wiretap laws 
so far six areas of the country have this service and as many 
as 22 states are debating whether to allow it 
some of the more unusual services in the early stages of 
availability include 
a personalized telephone ring distinctive rings allow three 
phone numbers to be combined on one phone line and let everyone 
know who the phone is for when it ring riiinnngg rings for dad 
or ring ring riiinnngggs for his oldest daughter the feature 
already is available on some office phone systems 
the lazy persons phone book when a customer calls 
directory assistance a recorded voice provides the phone number 
and for a fee of around 30 cents offers to dial the number 
the distinctive phone book listing if your name is john smith 
and you want to stand out in a sea of john smiths in the telephone 
book you can have your listing appear in sophisticated script 
or bold contemporary the cost is around 6 initially plus 3 
a month 
jolene meyer southwestern bells district manager of new 
product development said the most popular of the socalled second 
phase of features is call return 
it allows customers to automatically call back the last incoming 
call whether or not they answered it if the other line is busy 
they can hang up and call return will automatically keep dialing 
the number and notify them with a special ring when the line is 
free 
call return is the most popular of the group i think because 
its comparable to call waiting meyer said the customer 
doesnt have to do anything its kind of passive when were out 
in the back yard and we hear the phone ring were reminded that we 
have that service and we have the option of answering it now or 
later 
a similar feature is call cue which redials the last number 
you attempted to call and if the other line is busy will 
continue redialing for you 
other features include call blocker call trace and 
priority call which provides customers with a distinctive ring 
for each of three preselected incoming phone numbers 
phone companies say that because of the technology involved in 
linking central offices a number of these services wont be 
available to all their customers for five to 10 years 
but they say the demand is definitely there 
our lifestyles are demanding more control said southwestern 
bells meyer people are kind of tired of having their chains 
pulled every time the phone rings 
they have very busy hectic lives they put up with traffic 
jams stress at the office and when they get home they want to have 
some control over who they talk to and when

stock prices plummeted in afternoon trading 
today amid continued tension over iraqs invasion of kuwait with 
the dow jones industrial average skidding down more than 100 points 
the middle east remains a tinderbox said alan ackerman a 
market strategist with gruntal amp co its unstable and 
unpredictable 
the key dow jones average of 30 big industrial stocks was down 
about 118 points in sustained selling shortly before 2 pm on wall 
street 
in the broader market traders said overthecounter stocks were 
swamped with sell orders 
the stock market was battered by fears that higher energy prices 
worldwide resulting from the iraqi invasion would trigger inflation 
and further destabilize the us economy 
already in a downslide because of recent reports of underlying 
economic weakness the market was hit with more bad economic news 
this morning as the government reported higher unemployment in july 
the labor department said nonfarm payroll employment fell by 
219000 in july surprising analysts who had been looking for a 
modest increase the civilian unemployment rate jumped threetenths 
of a percentage point to 55 percent 
but market participants had their eye on iraq concerned that 
while kuwaits oil reserves may not be critical to world supplies 
further moves by iraq could threaten oil from saudi arabia and 
other nations 
the real concern is how far will iraq go in the middle east 
ackerman said theres an absence of superpower intervention 
obviously theres a lot of nervousness worldwide 
the dow industrials fell 3466 points thursday on fears that a 
possible disruption of oil supplies could spark inflation and 
recession in the united states

a plunge in stockindex futures prices today on 
the chicago mercantile exchange tripped two circuit breakers 
intended to prevent a runaway stockmarket collapse 
the drop in index futures coincided with a plunge in the stock 
market in response to disappointing economic news and fears of 
escalating conflict in the middle east 
all standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures contracts fell the 
permitted opening limit of 5 points within the first 10 minutes of 
trading forcing exchange officials to declare a halt to trading 
from 940 am edt to 942 am edt according to andrew yemma an 
exchange spokesman 
a second circuit breaker was triggered shortly after noon when 
the nearmonth contract for delivery in september tumbled to 
3419 12 points below thursdays settlement under merc rules 
selling below that level was prohibited for 30 minutes 
sampp 500 index futures are valued at 500 per point 
the plunge in index futures coincided with a drop of more than 
90 points in the dow jones industrial average after the labor 
department reported the nations unemployment rate jumped to 55 
percent in july the highest jobless rate in two years 
the report was perceived as evidence of a weakening economy at a 
time when the markets already were extremely jittery over the 
possibly inflationary impact of skyrocketing crude oil prices 
linked to iraqs conquest of kuwait 
stockindex futures are contracts for future deliveries of 
baskets of stocks such as the 500 stocks tracked by the sampp 500 
index investors buy and sell the contracts to hedge against losses 
in the stock market or to speculate on stockmarket moves 
the merc and the chicago board of trade implemented the circuit 
breakers after the stockmarket crash of october 1987 which some 
critics contended was exacerbated by trading strategies that employ 
computers to trade huge blocks of stocks and index futures

at least 14 americans are missing from kuwait 
oil fields and us officials believe they are in iraqi hands a 
state department spokesman said today 
there are no reports of injuries to americans in the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait but the state department was advising the 
estimated 3000 americans in kuwait and 500 in iran to leave as 
soon as they can said spokesman richard boucher 
he said however immediate departures would not be possible 
from kuwait because of the fighting and because all airport and 
ports are closed 
the us embassy in baghdad contacted officials of the iraqi 
foreign ministry today to ask about the whereabouts of 14 missing 
americans and to remind the iraqis of their commitment to 
safeguard the safety of americans said spokesman richard boucher 
in the early hours of the iraqi invasion which began before 
dawn thursday iraqi officials promised us authorities in baghdad 
that americans would not be harmed boucher said 
he said privacy laws do not allow public disclosure of the 
companies the missing americans worked for or their names but 
another official said the iraqis had been given those details and 
information about the circumstances of the disappearances to help 
in gaining their return 
iraq has provided no information about those missing boucher 
said 
the 14 were taken from three different oil fields near the 
iraqikuwaiti border boucher said 
we cant confirm theyre in iraqi control but we believe they 
are he said 
although the government gave no details about the missing 
family members of employees of santa fe drilling co of california 
said the company had contacted them about missing relatives 
larry neal a spokesman for sen phil gramm rtexas said state 
department officials indicated to him that most of the oil field 
workers were employed by santa fe drilling 
a shreveport la woman said she received a call from santa fe 
drilling that her husband donald g whatley was missing whatley 
has been working as a drilling supervisor for santa fe in kuwait 
said doris whatley 
she said whatley had just returned to the oil operation after 
vacationing in shreveport 
they took him from his rig this morning and they took him 
across the border to iraq she said thursday he just barely 
had arrived there in time for them to take him off his rig 
mrs whatley said she had not heard from state department 
officials about her husband but officials of santa fe drilling 
called her to say he was missing 
i dont want him to be forgotten like the rest of the hostages 
in the middle east have been she said 
in gilmer texas the family of charles amos 56 said he was 
among those rounded up by iraqi soldiers amos also works for santa 
fe the family said 
we are holding out for whatever information we can get said 
son david amos 
state department officials told the amos family that hed been 
moved by soldiers who invaded kuwait on thursday morning the 
younger amos told kltv and the longview newsjournal 
we were set to have a family reunion this weekend and dad was 
going to fly out of kuwait early thursday morning said his 
daughter karen amos but we got the call from the state 
department about 2 pm 
amos has been traveling and working overseas for more than 20 
years his son said 
a short time before a state department official disclosed the 
suspected roundup of some americans president bush was asked about 
reports that american workers in kuwait had been taken into custody 
i dont have anything on that right now he said 
secondly it would affect us in a very dramatic way because i 
view a fundamental responsibility of my presidency is protecting 
american citizens if theyre put into harms way i have certain 
responsibilities

iraqs invasion of kuwait continued to shake 
financial markets today but stock and bond prices got another jolt 
from a disappointing report on unemployment that worsened fears 
about inflation and a recession in the united states 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled more than 
100 points at one time during the session on the double dose of bad 
news before recouping slightly 
oil prices which shot up thursday after the iraqi attack 
continued to climb today prices were boosted by the possibility 
the invasion eventually could affect output from the two nations or 
other members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude was up 194 to 2505 a barrel by 
midafternoon on the new york mercantile exchange after jumping 
157 on thursday 
in london the spot price of north sea brent blend the most 
widely traded international crude was quoted at 2325 a barrel 
today up 86 cents from thursday when the price rose 2 a barrel 
the surge in oil prices came as a blow to other financial 
markets already concerned about the weakening us economy 
with oil and other energy sources crucial for every segment of 
the economy rising crude prices can reinvigorate inflation that 
would make the federal reserve which considers fighting inflation 
one of its top priorities less likely to move interest rates 
lower as a means of stimulating the economy 
the fed is caught between a rock and a hard place said jack 
barbanel president of first global asset management inc theyre 
trying to support a weakening economy and at the same time keep 
interest rates at a level to support foreign capital and keep 
inflation under control 
the outlook worsened today as the labor department announced the 
unemployment rate rose a sharp 03 percent to 55 percent in july 
the jump indicated a continuing slowing of the economy as private 
companies lost 45000 jobs from their payrolls 
the report also carried bad inflation news average hourly 
earnings posted a 06 percent rise to 1009 up from the 1003 
the average worker earned per hour in june 
the double blow of rising oil prices and a negative economic 
outlook sent stock prices sharply lower 
on wall street the dow industrial average skidded more than 100 
points before rebounding slightly at midafternoon the indicator 
was down about 81 points at 230 pm edt at 278342 
the dow jones average which tracks the movement of 30 blue chip 
stocks skidded 3466 points on thursday as traders grew uneasy 
about the effect oil prices would have on corporate profits 
stock prices also tumbled overseas in response to the iraqi 
invasion 
in tokyo the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues shed 
72942 points ending the day at 2951576 the index lost nearly 
593 points on thursday 
japan is especially vulnerable to the possibility of a 
disruption of energy sources because it imports 99 percent of its 
oil traders there are concerned that the oil price rise will take 
a heavy toll on japanese business 
bond prices were also hit hard by the unemployment report and 
the prospect of higher inflation from rising oil prices 
at midday today the treasurys bellwether 30year bond was down 
about 343 per 1000 in face value after plunging more than 12 
on thursday the bonds yield considered a benchmark for interest 
rates throughout the economy rose to 848 percent from 846 
percent late thursday 
bond traders are concerned that inflation will erode the value 
of their fixedincome holdings theyre also worried that interest 
rates wont be dropping soon as bond prices rise when rates 
decline so higher rates depress prices 
the dollar first soared thursday in response to the iraqi 
invasion and then gave up ground amid concern about the us 
economy 
today the dollar was little changed against most foreign 
currencies but made its biggest moves against the japanese yen in 
early new york trading the dollar was worth 149965 yen up from 
14930 late thursday

soybean futures ended higher and grain futures 
closed lower friday on the chicago board of trade in a seesaw 
session influenced mainly by developments in the persian gulf 
traders closely followed news reports for indications of whether 
iraq was more likely to withdraw its invading troops from kuwait or 
push on into saudi arabia 
war is always bullish for commodities said victor 
lespinasse an assistant vice president in the graintrading 
division of dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
news that iraqi troops were within six miles of the saudi border 
gave the markets a strong boost at midday but as the close 
approached the grain markets were calmed by a report that iraq had 
indicated to the soviet union it planned to withdraw troops from 
kuwait 
soybeans remained higher on ideas that the market was due for a 
rebound after falling for nearly six weeks 
by the close there was nothing too spectacular as far as 
price movement but there was a lot of stomach churning while 
trading said john frazier director of agriculture trading for 
gerald inc in chicago 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
september at 280 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower 
with september at 250 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 6 cents 
lower with september at 114 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents 
lower to 6 cents higher with august at 586 a bushel

national intergroup inc on friday reported a 
net loss of 2817 million in its first fiscal quarter of 1991 due 
to reserves set aside to cover restructuring costs 
the holding company which has interests in metals and 
pharmaceuticals said it lost 1301 per share in the three months 
ended june 30 compared with a gain of nearly 13 million or 53 
cents a share a year earlier 
the company said it set aside 2395 million in the most recent 
quarter to cover anticipated losses on the sale of its ben franklin 
stores and permian corp subsidiaries 
the company is selling most of its metals and other assets and 
plans to move its headquarters to dallas where its remaining 
asset foxmeyer drug co is based 
the company recorded a 267 million charge in the fiscal 1991 
quarter associated with the closing of its pittsburgh office and a 
148 million nonrecurring charge reflecting the market value of 
the preferred stock and expenses related to the sale of 20 percent 
ownership of national steel corp to nkk corp of japan 
those losses were offset partially by a 12 million gain on the 
sale of the companys information services subsidiary genix 
enterprises inc to mcn corp a holding company for michigan 
consolidated gas co 
though the loss is significant it clears the decks and allows 
us to move forward with our plan to focus our attention and 
resources on the drug distribution business said howard m love 
chairman and chief executive officer 
foxmeyer reported operating income increased 39 percent to 10 
million in the first fiscal quarter from 72 million in the 
yearago period sales increased 15 percent to 6668 million from 
5772 million 
the companys equity investment in national steel corp resulted 
in a net loss of 117 million in the first fiscal quarter 
compared with income of 162 million in the yearago period 
the decrease was due mostly to the change in the companys 
ownership interest in national steel nii said 
centaur partners of new york the companys largest stockholder 
with 165 percent of outstanding shares has been vying for seats 
on niis board of directors 
centaur principals and love said june 25 that the investor group 
won enough votes at the companys annual election to fill three 
seats on the 10member board keeping niis candidates out 
centaur wants nii to sell foxmeyer the nations thirdlargest 
drug distributor and give the proceeds to shareholders

accountants without a license can practice 
in california but have to call themselves unlicensed 
accountants according to a state appeals court ruling released 
thursday 
in a 30 decision the 1st district court of appeal upheld the 
state board of accountancys authority to allow only californias 
55000 certified public accountants to use the terms accountant 
or accounting without other modification in connection with 
their business 
but the court noted that state law does not require a license to 
prepare financial reports or do most other accounting work 
certified public accountants who must meet state standards for 
education and experience and pass a national examination can 
certify their audits and financial statements to lenders 
government agencies stockholders and the public 
people without licenses can call themselves accountants the 
court said as long as they also state that they are unlicensed or 
provide some other disclaimer saying their services do not require 
a license 
because the constitution provides some protection to free speech 
in advertising we must permit the use of those terms such as 
accountant if they are qualified by a warning or disclaimer that 
avoids their misleading impact said the opinion by presiding 
justice clinton white 
the ruling is a partial victory but is far from satisfactory 
said ralph alldredge a lawyer for the california association of 
independent accountants a group of about 700 unlicensed 
accountants he said no decision has been made yet on an appeal 
to call yourself an unlicensed accountant is a derogatory 
term almost he said its a very negative way to have to 
present yourself to the public 
alldredge said no one knows how many unlicensed accountants work 
in california because of state restrictions he said some list 
themselves in telephone directories under bookkeeping or tax 
services or business consulting none of which accurately describes 
their work 
the association he represents joined bonnie moore an unlicensed 
san francisco accountant with a college degree in accounting in a 
1986 suit challenging the state board of accountancys regulations 
the board had ordered moore and her firm to stop using the terms 
accounting and accountant in their business san francisco 
superior court judge thomas dandurand ruled in the boards favor 
white noted that the us supreme court has recognized 
advertisers right to free expression in truthful claims those 
rulings indicate that practitioners such as moore must be allowed 
to tell the public they are accountants as long as they specify 
that they do not have or need a license for their work white said

bank of new england corp which has shrunk under 
the weight of troubled real estate loans announced friday it lost 
more than 30 million in the second quarter 
the financial report is the latest gloomy financial news for the 
banking company continuing a tumble that began late last year the 
company lost more than 1 billion in 1989 and 466 million in the 
first quarter that ended march 31 
in the second quarter which ended june 30 the banking company 
lost 333 million or 49 cents per share compared with earnings 
of 365 million or 52 cents per share in the same period a year 
earlier 
bank chairman lawrence fish said in a statement that the company 
has made slow but steady progress in trying to recover 
but he said the loss was not unexpected because of the 
continued sluggishness in the regions economy the softness in the 
real estate market and lower net income 
the losses in part reflected how the bank has had to divert 
money into reserves to cover bad loans 
the banks total nonperforming assets which include troubled 
loans totaled 278 billion compared with 267 billion in the 
first quarter 
gerard cassidy a bank analyst with tucker anthony inc said 
the banks assets were not deteriorating at the same rate as in the 
past 
but when youre at these levels you need to see reduction in 
nonperforming assets not smaller increases he said overall 
the numbers are a continuation of a negative trend 
bank of new england has been operating under federal orders 
since early this year the bank came under heightened government 
scrutiny when a downturn in the economy and the real estate market 
exposed mountains of bad loans 
part of the banks strategy has been to sell off assets and 
slash its work force to cut costs and raise money 
the bank has reduced its workforce by 4000 through a 
combination of layoffs attrition and the sale of assets since the 
beginning of the year the bank has sold more than 5 billion in 
assets said spokesman james dorsey 
the company has decided not to sell it subsidiary bank in maine 
but is continuing discussions with possible buyers for its rhode 
island subsidiary 
the bank had been borrowing money from the federal reserve bank 
of boston to meet immediate cash needs but stopped in midjune 
bank of new england officials said however this could change 
from time to time 
the bank said it has been able to stabilize its deposits through 
a campaign to attract certificates of deposit and by offering other 
retail products 
through the first half of the year the bank lost 799 million 
or 117 a share that was slightly larger than the deficit of 
788 million or 112 a share in 1989s first half 
assets totaled 2307 billion at the end of the first half down 
from 3198 billion a year earlier

what we got today indicated more than in 87 they heard our 
demands and theyre moving on them said william don hammonds 
rankandfile chairperson of the uaw negotiating team at ford 
hammonds plant chairperson of uaw local 737 in nashville 
tenn was a member of the 1987 union team that negotiated the 
current contract with ford 
while the initial two weeks of negotiations have been cordial 
said hammonds and uaw vice president ernest lofton lots of work 
remains to reach a contract before the sept 14 deadline 
job security is still one of the things we have a great 
difference on lofton said 
the union has tapped job security as its top priority for 
negotiations at general motors corp ford and chrysler corp all 
three contracts expire at the same time 
negotiations at chrysler got off to a rocky start uaw vice 
president stan marshall said last week he said chrysler made a 
mockery of the opening of talks by floating contract concepts 
to the media before bringing them to the union 
since then negotiators have been meeting at the main bargaining 
table and taking turns making presentations few specific contract 
proposals have changed hands 
there has been little official word from the talks at gm 
company and union negotiators have been meeting in subcommittees 
focused on various sections of the contract such as health and 
safety time off and scheduling 
no specific economic proposals have been offered by either side 
in all three sets of negotiations 
lofton said he didnt expect the union to make specific economic 
offers until around labor day when the uaw chooses one of the big 
three as its negotiating target 
theres been a tradition in auto industry bargaining that the 
uaw chooses one company suspends negotiations at the other two 
and eventually reaches an agreement with the first 
that contract then is more or less imposed on the other 
automakers with little change 
there has been speculation this year that the pattern may be 
broken by chrysler chryslers chief negotiator anthony st john 
has said simply continuing the current contract would increase 
labor costs by about 16 percent an increase chrysler cant afford 
at news conferences following the opening of negotiations at 
each of the big three uaw president owen bieber said the union had 
no intention of breaking the tradition 
he said the union had worked too hard to bring the three 
contracts back in line with common expiration dates its the first 
time in 11 years that the contracts expire at once

recession warning signals the july jobless rate was the highest 
since it hit 56 percent in august 1988 
but the turmoil in the middle east in the wake of iraqs

york no ones comfortable going home short of dollars over the 
weekend when anything can happen out there 
rumors that iraqi troops had begun an assault on saudi arabia 
signalled an escalation in the persian gulf conflict and 
temporarily gave investors an extra incentive to buy dollars as a 
safe haven currency 
when word came later in the session that iraq planned to 
withdraw its troops from kuwait over the weekend the dollar buying 
subsided somewhat 
by the time trading was done in new york the dollar stood at 
149925 japanese yen up from 14930 yen thursday in tokyo the

rh macy amp co inc on thursday said its senior 
bank lenders have agreed to modify an agreement making it slightly 
more lenient which will give the retailer greater financial 
flexibility as it enters the important fall season 
the new yorkbased retailer also said it has agreed to sell a 1 
percent equity interest to the real estate development group 
corporate property investors for 15 million in cash four other 
property developers already hold investments in macys 
the decision to sell the stake to corporate property investors 
recognizes our longstanding ongoing relationship and 
prospective future real estate activities macys said 
proceeds from the sale will be used to buy back its debt from 
time to time in the open market macys said in a letter to its 
investors 
the retailer periodically releases such letters to update 
investors on its financial condition a copy was distributed to 
news media 
the letter said macys conservative inventory management and 
expense plan for the spring appear to have paid off 
macys had more cash available in late spring than it expected 
to have possibly indicating that the department store operator is 
weathering the current poor retail environment better than private 
analysts anticipated 
our cash availability was almost 65 million higher for the 
25th week this spring when our needs peaked than the 113 million 
projected in february to our banks and the factors macys said 
we are confident that this conservative approach will ensure a 
continuation of our liquid position in spite of a continuing soft 
retail environment it said 
the modification in the loan agreement reduced the amount of 
cash macys must have in relation to its debt 
macys said the bank agreement didnt need to be modified until 
the end of october but the companys lead bank lenders suggested 
that the amendment be made now so there would be no question 
about macys financial flexibility and liquidity as we enter the 
important fall season 
the letter signed by three executives including chairman edward 
s finkelstein said macys is reviewing a number of ways to reduce 
its interest costs it didnt give specifics and said investors 
would be advised of macys debt costreduction plans as they 
develop

rising unemployment and fears of spreading 
middle east conflict blasted the financial markets friday stocks 
plummeted and interest rates jumped on speculation the battered 
us economy could get worse 
feeding the turmoil was the governments report that 
unemployment rose 03 points to 55 percent in july another sign 
the economy might be slipping into recession 
adding to the mix was the second straight day of sharply rising 
oil prices a possible harbinger of higher inflation that could 
squeeze business and consumers alike 
weakened by the twopronged fear stock prices began tumbling 
early 
the dow jones average of 30 blue chip industrial stocks fell 
more than 118 points by midafternoon the selloff was so swift 
that temporary circuit breaker halts in trading of standard amp 
poors 500stock index futures were triggered twice on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
nevertheless the market rallied in later trading the dow 
finished down 5495 at 280965 extending its 3466point drop of 
thursday 
helping grease the stock drop was a surge by interest rates in 
the longterm bonds as traders reacted to the growing signs of 
higher inflation the yield on the bellwether 30year treasury bond 
finished at 856 percent up from 845 percent late thursday and 
835 percent on wednesday 
both markets reacted to the rise in oil prices which have shot 
higher since immediately after iraq invaded kuwait on thursday 
morning 
oil prices rose on speculation that supplies could be affected 
if the invasion escalated into an attack on neighboring saudi 
arabia the worlds biggest crude exporter 
such rumors periodically sent longterm bond prices lower but 
iraq announced late in the day it planned to begin withdrawing its 
troops from kuwait on sunday 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude traded up more than 250 a barrel 
at one point before settling at 2449 up 138 from thursdays 
close on the new york mercantile exchange the contract rose 157 
on thursday 
the surge in oil prices has been a blow to markets already 
concerned about the health of the us economy a sustained rise in 
crude prices is seen as boosting inflation which reduces the 
chance the federal reserve will push interest rates lower to 
stimulate the economy 
in foreign exchange the dollar climbed against most major 
currencies in volatile trading as dealers divided their attention 
between the economic and middle east news 
the dollar rose to 149925 japanese yen in new york from 14930 
yen thursday against the west german mark the dollar rose to 
15935 from 15910 
stock prices also tumbled overseas friday in response to the 
iraqi invasion 
in tokyo the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues shed 
72942 points ending the day at 2951576 the index lost nearly 
593 points on thursday 
japan is especially vulnerable to the possibility of a 
disruption of energy sources because it imports 99 percent of its 
oil traders there are concerned that the oil price rise will take 
a heavy toll on japanese business 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
fell 199 points or 09 percent to 22846

longterm bond prices plunged again friday as 
high unemployment and middle east tensions battered the 
rumorriddled credit markets 
but shortterm interest rates were hammered down after the labor 
department reported that the nations unemployment rate shot up to 
55 percent in july from 52 percent in june 
the report was another sign that the nations faltering economy 
may be heading into a recession which could herald lower interest 
rates in the short end of the market it temporarily overshadowed 
another day of inflation worries triggered by rising oil prices 
after iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond tumbled 1lsqb points or 
1125 per 1000 in face value on top of losses thursday of more 
than 12 the bonds yield which rises when the bonds price 
falls climbed to 856 percent from 845 percent late thursday 
economists said the unemployment report combined with a wave of 
other negative economic data in recent days normally would give the 
federal reserve enough reason to lower interest rates which would 
boost bond prices 
that sentiment was reflected among shorter maturity bills and 
bonds but the longer end of the market was gripped by the belief 
that the spike in oil prices would fuel inflation worldwide 
inflation which the fed seeks to control through monetary 
policy erodes the value of fixedincome securities such as bonds 
the data was weak enough under normal circumstances to make 
people think the fed would certainly ease said james capra 
senior vice president with shearson lehman government securities 
inc but now the issue is will the oil prices move cause the fed 
to pause or wait 
economists are concerned that a fed lower interest during a time 
of price concerns fanning inflation 
last months jobless rate was the highest since it hit 56 
percent in august 1988 
the sharp increase largely reflected the economys loss of 
219000 jobs though about 160000 of those americans who lost jobs 
were temporary census workers laid off by the government private 
industry payrolls also lost 45000 jobs the government said 
the market is trading in wide swings capra said its 
made it difficult for anyone but those with the strongest of 
views 
the long end of the market was wracked by speculation about 
events in the middle east including unconfirmed rumors that iraq 
was poised to possibly invade saudi arabia following its seizure of 
kuwait 
a serious escalation of hostilities in the region could push oil 
prices even higher worsening the inflation and economic outlook 
however late in the day iraq said it planned to begin removing 
its troops from kuwait on sunday 
prices of shortterm governments rose lsqb point intermediate 
maturities ranged from unchanged to down 1332 point and longterm 
issuestumbled 2132 point to 3132 point according to telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 266 to 116471 
yields on threemonth treasury bills tumbled to 755 percent as 
the discount dropped 10 basis points to 732 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 757 percent as the discount dropped 9 
basis points to 721 percent yields on oneyear bills plunged to 
755 percent as the discount lost 12 basis points to 706 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 7 percent down from 8 
percent late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds closed at 92 down rsqb the average yield to 
maturity rose to 734 percent from 731 percent late thursday

recession fears inflation worries and conflicting reports from 
the persian gulf ricocheted through us commodity markets friday 
resulting in price moves with little relation to supply and demand 
factors 
it seemed like a lot of attention was focused on what the 
latest rumors were observed tim evans a copper trader with deak 
international inc a new yorkbased dealer of metals and 
currencies 
oil futures ended sharply higher despite active selling late in 
the session precious metals were higher copper futures fell 
livestock and meat were mixed and grains and soybeans were mixed 
commodity traders kept close watch on stock and crudeoil 
markets where changing news reports about the iraqkuwait 
situation caused wild price swings that rippled out to other 
markets 
war is always bearish for stocks and bullish for 
commodities said victor lespinasse an assistant vice president 
in the graintrading division of dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
the persian gulf situation seemed very bullish for commodities 
early in the day when rumors circulated that iraqi troops had 
invaded saudi arabia from kuwait which probably would result in 
further disruptions of crude oil shipments to the united states 
those rumors were discounted but news reports then surfaced that 
iraqi troops were just six miles from the saudi border causing 
another plunge in stock prices and sharp gains in many commodities 
newswires then reported iraq had told the soviet union it 
planned to withdraw from kuwait prompting a strong rally on the 
stock market and selling in the commodity markets particularly in 
crude oil 
after most market had closed reports came out that the iraqi 
government would begin withdrawing troops from kuwait on sunday 
to further complicate matters the labor department reported 
friday that nonfarm payroll employment fell by 219000 in july and 
unemployment jumped threetenths of a percentage point to 55 
percent 
the figures reinforced concern in the financial world that 
economic activity was weakening more than had been thought just a 
few weeks ago 
the recession fears weighed heavily on the copper market which 
is especially sensitive to signs of economic weakness and on the 
stock market the dow jones industrial average fell more than 120 
points early in the afternoon but recovered to finish with a loss 
of about 55 points 
a similar plunge in stockindex futures prices tripped two 
circuitbreakers in the standard amp poors 500 index futures 
trading pit at the chicago mercantile exchange the circuit 
breakers are a series of trading halts and price limits intended to 
stop a runaway stockmarket collapse 
the contract for september delivery of the 500 stocks tracked by 
the index settled 662 points lower at 34486 the contract is 
valued at 500 a point 
copper futures settled 24 cents to 34 cents lower on new 
yorks commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in august 
at 1261 a pound 
skyrocketing oil futures contributed to inflation fears which 
prompted buying in the precious metal and soybean markets 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude oil settled 68 cents to 138 higher with september at 2449 
a barrel wholesale heating oil was 20 cent to 206 cent higher 
with september at 6658 cents a gallon wholesale unleaded gasoline 
was 70 cent to 411 cents higher with september at 7218 cents a 
gallon 
gold futures ended 20 cents to 60 cents higher on the commodity 
exchange with august at 37790 a troy ounce silver was 05 cent 
to 07 cent higher with august at 4842 a troy ounce 
on the chicago board of trade wheat futures settled 2 cents to 
4 cents lower with september at 280 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 3 cents lower with september at 249 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 7 cents lower with september at 114 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent lower to 6 cents higher with august at 586 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live cattle were 03 cent to 
53 cent lower with august at 7717 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 10 cent to 45 cent lower with august at 8847 cents a pound

allegheny international inc said friday 
federal bankruptcy court had approved of an agreement giving a new 
york investment group control of the maker of sunbeam and oster 
appliances 
the company also announced 321 million in losses in its fiscal 
1990 third quarter as consumerproducts divisions posted decreased 
operating earnings 
the us bankruptcy court approval will allow the investors 
japonica partners to take control of allegheny on aug 15 the 
deal announced thursday by committees representing company 
creditors and shareholders is contingent on japonicas ability to 
raise enough money 
alleghenys senior managers and board members would be ousted on 
that date by japonicas handpicked managers and a board comprising 
nominees from allegheny bank creditors and unsecured creditors 
the executive committee of allegheny internationals board of 
directors which had opposed japonicas assuming a position of 
power unanimously approved the settlement thursday the full board 
ratified the deal friday 
allegheny international filed for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws in february 1988 
the company to be renamed sunbeamoster companies inc 
initially will remain a publicly traded company but japonica is 
expected to own 90 percent of the stock creditors lawyers said at 
a bankruptcy court hearing 
japonica has said it intends to keep company headquarters in 
pittsburgh where allegheny international employs about 60 people 
the agreement would distribute stock and warrants to creditors 
and shareholders as specified in managements reorganization plan 
but would require japonica to buy the securities from anyone who 
wants to sell 
the price would be 7 per share or 153 per warrant except for

a federal appeals court ruled friday that 
an agency created by congress to protect securities investors can 
sue fraudulent brokers for racketeering and seek triple damages 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said the securities 
investor protection corp can use the powerful racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act in civil suits against 
brokers 
sipc reimburses customers of failed brokers and can appoint a 
receiver to sell or liquidate an insolvent broker who has violated 
the law if the brokers assets are not enough to pay claims sipc 
uses its own funds collected from member institutions 
the agency moved in 1981 to liquidate two brokerages first 
state securities corp and joseph sebag inc and said it had to 
spend nearly 13 million of its own funds to pay customer claims 
sipc then sued in federal court in los angeles against six 
companies and numerous individuals claiming they had used the two 
brokers as vehicles to manipulate the companies stock in the 
overthecounter market 
the lawsuit sought triple damages under rico claiming that the 
stock fraud had been a pattern of racketeering activity 
a federal district judge dismissed the racketeering claim 
saying sipc had neither bought nor sold the securities in question 
as required for a stock fraud suit but the appeals court said rico 
suits are not limited to buyers or sellers of stock 
noting that the rico law expressly covers any person injured 
in his business or property by reason of a violation the court 
said the law made no reference to a requirement that a plaintiff be 
a buyer or seller of securities 
it is not appropriate for this court to impose such a 
limitation judge david thompson said in the 30 ruling 
reinstating the rico claim 
lawyers for both sides in the case said the ruling appeared 
broad enough to apply to some defrauded private investors as well 
people who werent buyers or sellers of stock which was the 
subject of manipulation could come in under rico if they had 
suffered losses said stephen taylor a lawyer for sipc 
i think it is a broadening of the law and would have wide 
implications beyond sipc said jack mamet a lawyer for defendant 
robert g holmes jr the founder and president of aero systems 
inc one of the six companies whose stock was allegedly 
manipulated 
mamet said a supreme court appeal would be considered 
depending on the rulings interpretation mamet said an 
investor in a future case who held stock affected by fraud but who 
had not been induced to buy or sell the stock because of the fraud 
could be able to sue under rico 
sipc is a nonprofit corporation whose membership consists of 
most registered brokers and dealers it was established in 1970 
after the collapse of several brokerage houses

following iraqs invasion of kuwait

14890yen close 
on the stock market the 225share nikkei stock average quickly 
dropped 60989 points or 202 percent falling to 2963529 within 
the first 30 minutes of morning trading 
following its strength against the yen in new york the dollar 
opened higher and continued to rise as market players kept an eye 
on developments in the iraqkuwait conflict dealers said 
iraq invaded kuwait and took control of its capital thursday 
the united states announced it will impose economic sanctions 
against iraq while the soviet union also decided to stop exporting 
military weapons to the middle eastern nation 
market players are still buying the dollar as a safe 
investment because of uncertainties in the middle east situation 
said kimihiro hashimoto a trader with chemical bank in tokyo 
in new york dealers unloaded yen due to concern that japan 
would be hurt more than any other major industrialized country by 
disruptions in mideast oil supplies japan depends on imports for 
nearly all its oil needs 
hashimoto said the dollars surge quickly reversed a recent 
decline in the currency but it might not lead to a longterm 
upward trend 
dollar trading will be affected for a while by pessimistic 
prospects for the us economy and the middle eastern situation 
hashimoto said 
gloomy prospects for the us economy makes the dollar less 
attractive while concern over the middle east crisis encourages 
buying the currency because the dollar is considered a safe haven 
in times of uncertainty 
on the stock market traders said share prices were lower across 
the board as the iraqkuwait conflict continued to discourage 
market players prompting largescale selling 
but yoshiro inoue an analyst with nomura securities co said 
the general market sentiment reflected participants waiting for 
fridays release of the us jobless rate for july 
because of the persistent pessimistic prospects of us 
economic growth the dollar is not soaring that much today despite 
the middle east situation this will help stock investors calm down 
and support the market he said

in oil prices in tokyo he said

nearly three dollars from thursday

vacationers bound for summer getaways will notice something has 
happened to outoftheway tourist spots many have become 
miniature shopping meccas catering to devoted bargain seekers 
clusters of shops carrying discounted designer duds have 
sprouted up all over the country more manufacturers whose wares 
are normally peddled by mainstream retailers are striking out on 
their own 
outlet complexes are thriving in areas frequented by tourists 
who have the time to browse for good buys busloads of pricewise 
shoppers regularly pour in elsewhere outlets grouped near major 
thoroughfares are catching the attention of passersby 
the trend has ominous implications for traditional retailing it 
wont run all regular stores out of business but it does mean more 
competition in a saturated industry already fraught with fierce 
battling for market share 
sales at outlets are growing faster than general retail 
revenues although they still account for a small portion of 
retailing 
outlets generated nearly 6 billion in sales last year 
according to value retail news a clearwater flabased 
publication that tracks the industry by contrast a single 
retailer industry biggie sears roebuck and co alone had 1989 
sales of over 30 billion 
people like the excitement of shopping in a factory outlet 
they like the prices says lynn ellsworth president of company 
stores development corp a brentwood tennbased builder of 
outlet malls and a pioneer in the field 
manufacturers have several incentives to sell directly to 
consumers it allows them to control the process of getting rid of 
leftovers rather than risk problems that can crop up when they 
unload merchandise on liquidators 
closeout chains and offprice merchants which absorb excess 
apparel and sell it at discount often compete for customers with 
nearby department stores and other regular retailers 
manufacturers usually make sure their own outlets are far away 
from major shopping hubs so they dont jeopardize sales of their 
labels selling at fullprice stores or upset relations with 
retailers their primary customers 
we purposely stay away from traditional retailers notes 
benard holtzman president of apparel designer harve benard ltd 
clothing companies accessory makers and others that go into 
retailing must tred carefully the last thing they want is for 
outlet customers to return home gloating to their local retailer 
about the great deal they got 
womens apparel powerhouse liz claiborne inc has located its 22 
outlet stores 45 minutes to an hour away from regular retailers 
selling its label 
ritzy ralph laurens lines are sold at discount outlets 
deliberately situated 90 miles to 120 miles away from places where 
the polo collection is sold in fullprice companyowned boutiques 
and department stores 
nevertheless the issue is so touchy that manufacturers dont 
exactly go out of their way to publicize their involvement in the 
outlet business some even disguise their name meaning customers 
cant tell who owns an outlet pricy izodlacoste sportswear is 
sold at outlets called fashion flair for instance 
irked by the trend the national shoe retailers association 
recently adopted a resolution expressing disapproval of the 
proliferation of companyowned factory outlets independent shoe 
retailers are up in arms because they say manufacturers are 
bypassing them in channeling merchandise to outlets 
association president bill boettge said the group believes 
independent shoe sellers are being treated unfairly he said the 
group isnt trying to start a national boycott but some association 
members are refusing to carry merchandise of manufacturers that 
operate their own outlets 
from a manufacturers point of view it makes good business 
sense to look for new channels of distribution upheaval in the 
retail industry intensifed by the bankruptcy filings of big name 
chains including the parent companies of bloomingdales the bon 
marche lazarus and others has made manufacturers nervous about 
depending on department stores to market merchandise 
no longer mere havens for fashion hasbeens manufacturers 
increasingly use their factory outlets to showcase merchandise 
phillipsvan heusen corp reportedly does half its business in 
its own outlets marketing van heusen shirts and shoes from its 
gh bass amp co division 
commercial developers say projects involving outlets tend to get 
financial backing more easily in these tight money days than 
construction of traditional retail centers 
although lenders have tightened up their practices after the 
savings and loan debacle theyre still willing to support sound 
deals conventional retailers may be on the ropes but factory 
outlets look like theyre on stable ground according to richard 
echikson chairman of millburn njbased retail consultants inc 
which helps clients assess potential retail investments 
there is an increasing interest in the financial community and 
development community in true factory outlet malls says echikson 
with financial backing an increasing number of outlets has gone 
upscale offering entertainment and other amenities the woodbury 
common in central valley ny for instance recreates a village 
setting 
malls are growing bigger too benderson development co out of 
buffalo ny plans to open what it claims will be the worlds 
largest manufacturers outlet mall late next year in downtown 
niagara falls 
not all outlets are in the middle of nowhere or even near prime 
tourist attractions many outlets have been moving closer to 
metropolitan areas as more manufacturers get into the act 
according to value retail news the number of outlet chains has 
mushroomed and last year more were opened than ever before in a 
single year by the middle of this year there were about 350 
chains in operation up from 264 at the start of 1989 
the popularity is expected to continue as consumers save more of 
their incomes than they did during the freespending 80s aging 
baby boomers are keen on bargains now that they are tucking away 
spare dollars for their tots educations 
charles bloom chairman of the chelsea group a new jerseybased 
developer owner and operator of factory outlet shopping centers 
says the concept complements traditional retailing and will never 
supplant it 
without retail there is no wholesale he notes you 
couldnt buy a bargain if it wasnt selling for a higher price 
somewhere else
