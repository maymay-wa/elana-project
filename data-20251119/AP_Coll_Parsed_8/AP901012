an ariane rocket carrying two 
usmade telecommunications satellites blasted off friday night 
from this remote launching facility 
the unmanned ariane 44l rocket powered by four strapon liquid 
fuel boosters roared off its northeast south american launchpad 
on schedule at 758 pm 
the rocket carried two satellites built by the hughes aircraft 
co of pasadena calif that were successfully put into 
geostationary orbit 23000 miles over the galapagos islands west of 
the ecuadoran coast 
the countdown briefly stopped to top off the third stage with 
extra hydrogen and oxygen fuel to provide the vehicle with added 
boost ariane officials said 
the mission is the 39th since the commercial arianespace program 
started a decade ago and the third since a rocket exploded in 
february with two japanese satellites aboard 
weather for the launch was good and did not affect the liftoff 
despite the presence of residual winds from hurricane lili to the 
north

in the bribery and kickback trial of suspended navajo chairman 
peter macdonald and his son and defense attorneys said they would 
call no witnesses 
closing arguments and jury instructions were scheduled for

peter rocky macdonald jr made their surprise announcements

up to 15 witnesses 
their case is in a shambles we dont have anything we have to 
defend jolley said friday the only time you have to present a 
defense is when a case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt 
if convicted in tribal district court on all 42 counts of 
bribery conspiracy and ethics violations macdonald could be 
jailed for up to 23 years and barred from serving in tribal office 
for four years 
when asked whether he was afraid to hear the jurys verdict 
macdonald a former marine said ive faced worse situations 
than this i was in the south pacific in world war ii 
the prosecution rested its case after calling 23 witnesses 
the defense earlier asked judge robert yazzie to dismiss all 
charges 
the judge agreed to dismiss three an ethics and conspiracy 
charge against macdonald and an ethics charge against his son he 
ruled there was a lack of evidence of wrongdoing over an alleged 
attempt by the defendants to solicit a consultant contract from 
peabody coal co for the younger macdonald 
in addition the prosecution on friday dropped one bribery count 
against macdonald because a scheduled witness did not appear during 
the trial 
yazzie ruled that all other counts will be decided by the jury 
still pending against macdonald are 42 counts of bribery 
extortion conspiracy and ethics violations his son an unemployed 
lawyer who lives in san jose calif now faces 23 counts 
including 11 bribery or theft by extortion 11 of ethics violations 
and one of conspiracy 
macdonald is accused of accepting bribes and kickbacks from 
businesses operating on the navajo reservation the nations 
biggest jolley has argued that macdonald made no threats or 
promises when he accepted loans and gifts from businessmen 
macdonald was placed on administrative leave last year by the 
tribal council after allegations of corruption surfaced midway 
through his fourth fouryear term he and former chairman peterson 
zah are on the nov 6 ballot for the newly created post of tribal 
president 
the trial being heard by a jury panel of six navajos one 
pueblo indian and five nonindians began oct 1

backpedaling and admitting error the white 
house is struggling to pull itself out of three days of 
embarrassing budget confusion spawned by president bush 
hindsights always better presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said thursday he said the white house should have moved 
quickly to explain bushs apparent flipflop on taxes and 
contradictory statements by administration officials tuesday and 
wednesday 
i think we just made a mistake in not doing that frankly 
fitzwater said thats exactly what we should have done 
the misstep has cost bush dearly prompting headlines of 
presidential waffling zigzagging and retreat some wall street 
analysts blame his apparent indecision along with higher oil 
prices for the stock markets plunge this week 
there also has been a political price republicans worry that 
the appearance of disarray at the white house and by gop lawmakers 
on the budget has given democrats new ammunition for the november 
elections 
even the gops bedrock opposition to higher taxes is being 
called into question 
im sick and tired of going home to rural wisconsin and 
protecting a republican image as the party of the rich said rep 
steve gunderson 
rep fred grandy riowa said i think we made a mistake 
this party made a mistake taking this blood oath against tax 
rate increases 
at a news conference tuesday bush threw the budget negotiations 
with congress into confusion by saying for the first time in 
public that he would be willing to raise income taxes on the rich 
in exchange for a lower tax rate on capital gains which are 
profits on the sales of investments 
his statement sent shudders through the ranks of senate 
republicans they rushed to the white house and told bush that 
democrats would not drop the capital gains tax rate low enough to 
warrant an increase in income tax rates on the wealthy 
the lawmakers said bush in a surprising turnabout agreed 
that he should drop the idea fitzwater agreed with what the 
lawmakers said 
by the next day the white house was in retreat again neither 
the president nor his spokesman was willing to describe bushs 
position fitzwater said bush had not made any commitment to the 
senators read my hips bush said adding to the confusion 
during a jogging excursion 
the white house was hammered with more unflattering headlines 
bush trips capital reels the new york times said on the front 
page thursday 
there was even more chaos thursday when bush met with senior 
congressional republicans when the meeting was over rep bill 
archer rtexas said bush had unequivocally endorsed the idea of a 
modest increase in income tax rates for the rich in exchange for a 
sharp cut in capital gains tax rates 
that was the position bush had taken on tuesday later 
disavowed by the white house 
already burned the white house moved quickly to control the 
damage a written statement by fitzwater said that yes bush did 
like the idea of trading an income tax increase for the wealthy for 
a capital gains tax cut yet the white house said congress would 
not buy that idea 
i think its a waste of time because i just dont think it can 
get through both houses of congress bush said thus the idea 
was buried 
fitzwater was left with the job of trying to reconcile bushs 
statements with the remarks of republican members of congress after 
conferences with the president 
one of the phenomenons about group meetings is that people 
hear what they want to hear fitzwater said but the spokesman 
acknowledged that his boss the president had been imprecise at 
tuesdays news conference when he linked capital gains with a 
higher tax on the rich 
i dont think he meant to say it in a way in the way it was 
interpreted by some of you fitzwater told reporters 
for his part the president said he was unfazed by the flap 
these things come and go he said the best thing we get 
a good deal if we get a good deal people forget the namecalling 
and theyll forget the little rancor and the tension at the time

us rep bill schuette is hammering away 
at sen carl levin as a freespending liberal an entrenched 
washington politician whos out of touch with the electorate 
levin depicts himself as a hardworking and effective 
representative of michigans interests he attacks schuette as a 
habitual distorter of the truth 
to date the advantage has been all levins in his campaign for 
reelection 
schuettes approach is pretty bizarre says levin campaign 
manager gordon kerr 
hes started beating the drum for throw the bums out but 
hes one of the bums says kerr 
true levin a democrat has been in the senate 12 years 
but schuette a republican member of the house budget committee 
has been in congress for six schuette points out that levin has 
been in public life in various capacities for 23 years but the 
impression this has made on the voters appears to be 
inconsequential 
levin has had essentially the same lead since august with the 
latest poll showing his support at 60 percent to 26 percent for 
schuette 
the campaign has seen its share of attack ads 
schuette accused levin of voting to raise or protect his pay 22 
times and tied levin into the sampl mess levin has gotten 29000 in 
contributions over the years from people associated with the 
savings and loan industry 
kerr referred to the ad as fictions distortions and 
innuendos levin is returning a 9000 pay raise to the treasury 
and has voted against pay raises on other occasions he also 
returned 10000 to various donors involved in civil or criminal 
sampl probes 
a levin tv ad featured newspaper headlines some of them from 
editorial pages saying such things as the schuette deception 
and perjury phony 
kerr expects levins lead to narrow in the final weeks as 
schuette steps up his television advertising 
weve got some republican votes that schuette ought to be able 
to chip away at if he develops a message that connects with people 
and they can get it out said kerr 
schuette dismisses the polls as bunk 
the graveyards out there are littered with the bodies of 
candidates who were ahead in september and october and lost in 
november says the congressman 
schuettes last campaign finance report released in july 
showed he had raised 15 million 
kerr says the levin campaign is approaching its 6 million goal 
the only problem is weve spent most of it said kerr 
weve been on tv virtually nonstop since the fourth of july 
levin is telling voters who bill schuette is and what he 
stands for says political pollster and consultant steve 
mitchell any time your opponent defines who you are youre in 
trouble 
mitchell concludes it will take a miracle for schuette to 
overcome levins lead 
schuette tries to use the ongoing budget battle in washington to 
build up an antiincumbent sentiment against levin 
its the gang in charge thats the problem said schuette 
theres a wave thats coming across the country and people 
want to limit terms and they say weve got to have spending 
reductions instead of raising taxes he says it doesnt matter 
how much money carl levin puts on tv its not going to sweeten the 
electorates appetite for more of the same 
however kerr says levin is on the side of average michigan 
families and he has an effective record of doing things that affect 
their lives

the persian gulf crisis has unleashed 
forces seeking political reforms in the feudal gulf states 
including an extraordinary effort to discuss the future of kuwait 
if it is freed from iraqi occupation 
kuwaits exiled rulers have invited 450 prominent citizens to a 
conference in saudi arabia this weekend to consider the future 
shape of a free kuwait 
the government is eagerly and uncharacteristically 
soliciting the attendance of the western press at the event 
crown prince sheik saad al abdullah made it clear that the 
agenda will range from future defense arrangments to the rights of 
kuwaiti citizens and foreign workers 
the basic topic is liberation kuwaiti information ministry 
spokesman feisal mutawaa said in a telephone interview from the 
conference site in jiddah 
but all issues that members want to discuss will be 
discussed 
sheik saaid has called for a new social covenant between the 
rulers and kuwaiti citizens it follows widespread criticism by 
kuwaiti exiles of the domination of the alsabahs kuwaits deposed 
ruling family over their nations important financial and 
political institutions 
the debate is raising questions about the mandate of other gulf 
rulers benevolent despots who have so far rejected political 
parties and participatory democracy 
no government anywhere in the world would fail to take heed 
of changing situations by beginning to adjust whatever the 
prevailing situation sulaiman mutawaa minister for planning in 
the governmentinexile and feisals cousin said in london this 
week 
after his aug 2 invasion of kuwait iraqi president saddam 
hussein struck a responsive chord among the middle easts masses by 
claiming that kuwait was run by a selfish reactionary regime whose 
family had hoarded vast wealth for its own benefit 
to preempt such propaganda attacks the issue of powersharing 
is likely to take center stage in the other gulf states of saudi 
arabia qatar oman bahrain and the united arab emirates mideast 
experts say 
however few observers predict any immediate transformation to 
westernstyle democracy in a region without such traditions 
the gulf states are a political anachronism where oil wealth 
and the accompanying support and banking industries have reinforced 
a tribalbased feudalism uniqe in modern times 
the hereditary bedouin rulers power is rooted not only in 
tradition but also in their position as the symbolic source of the 
oilfueled largesse that has created some of the worlds highest 
per capita living standards 
the native populations are all beneficiaries of the welfare 
system except that isnt all they want said shahram chubin a 
middle east specialist who teaches at the graduate institute of 
international affairs in geneva 
the more educated ones want some say in the running of the 
country he added its not that theyre excluded from the 
benefits theyre excluded from any powersharing 
both kuwait and bahrain have sizeable middle classes and both 
have experimented with popular assemblies subordinate to the 
rulers authority 
sheik isa bin sulman alkhalifa dissolved bahrains 19month 
parliamentary experiment in 1975 after elements in the national 
assembly objected to a docking facilities agreement with the us 
navy 
kuwaits 50member elected naional assembly was dissolved by the 
emir sheik jaber alsabah in 1986 after iranian attacks on 
kuwaiti oil installations which delegates blamed in part on the 
governments poor security arrangements 
shortly before the aug 2 invasion he reinstated the assembly 
amid popular pressure for reform but added 25 appointed members 
saddams invasion and the subsequent popular support he 
garnered throughout the arab world have demonstrated the 
vulnerability of all the gulf states to destabilizaion by 
revolutionary populist forces 
all have proiranian shiites and palestinians forming a large 
part of their laboring underclass 
the gulfs ruling families are all sunnis moslems as are most 
of the citizenry 
the dynasties some in power for centuries must decide 
whether they can restore a significant part of the status quo or 
whether the best option is to preempt demands for democracy by 
taking steps along that road said mideast analyst don kerr of 
the international institute for strategic studies in london 
he noted that jordan where king hussein retains a strong 
measure of personal loyalty from his subjects is one of the arab 
worlds most politically liberal nations 
another issue surfacing is what political rights if any should 
be granted to the guest workers on which the gulf states depend 
heavily 
the citizens of qatar and the united arab emirates are 
minorities in their own countries and the same situation applied 
in preinvasion kuwait 
theyd have at some point to ask themselves at what juncture 
does someone who works there all his life gain the right to 
citizenship kerr said these people dont have any share 
and this is what saddams playing on in kuwait

every morning 90 iraqi sailors hoist the flag on 
their two esmeraldasclass corvettes rev their engines and swivel 
their 76millimeter cannons menacingly along the horizon 
it is a scene that would worry the us military if it were 
not taking place on the sunny italian riviera 
the two corvettes and eight other warships floating nearby 
were ordered from italy in 1980 they were to have formed the bulk 
of iraqs most powerful naval fleet ever 
but as saddam husseins country prepares for war its wouldbe 
navy is stranded at an italian military base and a nearby 
shipbuilders docks a victim of delays and italian government 
embargoes 
it will be very difficult for these ships to ever arrive in 
iraq said marco maria ferranti spokesman for the italian 
shipbuilder fincantieri 
the shipbuilding deal between iraq and italy is an example of 
the lucrative arms contracts that baghdad reached with western 
countries in the past decade 
for italy the 26 billion contract was a boon for the 
countrys sagging shipbuilding industry 
it called for the stateowned fincantieri to supply iraq with 
four lupoclass frigates each displacing about 2500 tons and 
armed with shortrange missiles 
the company also agreed to build two esmereldasclass corvettes 
and four wadiclass corvettes loaded with helicopters missile and 
rocket launchers and antisubmarine torpedos supplied by other 
italian firms 
the fleet also included a support ship and a floating dock 
it would have completely transformed the quality and capacity 
of their iraqs fleet said jim mccoy a naval analyst at the 
londonbased international institute of strategic studies 
they would have become a force in the persian gulf 
the first part of the shipbuilding deal a support ship headed 
for iraq in 1984 but by then iraq was at war with iran the ship 
could not reach its base at basra since the shattalarab waterway 
was blocked the vessel docked at alexandria egypt where it 
remains 
in 1986 two corvettes were formally turned over to iraq one 
hundred iraqi sailors went to the naval base at la spezia 270 
miles north of rome to train on the ships 
but later that year italy decided to suspend the sale of 
military goods to iran and iraq iraq which had paid half the 
price of the ships cut off further payments 
fincantieri continued to build hoping the measure was 
temporary their hopes were raised when the iraniraq war ground to 
a halt in 1988 
finally in april the italian government announced it was 
prepared in principle to let the ships go to iraq 
but iraq decided it wanted some compensation for its long wait 
according to ferranti iraq demanded more helicopters radar 
systems a highspeed gunboat shipbuilding plans and a 
sophisticated electronic warfare command system 
the italian government began to get cold feet in may italian 
police seized nearly 100 tons of steel parts on suspicions they 
were destined for an alleged iraqi supergun italy then refused 
to let the two iraqi corvettes go home 
the position of saddam hussein certainly wasnt reassuring 
said a foreign ministry spokesman alessandro di franco 
in the meantime iran worried about its gulf rival summoned 
the italian ambassador to protest any turnover of the ships to 
iraq 
negotiations on iraqs demands were stalled by the time it 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 italy has since observed a un boycott 
on trade with iraq leaving the ships stuck once again 
don kerr another analyst at the institute of strategic studies 
says the ships could have been useful now to iraq at the very 
least like a security blanket however they would have been no 
match for the multinational force now in the gulf 
what will happen to iraqs wouldbe navy 
the ships may be sold to someone else ferranti said however 
such a sale would mean breaking a legal contract with iraq and 
paying it back 
these arent packets of nuts they are warships said di 
franco its a delicate thing 
fincantieri is losing millions of dollars a year maintaining the 
ships it cant deliver ferranti said 
meanwhile every day the 90 iraqis go through their paces on 
their corvettes running fire drills swiveling the antiaircraft 
missile ramps and aiming the cannons at imaginary enemies 
officials said the arms have no ammunition they said 
the italian military keeps an eye on the iraqis but there are no 
restrictions on their movements said cmdr aldo de franceschi the 
chief of staff for the tirrenia region 
i think theyre very satisfied to be here he said here 
they are better off above all they are at peace

audrey hepurn and madonna might not know it 
but they have a lot in common where fashion is concerned 
in fact the looks they helped make famous the demure 1960s and 
the sexy 1990s combine to make up next years italian 
springsummer fashion 
models with accentuated eye makeup in pretty printed aline 
dresses and high heels and carrying the inevitable handbag rubbed 
elbows down the runway with colleagues wearing bra tops micro 
skirts derrierehugging hot pants and more unitards than in all 
the performances of cats put together 
prints were another big 1960 revival item during the 
readytowear moda milanese week that ended thursday ranging 
from the luxurious silk pucci prints to the mandrian block prints 
to the couregges blackandwhite geometric designs 
in theory the hot pants and miniskirts were also retro items 
but in practice the short shorts and the daring hemlined skirts 
made the 1960s hot pants and miniskirts look like childs play 
the biggest trendsetter for next years warmer weather is the 
shift dress which makes a comeback after seasons of layered 
fashion for next season it comes in aline or trapeze styles 
favored in hepurns most famous film breakfast at tiffanys 
the hemline is shorter than 30 years ago usually around the lower 
thigh giving it a modern flip look 
the dress is also the only real office apparel in the 
collections devoted mostly to holiday and afterhours fashion 
the prettiest dresses seen on the runway were at the mariuccia 
mandelli krizia collection they came in navy blue linen with white 
lapels and short sleeve cuffs gaily printed silks and white 
jersey with silver trimming 
karl lagerfeld for fendi had a series of demure trapeze styles 
in navy or bright shades with feminine pleats at the back giorgio 
armani preferred them in stretch brocade to be worn over silk 
shorts the pivoting item of his collection ferre and versace 
spiced them up with plunging or seethrough bodices and extra short 
hemlines 
the revival styles paired with red light district fashion seemed 
to reflect the present mood of italian fashion 
while the designers still want to maintain the tailored look 
that put them at the top of labeled readytowear in the 1980s 
they are in search of tempting new styles that will make women 
forget their shrinking pocketbook 
the result is both good and bad 
as one us buyer put it there are always rich people ready 
to buy expensive extravagant clothes what is missing are items for 
the client who wants welltailored sensible clothes 
buyers this season are cutting down their orders plagued by a 
recession fears back home a falling dollar and a wholesale 
increase of over 20 percent 
the designer who stopped the milan show for extravagance was 
beverly hills favorite gianni versace with his breathtaking printed 
outfits from the catsuits with matching color scheme shoes and 
jewelry to the multicolored sequined jackets depicting andy warhol 
vogue covers of such stars as marilyn monroe james dean and 
madonna 
the sexiest show in town was the dolce and gabbana collection 
with its sequined bra tops bare midriffs chiffon skirtlets and 
shimmery hot pants all accompanied by thigh stockings 
the two sicilian designers domenico dolce and stefano gabbana 
are considered one of the upandcoming labels of a fashion scene 
perceived by some to be lacking new blood 
another new name on the circuit is moschino who pokes fun at his 
colleagues by layering each outfit on the runway with every style 
and trend imaginable 
his shows are always very entertaining and on closer 
examination contain many good wearable pieces favorite items for 
next season were the red pant suit with the words waist of 
money embroidered in gold letters around the waistline of the 
jacket and a shift dress with the map of italy stiched down the 
front 
far from the crowd in an elegant showroom the spanish designer 
sybilla showed her clothes to editors and buyers by appointment 
the new collection is minimal fashion at its best 
three ideas proved that sybilla knows where fashion is going 
a black gown that was pieced together with transparent nylon 
thread so that it looked like each seperate piece was suspended on 
the body 
a wraparound dress made up of a jersey shawl with arm holes 
that you put on by crisscrossing it over the body the answer to 
the elgant travelers prayer 
and a mail order catalogue depicting each item in the 
collection for a quick understanding of what sybilla is all about 
on wednesday night giorgio armani still the safest and most 
consistently beautiful label in milan closed the springsummer 
1991 collections 
for daytime he offered the softest most feminine gray business 
suits worn with crisp white blouses and a chic unknotted tie the 
new blazer has petal slits on the side lapels but no collar 
the central item of the collection are shorts which armani uses 
under daytime jackets as well as an alternative to underwear in his 
long evening gowns slit up the front

when rep pat williams won his house floor 
battle to rescue the national endowment for the arts from 
conservative attack he happily lost a 1 bet to an old montana 
cowboy 
six months ago williams says he was convinced that the federal 
arts agency wouldnt survive the political controversy over nea 
support for arts projects that its critics consider obscene and 
blasphemous 
the montana democrat a staunch nea supporter said an elderly 
cowboy in his home district bet that williams would prevail when 
the issue reached the house floor 
williams owes the cowpoke a buck 
on thursday the house overwhelmingly rejected a move to abolish 
the nea defeated a proposal to impose tough new antiobscenity 
restrictions and embraced a bipartisan compromise that would leave 
the obscenity issue to the courts 
the compromise bill drafted by williams and rep e thomas 
coleman rmo after months of intense negotiations was approved 
on a 38242 roll call vote the margin surprised williams 
it was a bigger victory in favor of tolerance and freedom of 
expression than i had expected he said the house made it much 
easier for members of the senate to save the nea 
like a similar measure awaiting senate floor action the house 
bill would shift from the nea to the courts the burden of deciding 
whether federally subsidized arts projects are obscene 
under the bill grant recipients who are subsequently convicted 
of using their federal funds to create works that violate obscenity 
laws would be required to return their grant money to the nea once 
they do they would be eligible to apply for new endowment grants 
the house measure also would order reforms in the neas 
grantmaking procedures with the aim of making them more responsive 
to the taxpaying public in a provision pushed by republicans the 
bill would increase the share of nea grant money allocated to the 
states from 20 percent to 35 percent over the next three years 
the bill would extend the neas statutory authority for three 
years instead of the usual five years and would declare that 
works violating the supreme courts obscenity standard shall not 
be funded 
current restrictions imposed by congress a year ago at the 
urging of sen jesse helms rnc forbid nea financing of works 
that may be considered obscene including depictions of 
homosexual and sadomasochistic activities and sexual exploitation 
of children 
the house planned to begin debate later today on a separate 
appropriations bill that would boost the neas budget from 171 
million to 180 million in the fiscal year that began oct 1 
rep ralph regula rohio obtained permission to introduce a 
floor amendment to the money bill that would forbid nea financing 
of obscene or indecent art his proposal also would require the 
endowment chairman to ensure that neasupported works are 
appropriate for a general audience 
williams and coleman said that if regulas amendment is tacked 
onto the money bill they will seek to replace it with the terms of 
their measure so the house will take a uniform position on the nea 
in both bills 
during an emotional fivehour debate on the nea bill thursday 
the house defeated 36164 a move by rep philip crane rill to 
abolish the nea 
then it rejected 249175 a proposal by rep dana rohrabacher 
rcalif to impose stringent new antiobscenity curbs on nea 
grants 
this would include a ban on financing works that depict 
sexually explicit conduct or child pornography attack 
religion defile the american flag or include an actual human 
embryo or fetus 
rohrabacher warned his colleagues that the american people are 
watching this debate on television implying that lawmakers who 
opposed his amendment would face the wrath of voters in the nov 6 
elections 
he denounced the williamscoleman bill as a fraud and 
challenged the house to set standards so our tax dollars are not 
channeled into subsidizing child pornography or attacks on 
christianity 
rohrabachers opponents charged that his proposal was an 
unconstitutional attempt to intimidate artists and squelch freedom 
of expression for political gain

a man who had been his quadriplegic sons sole 
caretaker for 12 years died of lung cancer a week after he 
apparently helped his son end his life so the young man wouldnt be 
left alone 
robert bergstedt 64 died thursday at nathan adelson hospice 
said his attorney he checked into the hospital after his 
31yearold son kenneth died last week 
both deaths came before the nevada supreme court ruled on 
kenneth bergstedts petition that he be allowed to end his life 
without threat of legal recourse against anyone who helped him die 
i think the story of roberts care of his son is really an 
epic story of eternal love supreme court justice cliff young 
said if anybodys deserving of being considered for canonization 
or sainthood i think robert would be a nominee 
kenneth bergstedt sought to end his life for fear his father 
his sole companion would not be around to take care of him in 
court papers he said he found little fulfillment in life which he 
spent strapped to a gurney and hooked to a respirator 
a lower court had ruled in his favor but asked that he postpone 
his death until the supreme court could rule 
ive lost two very close friends in the last week said 
attorney jack cherry 
cherry said bergstedt lost a leg in a 1947 industrial accident 
his wife died of cancer in 1978 and he had cared for his son since 
a swimming accident in 1969 left him crippled bergstedt was 
diagnosed last month as having cancer 
how tough can one family have it the lawyer said any 
time you think youve got it tough take a look at these folks 
everythings relative 
kenneth bergstedt was found dead oct 4 in the mobile home he 
and his father shared the coroners office said it was awaiting 
toxicology tests before ruling on the cause of death 
robert bergstedt told the las vegas sun last week that he gave 
his son sedatives and loosened his respirator after his son told 
him he could not live any longer 
but police said bergstedt told them his sons respirator had 
accidentally worked loose and that he had awakened to find kenneth 
bergstedt dead 
young said the supreme court plans to rule on the righttodie 
case anyway 
we could say its moot because kenneth is dead but the court 
has pretty well indicated it wants to face the issue directly he 
said

five demonstrators chained themselves 
to the gates of the soviet consulate today to publicize the arrests 
of a greenpeace crew by the soviet union four days earlier 
the protesters were demanding that soviet authorities allow a 
resumption of radio contact between the 34member crew of the 
vessel mv greenpeace and the enviromental groups london 
headquarters said greenpeace spokeswoman michelle grosvenor 
she said the protesters will remain chained to the consulate 
gates until radio contact is resumed and the safety of the crew 
guaranteed 
the crew including an austrialian and and at least one 
american was seized monday by the kgb while protesting a planned 
nuclear weapons test on the soviet archipelago of novaya zemlya 
a soviet foreign ministry statement released thursday said the

its taking longer than president bush 
predicted but the united states and the soviet union are only 
months away from signing two of the most significant arms reduction 
treaties in history 
one would rid europe of thousands of tanks airplanes 
antiaircraft artillery pieces and armored troop carriers most of 
the cuts would be in soviet weapons 
the other pact would trim us and soviet longrange nuclear 
missiles by about 30 percent overall hundreds of warheads would be 
scrapped under tight supervision 
the european treaty is the most comprehensive arms control 
accord in history the ussoviet strategic arms reduction accord 
meanwhile deals with the deadliest weapons and at 400 to 500 
pages is of unprecedented length 
bush predicted the conventional weapons treaty would be ready by 
last june at the latest it looks like it will be ready in 
midnovember the heads of the 16 north atlantic treaty 
organization countries and the six warsaw pact nations will sign 
the treaty in paris at a glittering summit meeting 
bush hoped to sign the start accord with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in moscow in december there is a slim chance 
of that us officials say early next year is more likely 
deadlines are not the main consideration harnessing the race in 
conventional and nuclear weapons once a visionary dream is about 
to become a reality 
incredibly the historic development has not captured the 
publics imagination one reason is that the end of the cold war 
already has soothed nuclear war nerves gorbachev is committed to 
withdrawing many of the tanks to be cut under the treaty along 
with the troops that accompany them bush has ordered more modest 
cuts 
the conventional forces in europe treaty will make cutbacks 
legally binding however and it will establish a framework for 
even deeper reductions later on 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze cleared the last roadblocks in new 
york last week these involved limits on landbased airplanes and 
verification procedures against cheating 
the two officials were unable however to resolve the remaining 
differences in the strategic arms reduction treaty the four key 
ones are 
the restrictions to be imposed on transfers to allies of 
weapons barred under the treaty this mostly involves us nuclear 
submarine technology for britain 
the restrictions to be imposed on improving the soviet ss18 
intercontinental ballistic missiles 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
longrange weapon under the treaty and made subject therefore to 
limitations 
procedures for verifying the destruction of the bombers 
submarines and missiles outlawed under the treaty 
baker indicated last friday that his talks with shevardnadze 
tripped over the transfer issue and that the ss18 and backfire 
problems could be settled once what arms controllers call 
noncircumvention is cleared up 
in every nuclear negotiation the soviets press us on 
cooperation with britain and they have acceded ultimately every 
time a us official said thursday personally i am optimistic 
that well settle this one 
the backfire bomber also has dogged ussoviet nuclear arms 
talks for a long time 
the soviets insist the weapon is of mediumrange the united 
states insists the backfire can span oceans and should be 
restricted both in range and in number 
the solution may be an agreement outside the treaty in which the 
soviets volunteer to curb backfire 
the ss18 issue causes the most concern among conservatives in 
congress some were ready to crucify baker a few months ago when he 
tentatively agreed to some tests of the missile the deadliest in 
the soviet arsenal 
the soviets already have agreed to cut their ss18 stockpile in 
half from 308 to 154 the question is at what point improvements 
in the existing ss18 amount to creation of an illegal new weapon 
the official who gave the associated press a progress report 
under conditions of anonymity cautioned i would not downgrade 
the importance of the specifics of verification 
among the tough items are the procedures for inspecting missile 
plants to guard against the production of illegal weapons 
they require long hours and a lot of work and focus but that 
doesnt mean its impossible the official said

when students at a roman catholic school 
here recite the pledge of allegiance they promise loyalty to a 
country that offers liberty and justice for the born and the 
unborn 
the principal at lorain catholic high school said she and 
faculty members added the phrase this week to reflect the churchs 
antiabortion stance 
some of the schools 400 students in this town 35 miles west of 
cleveland said that they were not ordered to recite the phrase to 
the end of the pledge but that they feel pressured to do so and 
resent it 
its like changing the constitution junior angela martinez 
said thursday 
others said the antiabortion sentiment should be expected in a 
catholic schoo 
senior meghan chapple said the change gave the same emphasis and 
values behind catholic prayers of those who disaprove she said 
theyre at a catholic school and should be expected to uphold 
the catholic values 
some students had threatened to boycott classes thursday to 
protest the change but students questioned after school said they 
had not skipped classes and did not know if others had 
principal joanne miller said the amended pledge was appropriate 
and that no students had protested 
students come here by choice they do not come here because 
this is their district and when they come they agree to our 
policies and our philosophy she said 
this week has been designated respect for life week at 
catholic schools around the nation students are being urged to 
reflect on the issues of abortion euthanasia the homeless and 
poverty 
robert kealey executive director for the national catholic 
education association in washington said he had not heard of any 
other school altering the pledge of allegiance the association 
represents most of the nations catholic secondary and elementary 
schools 
jerry lackamp spokesman for the catholic diocese of cleveland 
said referring to the unborn in the pledge is not policy for 
catholic schools in northeastern ohio 
some students said they recite the pledge then stop at the new 
part 
a lot of students when they say the pledge say justice for 
all and then sit down and you just hear the rest over the pa 
system said marcie apont an eighthgrader

some of their yields have been shaved by dry 
weather but farmers nationally are harvesting a bumper corn crop 
this fall according to new estimates by the agriculture 
department 
production was estimated thursday at 802 billion bushels up 7 
percent from last years crop thats the most since the 1986 
harvest of 823 billion bushels 
however the new estimate by the departments agricultural 
statistics board was down 1 percent from last months forecast of 
812 billion bushels 
early in september lack of moisture in the western corn belt 
caused deteriorating crop conditions the boards report said 
crop conditions lagged furthest behind in illinois indiana and 
missouri 
farmers harvested 753 billion bushels in 1989 and the 
department in its initial 1990 forecast on aug 9 put this falls 
harvest at 785 billion bushels before raising it last month 
john a schnittker of schnittker associates a washingtonbased 
consulting firm said the forecast is almost equal to the amount 
of corn we will need in the next 12 months to meet domestic and 
export demands now projected 
but the bad news he said is that this corn crop coincides 
with a glut in wheat especially big wheat producers including 
the united states are subsidizing exports in an effort to unload 
surpluses 
the big wheat crop glutting the world market and the 
subsidization of wheat pushing it below corn prices is the real 
problem schnittker said 
based on oct 1 surveys corn yields were estimated at a record 
1203 bushels per acre harvested compared with 1162 bushels last 
year and 1217 bushels indicated last month the old record was 
1194 bushels in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 58 percent in 
1989 the sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 are expected 
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 182 billion bushels down 5 percent from 
last years harvest of 193 billion bushels and 1 percent below the 
september forecast of 183 billion bushels 
cotton production was indicated at 145 million bales up 19 
percent from last years output of 122 million bales but down 1 
percent from the september forecast 
the revised estimates showed total wheat production at 274 
billion bushels up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest but down 
slightly from last month 
the departments allcrops production index was reported at 111 
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison down one 
percentage point from september but still the highest reading since 
the index averaged 116 percent in 1985 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 199091 marketing year that 
began sept 1 is expected to be about 8095 billion bushels 
including domestic and export requirements 
with demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production that will 
mean a decrease in us corn stockpiles to about 1273 billion 
bushels left over by sept 1 1991 
but the downturn would be modest compared with 1989 when the 
corn stockpile plummeted from 426 billion bushels on sept 1 1988 
to 193 billion bushels on hand last sept 1 
the report said us corn prices may average in the range of 
220 to 260 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year up 10 
cents from the september projection corn prices at the farm 
averaged about 236 per bushel last season 
no significant changes were reported in the us wheat supply 
and demand situation and prices at the farm are expected to 
average 255 to 285 per bushel this marketing year from 372 in 
198990 
soybean prices at the farm were forecast at 570 to 7 per 
bushel in 199091 compared with 570 the past marketing year 
that was up 20 cents on the lower end of the range in september 
other 1990 crop estimates based on oct 1 indications compared 
with 1989 output included 
sorghum 5619 million bushels and an average yield of 607 
bushels per acre compared with 6179 million and 554 in 1989 
rice 158 million hundredweight and a yield of 5629 pounds per 
acre compared with 1545 million and 5749 
peanuts 336 billion pounds and a yield of 1917 pounds per 
acre compared with 399 billion and 2426 
tobacco 158 billion pounds and a yield of 2166 pounds per 
acre compared with 137 billion and 2016 
sugar beets 271 million tons and a yield of 1989 tons per 
acre compared with 251 million and 194 
sugar cane 257 million tons and a yield of 357 tons per 
acre compared with 294 million and 345

defense secretary dick cheney plans to press 
soviet government officials for secret information about the iraqi 
military while hes in moscow next week an aide said 
cheney is scheduled to meet with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on wednesday as well as with foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and defense minister dimitri yazov cheney also will 
meet with soviet political reform leaders 
the cheney aide speaking on condition of anonymity said 
thursday that moscow had not responded to previous us requests 
for detailed intelligence on iraqi weapons most of which were 
designed and built by soviets 
the soviets have provided american officials with general 
assessments of iraqi intentions regarding the occupation of kuwait 
but nothing more specific the official said 
last month soviet kgb chairman vladimir a kryuchkov said in an 
interview with the associated press that moscow was willing to 
share intelligence on iraq with washington but hadnt made the 
offer directly because it has been rebuffed in the past by the cia 
nearly all the estimated 3500 iraqi tanks deployed in kuwait 
and southern iraq and many of that countrys military aircraft are 
of soviet design us officials claim that several hundred soviet 
technical specialists are in iraq advising iraqi military officials 
on maintaining warplanes and other sovietbuilt equipment 
cheney is scheduled to arrive in moscow on tuesday his will be 
the second visit to that country by an american secretary of 
defense cheneys predecessor frank carlucci was there in 1988 
cheney will hold meetings with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher and her defense secretary tom king in london on monday 
before flying to moscow he will stop in paris on his way back from 
moscow on oct 19 to meet with president francois mitterrand and 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement 
the london and paris meetings will focus mainly on the status of 
arms control negotiations and on prospects for redefining the role 
of the north atlantic treaty organization the pentagon official 
said he said the persian gulf crisis was not expected to be a 
major topic 
the pentagon official said that although cheney would press the 
soviets for specific intelligence on the iraqi military 
discussions on the gulf crisis would be secondary to questions 
about soviet economic social and political reform 
he said cheney would stress to the soviets that the bush 
administration is planning major cuts in defense spending plus the 
withdrawal of more than 40000 troops from western europe this 
will be highlighted in hopes of encouraging the soviets to carry 
through with their declared intentions of reducing military 
strength the official said

vast budget gaps bondrating woes and 
fingerpointing by big shots new yorks crisis has all the marks 
of the citys nearbankruptcy 15 years ago but fiscal watchdogs 
say there wont be a reprise of 1975 
that was the year new york pleaded for a federal rescue and the 
daily news scored with the headline ford to city drop dead 
it was the year 25000 city workers including 5000 police 
officers were laid off 8000 substitute teachers were fired and 
services were slashed 
this year the headlines trumpet fiscal warnings that seemingly 
are as perilous as the economy goes downhill regionally and 
nationally 
mayor david n dinkins 10 months in office is plugging a 18 
billion budget deficit just three months into the fiscal year and 
grappling with a gap for next year 
the first week of october epitomized the citys struggle to 
limit spending without gutting services 
first the city gave teachers a 55 percent raise in a oneyear 
contract settlement critics said the amount was too generous and 
would set a bad example for negotiations with 250000 other city 
workers 
responding to a summer crime wave dinkins let loose a criminal 
justice plan with a 19 billion price tag leaders in the state 
legislature promptly said they would block the taxes dinkins called 
for to finance the package 
dinkins then imposed a hiring freeze and said he was considering 
laying off 15000 workers because of declining revenue 
the jobless rate in the city hit 79 percent in september up 
from 62 percent in august 
to top it off standard and poors announced tuesday it has 
placed the citys 13 billion in general obligation bonds on 
credit watch meaning the citys bond rating might be lowered 
bond markets have been tumbling since forcing higher borrowing 
costs on the city 
then came the namecalling former mayor edward i koch accused 
labor commissioner eric schmertz of helping teachers take dinkins 
to the cleaners 
schmertz said koch was indulging in monumental bitchiness 
and had been involved in the most corrupt administration since 
jimmy walkers in the 1920s 
dinkins had to weather bad publicity over a headboard for his 
bed as he was urging belttightening the headboard reportedly cost 
11500 the administration said that whatever the cost it would 
be covered privately 
so how bad is the situation compared with 1975 
not the same not as bad said edward v regan state 
comptroller in those days in 1975 the city was unable to 
borrow basically unable to pay its bills in a lot of ways 
hyman c grossman standard amp poors managing director said 
we expect the city to pull it out but we have a bigger 
question mark which is why we have a credit watch 
the situation is lousy its awful but its not calamitous 
said herbert bienstock who was director of the local us bureau 
of labor statistics from 1962 to 1980 and heads a queens college 
research unit 
the major differences between then and now the analysts agreed 
is that the city was not prepared to handle the crisis of 75 
harrison goldin said that when he became city comptroller in 
1974 the city didnt have the foggiest idea where its money 
was as it turned out some was in shoeboxes tucked in closets 
where goldin said he found billions of dollars worth of deposits 
from contractors and negotiable municipal bonds 
the city he said didnt have the basic information to run a 
corner candy store 
very true agreed elinor b bachrach now deputy state 
comptroller for new york city from 1975 to 1981 she was on the 
staff of sen william proxmires senate banking committee where 
the city turned for help 
in those days the city couldnt even tell how much its deficit 
was how many people it had on its payroll bachrach said 
despite president fords opposition to a bailout the city 
pulled through 1975 after new fiscal constraints and monitoring 
were imposed and the feds coughed up 23 billion in shortterm 
loans 
the restraints included a law that the citys budget must 
balance creation of bachrachs office of deputy comptroller to 
monitor the citys finances and creation of a special 
belttightening board they are the same restraints expected to 
save the city from itself this time 
in a certain sense you are seeing the system work not the 
system not working said regan my guess is other than the 
economy eroding the mayor will come to grips with this it wont 
get worse

dozens of chinese government buyers are coming 
to the united states today to order american goods but us 
officials believe the main item on their shopping list is 
congressional goodwill 
the delegation the largest china has sent here comes as the 
house moved toward a vote on the administrations plan to extend 
trade benefits to china for another year 
the benefits known as most favored nation status are vital to 
china because they slash tariffs on chinese goods sold in the 
united states chinas biggest export market 
chinas trade status was in danger last year after its violent 
suppression of a prodemocracy demonstration at beijings tiananmen 
square many lawmakers are demanding the administration withhold 
the favored trade status unless china improves its human rights 
record 
they fully realize congressional sensitivities said david 
denny of the uschina business council a nonprofit group 
representing us firms doing business in china 
the invitation was solicited by china on the advice of us 
officials and lobbyists who urged them to appease congress much as 
taiwan and south korea do with such missions when their trade 
policies come under fire 
many members of congress also are upset over chinas trade 
surplus with the united states its increasing import restrictions 
against certain us products and its limits on us investment 
opportunities 
according to us commerce department figures the united states 
sold china products worth 58 billion last year mostly wheat 
boeing aircraft cotton and wood the united states bought from 
china almost double that amount 1199 billion mostly in 
apparel and footwear 
china which calculates the trade figures differently shows a 
surplus of only 13 billion 
either way reducing the surplus or announcing significant 
deals will do them some good with congress denny said 
only four lawmakers have agreed to meet with the delegation the 
rest have cited scheduling problems or said they dont want to be 
influenced before the vote on chinas trade status said one source 
who asked not to be named 
despite an administration ban on highlevel contacts with 
chinese officials imposed by president bush after the tiananmen 
square massacre the delegation will meet with lawrence 
eagleburger deputy secretary of state and thomas murrin deputy 
secretary of commerce 
the administration has made other exceptions to this ban most 
recently when secretary of state james a baker iii met with his 
chinese counterpart at the united nations but each time was 
described as an exception 
other sanctions imposed by the bush administration including a 
suspension of weapons sales and strict limits on loans to china 
remain in place 
chinese officials have promised to place orders for us goods 
worth 200 million or 300 million and negotiate for future 
purchases the team plans to visit washington new york chicago 
houston los angeles and seattle 
the trade mission demonstrates chinas determination of 
continuing to open to the outside world according to an 
announcement by chinese authorities 
but us officials and trade experts are skeptical 
its unclear how many new contracts therell actually be 
said one official familiar with the mission they may just sign 
contracts already in the pipeline 
chinas conservative leaders have shown few signs they actually 
intend to relax their trade policies since they began rolling back 
from economic liberalization two years ago 
on the contrary responding to a decline in economic growth and 
to fears of inflation as well as the burden of repaying the 
countrys 40 billion international debt authorities have 
restricted imports

an unfinished piece of music by wolfgang amadeus 
mozart has been played possibly for the first time after a 
relative decided to auction off the work composed about 200 years 
ago 
five students at the royal college of music on thursday 
performed the 35 bars of the quintet in b flat major for piano 
and wind instruments oboe clarinet basset horn and bassoon 
they are an unusual group of instruments and i think the work 
might not have been completed because mozart may have found it 
difficult to find musicians to play them said stephen roe 
director of manuscripts at sothebys 
the firm will auction the music nov 21 
the fragment took 1 minutes to perform and sounded complete 
although it was only the opening of a work 
roe said the single sheet of music was on the same kind of paper 
mozart was using in 1783 he said it was brought to one of their 
offices on the european continent by a member of the family who had 
preserved it for more than a century and who asked not to be 
identified

saudi arabia plans to increase crude oil 
production another 10 percent by the middle of next year and will 
speed up expansion plans to reach peak output of 10 million barrels 
a day by 1995 the washington post said in fridays editions 
in a dispatch from dhahran saudi arabia the newspaper quoted 
saudi oil executives as dismissing reports of problems in the 
expansion plan 
saudi aramco the stateowned oil company now produces 77 
million barrels a day a 45 percent increase from the 53 million 
daily barrels it was producing before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 
2 
kuwait and iraq had been producing 435 million barrels a day 
and that oil was immediately embargoed from world trade 
though the extra saudi production and increases in output 
elsewhere have replaced a large fraction of the lost production 
worried buyers have pushed the price of oil in international 
markets from about 21 a barrel in july to around 40 now 
in the late 1970s saudi arabia often produced 10 million 
barrels a day but production was cut back in the 1980s and 
facilities were mothballed 
reporting on an interview with nasr ajmi executive vice 
president of saudi aramco the newspaper said saudi production 
would reach 8 million barrels a day by the end of this year 
by the middle of 1991 the target is 85 million or 
better ajmi was quoted as saying 
we have every reason to believe we can get to that level and 
sustain it he said 
the government had already decided to restore capacity to 10 
million barrels a day in the 1990s but now will try to do 10 years 
of expansion work in five the newspaper said 
saudi arabia has by far the largest oil reserves in the world

the high fat fare preferred by fast 
foodloving americans is a killer diet that encourages cancer 
growth but scientists still dont know exactly why rich food seems 
to have this effect 
at a conference thursday on the effects of diet on cancer 
creighton university school of medicine researcher dr henry t 
lynch said there is good evidence that what americans eat is 
affecting the way many of them die 
the man on the street is eating himself to death with a killer 
diet of high calories and high fat said lynch they are more 
vulnerable to cancer we know that from epidemiological studies 
but the precise biological link between diet and the development 
of cancer cells is still unknown lynch said that despite claims by 
some unconventional cancer treatment centers there is no 
conclusive clear evidence that any specific food or diet is an 
absolute protection from cancer 
lynch a speaker at a meeting of the american institute for 
cancer research said all that scientists can say for sure is that 
a highfiber lowfat diet is a prudent precaution against 
cancer 
this is based on studies of populations in which the occurrence 
of cancer is lower than the rate in the united states or in other 
countries that have adopted a western diet he said 
laboratory studies using animals fed special diets have shown 
very appealing evidence that some nutrients can protect against 
the formation of cancer cells lynch said 
but this does not mean that special diets will have the same 
effect among people 
in humans the data is still preliminary and fragmentary 
said lynch when bringing dietary manipulation to a clinical 
application were still in a gray zone 
once cancer has developed lynch said there has been no 
reputable research showing that special diets or food supplements 
can effectively defeat the disease 
people with cancer may spend thousands of dollars on 
unconventional treatments based on unusual diets but they are 
wasting their money the researcher said 
there are no anticancer dietary supplements said lynch a 
practicing cancer specialist i know patients who get into that 
garbage and its pathetic 
carmia borek a professor at the tufts university school of 
medicine said there have been studies showing that low levels of 
some nutrients are more common among people with cancer and she 
said that laboratory studies on isolated cells and in animals have 
shown that increased levels of some vitamins and other nutrients 
can interrupt the development of cancer cells 
but she said there still is no evidence relating these 
findings to humans or proving that dietary manipulation can either 
treat or prevent cancer 
we still have to do work on that she said i dont think 
well have the final evidence for a long time 
lynch said one way to get this evidence would be to study 
families in which there is a genetic predisposition for cancer 
there are thousands of families that have been decimated by 
cancer he said some family members said lynch are destined by 
genetics to have a 5050 chance of developing the disease 
using controlled diets in carefully designed studies with these 
families he said could give final answers on cancer and diet 
in about one generation 
the evidence is very strong that diet is associated with 
cancer but its not clear if dietary manipulation can prevent the 
disease said lynch the hypothesis has to be tested 
a number of federal and private health organizations have said 
that the typical american diet includes too much animal fat and too 
little complex carbohydrates 
some studies have shown that americans typically consume up to 
45 percent of their daily calories from foods rich in fat the 
american heart association recommends only 30 percent of a diet 
from fat and some experts said the fat content should be as low as 
20 percent

sen dennis deconcini says nobody should write 
his political obituary because of an ethics investigation and 
predicts no wrongdoing will be found in his help for a collapsing 
savings and loan 
the arizona democrat after closed testimony thursday before the 
senate ethics committee said hes confident the truth will 
prevail and that the sixmember panel of his peers will 
exonerate me 
deconcini and four other senators are under investigation for 
the help they gave former savings and loan executive charles h 
keating jr the businessman and his associates contributed 13 
million to the five lawmakers campaigns and causes 
congressional sources have said committee special counsel robert 
s bennett recommended that there was enough evidence to continue 
the ethics investigation against sens deconcini alan cranston of 
california and donald w riegle jr of michigan 
bennett recommended dismissal for sens john glenn of ohio and 
john mccain of arizona mccain is the only republican in the group 
deconcini met with the committee for five hours punctuated by 
several breaks mostly to answer questions but also to give a 
halfhour statement defending his cnduct 
the committee which investigates potential violations of senate 
conduct has met individually with deconcini mccain and glenn 
cranston and riegle are scheduled to appear next week 
deconcini a threeterm senator who is up for election in 1994 
said the investigation has been a very trying time for him but 
added i wouldnt write an obituary for sen deconcini if i 
decide to run again 
the senator contended there was no basis to allegations by 
common cause a group that monitors congress that his help for 
keating violated senate rules common causes complaint that all 
five senators may have broken the rules triggered the preliminary 
investigation that began last december 
deconcini played an active role for keating inviting other 
senators to join him in sessions with us banking regulators and 
urging banking officials to approve the sale rather than seizure 
of keatings lincoln savings and loan 
his contacts with regulators continued until the time lincoln 
was brought under federal control in april 1989 a move that could 
cost taxpayers more than 2 billion in bailout costs lincoln was 
based in irvine calif but keatings main company american 
continental corp was in phoenix 
deconcini has maintained that his assistance for keating simply 
was representation for a constituent who was a major arizona 
employer 
the nations former top thrift regulator edwin j gray accused 
deconcini of offering him a deal on keatings behalf in april 1987 
but the senator and three of his colleagues who were present denied 
the proposal was ever made 
deconcini received 48100 in contributions from keating and 
associates but announced a year ago he was returning the money 
because there was a possibility the funds were illegally funneled 
from lincoln

a key soviet economic adviser says his country 
must make a very drastic change of the economic and political 
system but american business leaders say they expect no quick 
bonanza from the soviet unions movement toward a market economy 
stanislav shatalin chief adviser for economics on the 
presidential council of the ussr told the annual business week 
symposium of chief executive officers thursday that the soviet 
economic system is really hard to call economics at all 
it has become clear that the very basis of all our crises is 
the fact that we have a very inefficient economy shatalin said 
this will be very painful because of the fact that we have lagged 
behind in this area for many decades unfortunately 
some attending the conference were skeptical about the prospects 
for increased american business from any improvement 
i dont think there is going to be an immediate payoff at 
all warren bennis professor of business administration at the 
university of southern california and a member of the board of 
united research said in an interview 
this has been a bureaucratization that has been going on for 
70 years bennis said its verging on a hopeless situation 
there some american know how and some money may help but i think 
its going to be a much longer time than eastern europe 
i dont see any immediate bottom line implications bennis 
added 
richard ruch chief executive officer and president of herman 
miller inc said if you are asking me when russia is really 
going to be a market of opportunity that im not so sure of 
im sure eventually it is going to happen he said but we 
hear statements that there is an awful lot of work that has to be 
done in the soviet union 
i think it depends on what business you are in ruch said 
if you are in a business thats got a product that they really 
need now is the time to set up relationships and get going 
but if your product is office furniture like ours which is 
always a deferrable postponable type of purchase maybe its still 
a little bit too early to try to move in 
but we are going to watch them very closely because it could 
happen faster than we think ruch added 
richard le fauve president of saturn corp was guardedly 
hopeful about prospects for improvement in the soviet economy 
i think it depends on us le fauve said if we are willing 
to open up and share with the russian leadership through letting 
them visit and learn on the job so to speak i think it could 
happen very soon if we become conservative and try to teach 
through a lecturing process i think it will take forever 
shatalin said without assistance from the west it will be 
very difficult to accomplish our reforms 
the soviet official spoke to an audience of about 200 american 
executives and their spouses at the national museum of women in the 
arts

a nationwide republican campaign funding 
organization has agreed to withdraw its effort to raise money in 
idaho by offering people a 25 check says state attorney general 
jim jones 
the republican presidential task force has agreed to contact the 
people and offer them refunds said jones 
earlier in the day idaho democratic chairman conley ward asked 
jones to investigate whether the fundraising tactic violates state 
consumer protection laws or criminal fraud statutes 
letters told the recipients they could cash the 25 checks at 
absolutely no cost to you 
in fact however cashing the check constituted permission for 
the task force to automatically withdraw 1250 per month from the 
recipients bank account until the recipient sent written notice to 
stop it democrats said 
jones said on sept 28 he contacted the organization requesting 
information on what they were doing and officials agreed to stop 
it although there was no admission that there was anything wrong 
jones said the group informed him they sent 7000 letters to 
idaho residents the same letter went out nationwide raising 
protests from democrats in some states

a woman bugged about paying toll charges just to 
talk to her daughter six miles away has won a 17year battle to get 
the phone company to change its rate structure but she wont fully 
share in the victory 
estelle simon 70 of rural sudbury can call her daughters 
town of marlboro for free but sudbury residents still will be 
charged for calling lincoln which shares a high school with 
sudbury because of how the system is wired 
can you believe this simon said in an interview this week 
i blew my top 
in fact there will still be a charge to call the local crisis 
line six miles away in acton 
people who are about to commit suicide are not going to make a 
toll call simon scoffed 
simon decided to take on atampt then the largest corporation in 
the world in 1973 when her daughter moved a toll call away to 
neighboring marlboro 
i realized there was a lot wrong with the telephone company 
she said 
waging battle singlehandedly in rate hearings and regulatory 
proceedings before the state department of public utilities simon 
argued that smalltown residents were subsidizing the phone service 
of people in big cities 
all paid the same 9 for basic service but bigcity dwellers 
could reach more phones for free until 1984 in fact customers in 
93 communities including sudbury were even charged for calls 
within the same town 
thanks to simon new england telephone co on oct 19 will 
eliminate toll charges for calls between neighboring exchanges and 
reduce rates for other instate calls the ruling affects more than 
100 exchanges around the state 
public utilities officials had said during the battle that 
simons case was so well documented that new england telephone 
would probably be forced to overhaul its whole rate structure 
it was very flattering but at the same time my heart sank 
she said here we were fighting with the phone company to give 
relief to 4200 phones which is all we had in sudbury now we were 
talking about thousands of phones and millions of dollars and i 
knew they were going to fight that much harder 
under the new rates a fourminute morning call from brimfield 
to williamstown in western massachusetts on a weekday will fall 
from 111 to 23 cents a fourminute call at the same time of day 
from boston to new york costs 87 cents over atampt 
the phone company also eliminated the toll for calling marlboro 
simon said she recently paid about 100 a month in calls to her 
daughter 
but basic service went up 3 and dialing lincoln will continue 
to cost extra in sudbury about 15 miles from downtown boston the 
day rate for calls to lincoln will be 19 cents for the first minute 
and 9 cents a minute after that 
thats because of the wiring configuration between the towns and 
billing problems the phone company said an argument used against 
simon for 17 years 
there are people who are saying gee i wish you could have 
included this town or that town but you cant get the approval of 
all of the people all of the time said new england telephone 
spokeswoman roberta clement

americas education establishment is watching 
an oregon ballot measure that would let parents send their children 
to any school in the state 
the socalled school choice proposal on the nov 6 ballot also 
would give parents a 2500 tax credit for sending their children 
to private or church schools or teaching them at home 
oregon voters face 10 other measures including two 
antiabortion measures a strict recycling measure a proposed 
shutdown of the states only nuclear plant a seat belt law and a 
measure requiring welfare recipients to work 
the school choice proposal is widely viewed as a watershed for 
american education vice president dan quayle stumped for it last 
month sounding the bush administrations theme that school choice 
is the path to better schools 
it is time to shake up the educational system quayle said 
in salem we have competition in just about every other section 
of our society except for education in the kindergarten through 
12th grade 
supporters of school choice say competition for students will 
force schools to do a better job or close 
foes attack the measures constitutionality arguing it would 
amount to providing public funds to aid religion 
teacher unions and others in the nations public school 
establishment fear that their necks may be on the block if the 
measure passes and other states follow 
a late september poll indicated the measure was trailing 
although polls show strong support for another education 
initiative that measure defeated five times previously would 
phase in a permanent limit on property tax rates by 1995 
among the other oregon ballot contests 
two antiabortion proposals one that would ban abortions 
except to save the womans life or in cases of rape or incest and 
a less drastic measure requiring a doctor to notify a parent when a 
minor seeks an abortion 
opponents of both measures have raised more than 550000 
including 89000 from planned parenthood supporters reported 
spending about 80000 as of sept 27 
strict recycling standards on packaging sold by retailers 
the american paper institute dow chemical co exxon corp 
amoco chemical co and chevron corp among other companies and 
business groups have raised more than 14 million to defeat it 
two committees backing the measure reported raising 293000 
mostly in small donations 
a measure to shut down the trojan nuclear plant about 40 miles 
from portland until certain conditions are met including creation 
of a federal disposal site for radioactive waste 
portland general electric co the owner has spent 12 million 
battling the measure backers reported raising 45000 a similar 
initiative was defeated in 1986 by 64 percent strong support for 
this years version in earlier polls has eroded in a recent survey 
an initiative setting up a pilot program of governmentfinanced 
jobs with businesses in lieu of welfare unemployment or food 
stamps 
most workers would be paid 90 percent of the minimum wage 
savings from regular government assistance programs would pay the 
salaries 
the initiative was put on the ballot mainly by the efforts of 
jeldwen a klamath falls wood products company jeldwen founder 
dick wendt calls the project the full employment program 
opponents say it actually will penalize laidoff employees who 
would earn less than unemployment benefits 
a proposal requiring seat belt use oregon now requires seat 
belt use only for people under 16 voters in 1988 defeated a 
similar measure extending the law to all ages

us air force war planes participating in 
operation desert shield are flying again after they were ordered 
grounded for 24 hours following a rash of crashes 
pentagon and air force officials said regular training flight 
schedules resumed thursday at noon local time 5 am edt the 
flights account for a majority of us air missions in the persian 
gulf region 
the air force has not changed anything in flight operations 
as a result of the suspension of flights capt ac roper a 
spokesman for us central command said in saudi arabia 
he said air force officials wanted to examine potential 
hazards and to be sure they were doing everything possible to 
prevent accidents 
they have not identified any common cause or common 
contributing factors to the recent accidents he added 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said the number of us 
aircraft accidents in the gulf including three separate crashes 
this week were not out of the ordinary however suspension of 
training flights indicated otherwise 
williams said the air force gave its pilots in the gulf safety 
awareness briefings during the flight ban in order to review 
what they need to do to fly more safely 
aircraft on operational missions were not grounded said col 
miguel monteverde another pentagon spokesman those included 
reconnaissance aircraft refueling tanker planes and f15 jets 
patrolling areas near the kuwait or iraqi borders he said pilots 
of those planes received special safety briefings but their flight 
schedules were not changed 
so there was no degradation of our ability to defend 
ourselves monteverde said 
desert shield the largest us military buildup since the 
vietnam war involves an estimated 700 air force combat and support 
aircraft 
williams said information about the number of flight hours in 
desert shield is classified and will not be disclosed as a result 
he said he could not compare the accident rate with that of 
previous deployments 
the toll for accidental deaths since operation desert shield 
began rose to 31 on wednesday when an air force f111 
fighterbomber crashed on a training mission in saudi arabia 
killing both crew members 
on monday two pilots were killed in the crash of an air force 
f4 phantom reconnaissance jet in saudi arabia and just hours 
earlier two marine corps uh1 huey helicopters each carrying four 
crew members crashed over the arabian sea killing all eight men 
williams said the air force was the only service that has taken 
special measures to review safety in the gulf since this weeks 
accidents 
theyre concerned about the accidents theyre concerned about 
the number of accidents that happened so quickly over a short 
period of time he told reporters 
he said however that the militarys safety record in desert 
shield remained good 
given the amount of flying that has to be done given the 
extraordinary circumstances and given the higher than ordinary 
operating tempo in the area i think our service people are doing 
very well but any accident is cause for concern he said 
five us aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the 
gulf area since the start of desert shield two months ago an 
f111 an f4 phantom reconnaissance jet an f15e and two marine 
corps uh1 huey helicopters also a c5 transport plane crashed in 
west germany while ferrying equipment to saudi arabia 
also 20 other aircraft have been involved in nonfatal 
accidents in the gulf area williams said fifteen of those were 
helicopters

the stasi secret police is officially 
defunct but its shadow of fear still darkens the lives of germans 
in their newly unified land 
a rash of arrests of former east german spies has embarrassed 
people who ran west germanys intelligence network and raised 
questions about their effectiveness but the troubles dont stop 
there 
criminal justice officials fret over the legal complications of 
prosecuting former stasi workers who will undoubtedly say they were 
only following orders just as nazi criminals did after world war 
ii 
chancellor helmut kohl vows stasi criminals will be prosecuted 
but he warns against letting the stasi legacy poison our nations 
atmosphere 
a suspect must be taken to court if facts warrant it kohl 
said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper 
he added however we must in no way open up a witch hunt but 
protect our capacity for reconciliation 
lawmakers in former west germany fear that parliament called 
the bundestag will be tainted by newcomers from east germany who 
may have aided stasi officers at home 
it is important to clarify that no stasi accomplices are among 
the former volkskammer east german parliament members now in the 
bundestag nor that they violated basic human rights said 
burkhard hirsch a lawmaker with the free democratic party 
during its existence east germanys ministry for state security 
was split into two sections one for foreign espionage and one that 
ran a vast feared network of repression blackmail coercion and 
surveillance at home 
it is believed that a number of east germans with political 
ambitions had links to the domestic section 
germans are also troubled by stasis past links with 
international terrorism the stasis former leaders are believed to 
have helped some of the worlds most notorious terrorists 
including abu nidal and carlos the jackal 
news reports say international terrorists may still be lurking 
on german soil 
revelations about the stasis malignant grip appear in german 
news media nearly every day feeding a public preoccupation with 
the issue 
people were shocked by news reports that stasi agents may have 
killed a number of east german dissidents who fled to the west the 
deaths were initially ruled accidents but some of the cases are 
being reopened 
in the old east germany people are incensed after hearing news 
reports that some of the same stasi officers who spied on them now 
have jobs in law enforcement 
there are signs that old stasi networks have survived and are 
active in united germany dankward brinksmeier former chairman 
of an east german parliamentary committee that investigated the 
secret police told the news magazine der spiegel 
when the occasional individual has admitted to former ties to 
stasi he has been turned into a pariah 
one east german politician werner meyerbodemann says he 
received death threats after confessing last month that he was 
coerced into working as an informer for the stasi his political 
future is suddenly in doubt 
a number of lawmakers from former west germany want to create a 
special committee and empower it to look at stasi files that would 
shed light on the pasts of bundestag newcomers 
but many former east germans say not even the federal government 
should have the right to look at the stasi files because they 
contain secrets obtained by spying on east germans 
the files also worry many former west germans 
the stasis 90000 official employees and a force of perhaps 
more than 180000 informers did not limit their snooping to east 
germans 
visiting west german leaders lawmakers businessmen and 
tourists were the targets of stasi workers 
germans are uncertain which former stasi leaders they should 
prosecute 
the longtime head of the ministry for state security erich 
mielke is under arrest on suspicion of helping members of the 
outlawed red army faction terrorist gang among other charges 
spies who gave away western secrets to the east also face 
charges 
the government plans an amnesty for east german spies who 
committed lesser offenses but theres disagreement over who 
exactly should be covered 
theres also uncertainty over who will be jailed from among the 
domestic secret police who were responsible for everything from 
eavesdropping to beating up dissidents 
justice ministry spokesman juergen schmid said former security 
officers who killed or injured other east germans will be 
prosecuted that includes border guards who killed about 180 east 
germans who tried to flee to the west 
but he said courts could face some daunting difficulties if 
suspects contend they were innocent because they were only 
following orders the problem he said is that you have to 
decide to what extent someone can be blamed for carrying out the 
will of a politically repressive regime

marchers at haram essharif carried a symbolic 
coffin draped with an outlawed palestinian flag jews who call the 
site temple mount swayed in prayer at the western wall nearby 
again the site revered by three religions is at the vortex of a 
political firestorm 
tens of thousands of jews heeded the israeli government call 
thursday to come to the western wall also known as the wailing 
wall to dance at the end of the sukkot holiday and to support 
israels control of the holy site 
the area held holy by jews christians and moslems played host 
thursday to political demonstrations after mondays riot in which 
19 palestinians died from police gunfire 
at the church of the holy sepulchre built where christ is 
believed to have been buried palestinians mounted a sitdown 
strike 
women in traditional palestinian black dresses decorated with 
embroidery sat in the courtyard of the church while other 
palestinians sat inside the white stone building 
earlier this year the church was a focal point of palestinian 
demonstrations over efforts by jewish settlers to occupy a nearby 
hostel in the christian quarter 
on monday the violence took place when arabs at haram essharif 
began throwing stones down on jews praying directly below at the 
western wall 
israeli police moved in tear gas rubber bullets and live 
ammunition by the time it was over about 140 arabs and 30 jews 
were injured in addition to the 19 palestinians killed 
on thursday arab christian clergymen walked from the 11th 
century church to haram essharif which is arabic for noble 
enclosure the clerics who included greek catholic patriarch 
lutfi laham and anglican bishop samir kafity went for small cups 
of unsweetened arabic coffee they drank with moslems in a 
traditional gesture of mourning 
we came here to share with our brother moslems their great 
grief and we pray to god to grant this land peace and to preserve 
this islamic shrine said bishop basilus of the coptic church 
the site generally draws its largest crowds for moslem friday 
prayers and mosque preachers do not miss the opportunity to 
comment to the large audience on current events whether the 
persian gulf crisis or the israeli occupation 
the reverence for the site by both jews and moslems was at the 
heart of the rioting that enveloped the area monday 
as jews held their daily prayers at the western wall for the 
eightday harvest festival of sukkot a rumor spread on the temple 
mount above that a group of jewish zealots planned to march there 
the group called the temple mount faithful wants to build the 
socalled third temple on the site of the jews two ancient 
temples the last destroyed by the romans in 70 ad 
however the site is now occupied by two 7th and 8th century 
mosques al aqsa and the dome of the rock moslems believe it to 
be the spot where the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven 
the site is the holiest in islam outside saudi arabia the 
western wall the remnant of the last ancient jewish temple is the 
most revered site to jews 
both are in jerusalems old city which israel captured from 
jordan along with the west bank in the 1967 middle east war israel 
later annexed the area 
as the christian clergymen visited the mount on thursday 
hundreds of moslems marched for hours around the dome of the rock 
carrying a coffin covered by a black white green and red 
palestinian flag 
the chanted allahu akbar god is great and we will 
redeem the martyrs 
at the wailing wall jews were preparing for the festival of

officials of the company that makes little 
people toys say theyre puzzled that new yorks attorney general 
has continued to attack the miniature figures as choking hazards to 
children 
carol blackley a spokeswoman for fisherprice said thursday 
she had thought the matter was closed after the company agreed in 
june to toughen its warning labels and pay 25000 to new york 
state 
but attorney general robert abrams sent a letter thursday to 
consumer product safety commission chairwoman jacqueline 
jonessmith asking her to alert parents to the potential choking 
hazards of little people he also asked that cpsc increase the size 
of its smallparts standard for toys 
while the commission continues to do no more than review the 
toy children continue to die abrams wrote citing the recent 
deaths of two 6monthold boys who choked on little people 
but blackley said the little people package clearly states the 
toys are intended for children ages 2 to 6 and pose a choking 
hazard to any child who puts the things in his mouth 
fisherprice a division of quaker oats co in chicago has been 
making little people for more than 30 years in that time five 
children are known to have choked to death on the figures blackley 
said all but one of those children were below the recommended age 
range for the toy she said

the two lawmakers blocking senate action on a 
bill to reregulate cable television have agreed to a compromise 
under which cable companies could continue programming deals that 
freeze out satellite dish owners 
sens al gore dtenn and timothy wirth dcolo reached the 
accord after the bills manager sen daniel inouye dhawaii last 
month declared it dead and buried for the year because of 
threats of a filibuster by wirth and a veto by president bush 
bush has not backed off his veto threat but gore and wirth 
agreed thursday on exclusivity contracts that would require the 
federal communications commission to determine their use illegal if 
abused 
gore who favored better access by satellite dish owners and 
other cable competitors like socalled wireless cable operators 
to the programming produced by the cable industry said he hoped 
the bill could be brought to the senate floor early next week 
to those who would continue to block its consideration on 
behalf of the cable industry or the white house i would only say 
that such a move would backfire he said threatening to 
introduce a tougher bill on the industry next year 
both the senate bill and a similar measure passed by the house 
last month would require cable operators to provide a basic 
tier of cable service local and public tv stations plus 
governmentaccess channels at rates regulated by the fcc 
the legislation is a response to a growing wave of consumer 
complaints about excessive rates and poor service in many areas 
after the industry was deregulated by congress in 1986

the ulysses solar explorer fired its 
thrusters and zoomed farther from earth while the shuttle that 
launched the spacecraft was readied for next weeks piggyback jet 
ride home to florida 
nasa meanwhile formed a team to investigate why the shuttle 
discovery lifted off saturday with incorrect instructions for how 
it should operate some of its computer programs 
ulysses twoday series of thruster firings were to end this 
afternoon the maneuver was designed to turn ulysses so its main 
antenna dish pointed toward earth allowing faster communication 
with controllers 
the 250 million spacecraft which will explore the suns polar 
regions in 199495 is the centerpiece of a 750 million joint 
mission by nasa and the european space agency 
since it was launched from discovery on saturday ulysses has 
been communicating with its controllers through one of its smaller 
antennas 
discovery landed wednesday at edwards air force base calif 
maintenance crews found discovery in excellent condition after its 
17millionmile fourday flight said shuttle processing manager 
tip talone 
he said only 10 to 15 of discoverys heatshield tiles need to 
be replaced debris that hit the shuttle during its launch and 
landing caused 13 dings larger than one inch and about 50 
smaller ones 
thats a very low number talone said every time we come 
back we seem to learn more about how to fly and land the thing 
without taking a lot of hits 
talone said discovery should be ready for a oneday flight back 
to its cape canaveral fla launch site on monday riding 
piggyback on a modified jumbo jet 
shuttle project engineer chris fairey said thursday that the 
incorrect instructions were loaded into one of discoverys 
computers oct 4 
the investigators will recommend steps to prevent such an error 
from happening again he added 
the incorrect instructions were noticed and fixed by discoverys 
five astronauts about an hour after the shuttle was launched 
they never posed a danger to the shuttle or its crew even if 
the error hadnt been detected said milt heflin lead flight 
director at johnson space center in houston 
heflin said nasa considered the problem serious because it went 
undetected before discovery was launched fairey called it really 
minor but said it did point out a minor deficiency in the way 
we code our software 
ulysses was 368 million miles from earth on thursday zipping 
toward a 1992 flight past jupiter at 25372 mph said franklin 
odonnell a spokesman at nasas jet propulsion laboratory ulysses 
will use jupiters gravity to sling it into orbit around the sun

thursday you cant even call it a hunt 
agents were to meet today to decide whether to take action 
against those involved in the alleged hunts

a judge has refused the roman catholic churchs 
request to shut down a play it considers blasphemous in a building 
it owns 
im not a censor and im not going to engage in any act of 
censorship state supreme court justice irma vidal santaella said 
thursday in refusing to stop performances of the rapp theater 
companys the cardinal detoxes 
the play by thomas disch is a 35minute monologue delivered by 
a cardinal who has fatally struck a pregnant woman while driving 
drunk 
santaella ruled last week that the church had a right to start 
eviction proceedings against rapp which was staging the play in a 
former parochial school 
the judge found that rapp had violated the part of its lease 
that allow the landlord the church to determine what 
activities by the theater group are detrimental to the 
reputation of the landlord 
but the judge said rapp had a first amendment right to perform 
the play in the meantime 
the activist lawyer william kunstler representing rapp said 
the church was bringing the case in the wrong country and in the 
wrong century 
in the play the cardinal calls the church a sham and tries to 
blackmail other catholic officials into getting him off the hook by 
bribing a judge after he threatens to expose the churchs problems 
if they dont help him a monk gives him poisoned wine 
the churchs lawyer frank mclaughlin said the church has 
been injured your honor injured by the blasphemy in the play 
injured by the mockery

the usled military buildup in 
saudi arabia has local businessmen scrambling for contracts to sell 
everything from tomatoes to tents 
the economy here is really really percolating said gene 
heck commercial attache at the us embassy in riyadh 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait has thrown most regional 
economies into disarray causing big cash flights and paralyzing 
stock markets 
however in saudi arabia the military deployment countering 
iraq has opened a rich field for entrepreneurs 
most are in the kingdom already others from the united states 
and around the world hope to use the military presence to enter the 
saudi market for the first time 
hecks job is to help businesses channel their ideas to 
decisionmakers in the military 
one of the messages we need to get across is that this is just 
as stable an economy as it was before aug 2 he said the 
opportunities are even greater 
heck peers over thick glasses at a stack of yellow message slips 
and rattles off the names of companies who want to do business in 
saudi arabia he estimates 1520 firms contact him every day 
theres a company in indianopolis that wants to sell mobile 
field kitchens that prepare 15000 meals in 24 hours he said 
theyve got retired generals on their board that usually 
helps 
other business propositions are not quite so well thought out 
ive got a guy in jiddah who has 7000 videotapes that the saudi 
police wont let him sell so he wants to sell them to the 
troops said heck 
press reports say the foreign military presence in the kingdom 
is likely to generate about 5 billion in sales from the private 
sector directly to the military everyone seems to want a piece of 
the action 
omanis want to sell spices to the troops thais are hawking 
fruit juice and the dutch and danish have dairy products theyre 
all calling heck who carries a foothigh stack of catalogues to 
military procurement people two or three times a week 
col john downey chief of the military contracting office in 
riyadh said he answers 10 to 15 calls a day he gives callers the 
numbers of procurement officers in army navy air force and 
marines all do separate purchasing 
there are awful lot of people running around looking for 
opportunities said keith poulin president of dalil 
international development corp a business development firm 
i deal with a large agriculture development company and the 
guy there starts talking to me about gas masks i said whats this 
got to do with lettuce and tomatoes people jump into new 
businesses whenever they see an opportunity 
poulin said gas masks top the list of items companies are trying 
to sell to the military 
iraqi president saddam hussein has vowed to use chemical weapons 
if his country is attacked 
poulin also noted that his company received many calls from 
saudis willing to sponsor companies who want to do business with 
the military under saudi commercial law all foreign companies 
must have a local sponsor 
weve had a lot of calls from saudi firms wanting to identify 
canadian sources of goods that are obviously going to be sold to 
the military said ron bollman canadian commercial counselor 
most of our exporters are looking at protective clothing 
electronics and telecommunications 
some businessmen however feel that there is a dearth of 
information on the military procurement process leo kelleher 
manager of projects for economic bureau a 100 percent saudiowned 
consulting firm said his company has submitted three proposals to 
the military three weeks ago and weve been going in circles 
every since 
downey conceded that unsolicited proposals to the military may 
await four to six weeks for a response its a lengthy process to 
get it through the loop he said we may not have all the 
expertise to evaluate it here

americans failed to achieve at least one 
important goal in a 10year drive by the government to reduce high 
blood pressure losing weight 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
at least seven of the nine health objectives related to high blood 
pressure were met including a nationwide reduction in the 
prevalence of hypertension 
the goal set a decade ago was for at least 60 percent of the 
population with high blood pressure to have it under control a 
recent survey suggests a level of 65 percent the cdc said 
but one important goal was missed reducing the overweight 
population to fewer than 10 percent of american men and fewer than 
17 percent of women a 1988 federal survey found 27 percent of men 
and 26 percent of women were overweight defined as more than 20 
percent above their desired weight 
being overweight increases the risk of high blood pressure 
which is a cause of heart disease and stroke 
improvements in blood pressure control have contributed to 
a 50 percent decrease in stroke and a 35 percent decrease in 
coronary heart disease since 1972 the cdc said 
but there is work to be done the agency said despite this 
progress 30 million persons in the united states still have 
inadequately controlled blood pressure 
in 1979 when the health and human services department prepared 
its 1990 health goals high blood pressure was defined as a reading 
of 16095 or higher 
the cdc objective was to have at least 60 percent of those with 
hypertension in control of their blod pressure and that goal has 
most likely been met the agency said high blood pressure is 
usually controlled with medication 
comprehensive studies are not yet complete the cdc said 
in 1984 us health officials revised their standard for high 
blood pressure to a reading of 14090 and progress toward that 
measurement is less certain 
other 1990 bloodpressure goals that have been met according to 
the cdc include 
more than half of us adults should know the principal risk 
factors for heart disease and stroke high blood pressure smoking 
high cholesterol and diabetes 
more than 90 percent of adults should be able to say whether 
they have high blood pressure 
at least half of processed food in grocery stores should be 
labeled with sodium and caloric content 
progress isnt known toward one of the goals reducing the 
average daily salt intake to less than 6 grams no studies have 
been done to provide such data the cdc said

belgium and germany today announced they 
have pulled all their diplomats from kuwait as iraqi president 
saddam hussein starves out the last envoys from encircled missions 
in the conquered emirate 
the campaign is a key part of his effort to turn kuwait into the 
19th province of iraq 
in bonn germany a foreign ministry spokesman said the last 
diplomats in the german embassy drove from kuwait to baghdad on 
thursday zdf television a german station said the group included 
the ambassador and his wife along with three embassy staff 
members 
the foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the embassy was vacated because of exhausted food 
supplies 
in their announcement in brussels belgian officials said their 
remaining two diplomats had also left for baghdad on thursday 
the dutch italian and polish embassies among the compounds 
besieged exactly seven weeks ago today have also withdrawn the 
last of their diplomats from kuwait city in the past week 
that leaves the americans british canadians and french as the 
only holdouts among western missions few other nations appear to 
be staffing their embassies with diplomats 
the remaining diplomats were surviving mainly on canned food and 
occasional loaves of bread carried in by local staff but they were 
surrounded by iraqi troops enforcing a blockade of supplies in 
most cases water and electricity have been cut off 
the holdouts are not expected to last long 
the ambassadorial standoff reflects the international 
confrontation of the persian gulf in microcosm saddams forces 
have been locked in a war of nerves and attrition with 
representatives of many of the countries that have sent troops and 
equipment to counter the iraqi president 
after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and annexed the neighboring 
oil emirate it ordered all embassies in the emirate to shut down 
by aug 24 and began surrounding holdouts that day 
iraqi authorities said foreign countries would be represented in 
baghdad iraqs capital the embassy staffs in kuwait would lose 
their diplomatic status and privileges 
initially dozens of embassies balked refusing to recognize 
iraqs annexation of kuwait and desperate to help their stranded 
nationals however as the iraqi siege set in the remaining 
diplomats have trickled out 
they have said the departures are temporary and some of them 
have annnounced that the embassies remain technically open but 
its only a technicality 
at the us embassy 10 diplomats and an unknown number of 
american citizens who took refuge are eking out a living from 
canned goods and perishables stored there before iraqi tanks rolled 
into kuwait city 
life at the embassy is kind of hot stuffy and boring a 
us official in washington said wednesday us diplomats are 
still there because we dont recognize the annexation we will not 
recognize an order based on annexation and we want to help 
american citizens 
about 600 americans are stuck in kuwait many in hiding and 
several reported to be desperately ill 
living conditions at the us embassy are wretched power and 
water have been severed for more than a month forcing the 
americans to forgo baths and boil water from the swimming pool to 
drink 
ambassador w nathaniel howell deputy ambassador barbara bodine 
and the other americans are using outside latrines 
they sometimes sleep outdoors at night to keep cool despite 
swarms of mosquitoes 
telephone conversations are deliberately brief under the 
assumption that the iraqis have tapped phone lines seeking 
information on the whereabouts of americans or kuwaitis who are 
harboring them 
at the british embassy the two remaining diplomats are eating 
cans of tuna and wieners as well as vegetables from an embassy 
garden they are also brewing their own beer according to two 
other embassy staffers sent to baghdad to stretch out the dwindling 
supplies in kuwait for the two remaining 
conditions are becoming harsh french foreign ministry 
spokesman daniel bernard said monday but charge daffaires 
jeanpierre galtier and his remaining staff will stay firmly at 
their post he said 
life has been no picnic even for those who leave iraqi 
authorities have allowed them to travel to baghdad but forced them 
to remain

following this nations latest revolt 
last week in the south a series of political battles has broken 
out which dramatize the divisions undermining president corazon 
aquinos government 
the disputes serve as an example of the political infighting 
which has hampered the administrations effectiveness in dealing 
with the nations problems and reduced public faith in government 
the seventh military rebellion against mrs aquino ended last 
saturday when renegade col alexander noble surrendered after 
seizing two military garrisons and proclaiming independence for the 
second largest island mindanao 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa said after the 
mutiny that the key to ending the threat of coups was better 
government united to move as one 
recent events show little sign of such unity 
noble surrendered to sen aquilino pimentel one of the senior 
military and civilian officials who rushed to cagayan de oro on 
mindanao to confront the rebellion 
no sooner had he returned to manila than pimentel accused the 
senior cabinet member on the scene local government secretary luis 
santos of drinking heavily in cagayan de oro instead of helping 
solve the crisis 
several newspapers also reported hat santos and his entourage 
nearly provoked a shootout among government forces by staging a 
publicity stunt hauling down an independent mindanao flag from 
the camp flagpole and hoisting the philippine flag 
col plaridel obrique deputy commander of the 4th infantry 
division protested that santos and others from manila were trying 
to get the glory for recapturing the camp when in fact noble 
gave up without a fight 
the flagraising idea reportedly planned for the benefit of 
photographers was scrapped after obriques troops threatened 
violence the papers said 
santos spokesman antonio ortiz said wednesday that santos has 
no time to answer allegations against him 
mrs aquino asked for an explanation of the charges but none was 
offered 
her own spokesman tomas gomez meanwhile provoked a war of 
words with vice president salvador laurel by claiming that laurel 
supporters signed a 900000 contract with a us public relations 
firm to smear the aquino administration in the united states 
where did the money come from gomez asked did it come 
from imelda marcos did it come from ultrarightists who belong to 
the republican government in washington or did it come from 
excia sources 
laurel broke with mrs aquino in 1987 and resigned as foreign 
secretary although he kept his elected post as vice president mrs 
aquino has frequently accused laurel of failing to stand up for 
democracy in times of crisis 
laurels office denied the smear campaign allegation and 
countered by releasing the names of 16 american public relations 
firms hired by the aquino administration 
now that gomez has opened this can of worms he should detail 
to the public how many precious dollars have been spent while the 
country grovels under heavy external debt and piecemeal 
existence laurel spokesman ike gutierrez said 
gomez said the 16 firms were hired to lobby for greater 
purchases of philippine coconut and sugar products

sharon carpenter says a 425000 
settlement from an animal shelter has not erased the memory of 
seeing her 4yearold son fatally mauled by a wolfdog hybrid 
it put an end to the financial part of it but its something 
we have to live with for the rest of our lives so it never really 
ends mrs carpenter said wednesday 
the animal killed nathan carpenter on sept 23 1988 two hours 
after a neighbor adopted it from the panhandle animal welfare 
society based here the wolfhusky mixed breed was advertised as 
pet of the week 
the adoption violated the shelters policy against placing wolf 
breeds said donna olson the agencys executive director but a 
paws lawyer said the settlement reached last friday does not mean 
the shelter admits liability 
mrs carpenter said she did not recognize the dog when she saw 
it running loose near her home in nearby wynnhaven when it entered 
her yard and lay down 50 feet from her son she went inside to call 
the phone number on the dogs tag 
i looked out the window and saw him ataack nathan mrs 
carpenter said i ran outside and pushed the dog off my son 
an offduty okaloosa county sheriffs deputy shot the animal

which sell for 249 the imitations cost less usually 99 cents 
main street toy maintains its bracelets made with stainless 
steel are safe and says imitations are made from cheaper steel 
that will rust and break 
elementary school officials in pelham ny have banned the 
wraps because of concerns about children cutting themselves

attempts to reach a plea bargain for 
marlon brandos son broke down and a judge set christian brandos 
murder trial for nov 5 
nobodys talking settlement now deputy district attorney 
william clark said after a brief hearing thursday 
clark said that last week christian brandos lawyer and 
prosecutors discussed a possible plea bargain after it became 
apparent brandos sister cheyenne was unlikely to testify in the 
case 
clark said defense lawyer robert shapiros proposals were not 
accepted 
but shapiro told reporters the defense remains open to 
negotiations 
the 32yearold brando is charged in the may 16 murder of his 
halfsisters tahitian lover dag drollet who was fatally shot at 
marlon brandos hilltop mansion 
in early statements to police the young brando said he didnt 
mean to kill the 26yearold drollet and suggested they were 
struggling over a gun that accidentally fired 
prosecutors maintain the shooting was intentional and that 
brando was spurred into a rage by his sister who said drollet had 
beaten her 
superior court judge robert thomas said jury selection in the 
trial would begin nov 5 he noted he has received large amounts of 
mail indicating strong public sentiment in the case 
if the mail is any indication theres some very strong 
feelings about the matter both ways he said adding he expects a 
difficult search for jurors unaffected by publicity 
meanwhile clark said he was negotiating with french authorities 
to allow cheyenne brandos return to the united states to testify 
she is being held in tahiti on a charge of accessory to the 
murder 
miss brando went to tahiti in june to have the baby drollet 
fathered she was later hospitalized with emotional problems 
according to her father marlon brando 
clark said marlon brando will testify in his sons trial but he 
was uncertain whether he would be a prosecution or defense witness

a court today convicted a russian nationalist of 
promoting racism and insulting jews and sentenced him to two years 
in a labor camp ending a threemonth trial highlighting fears of 
growing antisemitism 
im suffering for russia konstantin smirnovostashvili 
shouted in one of many outbursts during the halfhour session in 
the heavily guarded moscow city court 
andrei makarov a prosecutor said the case shows fascism is 
being born in the soviet union likening the situation to that in 
germany in the 1930s 
supporters of smirnovostashvili heckled judge andrei muratov 
repeatedly as he read a summary of the case then the verdict they 
sometimes drowned him out 
it was the first such case brought to trial under a law passed 
as the soviet union grapples with widespread unrest among many of 
its more than 100 ethnic groups smirnovostashvili 54 was 
charged with inciting hatred between ethnic groups 
he shouted angrily and raised his fist as the judge read a list 
of witnesses who had testified against him wheres the 
expertise 
everything is taken out of context its all a lie he 
shouted from behind a brown wooden partition guarded by five 
interior ministry soldiers with guns and rubber clubs 
smirnovostashvili was accused of organizing protesters who 
broke up a meeting at the central house of literature in moscow on 
jan 18 and insulted jewish writers 
the popular weekly publication ogonyok quoted an unidentified 
protester as shouting through a megaphone 
your time is over neither the police nor the kgb nor the 
party will help yuu now we will be masters of the country and you 
newcomers clear out and go to israel how long can we tolerate 
your russophobia 
muratov determined friday that smirnovostashvili had made those 
remarks the judge said the defendants diatribe contained 
insulting demeaning threatening phrases virtually intended to 
humiliate the national honor and dignity of citizens of the jewish 
origin 
the court dismissed charges that smirnovostashvili had used 
violence at the writers meeting but said he had threatened attacks 
on jews 
the case received wide publicity in the soviet media at a time 
when thousands of jews are emigrating many because they fear a 
wave of antisemitic attacks by extreme russian nationalist groups 
the trial followed a fivemonth investigation during which more 
than 400 people were questioned 
soviet jews welcomed the landmark case which participants said 
was the first time an accused antisemite has been put on trial in 
russia 
it has shown that there is new fascism in russia but it has 
also shown that soviet law has been made to work and come to the 
rescue said alla geller a member of the writers group april and 
a trial spectator 
mikhail clenov copresident of vaad the confederation of 
jewish organizations and communities in the ussr said the 
government should now investigate the entire pamyat group a 
russian nationalist organization to which the defendant belongs 
some of the 100 spectators in court today wore buttons of 
pamyat they shouted shame shame after the judge read the 
sentence other spectators were jews largely silent during the 
sessions 
early in the session a spectator threw a bouquet of red 
carnations at smirnovostashvili and he held it up and shouted 
zionism wont succeed long live russia 
the defendant could have received a maximum penalty of five 
years in prison or labor camps or a fine of up to 5000 rubles 
about 9000 at the official exchange rate the verdict and 
sentence were decided by the judge and two civilian assistants 
without a jury 
he was sentenced to two years in a labor camp 
smirnovostashvili has denied being antisemitic but maintains 
the soviet unions 14 million jews hold a disproportionate number 
of high places in government and society

thank goodness for star turns 
philip bosco and carole shelley are the main reasons to see 
the miser molieres comic portrait of greed incarnate now 
being revived on broadway by circle in the square 
their performances dominate an otherwise ordinary production 
marred by stephen porters listless direction and some oddly cast 
secondary roles 
bosco is almost unrecognizable as harpagon the man who worships 
his money more than life with a white fright wig and a scruffy 
unshaven face he looks like ebenezer scrooge on a bad day the 
actor is a master of comic timing as he storms around the stage 
blowing out candles why waste the wax or ordering his servants 
to water the wine 
bosco plays harpagon a little nastier than usual but its still 
funny his misers maniacal devotion to gold makes one a bit 
uneasy theres a hint of venom underneath the obsessiveness but 
it works 
besides not many actors can get a huge laugh just by coughing 
but what a cough it starts as a low rumble in his throat and 
bursts forth like an engine of a 747 cleared for takeoff 
shelley in the much smaller role of the matchmaker frosine 
matches bosco quip for quip and laugh for laugh the production in 
fact doesnt really come to life until the actress shows up late 
in the first act 
tarted up in rouge and masses of red curls frosine coos her way 
into harpagons confidence shelley and bosco beautifully play off 
each other mining the humor that moliere finds in the hypocrisy of 
two people using each other for their own ends 
the plot turns on the usual complications of mismatched couples 
harpagon a widower wants to marry the young lady adored by his 
son his daughter desires a supposedly penniless manservant in the 
household while harpagon plans to marry her off to a wealthy older 
man 
the ending is so blatantly contrived that it earns laughs for 
its artificiality the translation by john wood certainly is 
serviceable conversational without being too modern 
but when the two stars are off stage the production sags 
harpagons vexed children elise and cleante are played by mia 
dillon and thomas gibson their performances are marked by some 
mighty strange vocal acrobatics she simpers he screeches what 
may have been thought of as funny by director porter becomes 
annoying 
elises admirer valere is done in by christian baskous wooden 
portrayal in which he seems to be reading his lines from a cue 
card only john christopher jones as the hapless servant maitre 
jacques can match the comic spirit of bosco and shelley 
part of the directors problem may be the awkward elongated 
playing area with the audience on all four sides actors have to 
race around the stage and they do it without much style 
james morgans scenery is sparse but gail brassards costumes 
are sumptuous especially for the foppish son cleante but the 
miser only really comes alive when bosco and shelley are center 
stage without them the merriment is as minimal as the title 
characters gift of giving 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times the production has been 
guided with uncharacteristic sloppiness by the moliere and shaw 
expert and frequent bosco collaborator stephen porter mr 
bosco deflates much of the evening by wailing and sobbing in grave 
selfpity over harpagons travails as if he were somehow imbued 
with a tragic awareness more appropriate to shylock than to a role 
with roots in commedia dellarte 
clive barnes new york post bosco has never been 
better sometimes as an actor he suffers from a certain orotund 
selfsatisfaction leading to an easily ingratiating superficiality 
best suited to shaw but here he attempts something harsher and 
funnier 
howard kissel daily news what better way to celebrate the 
sentencing of michael milken than a revival of molieres the 
miser by the second act when the paly itself gathers 
momentum the production becomes as unpretentiously entertaining as 
its author intended it to be

prime minister toshiki kaifu was greeted by hoots 
and catcalls today when he opened a special session of parliament 
by urging support for his plan to deploy japans self defense 
forces overseas for the first time 
the prime minister told the deeply divided parliament or diet 
that japans international role is bigger than most of us are 
aware of such responsibility he said justified dispatching his 
proposed united nations peace cooperation corps to the persian 
gulf 
we must not forget the fact that japan is one of the prime 
beneficiaries of a world without war kaifu said contributing 
to maintain world peace is both a natural and inevitable cost 
arising from japans position within the international community 
kaifu faces powerful opposition over the bill to create the 
force 
consisting partly of military personnel the 1000 to 
2000member team would perform noncombat services such as 
transportation and medical aid to assist the multinational effort 
in the gulf 
the prime minister however does not appear to have enough 
legislative support to push the bill through the three largest 
opposition parties have said they will not allow its passage 
such a bill is nothing but a serious challenge to our peace 
constitution said takako doi chairwoman of the socialist party 
the largest opposition group 
japans constitution written after world war ii under us 
occupation prohibits the use of force to settle international 
disputes 
but the government feeling pressure from washington to increase 
its role in the gulf has said sending military personnel overseas 
can be constitutional as long as force is not used and actions are 
based on un resolutions 
kaifu committed himself to establishing the special corps during 
a meeting with president bush in new york last month 
government officials said they will present the bill early next 
week 
the liberal democratic party must win support from one of the 
three top opposition groups to push the bill through the upper 
house where it lost a longheld majority in july 1989 elections 
japan has pledged 2 billion toward usled multinational 
efforts in the gulf to force iraq out of kuwait it also promised 
2 billion in economic aid to gulf nations hard hit by the 
international trade embargo against iraq

gunmen today killed the parliament speaker 
and three security men outside a downtown hotel the attack came 
after the government warned that terrorists might strike to punish 
egypt for its opposition to iraq 
there was no claim of responsibility for the attack by gunmen on 
motorcycles but the interior minister said he suspected egyptian 
moslem fundamentalists or foreigners 
rifaat elmahgoub 64 speaker of the peoples assembly and the 
second ranking politician after the president was shot as he sat 
in the rear of his chauffeurdriven mercedes interior minister 
abdelhalim moussa said the gunmen then fled as other security men 
returned their fire moussa said 
the shooting occurred as elmahgoubs car drove by the hotel 
semiramis intercontinental a block from the us embassy the 
speaker was heading for a hotel about 1 miles away where he was to 
meet a syrian delegation 
moussa told reporters that four young assailants attacked 
elmahgoubs vehicle and an accompanying security car from two 
suzuki motorbikes 
three escaped on the bikes he said they rode through a nearby 
underpass in front of the hotel speeding against the traffic on 
the oneway street 
the fourth ran into a densely populated area nearby and 
disappeared he wounded two bystanders who tried to stop him 
moussa said 
the minister confirming earlier reports said two security men 
were killed in elmahgoubs car and another in a security car 
traveling behind him 
an hour after the shooting elmahgoubs black mercedes sat 
outside the hotel its rear window and right front window smashed 
one of the two slain bodyguards in the car lay in the front seat 
his head torn apart by gunfire 
a second car a peugeot was stopped about 200 yards away a 
mans body hanging onto the roadway from the rear seat that man 
also was identified as a member of a security detail traveling with 
elmahgoub 
all streets were blocked around the 28story hotel one of the 
newest and most luxurious in cairo 
moussa said the assailants awaited elmahgoubs car and escort 
with their rifles hidden in handbags 
one sovietmade hand grenade and four homemade explosives 
which were timed to explode but didnt were found on the roadside 
near the hotel moussa said policeman defused them later 
moussa said he suspected the attackers were foreigners or local 
moslem fundamentalists he refused to elaborate 
moussa who said he was traveling 300 yards behind elmahgoubs 
car during the attack dismissed questions about whether he was the 
intended target islamic militants tried to kill an interior 
minister with a bomb and shot at two interior ministers in 1987 
one of the exministers was wounded seriously 
president hosni mubaraks predecessor anwar sadat was killed 
oct 6 1981 by moslem extremists who then tried and failed to 
overthrow the government 
todays shooting occurred 90 minutes before moussa was to have 
briefed reporters on the outcome of a national referendum thursday 
results showed 93 percent of the egyptians voting approved 
mubaraks proposal to dissolve the peoples assembly and call new 
elections 
moussa warned before the vote that iraqis and other arabs had 
infiltrated the country to destabilize the government through 
terror attacks including assassinations egypt has led arab 
opposition to iraqs annexation of kuwait 
it was unclear what effect elmahgoubs assassination might have 
on the election process the constitution provides that elections 
must be held within 60 days of certification of the referendum 
results 
mubarak scheduled the referendum because the nations highest 
constitutional court had declared illegal the election laws under 
which the parliament was seated 
under egypts constitution elmahgoub as parliamentary speaker 
was the secondranking official because mubarak has not named a 
vice president a political moderate elmahgoub had been speaker 
since 1984 
elmahgoub mostly took his cue from mubarak and despite his 
ranking in egypts heirarchy had little real authority other than 
over parliament his high profile however made elmahgoub a 
relatively easy target for attackers 
after the shooting elmahgoubs wife was brought to the hotel 
crying hysterically just let me see him she sobbed 
in recent weeks newspaper commentators and cartoonists have 
mocked the peoples assembly and indirectly skewered elmahgoub for 
his position on the referendum although he never said so publicly 
he was known to oppose dissolution of the assembly and new 
elections

likelihood will win said preston beckman nbc vice president for 
audience research

series since the new season began last month averaged a 199 
rating in the 24city overnight ratings when it began its second 
season thursday night

been a perennial ratings winner received a 193 rating 
the first halfhour of a new columbo episode on abc was 
third in the thursday ratings battle averaging an 115 a cbs 
movie dark avenger was left far behind with a 52 
the 24city overnight ratings represent more than 47 percent of 
the nations 931 million tv househoulds according to nielsen 
media research 
the high simpsons ratings were anticipated by nbc beckman 
said both because of heavy press coverage of the shows return and 
heavy promotion of the show this week by fox broadcasting co 
fox must have spent an enormous amount on promotion for this 
show he said given all that its a good number for him 
can matt groenings bugeyed bigtoothed cartoon clan continue 
beating cosbys huxtable family 
its really difficult to say beckman said that will become

in parliament resigned his seat today and called on the united 
nations to arrange a vote for selfdetermination in the troubled 
state of punjab 
simranjit singh mann said in a letter to the speaker that he 
quit to protest the extension of federal rule in punjab and the 
refusal to allow elections of a state legislature 
parliament overwhelmingly approved extending federal rule to 
punjab last week on the recommendation of prime minister vp 
singh who said a fair election free of pressure by militant 
separatists could not be guaranteed 
meanwhile in kashmir northwest of punjab ethnic violence 
erupted today when moslem militants killed three paramilitary 
policemen and wounded three others in the city of sprinagar 
witnesses said 
they said troops retaliated by setting fire to five houses whose 
occupants had fled violent gunbattles earlier in the week 
about 35 people mostly noncombatants have been killed in 
fighting between militants and government troops that began in 
sprinagar on sunday and about 175 houses destroyed by fire 
residents said 
militants and government troops traded gunfire for eight hours 
thursday night in sopore 25 miles northwest of srinagar according 
to witnessses no deaths were reported but the residents accused 
the government men of setting fire to 60 shops in the iqbal market 
at least 1375 people have been killed in the predominantly 
muslim kashmir region since jan 20 when the government launched 
its harshest crackdown ever on the increasingly violent 
secessionist movement 
meanwhile in new delhi mann the sikh legislator told foreign 
reporters two other party members have said they will quit and 
others will follow 
manns akali dal faction last year won seven of punjabs 13 
seats in the 529member lower house of parliament 
but he declined to take the oath of office when the authorities 
refused to let him wear his threefootlong ceremonial sword 
mann was again refused entry into the parliament building today 
to submit his resignation when he refused to remove the curved 
sword strapped across his shoulder he waited 45 minutes for an 
official to come and take the letter news agencies reported 
an average of about a dozen people are killed every day by sikh 
militants in punjab a farming state bordering pakistan sikhs have 
a slight majority in punjab but make up only 2 percent of indias 
total population of 880 million 
mann said that in the 41 months since the dismissal of the state 
legislature punjab had become a colony of india he called for a 
unsupervised referendum in punjab to decide its future 
an international effort is required to get us out of this 
colonial state he said i think this will have to go to the 
united nations

parliament speaker rifaat elmahgoub always 
lacked the charisma of other political leaders but he served 
president hosni mubaraks interests well as the nations 
secondranking politician 
from the time he took over as head of the peoples assembly in 
1984 until he was assassinated today elmahgoub 64 steered 
egypts unicameral legislature as mubaraks government and national 
democratic party wanted 
as parliament speaker he was supposed to be neutral a sort of 
umpire between the governing partys majority in the 485member 
chamber and the opposition which held about 100 seats 
however elmahgoubs preference for the governing party was 
evident sometimes brazen in his conduct of debates 
he used his authority to push through or shelve legislation in 
accordance with government wishes this prompted attacks by 
opposition parties who characterized him as a dictator 
tall lean and bespectacled elmahgoub almost always appeared 
stiff and stern during parliamentary sessions he often made quick 
rulings on the outcome of voting by a show of hands without 
bothering to count 
the peoples assembly elected elmahgoub speaker in 1984 and 
again in 1987 in this post he was the countrys secondhighest 
official in protocol but he had no real power over national 
policy 
mubarak suspended the assembly sept 26 and called a referendum 
held thursday that gave him a mandate to dissolve parliament this 
was necessary because egypts highest court ruled in june that the 
assembly was elected under an unconstitutional law and was 
therefore illegal 
the outgoing chamber was crisisridden from the start a cairo 
court ruled that 78 seats held by national democrats rightfully 
belonged to opposition party members an appeals court agreed 
but the assembly ignored the ruling 
elmahgoub cited a legal provision that on parliamentary 
membership issues the assembly is master of its own decision 
elmahgoub graduated from cairo universitys law school in 1948 
and obtained a doctorate degree in economy from the university of 
paris five years later he assumed several academic posts 
including dean of the college of economy and political sciences he 
became minister for presidential affairs in 1972 and deputy prime 
minister three years later 
the minister is survived by his wife and four children

put away the sweats and put on your 
glasses 
the only physical exertion some high school juniors and seniors 
will have to do next year for credit is to occasionally lift their 
eyelids or at least say they did 
the pittsfield school committee voted this week to let students 
fulfill physical education requirements by reading about exercise 
starting next september students will have three options they 
can take gym classes once or twice a week or enroll in the reading 
program the current requirement is gym twice a week 
under the minimum option students will be able to tell teachers 
they have read assigned pamphlets about health and physical 
exercise no tests papers or classes will be required 
school committee member george desnoyers contended that juniors 
and seniors are old enough to choose whether to exercise he wanted 
to eliminate the physical education requirement altogether but 
its required by state law 
kids should be encouraged to participate in sports like 
intramural sports or joining the y or the girls club but the 
school day is too short the school year is too short and something 
has got to give said school committee member george b crane 
angel g ramirez cast the lone opposition vote he said too many 
young people loaf around watching television instead of exercising

several of the largest employers in the city 
have agreed to prepay 50 million in wage taxes to help the city 
government which is expected to go broke in december 
the prepayers include the university of pennsylvania bell of 
pennsylvania philadelphia electric co and childrens hospital of 
philadelphia according to reports today in the philadelphia 
inquirer and the philadelphia daily news 
the city failed last month to sell 375 million worth of 
temporary loan notes meant to keep it going until spring when 
property tax payments are due lenders apparently were scared off 
by the citys projected 206 million budget deficit 
a spokeswoman for the philadelphia chamber of commerce said the 
tax prepayments would be announced today 
the city spends about 9 million a day so the 50 million 
prepayment would only keep the government going for 5 days beyond 
dec 1 when mayor w wilson goode has said the city will run out 
of cash 
we dont want to overblow this as anything more than a show of 
confidence chamber of commerce vice president nicholas 
debenedictis told the daily news 
debenedictis said the prepayment however was a step in the 
right direction 
our immediate problem is getting cash and we need some 
confidence going some positive action he said

house democrats rallied around a liberal 
budget plan today that lays new taxes on the wealthy divided 
republicans meanwhile seemed ready to ignore president bushs 
conclusion that a deep cut in the capital gains tax is dead 
there was a very strong positive attitude on the part of 
members speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters after a 
democratic caucus theres a sense of unity 
the democratic plan would boost taxes on wealthier americans and 
offer a small capitalgains tax cut for middleincome families it 
is one of many budget proposals sprouting all over capitol hill 
amid frustration over bushs blurry position on taxing the rich 
house republicans were honing a plan that would hold this years 
spending to last years levels it would also cut the capital gains 
tax deeply while gently raising income taxes on the wealthy a 
trade bush likes but has said is unattainable because of democratic 
opposition 
were doing a house republican position said rep mickey 
edwards rokla were not developing a white house position 
thats different 
at the wht summit agreement 
as a result the democrats would impose a lesser boost ontthe 
monthly premium that medicare beneficiaries pay for doctors 
coverage the annual 75 deductible paid by participants for 
doctors expenses would increase but also at a lesser rate

prime minister margaret thatcher 
signaling increasing british impatience with the persian gulf 
standoff told her conservative party today to be prepared for war 
if sanctions fail 
we must hope they work if not the military option is there 
we must be ready for any contingency she said in her keynote 
address winding up the tories fourday annual conference 
amid applause from the 5000 delegates mrs thatcher also said 
iraqi president saddam hussein must face war crimes charges pay 
reparation for the devastation of kuwait and be stripped of power 
to mount new attacks 
this tyrant has taken our people hostage she said you 
get him out make him pay and see that he is never in a position to 
do these things again 
mrs thatcher spoke a day after foreign secretary douglas hurd 
said the international community must assess within weeks whether 
sanctions are working and whether only force can end saddams aug 
2 invasion of kuwait 
mrs thatcher praised president bush for taking the lead in the 
gulf crisis adding in times of great crisis britain and the 
united states stand as always together 
she focused most of her keynote address on trying to rally the 
party which despite promises of better economic times ahead is 
running out of time to reverse its long lag in opinion poll 
ratings 
on britains relations with the rest of the 12nation european 
community the issue that is dividing her cabinet she was 
adament that she will fight plans for economic integration with a 
single currency 
europe cannot be built by trying to turn us into regions 
rather than nations she declared 
mrs thatchers personal ratings have been boosted by the gulf 
crisis and the fresh life that her swift dispatch of british forces 
has given to the angloamerican relationship britain had seemed 
overshadowed by the emergence of a reunified germany as the 
dominant west european power 
still the conference has produced signs of anxiety that after 
11 years in power the conservatives are running out of new ideas 
we have to avoid looking like custodians of a finished 
process designers whose work is done declared sir geoffrey 
howe the deputy prime minister

genetics not the social class of a family is 
the strongest influence on intelligence according to a study of 
identical twins who were raised separately 
the study published today in the journal science said that 
twins who were raised separately scored close to the same values in 
three intelligence tests taken as adults 
thomas j bouchard a university of minnesota professor who 
directed the study said that it shows that inherited 
characteristics is the most powerful contributor to intelligence 
he and his colleagues found that 70 percent of the influence on iq 
scores was genetics and only about 30 percent was as a result of 
environment 
while 70 percent of the variation in iq in this group is due 
to genetic factors that still leaves considerable room for 
environmental influences bouchard said but whatever those 
influences are social class isnt one of them 
in the science report bouchard and his colleagues said that 
socioeconomic effects have been found to influence iq scores for 
young but not among adults 
this suggests the study said that although parents may be 
able to affect their childrens rate of cognitive skill 
acquisition they may have relatively little influence on the 
ultimate level attained 
the study is based on evaluations of 50 pairs of twins who were 
separated in childhood raised apart and then reunited as adults 
bouchard cautioned that the findings cannot be applied to people 
in extreme circumstances since none of those studied were retarded 
or raised by very poor or illiterate parents 
they do indicate that in the current environments of the 
broad middle class in industrialized societies twothirds of the 
observed variance of iq can be traced to genetic variation the 
study said 
the study also evaluated the attitudes interests and 
personalities of the raisedapart twins and found what was called 
remarkable similarity 
childhood environmental influences also seemed to have little 
effect on physical and emotional traits identical twins the study 
said are about equally similar on most physiological and 
psychological traits regardless of rearing status 
bouchards study is in conflict with some earlier separated 
twins studies that attributed only about half of the similarity in 
iq scores to genetics and said that environmental effects would 
have a stronger influence on the adult intelligence measures 
coauthors with bouchard in the study were david t lykken 
matthew mcgue nancy l segal and auke tellegen all of the 
university of minnesota 
science which published the minnesota study is the journal of 
the american association for the advancement of science

dr john talbott a physician 
researcher and teacher who edited the journal of the american 
medical association has died of cancer he was 88 
he died at home wednesday 
talbott edited the medical journal fored to elaborate 
moussa who said he was traveling 300 yards behind elmahgoubs 
car during the attack dismissed questions about whether he was the 
intended target islamic militants tried to kill an interior 
minister with a bomb and shot at two interior ministers in 1987 
one of the exministers was wounded seriously 
president hosni mubaraks predecessor anwar sadat was killed 
oct 6 1981 by moslem extremists who then tried and failed to 
overthrow the government 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we 
are shocked by the assassination he said the united states 
deplored the attack and had no indication who carried it out 
todays shooting occurred 90 minutes before moussa was to have 
briefed reporters on the outcome of a national referendum thursday 
results showed 93 percent of the egyptians voting approved 
mubaraks proposal to dissolve the peoples assembly and call new 
elections 
moussa warned before the vote that iraqis and other arabs had 
infiltrated the country to destabilize the government through 
terror attacks including assassinations egypt has led arab 
opposition to iraqs annexation of kuwait 
it was unclear what effect elmahgoubs assassination might have 
on the election process the constitution provides that elections 
must be held within 60 days of certification of the referendum 
results 
mubarak scheduled the referendum because the nations highest 
constitutional court had declared illegal the election laws under 
which the parliament was seated 
under egypts constitution elmahgoub as parliamentary speaker 
was the secondranking official because mubarak has not named a 
vice president a political moderate elmahgoub had been speaker 
since 1984 
elmahgoub mostly took his cue from mubarak and despite his 
ranking in egypts heirarchy had little real authority other than 
over parliament his high profile however made elmahgoub a 
relatively easy target for attackers 
after the shooting elmahgoubs wife was brought to the hotel 
crying hysterically just let me see him she sobbed 
in recent weeks newspaper commentators and cartoonists have 
mocked the peoples assembly and indirectly skewered elmahgoub for 
his position on the referendum although he never said so publicly 
he was known to oppose dissolution of the assembly and new 
elections

despite lastminute concessions by civil 
rights forces president bush still plans to veto major legislation 
designed to combat job discrimination the white house said today 
we still believe this is a quota bill bushs press 
secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters we continue to 
believe a veto is warranted on that basis 
attorney general dick thornburgh also told congress that bush 
would veto the proposed civil rights bill he said in a letter to 
senate republican leader bob dole that changes put forth by 
housesenate conferees do not offer substantial improvement and 
in some respects they make the bill worse 
civil rights forces had hoped that changes adopted by the 
conferees in the job discrimination legislation would overcome bush 
administration fears that the bill would encourage employers to 
adopt hiring quotas to avoid lawsuits 
but the attorney generals letter made clear that the changes 
had no effect on the bush administrations position 
accordingly the president will be compelled to veto s 2104 in 
its current form thornburgh said in a letter released by the 
justice department 
bush has said he wants to sign a civil rights bill this year 
but fitzwater said the white house will not accept the current 
version despite changes that rep augustus f hawkins dcalif 
said backers hoped were more in line with the presidents 
views 
the key change would offer employers greater leeway in defending 
against discrimination suits it also would make clear that nothing 
in the bill was designed to encourage the use of hiring quotas 
but thornburgh said the new language makes no material 
change in the bill which bush had previously threatened to veto 
the words are different but the meaning and effect are the same 
and there is no improvement 
the trouble with the bill is not that it explicitly 
encourages or requires quotas but that it will inevitably 
result in quotas being adopted surreptitiously to avoid the cost 
and trouble of lawsuits thornburgh wrote 
the assertion that the bill ought not have this effect cannot 
change the fact that it will the attorney general said 
the legislation the top legislative priority of the civil 
rights movement would negate six supreme court decisions last 
year 
main features would change complex courtroom procedures in a way 
that would make it harder for employers to defend against 
discrimination suits 
other provisions range from a ban on racial harassment on the 
job to removal of obstacles to reopening courtapproved minority 
hiring agreements 
critics in the administration and the business community say the 
bill would make it so difficult for employers to win discrimination 
suits that they would turn to hiring quotas as a way of heading off 
such charges 
a housesenate conference committee that already had produced a 
compromise version of the bill went back to work thursday night and 
adopted a sevenpoint package of concessions designed to win bushs 
backing 
supporters said that even if the president remains opposed the 
changes might attract the twothirds congressional support for the 
bill needed to override his threatened veto 
the package was adopted 118 by the conference committee 
rep craig washington dtexas a strong supporter of civil 
rights voted with critics against the package he said the changes 
turned the measure into the hollow shell of a civil rights 
bill 
washington said long delays in sending the bill to the white 
house most likely will enable bush to stop the bill with a pocket 
veto if he so desires 
under a pocket veto the president is able to kill bills by 
simply refusing to sign them when congress is not in session 
lawmakers are getting ready to leave washington for a round of 
campaigning before november elections 
im not criticizing them theyre senators and stuff 
washington said nodding toward sen edward m kennedy dmass 
but we could have done this three weeks ago 
hawkins also a strong civil rights supporter said it was time 
to come up with something we hope is more in line with the 
presidents views

the house today turned aside an 
acrosstheboard cut in 1991 defense spending despite lawmakers 
warnings of a depression if congress fails to reduce the military 
budget 
is it going to be guns or is it going to be bankruptcy rep 
james traficant dohio asked his colleagues prior to the vote on 
an amendment imposing a 5 percent cut on all defense programs 
by a resounding 31997 the house defeated the measure as 
lawmakers worked with rapidfire speed on a 268 billion defense 
spending plan that makes wholesale cuts in president bushs fiscal 
1991 budget request 
the legislation halts production of the b2 stealth bomber at 
five planes slashes bushs proposal for the strategic defense 
initiative to 23 billion and reduces us forces by 77000 
were moving in the right direction stressing more 
conventional weapons less strategic weapons said rep john 
murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on 
defense 
as members pushed to complete the bill and recess for their 
first weekend off in three weeks large chunks of thar wars that delays 
early deployment and cuts the 
number of us troops by 100000 
facing increasing congressional discontent with the stealth 
aircraft and its manufacturer the northrop corp the 
administration stepped up its effort to save the bomber on 
thursday 
in a letter to members of the house and senate armed services 
committees bush said the bomber is imperative to ussoviet 
negotiations to limit strategic weapons 
meanwhile air force secretary donald rice pleaded with 
lawmakers not to decide the fate of the b2 based on an air force 
review that found widespread problems in nearly every aspect of 
northrops business 
earlier this week brig gen robert w drewes who led the 
eightman team that conducted the study told a house panel that 
northrop was deficient in six major areas including cost and 
schedule estimates 
the review did not delve into problems associated with ongoing 
federal probes of the los angelesbased company northrop pleaded 
guilty in february to 34 counts of fraud and was fined 17 million 
the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense contractor 
the plea stems from charges that northrop falsified reports on 
the airlaunched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the 
harrier av8b jet

the government faces legal action unless it alters 
a planned highspeed rail line through the territory of two rare 
eagles a zoo director said friday 
didier pons who runs a zoo in the southern town of saintcanat 
near the eagle habitat said france would violate a 1989 european 
community conservation accord if it constructs the track along the 
intended route between lyon and marseille 
the eagles in the area are one of 31 pairs of bonelli eagles 
recorded in france according to conservationists experts say the 
birds cannot live in captivity and are unable to procreate except 
in their own territory 
pons said transport minister michel delebarre when informed of 
the problem in june responded with an utterly useless proposal 
to shift the proposed track by 100 yards in the affected area 
pons said the environmental wing of the european community will 
take the case to the european court of justice if french 
authorities ignore requests to ensure the eagles protection

in the face of rising us anger prime minister 
toshiki kaifu again expressed deep regret friday over the remarks 
of a cabinet minister who compared black americans to prostitutes 
the statement by the minister of justice is extremely 
inappropriate and extremely regrettable since he is a member of my 
cabinet i have given a stern warning to him foreign ministry 
spokesman taizo watanabe quoted kaifu as telling japanese 
reporters 
although kaifu has previously expressed regret over the remarks 
made last month by justice minister seiroku kajiyama the issue has 
failed to die 
japanese commentators have expressed worry that the controversy 
the latest involving insulting remarks made by a japanese official 
about us minorities may inflame growing trade tensions 
on thursday the us congressional black caucus said its 
members have submitted a resolution to congress calling on japan to 
fire kajiyama 
the city of trenton nj reportedly canceled a planned visit by 
members of the tokyo metropolitan assembly 
and a group representing all 26 african ambassadors in japan 
visited the foreign ministry to protest the remarks and demand more 
awareness of racial issues among japanese officials 
on sept 21 kajiyama told reporters after the arrests of 
foreign prostitutes in a tokyo redlight district that such people 
ruin the atmosphere of neighborhoods 
its like in america when neighborhoods become mixed because 
blacks move in and whites are forced out he said 
watanabe quoted kaifu as saying he was saddened and very much 
contrite over this inappropriate statement which has given 
feelings of deep unpleasantness to many people including 
afroamerican people 
kaifu said he was determined to implant a correct recognition 
of minority issues among the japanese people and noted that 
kajiyama had retracted his comments and apologized to us 
ambassador michael armacost 
watanabe said kaifu did not indicate whether the cabinet 
minister would resign

rebounding automobile purchases and surging 
gasoline prices powered retail sales to a strong 11 percent gain 
in september the government said friday 
that was the biggest advance in four months but economists said 
the two special factors were masking an otherwise weak report 
which included a large decline in department store sales 
sales figures are not adjusted to factor out price increases 
gasoline costs have shot up since iraq occupied kuwait aug 2 
inflating that sales category 
the recovery in auto sales was positive but came after months of 
deteriorating sales analysts said 
overall sales rose 16 billion to a seasonally adjusted 1512 
billion the commerce department said that followed a 04 percent 
decline in august 
what is underscored by these numbers is that the process of 
economic decline is a very slow one consumers take two steps 
backward and then one step forward at least if theyre given a 
bargain as they were with autos said economist david jones of 
aubrey g lanston amp co 
retail sales are an important barometer of economic health 
because they represent about onethird of the nations economic 
activity 
consumers are gradually becoming increasingly cautious because 
they see the oil price s forward 1346 1347 1360 1362

arrest of the former mayor of nice who resigned last month after 
24 years in office and took refuge in south america 
jacques medecin quit on sept 16 10 days before he was 
scheduled to appear in court to face possible charges of financial 
misconduct 
if medecin 62 does not return promptly to france to answer the 
charges he could be tried in absentia if convicted in such a 
trial he would face the prospect of immediate imprisonment should 
he return later 
the warrant is not valid internationally and will not trigger 
any bid to have medecin arrested in south america officials said 
however investigations of medecins financial affairs continue 
and authorities have left open the possibility that an 
international arrest warrant could be issued eventually 
according to investigators medecin was a majority stockholder 
in a magazine which obtained much of its advertising revenue from 
the city of nice and from the regional administrative council 
medecin was the councils president 
he also was accused of improperly shifting funds to cover 
municipal debts 
medecin who has spent time in uruguay and argentina since his 
resignation has said he has no immediate plans to return france 
but might do so if his lawyers recommend it 
the resignation ended a family dynasty in nice medecin was born 
in 1928 the same year his gather jean became mayor of the 
riviera city 
jean medecin held the post for 38 years until his son succeeded 
him in 1966

a federal agency established new construction 
regulations friday stemming from the 1987 collapse of lambiance 
plaza in bridgeport conn that claimed 28 lives 
the occupational safety and health administration regulations 
include a requirement that nonessential workers clear out when the 
liftslab method of construction is in use such a rule would have 
saved most of those killed at lambiance officials said at a 
signing ceremony in which the regulations were formally enacted 
we often hear we have too much regulation that we need less 
government said rep christopher shays rconn whose district 
includes bridgeport and who lobbied for regulatory changes well 
this is a classic example of where you needed more government and 
where you needed more regulation 
on april 23 1987 hydraulic jacks being used to hoist slabs of 
concrete flooring into place at the lambiance plaza construction 
site failed causing the entire building to collapse twentyeight 
workers were killed and dozens were injured in the worst workplace 
accident in the united states in nearly a decade 
only seven of those killed were working on the floor lifting 
job others were performing a variety of construction jobs 
throughout the building site 
osha chief gerard f scannell acknowledged a lot of criticism 
on the slowness of promulgating standards the 125 pages of new 
regulations took threeandahalf years to put in place but 
scannell said the rgulatory process of study hearings and comment 
made the delay inevitable 
osha officials estimated that the new rules would cost the 
construction industry only about 400000 per year the rules also 
require that 
employers provide independent engineering review to ensure 
structural integrity if workers are allowed to remain in the 
building site 
liftslab operations must be designed and planned by a 
registered professional engineer 
jacks must be able to support more than twice their rated 
weight 
lifting systems must be designed so that the failure of any 
one jack does not cause a collapse 
scannell said that in 1987 the most recent year for which 
statistics are available less than 1 percent of the 1 million 
square feet of commercial and industrial space constructed involved 
the liftslab technique

the radio said aouns supporters saw the gunman aiming a pistol 
at the general and pushed him before it went off the radio said 
the assailant was questioned by military officials and confessed 
that he was ordered to kill aoun the radio did not say who gave 
those orders the report also did not identify the aide who was hit 
or describe the extent of his injuries 
the broadcast said the attack came as aoun talked to his 
supporters who have formed a human shield around the presidential 
palace in the encircled christian enclave in an attempt to 
forestall the expected syrian attack 
i am ready to die on the battlefield of honor rather than 
surrender be sure i shall die fighting aoun told the cheering 
crowds around the hilltop palace east of beirut in baabda 
lebanons christian heartland 
the syrians overnight moved thousands of troops and dozens of 
tank columns to the major entrances of aouns territory in what a 
lebanese government official said was another step in the march 
to end aouns mutiny 
syrias troops support the government of president elias hrawi 
who is trying to end 15 years of civil war an official in hrawis 
administration said syrian and lebanese government troops would 
attack if a french mediation attempt failed but he did not set a 
deadline 
hrawis army was ordered on maximum alert and his troops joined 
the syrian army in positions facing aouns lines along a fivemile 
front from south beirut to the central mountains east of the 
capital 
aoun urged the estimated 150000 inhabitants of his enclave to 
form a human shield around his headquarters at the heavily damaged 
presidential palace 
he employed the same tactic last year to prevent a syrian 
assault the move caused an uproar and france and the vatican 
pressured syrian president hafez assad to call off the assault 
hrawis government ordered the latest blockade of aouns enclave 
as of sept 30 in a bid to force the general to step down 
jeeps from aouns military toured towns and villages of the 
enclave today and soldiers using bullhorns urged the population to 
take up arms and defend yourselves against the aggressors 
aouns radio blared martial music and songs declaring support 
for the 55yearold general 
we shall stay put whatever they do we shall not walk out on 
aoun we dont accept any other leader one of the songs said 
church bells tolled to signal thousands of aoun supporters who 
clapped shouted slogans and waved banners around aouns 
headquarters at the shellwrecked palace 
they cheered when aoun emerged from his underground bunker to 
address them 
i salute your steadfastness you will be mentioned in history 
books he told the crowd they are coming to assassinate me but 
i am not afraid i will be more than delighted to fight them off 
aoun said in remarks broadcast live by his radio station 
aoun was army commander when former president amin gemayel at 
the end of a sixyear term appointed him caretaker prime minister 
in september 1988 
aoun rejected hrawis syrianbacked election on nov 24 1989 
the election was held to carry out an arab leaguebrokered peace 
accord distributing power equally between moslems and christians as 
a step toward ending lebanons 15yearold civil war 
aoun and hrawi are both maronite catholics the christian sect 
that dominated lebanon for decades after independence from france 
in 1943 but the general considers the president to be a syrian 
puppet 
syria now the main power broker in lebanon has 40000 troops 
deployed in predominantly moslem regions under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the 21nation arab league

an iraqi opposition group based in london 
said today that iraq is considering withdrawing from kuwait and 
that its ruling political party has circulated a questionnaire 
asking key members for their opinion 
the kurdistan democratic partyiraq said president saddam 
hussein might use the survey as a way of justifying a withdrawal 
from kuwait 
the kurdistan party said in a news release received in nicosia 
from its london headquarters that the questionnaire was circulated 
on oct 8 to senior arab baath socialist party members cadres and 
activists 
this latest move shows building tension and anxiety within the 
iraqi leadership over the consequences of its invasion and 
annexation of kuwait the kurdistan party said in its statement 
it may well indicate that saddam hussein is contemplating a 
way out of the crisis by consulting party members it said 
the regimes propaganda can point back to party approval for a 
withdrawal in order to show a popular backing for any eventual 
decision taken by saddam hussein to seek a compromise in the 
current crisis 
the three survey questions reportedly posed were 
should iraq remain in kuwait 
should iraq withdraw from kuwait 
should iraq stay in kuwait even if war broke out 
those surveyed were allowed to answer under condition of 
anonymity according to the kurdish opposition group 
the purported survey could not be independently confirmed 
however the kurdistan democratic partyiraq is known to have 
good access to information inside iraq and the group was the first 
source to report on the use of chemical weapons against the kurdish 
population in iraq in 1988 
if such a questionnaire was distributed it would represent an 
unusual attempt by saddam to rule by consensus rather than decree 
the iraqi leader is known for his obsessive grasp on power in 
all political and military matters as well as his tight control 
over the nationalist baath party which served as his springboard 
to power 
the kurdistan democratic party seeks saddams overthrow and 
establishment of an independent kurdish state in northeast iraq 
saddam used chemical weapons in suppressing an april 1988 
kurdish uprising in the city of halabja in which an estimated 
20000 ethnic kurds were killed 
there are also kurdish groups in iran and turkey who seek 
independence 
iraq invaded oilrich kuwait on aug 2 prompting the deployment 
of a multinational force led by the united states in saudi arabia 
and the persian gulf the force is upholding a trade embargo 
approved by the united nations 
saddam annexed kuwait claiming it was historically part of 
iraq and has said repeatedly that iraq would never withdraw

americans say students must borrow too much 
money to attend college but agree a college education is worth a 
lot over an entire lifetime a gallup organization poll showed 
friday 
the survey found adults nationwide think the cost of higher 
education is unmanageable without some form of financial 
assistance 
it showed that 91 percent of the 1014 adults interviewed by 
telephone in june believe it is not possible today for most people 
to go to college without receiving some form of financial aid 
sixty percent believe the loan burden most students bear is too 
high about half as many 28 percent said the loan burden is about 
right given the value of a college education four percent said 
students borrow too little 
we must all redouble our efforts to provide the financial 
resources needed grants and other aid as well as loans for 
every qualified student to attend college said virginia carter 
smith interim president of the council for advancement and support 
of education case which commissioned the survey 
students at fouryear public colleges are paying an average of 
1809 for tuition and fees this year up 7 percent and those at 
twoyear public colleges are paying an average of 884 up 5 
percent the college board said at fouryear and twoyear private 
colleges students are paying an average of 9391 and 5003 
respectively up 8 percent 
almost half of all college students receive public or private 
assistance which reached an alltime high of 28 billion last 
year the college board said 
according to the poll the public supports changing federal 
government policy to include academic promise as a criterion for 
financial aid if the federal government is to give out additional 
aid 66 percent said it should be based on both academic ability 
and financial need 
twenty percent prefer the current system which is based solely 
on financial need with about half as many 11 percent voicing a 
preference for additional aid being based strictly on academic 
potential 
the survey also found that 75 percent believe significant 
advancements in the areas of medicine and technology could be 
accomplished if more people obtained a college education and 58 
percent feel that more college educated adults would dramatically 
improve societys ablity to solve social problems such as crime 
drugs and homelessness 
case an international association of colleges universities 
and independent elementary and secondary schools released the 
survey as part of national higher education week which begins 
sunday the margin of error was a plus or minus 4 percent

victims already have received such burials in which the deceased

an eastern oklahoma town that once 
reviled writer john steinbeck for his portrayal of the region in

wasnt the way it was 
when the novel the grapes of wrath was published oklahomans 
of the era generally objected it was banned in some places 
but when the book was made into a movie hollywood came to 
sallisaw for background shots including one 23second scene of 
cars and trucks loaded down with oklahomans and their belongings in 
the exodus to california 
ms plunkett said she was on her front porch one day when her 
husband olen drove up in his pickup and yelled yall get your 
clothes ready

republican resistance to raising top income 
tax rates is splintering as democrats portray the gop as the party 
of the rich 
it is the world of political dynamics in action said rep 
steve gunderson rwis im sick and tired of going home to rural 
wisconsin and protecting a republican image as the party of the 
rich 
a few months ago gunderson a member of the house gop 
leadership was one of a majority of congressional republicans who 
pledged in writing not to change tax rates in any circumstance 
now he and others favor a major revamp including raising the 
top tax rate on the rich some like gunderson would do it in 
exchange for a cut in the tax rate on capital gains profits from 
the sale of investments and others as an alternative to proposed 
levies such as a 12 cent increase in gasoline taxes 
the driving force behind the gop conversions is evidence that 
after years of trying democrats are scoring with their usvsthem 
rhetoric with a public made more receptive by the sampl scandal and a 
faltering economy 
its totally inaccurate and unfair the democrats have tried 
to turn the debate into a class warfare complained sen richard 
lugar rind there really is no need to try to turn what is 
already a difficult process into a campaign issue 
but democrats are doing just that 
democratic members of the house ways and means committee on 
thursday proposed raising income tax rates on the wealthiest 
americans from 28 to 33 percent in addition people earning more 
than 1 million annually would pay a 10 percent tax surcharge 
the extra revenue would be used to ease the hit on medicare 
recipients that was proposed by the bipartisan budget summit with 
president bush 
democrats today embraced a series of changes to restore 
fairness to our tax system said committee chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill 
the democratic plan clearly was a political statement veto bait 
for the president an attempt to highlight the issue in the final 
weeks before the midterm elections 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan and other republicans worried 
there may not be enough time to fight back 
once its shaped that way its awfully hard to get people 
focused back she said republicans needed to come forward with a 
clear position but she said i think maybe the opportunity for 
reason has now been lost 
this is a policy squabble that has become a public relations 
catastrophe said rep fred grandy riowa we are in damage 
control 
i wish we were in a big debate over whether we were going to 
be freezing spending for a while instead of raising taxes said 
sen don nickles rokla chairman of the senate republican 
campaign committee for the time being anyway weve lost the 
debate on the spending side 
i think so far the democrats have been pretty successful in 
demagoguing the tax issue theyre taking advantage of it 
nickles said 
nickles said republicans now might support what he called 
making the tax rates more understandable that is making the 
marginal tax rates on the wealthy match those of the upper middle 
class but without a net increase in revenue 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis in 1988 tried 
but failed to woo voters with his im on your side campaign 
theme last year congressional democrats revived the concept in 
their barely successful blockade of bushs capital gains tax 
proposals 
but a recent national poll by the times mirror center for people 
amp the press showed 21 percent of the people think republicans as 
rich powerful moneyed interests in a previous poll three 
years ago 18 percent made such an association 
earlier times mirror incorrectly reported 51 percent think of 
republicans as rich and powerful and blamed a computer error 
but coming up with a gop answer the public can understand is a 
tall order 
house gop leader robert michel rill said his ranks were 
divided 
there are some who are really worried about the rich man vs 
poor man argument who would without too much prodding go to 33 
percent the democratic position he said 
others were still wedded to the capital gains tax cut in line 
with bushs 1988 campaign position which democrats charge would 
mean a big break for the superrich he said 
the confusion over where the president is now isnt helping 
some say 
we dont know what game were playing we dont know whos on 
our team said rep vin weber rminn but were sure the ball 
is in play

a court on friday convicted a russian nationalist 
of fanning ethnic hostility and insulting jews in a landmark case 
that had galvanized fears of antijewish pogroms and fueled a 
jewish exodus from the country 
american and soviet jewish leaders hailed the verdict as the 
first real sign of a government crackdown on russian antisemitism 
a lawyer said it was the first time an accused antisemite has been 
put on trial in russia 
the judge sentenced konstantin smirnovostashvili a 54yearold 
factory worker to two years in a labor camp 
everything is taken out of context its all a lie the 
defendant shouted angrily in one of many outbursts during the 
halfhour session in the packed and heavily guarded moscow city 
court 
smirnovostashvili a member of the nationalist group pamyat 
has denied being antisemitic but maintains that the soviet 
unions 14 million jews hold a disproportionate number of high 
places in government and society 
he was accused of organizing protesters who broke up a jan 18 
meeting at the central house of literature in moscow and insulted 
jewish writers the court determined he was drunk at the time 
the judge also identified smirnovostashvili as the protester 
whom the weekly magazine ogonyok quoted as shouting at the writers 
your time is over neither the police nor the kgb nor the 
party will help you now we will be masters of the country and you 
newcomers clear out and go to israel how long can we tolerate 
your russophobia 
it was the first trial under a yearold law passed to quell 
unrest among the soviet unions more than 100 ethnic groups the 
law punishes inciting hatred and enmity among ethnic groups 
antisemitism dates back centuries in russia the nations 
largest republic and has frequently been associated with russian 
nationalism although it also has reared its head in most of the 
other 14 soviet republics at various times 
smirnovostashvili brought up his national heritage repeatedly 
friday 
im suffering for russia the defendant shouted as he stood 
behind a brown wooden partition guarded by five greenuniformed 
interior ministry soldiers bearing guns and rubber truncheons he 
wore a jacket over a blue track suit and shouted and jabbed his 
fist in the air 
supporters of smirnovostashvili some wearing pamyat buttons 
heckled the judge as he read a summary of the case and the verdict 
how are your friends in tel aviv they shouted 
protesters outside held a sign that read the trial of 
ostashvili is a trial of the russian people 
judge andrei muratov said the defendants diatribe at the 
writers meeting was not a dialogue or polemics but contained 
insulting demeaning threatening phrases virtually intended to 
humiliate the national honor and dignity of citizens of the jewish 
origin 
smirnovostashvili the judge said had tried to play one 
nationality against another russians to jews by accusing one 
nationality of illegal actions in respect of another he was thus 
irritating and agitating those present in an attempt to cause 
hostility discord and enmity 
the incident and threemonth trial have received wide publicity 
and many soviet jews have cited the case and other threats from 
russian nationalist groups as a factor in their decision to 
emigrate 
a record 18725 jews arrived in israel from the soviet union in 
september and soviet jewish groups have said the numbers will 
continue to soar because of an unprecedented panic among the 
jewish population 
in recent months antijewish graffiti has appeared on 
synagogues and the doors of homes where jews live and hatemongers 
have openly distributed leaflets that borrow from hitler to condemn 
the zionist menace 
jewish leaders said they saw hope in fridays court action 
it has shown that there is new fascism in russia but it has 
also shown that soviet law has been made to work and come to the 
rescue said alla geller a member of the writers group and a 
trial spectator 
an american specialist on soviet jewry agreed 
it sends a clear message that antisemitic acts will not be 
tolerated and those who continue to engage in them can expect to 
feel the full weight of the law said myrna shinbaum the 
director of the new yorkbased antidefamation leagues soviet 
jewry project spoke during a visit to moscow 
mikhail chlenov copresident of vaad the confederation of 
jewish organizations and communities in the ussr called the 
trial a first step in the crackdown on antisemitism 
he said the government should also investigate pamyat 
the court dismissed a charge that smirnovostashvili beat a 
writer at the meeting but upheld an accusation that he threatened 
attacks against jews 
smirnovostashvili could have received a maximum penalty of five 
years or a fine of up to 8950 the verdict and sentence were 
decided by a judge and two civilian assistants without a jury

a french news magazine reported today that us 
military officials have drawn up plans to free kuwait and defeat 
iraq in a fourday offensive that would leave saddam husseins 
armed forces in ruins 
lexpress said it obtained an outline of operation night camel 
from an unidentified adviser to defense secretary richard cheney 
the weekly is a general news magazine and has one of the largest 
circulations in france 
the pentagon declined to comment on the report we have 
nothing for you on that capt sam grizzle a pentagon spokesman 
said in washington 
the attack would begin on a moonless november night with an air 
assault by american warplanes dispatched from turkey saudi arabia 
and the aircraft carrier independence the magazine said 
the planes including b52s with cruise missiles would attempt 
to destroy iraqs air power neutralizing radar systems bombing 
missile bases and attacking air bases before iraqi planes could 
counterattack lexpress said 
by dawn iraq has lost all capacity to react it said 
this first phase would have lasted less than six hours 
in the second phase lexpress said warplanes and missiles 
would be used to annihilate iraqs entire military industrial 
complex targets would include nuclear facilities chemical weapon 
depots arms factories command bunkers and the main highway to 
kuwait 
also during this phase an air attack would be mounted on iraqi 
tank units massed near the border with saudi arabia lexpress 
said 
the magazine said the goal of the third phase would be to cut 
off links between kuwait and iraq it said us green berets and 
navy commandos would infiltrate behind iraqi lines to disrupt 
communications 
then it said the multinational force would launch an offensive 
along the iraqikuwait border involving tankkiller planes combat 
helicopters and 200 us m1 tanks this would be aimed at cutting 
off the 170000 iraqi soldiers in kuwait from supplies and 
reinforcements in iraq 
the fourth and final phase according to lexpress would be an 
even larger offensive to reconquer kuwait it said 11000 us 
marines would land on kuwaits north coast while 45000 marines 
three mechanized us army infantry battalions 4000 french 
troops 6000 british troops and 50000 soldiers from the panarab 
force would cross into kuwait from the south to liberate it meter 
by meter 
lexpress said us planners estimated the offensive might cost 
20000 american lives it gave no estimate for dead of other 
nations 
the magazine said planners had two other reservations that 
iraq might retaliate with chemical weapons and that it might 
succeed in wrecking saudi arabian oil fields

an architect has proposed building a 12story 
luxury apartment tower using plans prepared and then abandoned by 
frank lloyd wright 38 years ago 
architect louis astorino told city officials he wanted to build 
the trangular tower on the edge of mount washington a cliff 
overlooking downtown and the monongahela river 
the building would have 12 large apartments one on each floor 
that would cost 1 million to 12 million each it would be built 
on the site of the closed st mary of the mount high school 
city officials have welcomed the plan 
i think its an exciting wonderful thing said city 
councilwoman michelle madoff people would be living in a work of 
art 
astorino said he would not discuss the project until after 
presenting the plans to st marys parishioners sunday 
the school was closed because of declining enrollment in june 
1982 there were no takers when the 13acre site went on the 
market for 2 million the following year 
wright who died in 1959 was considered americas greatest 
architect by many there are more than 400 wrightdesigned homes in 
the united states 
wright conceived the project in 1952 calling it point view 
residences it was commissioned by pittsburgh department store 
magnate edgar j kaufmann 
it wasnt built because developers at the time thought mount 
washington lacked the shops and services needed by the buildings 
future residents according to treasures of taliesin a 1985 
book by wright archivist bruce brooks pfeiffer 
wrights design calls for a triangular tower that would give 
each unit terraces and balconies facing in all three directions

wholesale prices soared 16 percent in 
september an annual rate of more than 20 percent as gasoline 
prices shot up at their fastest pace on record the government said 
friday 
the oil shock is hitting with a vengeance its just one 
more jolt to an already fragile economy said robert dederick 
chief economist at the northern trust co of chicago 
this is the start of the wave of doubledigit inflation we 
will have to suffer through for the next quarter or two because of 
iraq said allen sinai chief economist at the boston co its 
going to propel an economy thats already in recession into a 
deeper recession 
while the labor department blamed much of the steep increase in 
wholesale costs one step short of the retail level on costlier 
petroleum prices excluding the volatile energy and food areas were 
still up a worrisome 06 percent twice the august gain 
the 206 percent rise in the cost of gasoline was the highest 
onemonth increase since the government began tracking the 
commodity in 1947 
at the earliest stage of the production process crude oil 
prices rose 204 percent fueling analysts concern that the higher 
prices will begin affecting the thousands of plastic chemical and 
other products made with petroleum 
oil also shows up in utility costs and figures in prices for 
products that must be transported long distances 
in a separate report the commerce department said retail sales 
jumped 11 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 1512 
billion and were bolstered by the soaring cost of gasoline and a 
partial recovery in auto sales excluding gasoline sales rose 08 
percent 
analysts say the combination of higher prices and stronger 
consumer spending deepens the dilemma for the federal reserve 
which has been under pressure from the bush administration to ease 
its inflationfighting campaign and lower interest rates to spur 
the economy 
how in the world can the fed ease the consumer at least 
hasnt rolled over and inflation is rebelling the two reports 
give a further reason for the fed to remain frozen in its current 
posture dederick said 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said inflation 
going up is never good news he declined to criticize the federal 
reserves apparent tight monetary policy 
we still are concerned about growth and about preventing a 
recession we think the fed has recognized all these factors and is 
on the right course fitzwater said 
septembers 16 percent rise in wholesale prices would translate 
into an annual increase of 209 percent if prices rose at the same 
pace for 12 straight months the government said 
before iraq occupied kuwait aug 2 wholesale prices were rising 
at an annual rate of just 3 percent but with the august and 
september increases figured in wholesale inflation has increased 
at an annual rate of 63 percent so far in 1990 the government 
said 
last months rise in the producer price index for finished goods 
followed a 13 percent increase in august also caused by higher 
energy costs brought on by the gulf crisis 
it was the biggest twomonth jump in wholesale prices since 
1980 the government said 
prices at earlier stages of the production process were up 
sharply too crudegoods costs jumped 46 percent while 
intermediategoods prices rose 18 percent 
an example of the three processing stages would be cotton at the 
crudegoods level cloth at the intermediategoods level and 
clothing at the finishedgoods level 
at the finishedgoods level 
energy costs overall rose 138 percent fuel oil prices rose 
213 percent natural gas costs were up 13 percent 
food prices were down 09 percent after rising 08 percent in 
august 
passenger car prices were up a sharp 34 percent after rising 
08 percent 
the consumer price index which measures the prices of goods and 
services at the retail level is due out next week 
the various changes put the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1203 in september that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods that cost 100 in 1982 would have cost 12030 
last month up from 11360 a year earlier

republican sen pete wilson holds a narrow 
lead of 47 percent to 42 percent over democrat dianne feinstein in 
the race for governor according to a california poll published 
friday 
although the results were too close to declare wilson a clear 
leader the survey respondents by a 21 margin said they expected 
the republican nominee to win the nov 6 election 
asked who they expected to win regardless of their personal 
preference 55 percent named wilson and 27 percent said feinstein 
said pollster mervin field 
wilson voters are supremely confident that he will be elected 
while a plurality of feinstein voters believe she will be 
californias next governor their confidence level is not as 
high field said 
some 1021 voters were surveyed by telephone in the oct 310 
poll which had a margin of error of 32 percentage points seven 
percent were undecided and 4 percent favored minor party 
candidates 
wilson had leads of 45 percent to 42 percent in an august survey 
and 45 percent to 40 percent in a june survey 
in the latest survey wilson was leading by 49 percent to 41 
percent among men and by 46 percent to 44 percent among women the 
survey found wilson leading by a 5039 margin in southern 
california while feinstein led by a 4843 margin in northern 
california

the supreme court on friday refused to 
reinstate campaigncontribution limits for californias 
gubernatorial election and other political contests in that state 
next month 
the court without comment or recorded dissent let stand a 
federal judges ruling that threw out contribution limits imposed 
by california voters in proposition 73 two years ago 
the judges ruling lets candidates for governor other statewide 
posts and some local offices accept contributions greater than the 
limits created in 1988 
us district judge lawrence karlton ruled on sept 25 that the 
limits gave an unfair advantage to incumbents karlton also tossed 
out a ban on transfers of funds between candidates 
prop 73 barred anyone from contributing more than 1000 to a 
particular candidate in a fiscal year the measure also limited 
political action committee donations to 2500 or 5000 per 
candidate for each fiscal year depending on the size of the 
committee 
wilson who had only token opposition in the june primary 
raised 125 million through june and had 39 million in the bank 
as of july 1 feinstein raised 81 million through june but had 
just 645344 left over from her victorious primary campaign 
against state attorney general john van de kamp 
the contribution limits were challenged by the democratic party 
and labor unions which said proposition 73 unfairly interfered 
with freespeech rights and the freedom of association

demonstrators at the capitol marked fridays 
anniversary of columbus discovery of the new world by beginning a 
fast to protest what they said were violations of indian rights 
a group called fast for big mountain said six people would 
engage in a wateronly fast on the capitol steps until nov 22 
thanksgiving day with the 150 demonstrators were four indians 
beating a drum 
columbus and the conquistadors who followed him invaded this 
hemisphere and exploited oppressed and killed the original people 
here their statement began 
nearly 500 years later descendants of these indigenous 
inhabitants are still being exploited oppressed and killed by 
descendants of the invaders 
columbus first sighted american land on oct 12 1492 in this

the search for alien civilizations in space 
expanded to cover the entire sky as a new radio receiver started 
running in argentina on friday the anniversary of columbus 
discovery of the new world 
today represents the opening up of half of the universe to the 
search by the human species for extraterrestrial intelligence 
said astronomer carl sagan president of the planetary society 
you have to be made of wood not to be interested in knowing 
whether were alone in the universe sagan said by phone from 
ithaca ny where he is a professor at cornell university here 
we are for the first time in human history when its technically 
possible to find out and its very cheap 
wouldnt we be ashamed of ourselves if the answer was there 
for the taking and we were too shy to look 
the pasadenabased planetary society which advocates space 
exploration financed the supercomputercontrolled radio receiver 
and signal analyzer with 150000 raised from its 125000 members 
in more than 100 nations 
the 84millionchannel receiver about the size of two large 
refrigerators is called megachannel extraterrestrial assay ii or 
meta ii it is located at argentinas institute of radioastronomy 
30 miles southeast of buenos aires 
it is identical to meta i at harvard universitys oak ridge 
observatory in massachusetts since 1985 that receiver has 
listened to northern hemisphere skies for signals from aliens 
steven spielberg who directed the films et the 
extraterrestrial and close encounters of the third kind 
donated 100000 for meta i 
the meta project is the worlds most powerful operating search 
for alien radio signals although nothing has been heard so far 
about 100 people watched as the institutes director raul 
colomb pointed one of the institutes 98footwide radiotelescope 
dish antennas toward the southern cross a major southern 
hemisphere constellation as the receiver was switched on friday 
morning 
the new receiver is capable of listening to the heart of our 
milky way galaxy 
if either receiver ever detects radio signals intentionally sent 
by aliens it means that its not inevitable civilizations in 
their technological adolescence destroy themselves sagan said 
the united states celebrated columbus day on monday but friday 
was the anniversary of christopher columbus arrival in north 
america from spain on oct 12 1492 
sagan who was host of the popular public television series 
cosmos said discovery of extraterrestrials would be still 
more powerful and significant and historical it would be a turning 
point in the history of civilization every field of human endeavor 
will gain something 
the development of technical civilization is likely to happen 
on countless other worlds sagan said our galaxy alone contains 
400 billion stars evidence suggests many have planets and studies 
show carbon the basis of life is abundant in space he said 
more than 50 limited searches for extraterrestrial intelligence 
have been conducted since the 1960s almost all previous efforts 
listened for radio signals above earths northern hemisphere with 
only brief searches of southern skies 
the meta receivers designed by harvards paul horowitz listen 
to radio frequencies around what scientists call the water 
hole they are frequencies emitted naturally by the breakdown 
products of water hydrogen the most abundant element in the 
universe and hydroxyl made of one oxygen and one hydrogen atom 
water has one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms 
astronomers believe that like animals gathering to drink 
intelligent aliens would pick the water hole as a way to 
contact other civilizations

the consumer product safety commission said 
friday it has taken the first step to ban infant bean bag 
cushions because of 30 reported cases of babies found dead on them 
the commission voted thursday to publish a notice of proposed 
rule making in which it will seek public comments to help it 
develop an accurate definition of the product 
the cushions are filled with plastic foam beads or other 
granular material that can conform to the body of an infant 
especially to the face when the infant is placed stomachdownward 
they have been promoted as resting or sleeping places for 
infants or devices to prop them upright but in at least 30 cases 
have led to death through suffocation 
the commission announced earlier this year an agreement with all 
known manufacturers of the cushions to recall them and not produce 
any more the recalls covering about a million cushions are still 
in effect 
consumers who have not already returned their infant cushions 
should stop using them return to the store or destroy them the 
commission said 
recall instructions can be obtained from a tollfree telephone 
number 18006382772 most manufacturers have offered refunds 
commenting on the commissions vote chairman jacqueline 
jonessmith said although production of infant cushions has 
stopped we need to prevent any future production of this product 
in order to prevent more deaths

hundreds of kuwaitis representing 
all walks of life began gathering here friday for a conference on 
their countrys current plight and its future 
the exiled emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah will address the 
threeday kuwaiti peoples conference which begins saturday 
his kuwaiti critics hope the royal family will loosen its hold 
on the emirates financial and political institutions if it regains 
control 
the emir has called for a new social covenant between the 
alsabah family and kuwaits citizens 
the debate has raised questions about the mandate of other gulf 
rulers benevolent despots who so far have rejected a multiparty 
system and participatory democracy as destablilizing influences 
the iraqi invasion and the popular support saddam has garnered 
in parts of the arab world have demonstrated the vulnerability of 
all the gulf states to destabilizaion by revolutionary populist 
forces 
the kuwaiti participants at the jiddah conference include former 
ministers parliamentarians diplomats businessmen judges civil 
servants journalists and representatives of public and private 
organizations 
among them are expected to be members of opposition groups who 
had been campaigning for the restoration of kuwaits westernstyle 
parliament even before the aug 2 invasion 
the opposition figures insisted even then that they still were 
loyal to the emir in statements over the last few weeks they have 
maintained that line some even say they have dropped their 
opposition 
the conferences first session in jiddah the saudi summer 
capital is expected to deal with ways to intensify the opposition 
to saddams invasion and annexation 
conference members also are expected to reject any iraqi attempt 
to include a national referendum on kuwaits future as part of a 
political solution to the gulf crisis 
the very presence of this large number of kuwaitis is in 
itself a pledge of allegiance for the rule of alsabah family and 
sheik jaber said abdulrahman alawadi minister for cabinet 
affairs 
the conference will expose the brutal iraqi practices against 
our people inside kuwait alawadi said

new jersey can breath freely again it can 
still ship its garbage to indiana 
a proposal that would have allowed states to close their borders 
to other states garbage was killed in housesenate negotiations 
friday 
the garbage fight has pitted new jersey lawmakers against those 
from indiana but the issue had far broader ramifications by some 
estimates as many as twothirds of the states ship garbage beyond 
their borders because of landfill shortages 
last month the senate by a 6831 vote tacked the interstate 
garbage shipment prohibition onto an appropriations bill for the 
district of columbia but members of a housesenate conference 
committee removed the provision on friday the house never enacted 
a similar measure 
this is a big win for new jersey said sen frank 
lautenberg dnj who had led the fight against the measure 
sponsored by sen dan coats rind 
coats characterized the issue as one giving every state the 
right to determine its own destiny in managing and disposing 
trash 
we lost the battle but believe ultimately we will win the 
war coats said through a spokesman coats who has made the 
garbage issue a key part of his reelection bid promised to renew 
the fight in the next congress if reelected 
indiana is among the recipients of a rising tide of outofstate 
garbage coats measure would have allowed states to block garbage 
imports or impose high fees on such shipments 
sen bill bradley dnj said coats proposal was an 
attack on new jersey he and lautenberg argued that states must 
be able to send garbage elsewhere until they can develop 
environmentally safe and reasonably priced alternatives including 
more incentives for recycling 
new jersey which now sends about half its garbage out of state 
hopes to ease its garbage problems in the future by reaching a goal 
of 60 percent recycling 
rep dean gallo rnj who was a member of the conference 
committee considering the bill that included the garbage measure 
said house members opposed it because the issue had not been 
thoroughly debated in the house 
senate negotiators agreed to withdraw the provision after only 
three of the six senators at the conference said they would support 
it

attorney general dick thornburgh on friday 
stuck by his decision to block the release of government secrets 
that had scuttled the irancontra trial of former cia agent joseph 
fernandz 
the justice departments announcement drew a stinging response 
from the irancontra special prosecutor 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said the dismissal of 
charges against former cia agent joseph fernandez was forced by an 
overprotective attitude toward classified information 
no matter how the administration rationalizes the 
nonproduction of this information it shows a lack of concern for 
applying the rule of law to officials of the intelligence 
community walsh said 
he said the administrations stance will form the basis for an 
important part of our final report to congress on the irancontra 
investigation 
fernandez former cia station chief in costa rica was accused 
of lying to the presidential commission that investigated the 
irancontra affair and cia superiors about his role in helping ship 
arms to the nicaraguan rebels 
fernandez was accused of lying about the purpose of an airstrip 
he helped build in costa rica that was used by a covert resupply 
operation set up by white house aide oliver l north 
a federal judge in alexandria va last year ruled that 
fernandez was entitled to disclose secrets about cia operations in 
central america to show it was deeply involved in the covert 
resupply effort 
us district judge claude m hilton dismissed the charges 
against fernandez after thornburgh filed an affidavit under the 
classified information procedures act that barred the use of the 
secret evidence 
in september the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond 
va upheld hiltons determination that fernandez was entitled to 
disclose the secrets at issue during his trial 
thornburgh reviewed his original decision on friday the 
justice department notified hilton in a letter that thornburgh 
would still not allow the secrets to be released at trial 
under cipa hiltons dismissal order does not become final until 
the attorney general reaffirms his decision to block the release of 
secrets 
the letter by justice department attorney james s reynolds said 
thornburghs review included a meeting with heads of government 
agencies responsible for protecting national security 
these officials unanimously urged thornburgh not to withdraw his 
affidavit reynolds said 
the potentially serious damage to national security which 
could result from the disclosure of the two categories of 
information is exacerbated by the prospect for additional 
disclosures at trial reynolds wrote 
one senior official described the potential harm which could 
result as devastating

a news magazine reported friday that us military 
officials have made plans to defeat iraq and liberate kuwait in a 
fourday offensive that would destroy saddam husseins armed 
forces 
lexpress a weekly news magazine with one of the largest 
circulations in france said it obtained an outline of the plan 
from an unidentified adviser to defense secretary richard cheney 
it said us planners estimated the offensive heavily dependent 
on air power might cost 20000 american lives it gave no estimate 
for dead of other nations it said the offensive was to be launched 
in november by american warplanes from turkey saudi arabia and the 
aircraft carrier independence 
the magazine made no mention of the thousands of western 
hostages held in iraq and kuwait at strategic sites 
a pentagon spokesman declined comment we have nothing for you 
on that said capt sam grizzle a pentagon spokesman 
pentagon officials previously have said they would rely on air 
power in any attack on iraq air force gen mike dugan was fired in 
september for public comments about us plans for heavy bombing in 
baghdad that would specifically target saddam and his family 
the head of the joint chiefs of staff gen colin l powell and 
gen h norman schwarzkopf commander of us forces in saudi 
arabia have said that air power is the only way to defeat iraqi 
forces without overwhelming casualties 
lexpress said that aside from the high casualties planners had 
two other reservations that iraq might retaliate with chemical 
weapons and that baghdad might succeed in wrecking saudi arabian 
oil fields 
the socalled operation night camel would begin on a november 
night with an air assault by the american warplanes including 
b52s with cruise missiles the magazine said 
the planes would aim to destroy iraqs air power before iraqi 
planes could counterattack radar systems would be neutralized 
missile bases bombed and air bases attacked lexpress said 
the magazine said this first phase would last less than six 
hours 
by dawn iraq has lost all capacity to react it said 
in the second phase warplanes and missiles would be used to 
annihilate iraqs entire military industrial complex lexpress 
said targets would include nuclear facilities chemical weapon 
depots arms factories command bunkers and the main highway to 
kuwait 
an air attack would also be mounted on iraqi tank units massed 
near the border with saudi arabia in the second phase lexpress 
said 
in the third phase the goal would be to cut off links between 
kuwait and iraq the magazine said us green berets and navy 
commandos would infiltrate behind iraqi lines to disrupt 
communications 
the multinational force would then launch an offensive along the 
iraqikuwait border involving tankkiller planes combat 
helicopters and 200 us m1 tanks to cut off the 170000 iraqi 
soldiers in kuwait from supplies and reinforcements the magazine 
said 
in the fourth and final phase there would be an even larger 
offensive to reconquer kuwait lexpress said 
the magazine said 11000 us marines would land on kuwaits 
north coast at the same time 45000 marines three mechanized 
us infantry battalions 4000 french troops 6000 british troops 
and 50000 soldiers from the panarab force would cross into kuwait 
from the south to liberate it meter by meter

the major maker of barium enema kits is 
recalling some products because they may be linked to severe 
reactions including nine deaths from the common medical 
procedure federal officials said friday 
ezem inc of westbury ny sent recall notices to customers 
a week ago saying evidence suggests watersoluble proteins in 
inflatable latex cuffs on the enema tips may be triggering the 
reactions 
the fda has received 150 reports of allergic reactions related 
to barium enema procedures in 1989 and 1990 said fda spokeswoman 
susan cruzan in nine cases the patient died she said 
the company makes 85 percent to 90 percent of the kits which 
are used to diagnose disorders of the intestines 
about 8 million to 10 million barium enemas are performed 
annually cruzan said 
the reports have been related to the companys enema kits with 
inflatable latex cuffs 
company officials did not return a telephone call for comment 
in light of the reports the fda asked radiologists and other 
health professionals to report any adverse reactions related to 
barium enema procedures that have occurred in the past 12 months 
fda is particularly concerned because some of these allergic 
reactions have been fatal and occurred within minutes of beginning 
the procedures the agency said in its october issue of fda drug 
bulletin a publication sent to physicians 
the procedure involves injecting a bariumcontaining fluid into 
the rectum and colon which enables these organs to show up on an 
xray 
in some cases the reactions occurred after the enema tip had 
been inserted but before the barium had been introduced the fda 
said 
the fda said the cause of the problem is still unclear

prime minister margaret thatcher 
winding up her conservative partys annual conference friday told 
britain to prepare for war if sanctions fail in the persian gulf 
crisis 
we must hope they sanctions work if not the military 
option is there we must be ready for any contingency she 
said signalling increasing british impatience at the standoff 
delegates cheered as mrs thatcher spelled out a tough line on 
iraq in her 45minute keynote address at the end of the fourday 
conference in this south england resort 
she painted britain as americas no 1 ally in the gulf 
rejected plans for economic integration of the european community 
and attacked the revamped labor party as hardline socialists 
masquerading as a party of moderation 
the hall resounded with applause as the prime minister who 
turns 65 saturday threaded her way through 5000 delegates who 
waved union jacks and sang the favorite tory anthem land of hope 
and glory 
but the party remains in trouble heavily dependent on her 
promises that inflation which edged up to 109 percent friday 
will fall sharply next year 
labor is posing its biggest threat since mrs thatcher won power 
11 years ago the conservatives have narrowed a yearlong lag in 
opinion polls but labor remains 8 to 14 points ahead 
the conference appeared short on new ideas for a party that may 
fight an election before its next meeting 
the weekly economist which generally supports the tories 
commented friday for a party used to wallowing in victory and 
selfcongratulation it was a strangely glum affair 
on iraq mrs thatcher said president saddam hussein must face 
war crime charges pay reparation for the devastation of kuwait and 
be stripped of power to invade again 
this tyrant has taken our people hostage she said you 
get him out make him pay and see that he is never in a position to 
do these things again 
on thursday her foreign secretary douglas hurd urged an 
assessment within weeks to determine if sanctions are working or if 
only force can end saddams aug 2 invasion on iraq 
mrs thatcher praised president bush adding when the call 
came to send forces to the gulf it was independent nations above 
all the united states and britain which took rapid and decisive 
action 
on britains relations with the rest of the 12nation european 
community the issue that divides her party and cabinet she said 
she will fight plans for a single currency despite linking the 
pound this week to europes other major currencies sterling joined 
the communitys exchange rate mechanism 
she is gambling that inflation will fall as a spinoff of 
stabilizing the pound against the strong german mark combined with 
the past two years of high british interest rates 
low inflation would enable her to cut interest rates and put the 
government in better shape to call an election next year mrs 
thatchers third fiveyear term expires in june 1992

moslem fundamentalists have stepped up 
attacks on the afghan capital and are poised for a major assault to 
bring down the communist government sources said friday 
more moderate guerrilla leaders predicted the attack would 
accomplish nothing except massive bloodshed and have begun to map 
out plans to stop them 
it will be a massacre said one rebel leader who spoke on 
condition of anonymity he said he feared his outspokenness would 
be punished with reduced arms shipments to his fighters 
there had been a period of relative calm in kabul the afghan 
capital until the fundamentalist guerrillas stepped up attacks 
the governments wellequipped army and air force have responded 
with air and artillery strikes diplomatic and guerrilla sources 
said 
at least 60 people have been killed and scores more injured in 
two weeks of heavy fighting 
there were reports that government troops had decimated two 
guerrilla columns marching toward the capital those reports could 
not be independently confirmed 
were attacking all the time but the time has not been set yet 
for the big offensive said hamid a guerrilla spokesman who 
like many afghans uses only one name 
according to the sources gulbuddin hekmatyar the most radical 
and antiwestern of usbacked guerrilla leaders has been chosen 
to lead the major assault on the capital of 15 million 
for more than 12 years pakistans powerful intelligence agency 
has been a conduit for us military aid to the guerrillas who are 
fighting to unseat successive communist governments in their 
neighboring homeland 
rumors have been circulating in this dusty border city for weeks 
that hekmatyar and shah nawaz tanai the former defense minister of 
afghanistan who defected to the guerrillas in march were planning 
another coup attempt 
tanai orchestrated a failed coup last march that left hundreds 
dead destroyed sections of the capital and severely handicapped 
afghanistans air force before forces loyal to president najibullah 
crushed the mutineers 
afghan and pakistani sources say arms shipments to hekmatyar 
have risen dramatically since benazir bhuttos government was 
ousted on aug 6 and replaced by her rightwing opponents 
ms bhutto reportedly sought a reduced role for the firebrand 
moslem rebel leader 
for months he was getting very little now he is getting 
everything said another guerrilla spokesman abdul wakeel 
soviet troops sent to afghanistan backed up najibullahs 
government until they withdrew from afghanistan in february 1989 
the guerrillas had presented a unified front until then but the 
alliance has gradually disintegrated 
several key commanders including haq and ahmed shah masood 
considered the most effective rebel leader met friday to map out 
a strategy to stop hekmatyar and find an acceptable political 
alternative to najibullah 
moscow and washignton are reportedly close to an agreement that 
calls for elections overseen by a transitional government that 
includes neither najibullah nor the guerrilla leadership

israel used curfews roadblocks and water 
cannons friday to stop thousands of arabs from attending moslem 
sabbath services at the temple mount where police killed 19 
palestinians earlier this week 
in the occupied territories troops shot and killed two 
palestinians and wounded at least 10 in clashes with stonethrowing 
youths arab reports said 
also friday prime minister yitzhak shamir said israel would 
reject any effort by the un security council to send a team to 
investigate the temple mount deaths which occurred monday 
shamir said a un investigation would be an infringement on 
israels sovereignty over jerusalem israel captured the arab 
sector which contains the temple mount from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war and later annexed it 
in the recent past in the middle east there have been a 
number of incidents where people were killed he said we did 
not see the security council being pressured to such grave 
discussions and with such broad outcomes 
a security council resolution condemning the incident has been 
hung up over differences on the form of a un investigation and 
whether to emphasize protecting palestinians the issues have 
divided the united states and its allies 
the arab league will hold an urgent meeting on the confrontation 
next wednesday sources in tunisia said 
defense minister moshe arens said the us was trying to walk 
a fine line in order not to jeopardize its international 
coalition against iraq 
but i think if they conclude that the way to keep this 
coalition is to blame israel for an event whose roots lie in moslem 
fanatacism they will make a mistake arens said on israel 
television 
deputy foreign minister bibi natanyahu said the un response to 
the events lends rioters an international license to continue 
their rioting 
a palestinian human rights group al haq issued a preliminary 
report on the killings calling them a massacre and urging 
international protection for palestinians 
the group said massive stonethrowing which police say prompted 
their gunfire did not begin until after tear gas was fired onto 
the temple mount it also accused paramilitary border police units 
of opening fire without warning 
since the revolt against israeli occupation of the territories 
began in december 1987 760 palestinians have been killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians 
an additional 278 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaboration with israeli authorities 
fortyeight israelis have died in the violence 
the latest victims were amar derouchme 20 from the west bank 
village of toubas and rami jarar 18 from nearby jenin 
the army said derouchme was a former prisoner shot by soldiers 
in a stonethrowing clash and that it was checking the 
circumstances of jarars death arab reports said jarar was shot as 
soldiers chased curfew violators 
mondays rioting on the temple mount sacred to both moslems 
and jews started when arabs threw stones down at jews worshiping 
below at the western wall also known as the wailing wall 
the moslems had been inflamed by rumors that a zealous jewish 
group the temple mount faithful was planning a march to the mount 
to reclaim the site for judaism 
police and arab hospitals said 19 palestinians were killed and 
140 were injured in police gunfire on the mount at least 28 jewish 
civilians and six police were injured in the stoning police said 
israeli politicians on the left and right charged that israeli 
security forces were unprepared for trouble despite advance 
warnings jerusalem mayor teddy kollek accused the arabs of 
planning the riot 
police chief yaacov terner said however the rioting was 
spontaneous and that there was no concrete intelligence that a 
major arab demonstration was planned 
on friday hundreds of police and paramilitary units were on 
duty around the mount and a helicopter circled above 
palestinians from the west bank were stopped by army roadblocks 
from approaching jerusalem in the city police blocked hundreds of 
young men from walking to prayers halting them at the gates to the 
old city or to the mount 
police turned water cannons on a group of 200 palestinian youths 
who tried to march to the mount the youths retreated to a nearby 
street and pelted passing cars with stones 
about 2000 managed to attend the prayers about onefifth the 
usual friday crowd at the service prayer leader sheik mohammed 
hussein praised those killed monday as martyrs and pledged 
we will defend our mosque until the last drop of our blood 
his sermon was interrupted by worshipers shouts of god 
destroy the jews 
many palestinians also were blocked from prayers by army 
curfews more than one million palestinians in arab east jerusalem 
the west bank and gaza were confined to their homes for a fifth day 
because of mondays riot 
residents of the gaza strip used a twohour lifting of the 
curfew friday to burn tires and shout antiisraeli slogans in 
street demonstrations residents said

the head of northrop corp defended his 
company friday against charges that the manufacturer of the b2 
bomber cant manage its business 
northrops long record as an asset to this country deserves to 
be weighed in the haste to discuss its liabilities said kent 
kresa who is chairman of the board president and chief executive 
officer 
kresas testimony came at the end of a difficult week for 
northrop a top air force official testified on tuesday about 
deficiences in six major areas at the company including cost and 
schedule estimates 
the air forces assistant secretary for acquisition jack welch 
said in an interview with the los angeles times that testing of the 
second b2 bomber had been delayed nine months 
meanwhile the house approved a 1991 defense appropriations bill 
that halts production of the b2 bomber at 15 planes lawmakers 
have expressed dismay over the aircrafts cost of nearly 865 
million a copy 
in a lengthy statement kresa said he accepts responsibility for 
the failures of individuals and management oversight that took 
place in the past 
our failings should never have occurred the systems that 
allowed them to occur have been changed and are being changed some 
changes in our business and management systems we should have made 
long ago and didnt kresa said 
the northrop president detailed steps the company has taken 
including changes in top management and an examination of values 
and ethics among employees 
kresa said lawmakers were rightfully outraged by the events 
that led to criminal penalties against northrop 
northrop pleaded guilty in february to 34 counts of fraud and 
was fined 17 million the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a 
defense contractor the plea stems from charges that northrop 
falsified reports on the airlaunched cruise missile and conducted 
improper tests on the harrier av8b jet 
in his appearance before the house goverment operations 
subcommittee on legislation and national security kresa sought to 
assure lawmakers about northrops major program the b2 bomber 
the stealth aircraft and employees on the project have faced 
allegations of overcharging mismanagement and destruction of 
material kresa said since those charges in february 1988 the 
justice department air force and pentagon have been unable to find 
any evidence to support the allegations he said 
not a single charge has been placed against anyone for 
anything kresa said

jackson

jurors in the case who said deputy us marshals told them the 
alternate panelists would have voted guilty guilty guilty

whether the drug sting at their hotel had been staged for their 
benefit

18 that incident produced one of the misdemeanor possession 
charges the jury could not decide 
the mayor is scheduled for sentencing on oct 26 he could face

the white house said friday that president 
bush still plans to veto a major jobdiscrimination bill despite 
lastminute changes designed by proponents to overcome 
administration objections 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said changes 
adopted by housesenate conferees did not eliminate features in the 
civil rights bill that administration contends would encourage 
employers to adopt hiring and promotion quotas to avoid lawsuits 
we still believe this is a quota bill fitzwater told 
reporters we continue to believe a veto is warranted on that 
basis 
the legislation would undo six supreme court decisions that 
civil rights lawyers claim make it harder for plaintiffs to prove 
employment discrimination 
the white house statement and a letter by attorney general dick 
thornburgh to congress that summarized the presidents objections 
to the bill prompted accusations from a leading civil rights group 
that the administration was negotiating in bad faith 
the leadership conference on civil rights charged in a statement 
that white house chief of staff john sununu and presidential 
counsel c boyden gray insisted on provisions that would gut the 
bill and actually weaken civil rights laws 
the group released a copy of a sept 21 proposal made by sununu 
and gray that it said would allow businesses to hire on the basis 
of legitimate community or customer relationship efforts 
customer relations was the code word used by airlines to 
restrict flight attendant jobs to young single women the civil 
rights coalition said 
the administrations proposal could allow law firms banks and 
other employers to bar blacks or jews or catholics from certain 
jobs because customers prefer not to deal with them 
arthur fletcher a leading black republican whom bush appointed 
to chair the civil rights commission expressed dismay that the 
white house was listening so closely to business interests 
the business community which seems to have the upper hand on 
this one this time really doesnt want to be held accountable for 
their efforts with respect to hiring training development and 
promotion of minorities fletcher said 
a leading republican member of the house hamilton fish of new 
york also expressed regret over the white house statement 
fish said he and other republican lawmakers who have worked on 
the bill have tried without success to meet personally with bush to 
urge his support 
there is still the outside chance that bush will sign the 
measure fish said i dont think the president is focused on 
this how could he be with the budget diplomacy and half a dozen 
other major issues 
bush has continually said he wants to sign a civil rights bill 
but not one that would prompt hiring and promotion quotas 
thornburgh said the changes adopted thursday by housesenate 
conferees recognize that the bill contains serious 
deficiencies but the amendments do not offer substantial 
improvement and in some respects they make the bill worse he 
said 
language stating that the bill does not require or encourage 
quotas wont eliminate the problem thornburgh said in a letter to 
senate republican leader bob dole 
the trouble with the bill is not that it explicitly 
encourages or requires quotas but that it will inevitably 
result in quotas being adopted surreptitiously to avoid the cost 
and trouble of lawsuits thornburgh wrote 
the assertion that the bill ought not have this effect cannot 
change the fact that it will the attorney general said 
thornburghs letter also said that despite changes the bill 
still narrowly restricts the ability of employers to defend charges 
that business policies unfairly discriminate against women and 
minorities 
ralph neas executive director of the civil rights coalition 
called thornburghs description of the bill highly misleading and 
inaccurate it does a disservice to the president and the nation 
they are ignoring all the changes made by the house and 
senate neas said 
neas said language now cited by thornburgh as objectionable was 
included in the bill last summer at sununus behest to define 
practices that employers could cite in defending discrimination 
suits 
to show that a practice was necessary to good business 
employers would have to show that it bore a significant 
relationship to successful performance on the job according to 
the language

a former kgb general won a partial legal victory 
friday in his battle to get the kremlin to restore benefits and 
honors that it withdrew when he was fired for criticizing the spy 
agency 
the russian supreme court overruled a decision last week by the 
moscow city court and ordered the city court to reconsider oleg d 
kalugins challenge of his demotion by soviet prime minister 
nikolai ryzkhov tass reported 
kalugin who had accused the kgb of tapping telephones and 
spying on free trade unionists clergymen and others challenging 
communist authorities was stripped last summer of his rank honors 
and pension 
if kalugin is successful in his attempt to have them restored 
it could be a landmark case for citizens challenging official 
secrecy about government decisions 
kalugin in august complained to the city court that he was 
unfairly demoted on june 29 by ryzkhov denied his awards by 
president mikhail gorbachev and wrongly stripped of his pension by 
kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov 
the moscow court last week threw out the complaint against 
ryzkhov on the grounds that the decision had been taken by the 
13member council of ministers ryzkhovs cabinet and no person 
could be singled out 
but kalugins lawyers submitted statements by several ministers 
that the decision to demote kalugin was made without their 
knowledge 
the supreme court ordered the moscow court to review kalugins 
complaint against ryzkhov 
appeals can be lodged against a particular officials personal 
actions as well as his actions on behalf of the body he 
represents tass quoted the high court as saying 
kalugin called the ruling a step towards justice 
the city court also is considering the complaint against kgb 
chief kryuchkov but has taken no action on the allegation against 
gorbachev the threejudge panel is scheduled to meet again oct 
23 
under the reforms introduced by gorbachev the soviet parliament 
has asserted greater control over the government but kalugin and 
other reformers argue that many officials continue to follow secret 
orders 
officials in the kgb which in earlier years arrested 
incarcerated and executed millions of citizens with impunity have 
told the soviet people that the days of terror are over 
but the kgb and the soviet leadership reacted harshly last 
summer after kalugin went public with his criticism of the agency 
which gathers intelligence abroad and is responsible for state 
security at home 
publicity surrounding the case helped kalugin win a seat 
representing the southern russian city of krasnodar in the soviet 
parliament last month 
viktor alexeyev chief of the kgb legal department told the 
court that the agency revoked kalugins military pension after he 
was demoted in accordance with a soviet law alexeyev said 
kalugin 55 could receive a normal oldage pension when he becomes 
eligible in five years

the senate banking committee on friday 
approved 57 billion in new taxpayer bailout funds for savings and 
loan depositors more than the 50 billion committed in the 
original rescue package enacted just 14 months ago 
on a voice vote with no audible dissent the 21member committee 
gave its assent to a plan carrying the bailout through the 1991 
fiscal year that began just 13 days ago after bush administration 
officials said the rescue effort would falter for a lack of funds 
while administration officials had been saying since june that 
the bailout would need another 40 billion to 80 billion in new 
government money they had made no specific request to congress 
until this past wednesday 
bush had contended the 50 billion he requested and received 
from congress last year to close or merge insolvent thrifts and 
cover their losses of federally insured deposits would put the sampl 
crisis behind the nation 
but with declining real estate values in many areas of the 
country the losses have continued to swell as regulators moved 
into the insolvent or nearly insolvent thrifts 
on wednesday treasury secretary nicholas f brady wrote the 
chairmen of the senate and house banking committees that the 
bailout will virtually cease within the next two months unless 
additional funds are provided 
brady requested 40 billion in new money to carry the rescue 
through the next 12 months 
but he also wanted lawmakers to abandon their requirement that 
the resolution trust corp maintain a 15 percent reserve to cover 
more unexpected losses in the event the value of assets on sampl 
books fall further 
to maintain those reserves he said would require another 17 
billion 
rather than see the present 8 billion reserve exhausted the 
senate committee opted to provide the full 57 billion even though 
the administration expects to spend only about 50 billion this 
fiscal year 
house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez dtexas said 
friday that his panel will take up bradys request next week 
money to carry out the plan must be provided through a separate 
appropriations bill

press said friday a national poll it took last month showed that 21 
percent o the people not 51 percent as reported associated 
republicans with rich powerful moneyed interests 
in a previous poll three years ago 18 percent made such an 
association the big jump to 51 percent was widely published and 
frequently cited by political commentators 
times mirror said the incorrect figure was due to a computing 
error 
it said it also overstated the percentage of people who 
spontaneously said they associated republicanism with conservatism 
being business oriented and not being for the people 
scott sowry a spokesman for the republican national committee 
said the party was certain that the apparent jump was an error

bawdy rappers 2 live crew face 
contempt of court charges for showing up late to their own 
obscenity trial on friday 
band members luther campbell and chris wongwon showed up 30 
minutes late for fridays proceedings and mark ross trailed in more 
than an hour late infuriating broward county judge june johnson 
johnson said she would sentence the three on contempt charges 
when the trial ends each faces up to six months in jail 
the three are on trial on misdemeanor obscenity charges stemming 
from a june 10 adultsonly performance at a nightclub in nearby 
hollywood the performance came four days after a federal judge 
declared obscene their sexually explicit album as nasty as they 
wanna be 
if convicted each rapper faces up to a year in jail and fines 
of up to 1000 each 
on the fifth day of jury selection the judge upheld the 
prosecutions removal of a potential black juror defense attorney 
bruce rogow failed to persuade the judge that the man had been 
removed because of his race 
rogow has unsuccessfully tried to show that browards selection 
of jurors from voter registration lists is unconstitutional because 
blacks and youths are underrepresented 
no jurors had been chosen by friday afternoon 
2 live crew members maintain young and black jurors are needed 
for a fair trial because obscenity is defined by local community 
standards 
broward assistant state attorney pedro dijols who is black 
said the juror candidate vernard kinnel had identified himself as 
a 2 live crew fan 
i want the record to clearly reflect very clearly your 
honor this prosecutor is a black puerto rican and this prosecutor 
has heard an answer from mr kinnel that he is a fan of this 
particular group that we have on trial dijols told the judge 
thursday

motivated

from the first string of 25 potential jurors one was a middleaged 
black man 
the second group of 25 potential jurors was brought in friday 
afternoon and 11 had been eliminated by days end those remaining

the ambassador from rwanda says that refugees 
who have invaded the central african country appear to be backed by 
the ugandan government and have been receiving arms from fellow 
exiles based in the united states 
ambassador aloys uwimana said he asked us officials to assess 
the possibility of an invasion two years ago and they told him no 
movement was afoot several thousand armed refugees from the 
tutsi tribe invaded the country from uganda sept 30 and fighting 
continues 
uwimana was interviewed after the embassy released a statement 
thursday denying accusations that government soldiers have 
massacred hundreds of civilians belonging to the minority tutsi 
tribe which is also the tribe of ugandas president yoweri 
museveni 
uwimana said there is growing suspicion that ugandan leaders are 
behind the invasion by rwandan tutsis who have been living in 
uganda for two decades 
we dont want to directly charge the government of uganda but 
we recognize the facts the ambassador said 
the invaders are from a group of 250000 people who fled rwanda 
two decades ago after the majority hutu tribe took over rule of the 
country from the tutsi 
uwimana said about 15 rwandan tutsis representing the refugees 
in uganda are now based in the united states and have been involved 
in purchasing black market arms for the invading group 
state department spokesman mark dillen said friday that us

a usled international committee met a 
second time friday to discuss providing billions of dollars in 
economic aid to countries hurt by the persian gulf crisis but did 
not resolve several disputes dividing its members 
the threehour closeddoor meeting at the us treasury of 
representatives of 20 countries and international bodies was the 
second session of the gulf crisis financial coordination group 
president bush announced formation of the group on sept 25 
calling for a generous response from the world community to help 
countries hurt by the unsponsored embargo of iraq 
the administration believes its effort o isolate iraq might 
begin to crumble unless aid is funneled to countries who lost trade 
with iraq or who are coping with the flood of refugees produced by 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the coordinating group has been divided by such basic issues as 
how much money should be contributed and which countries should 
receive it 
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the group resolved several administrative issues in fridays 
meeting 
it agreed to rotate the location of the meetings and awarded the 
chairmanship of the group to treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
a state department official will serve as deputy chairman 
the next meeting was planned for rome during the first two weeks 
of november 
the official said the substantive issues athough discussed 
were not resolved but nevertheless described the meeting as quite 
successful however a senior treasury official shortly after the 
sept 26 session had said most of the unresolved matters would be 
cleared up before fridays meeting 
officials said previously that the united states would like to 
channel most of the aid to three front line states egypt 
jordan and turkey however saudi arabia and kuwait have complained 
that jordan is showing reluctance to support the trade embargo and 
therefore should not get help 
and some nations think the list of aid recipients should be 
expanded to include third world nations particularly hard hit by 
oil prices rising over 40 a barrel 
a world bank study had identified bangladesh india pakistan 
the philippines sri lanka and sudan as among the nations hardest 
hit 
there had also been disagreement over the amount of aid 
according to a german official the united states had been pushing 
for 145 billion while some european countries believed 9 
billion was a more realistic figure 
the nations participating with the united states in the 
coordinating group are japan germany great britain france 
canada italy saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates 
qatar south korea belgium the netherlands sweden and 
switzerland 
also participating are representatives of the 12nation european 
community the gulf cooperation council of persian gulf countries 
and the 154nation international monetary fund and its sister 
lending organization the world bank

the supreme court ruled friday that former 
dictator efrain rios montt and his running mates were not qualified 
to run for president in next months national elections 
chief justice edmundo vasquez martinez announced the courts 
decision which upheld an aug 22 ruling by the national election 
board that the constitution barred former dictators from running 
for office 
rios montt then a brigadier general took power after a 
military coup in march 1982 and ruled guatemala until august 1983 
when he was removed by another coup 
pending the courts ruling rios montt has campaigned hard and 
has been leading in polls for the nov 11 presidential race 
the court acting on an appeal by rios montts threeparty 
coalition had issued an injunction sept 12 ordering the election 
board to register the retired general as a candidate temporarily 
until it could hear arguments in the case 
in reversing the injunction vasquez martinez told a news 
conference the appeal lacked legal merit 
he said rios montts backers can still appeal to guatemalas 
constitutional court within 48 hours 
vasquez martinez said the ninemember court also barred rios 
montts running mate harris whitbeck pinol and the rest of his 
coalition ticket including candidates for legislator and a central 
american congress 
rios montts spokesman juan callejas said the coalition will 
take the case to the constitutional court 
we will appeal according to our plan callejas said in a 
telephone interview he said the publicity the case generated has 
been helping rios montts campaign 
we will win on the first round november 11 he said 
guatemalans seeking a strong hand in government have been 
turning to rios montt and his coalition of the united national 
front the institutional democratic party and the republican front 
polls show 
guatemala is troubled by an upsurge of violence and reports of 
official corruption and drug smuggling 
a bornagain christian rios montt was one of three officers 
asked by the armed forces to take over the country after the 1982 
coup that june he bounced the other two and named himself 
president 
while president he drew international condemnation by ordering 
the execution by firing squad of more than a dozen leftist 
guerrilla leaders military troops also were accused of conducting 
brutal campaign that left thousands of peasants dead in the 
northwest highlands 
the boards decision confirmed a supreme court opinion based on 
article 186 of guatemalas 1985 constitution 
according to that provision neither the head and leaders of a 
coup armed revolution or similar movement that has altered 
constitutional order nor those who have assumed the head of 
government as a result can run for president or vicepresident 
guatemalas 19 political parties are fielding a total of 13 
candidates for the presidential race if no candidate gets 50 
percent of the vote in november a runoff will be held jan 6 among 
the two top votegetters 
the winner will replace vinicio cerezo a centrist christian 
democrat voted in for a fiveyear term in january 1986 and only 
the second civilian president in more than three decades 
before cerezo guatemala was ruled by rightist military officers 
some elected and some placed in power through coups who have 
been battling a leftist insurrection since the early 1960s the 
only other civilian president was julio cesar mendez montenegro 
who served from 1966 to 1970 
the november balloting will also elect a vice president a 
national legislature about 300 municipal governments nationwide 
and deputies to a central american parliament to be created soon by 
guatemala nicaragua honduras el salvador and costa rica

top business leaders predicted friday 
that the us economy will stagnate during the second half of this 
year a minority said a recession is here or on the way 
the business councils fall forecast projected a nearly 
imperceptible 03 percent economic growth rate in the second half 
of 1990 and said oildriven inflation will climb to 61 percent 
before falling back below current levels 
onefourth of the corporate economists preparing the report 
foresee a recession a minority supported by several of the 
business council members 
as far as im concerned were in a phase of a recession 
said edmund t pratt jr chairman of pfizer inc 
asked whether he thought the nation ws in a recession lewis t 
preston chairman of jp morgan amp co replied i do 
the outlook for a short boost in inflation is based on the 
assumption there will be no war in the persian gulf 
the forecast was presented to the 100 leaders of the nations 
top corporations at their semiannual twoday meeting at this 
mountain resort 
preston a council vice chairman noted major differences 
between the councils forecast last spring and the current one 
the projections prepared by the 19 corporate economists for the 
may meeting predicted 2 percent economic growth in the second half 
of the year and 25 percent in 1991 the current expectation 
foresees just 03 percent growth in the second half 12 percent in 
the first half of 1991 and 26 percent in the second 
theres an even bigger change in mood on the part of the 
economists preston told reporters after suggesting moderate 
growth last may now by contrast theyre much more worried 
not worried enough in my judgment but much more worried 
indeed while only five of the 19 believe an economic downturn 
will occur in 1990s final quarter the panel has increased its 
recession risk assessment from 22 percent in its april survey to 39 
percent in its latest survey completed in september 
economists generally define a recession as two straight quarters 
of negative economic growth 
the probability of recession by midyear 1991 has increased 
from 29 percent to 47 percent their report said 
preston said the economists are virtually unanimous in thinking 
that the recent oil price hikes will not last 
thats because of the critical assumption of a decided 
majority that there either will be no persian gulf hostilities or 
that if hostilities do occur they will be relatively brief and not 
result in significant damage to oil field facilities he said 
because the consultants believe oil prices will come down 
significantly they do not at this point believe that what has 
happened to crude will have permanently distorting effect on the 
consumer price inex he added 
in their report the economists said they expect cpi inflation 
to reach 61 percent by years end and then slow to 45 percent in 
the first half of 1991 and to 42 percent in the second 
another council member allen e murray chairman of mobil 
corp told reporters he sees no petroleum shortages this winter 
and that crude oil prices which have doubled since the aug 2 iraqi 
invasion of kuwait will come down and come down hard 
this assumes no war he added 
other highlights of the council forecast included 
the economists expect economic weakness to be concentrated in 
housing consumer spending on durable goods and business 
investment 
industrial production will advance less than 1 percent between 
the middle of 1990 and the middle of 1991 before accelerating to a 
36 percent annual rate in the second half however orders sales 
and profits in the industrial sector will show little or no growth 
over the next six to nine months 
most of the council economists foresee continuing gradual 
improvement in the nations merchandise trade balance with the gap 
declining from 109 billion in 1989 to 98 billion in 1990 and 91 
billion in 1991

the west africans plan to install an interim government named by 
exiled and refugee liberian politicians business leaders and 
clergy taylor has named himself president of his own government

elections is a puppet of west african states 
ivory coasts support for taylor was the subject of a meeting 
last week between houphouetboigny and us ambassador donald 
petterson the top state department official for liberia 
diplomatic sources in abidjan said petterson tried to persuade 
houphouetboigny not to back calls for a withdrawal of the west 
african army 
the diplomats said the ivory coast leader surprised petterson by 
immediately telephoning six heads of states and inviting them to a 
summit 
ivory coast denies backing taylor though defense sources 
confirm ivorian police have escorted truckloads of weapons across 
ivory coasts western border into rebelheld liberian territory 
taylors fighters have overrun most of the country while a 
breakaway rebel faction led by prince johnson remains in monrovia 
along with remnants of slain president samuel does army

ignoring mounting opposition the military 
on friday enacted a decree that legalizes a balloting system in 
which the voters must stand in line behind the candidate of their 
choice 
the system that officials call open balloting will be used 
in local council elections in dec 8 to test the popularity of two 
political parties the government created to end military rule 
under the decree voters must arrive at polling booths by 11 
am and expect to spend the day there 
nigeria is africas most populous country with about 119 million 
residents 
the governments manipulation has made many voters apathetic 
critics say and waiting in line will only irritate them more 
creating a headache for police 
problems are expected particularly in the predominantly moslem 
northern states where religious leaders have said it would be 
unthinkable for male and female voters to line up together 
professor humphrey nwosu chairman of the national electoral 
commission said last month the system was chosen because it was 
something indigenous simple uncomplicated costeffective and 
credible 
voters will choose between candidates of the rightleaning 
national republican convention and leftofcenter social democratic 
party 
president gen ibrahim babangida created the two parties and 
wrote their manifestos last year after he banned all 13 independent 
groups seeking to contest promised 1992 general elections 
babangida said he wanted to do away with political groupings 
divided along tribal and religious lines and start from scratch 
but critics say civilian politicians have managed to evade 
babangidas intentions colonizing the created parties with their 
own personal agendas 
politicians representing the moslem north have essentaillly 
taken over the republican party these critics say while those 
representing the mostly christian and animist south occupied the 
social democratic party 
babangida seized power on aug 27 1985 the sixth military man 
to take power since nigerias independence from britain in 1960 
nigeria has not had a successful civilian government in that time

scientists detonated a nuclear weapon friday 
after a 2hour technical delay delivering a blast that was felt 
in las vegas high rises 105 miles from ground zero 
the weapon was up to 10 times more powerful than the atomic bomb 
that destroyed hiroshima 
fridays test was the seventh of the year and the third in three 
weeks at the sprawling nevada test site 
a 57 reading on the richter scale was recorded at the national 
earthquake information center in golden colo according to 
spokesman waverly person 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage 
if it occurs in a populated area 
department of energy spokesman jim boyer who monitored the test 
34 miles from ground zero said scientists seemed pleased with the 
results 
all i see is happy faces boyer said the situation 
appears normal everything looks real good 
the test codenamed tenabo was scheduled for 8 am but was 
delayed until 1030 am because of technical problems 
the test was put on hold until they checked out the 
mechanisms boyer said i dont have any details and i doubt if 
theyd tell me obviously it wasnt anything very serious 
the nuclear weapon was buried 2000 feet beneath pahute mesa 
about 105 miles northwest of las vegas 
doe monitors atop high rise buildings in las vegas said the 
blast was felt distinctly at the sahara rio and palace station 
hotels 
gilbert yarchever who has an apartment on the 25th floor of the 
regency towers a high rise building east of the las vegas strip 
said anything hanging moved 
the blast was listed as having an explosive force of 20000 to 
150000 tons of tnt the upper limit allowed by nuclear treaties 
with the soviet union 
the atomic bomb that destroyed hiroshima had an explosive force 
of 15000 tons 
managers of high rise buildings were warned by the doe that the 
explosion could cause some motion a standard warning given when a 
blast is expected near the upper limits 
the test was originally scheduled for thursday morning but was 
postponed because of winds blowing toward las vegas tests are 
called off if winds are blowing toward a populated area in case 
radioactive gases escape from the underground test area

hunters who paid thousands of dollars to 
gun down endangered animals left their names addresses and 
pictures of themselves with their kills as evidence game officials 
said friday 
it will be an officers dream to seek charges against the 
hunters state game ranger sam cottrell said we even have their 
pictures 
cottrell was one of more than two dozen federal and state agents 
who raided texoma hunting wilderness in southeastern oklahoma 
wednesday closing down the hunting range and confiscating piles of 
records and animal skins several live animals were seized 
it was pretty awful it was not much sport at all tom 
mckay senior resident agent for the us fish and wildlife 
service said friday 
mckay said each hunter paid from 1000 to 4000 to select an 
animal from a cage have it released onto a killing area about 
the size of a football field and shoot it 
among the native animals killed were grizzly bears black bears 
deer elk and cougars all of which are protected under federal or 
state laws 
mckay said the game refuge had a permit for the hunting of 
certain exotic animals such as foreign deer but that the permit 
excluded the native protected species 
records indicated most of the native animals had been brought in 
from other states mckay said transporting such an animal across 
state lines without a permit violates the federal lacy act 
conviction on such a charge could bring a penalty of five years 
in prison and a 250000 fine he said 
cottrell said that a brief examination of the records indicated 
that between 200 and 300 native animals had been killed at the 
preserve 
the 160acre preserve had been open for three or four years and 
apparently purchased animals from zoos preserves and at auctions 
officials said 
authorities also raided the home and office of the preserves 
owner charles b bartholomew of norman mckay said 
norman is about 20 miles south of oklahoma city in central 
oklahoma the hunting range was near bennington about 200 miles 
away 
authorities said it would take about a week to sift through the 
seized records and determine what federal and state charges to 
file and against whom 
besides bartholomew authorities are focusing on hunters and 
taxidermists named in the receipts

dow jones amp co publisher of the wall street 
journal is freezing budgets for capital spending and salaries and 
imposing other news and business cutbacks to cope with weak 
financial results and the sluggish economy 
the cuts announced in an internal memo to managers thursday 
followed weeks of rumors about a possible retrenchment and 
triggered concern over possible future layoffs at the media and 
financial industry giant 
dow jones earlier this week announced a 175 percent drop in 
thirdquarter profit reflecting a steady downturn attributed 
principally to the companys acquisition of the financial 
information service telerate inc 
dow jones also has been hurt by the recession plaguing wall 
street since the 1987 stock market crash 
operating income at dow jones business publications which 
include the journal and barrons weekly dropped 80 percent in the 
second quarter advertising linage at the journal dropped 16 
percent in the period 
the internal memo from dow jones chairman warren h phillips and 
publisher and president peter r kann freezes all capital 
expenditures immediately and holds all 1991 department budgets 
including total salary costs at 1990 levels accounting for 
inflation the budget cut would amount to more than 5 percent for 
1991 
the memo a copy of which was obtained friday also said dow 
jones will reduce management bonuses next year eliminate all 
temporary help try to eliminate all editorial staff relocations 
and reduce space devoted to news in the journal 
we have no reasons to believe that the deteriorating economic 
climate and business results weve been experiencing the past three 
months are aberrational the threepage memo said 
its likely we like many other companies in our industry 
will be facing adverse market conditions for most of our 
publications and services particularly in the us in 1991 it 
said thus its prudent for us to take steps now to reduce our 
costs further 
phillips and kann said the cuts were the preferred method of 
trimming our costs structure but said they could not guarantee 
that they would meet company goals thus we shouldnt be making 
any such promises to employees throughout the company the memo 
said 
the memo did not rule out layoffs fueling rumors at the journal 
and other dow jones units of forced reductions or closings of 
advertising locations or news bureaus 
i think what it means is fewer bodies said ronald chen a 
journal copy editor who heads the union representing about 2000 
dow jones employees 
executives say i dont think attrition is working chen 
said friday the only other thing we can think of is forced 
departures thats the kind of thing we see that worries us 
union members earlier this year ratified a threeyear contract 
providing for pay increases of 55 percent this year and 5 percent 
a year in 1991 and 1992 chen said the increases would not be 
affected by the announced cuts

iraq meanwhile said it may stop soviet detainees from 
returning home if they have knowledge of iraqi weapons systems the 
evacuation began sunday and iraq has promised to let at least 2000 
soviets leave 
us defense secretary dick cheney plans to ask soviet officials 
next week for intelligence data on the iraqi military which was 
armed largely by the soviet union 
there were signs that western impatience with the standoff was 
growing and that the usled forces arrayed in saudi arabia and 
elsewhere in the region could be sent to war to force iraq from 
kuwait

practice assault on the arabian coast soon as a trial run for a 
possible us invasion of kuwait a french magazine reported friday 
that us military officials have drawn up an offensive plan 
against iraq 
the us forces in the gulf area now total more than 200000 
including elements of two armored cavalry units that arrived this 
week the pentagon sources said officials indicated the buildup 
may be winding down 
the largest weapon used so far against iraq has been the trade 
embargo imposed by the united nations 
british prime minister margaret thatcher told her conservative 
party to be prepared for war if those sanctions fail 
we must hope they work she said in an address at the close 
of the partys annual conference in bournemouth england if not

20000 american lives it gave no estimate for dead of other 
nations 
us officials refused to comment in line with pentagon 
security rules

has said repeatedly that iraq will never withdraw 
however an iraqi opposition partyinexile said the iraqi 
ruling arab baath socialist party has circulated a questionnaire 
asking prominent members whether they believe iraq should pull out 
the claim by the kurdistan democratic partyiraq could not be 
independently confirmed if true it would represent an 
unprecedented quest for consensus by saddam 
saddam has declared kuwait to be iraqs 19th province and iraqi 
forces have encircled and cut off supplies to diplomatic missions 
since ordering them closed on aug 24 
diplomats from nations that oppose the aug 2 invasion have 
tried to hold out but are slowly abandoning the embassies for lack 
of food and intolerable living conditions electricty and water 
have been shut off to most of them

diplomats in the german embassy drove from kuwait to baghdad on 
thursday zdf television a german station said the group included 
the ambassador and his wife along with three staff members 
the foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said they had run out of food

russian president boris n yeltsin who made his 
political comeback by railing against official privileges found 
himself facing the issue friday on his first day back at work after 
a car crash 
yeltsin limping slightly officially resumed work at the 
russian republic parliament by opening a committee meeting he had 
been hurt in a road accident sept 12 near his office and had been 
recovering at home tass reported 
the accident stirred debate in the russian parliament over 
giving the republic leader a special car for safer transportation 
he had been riding in a sovietbuilt volga sedan 
after the accident russian officials ordered four armorplated 
luxury cars for yeltsin and his prime minister ivan silayev from 
gorky auto works plant but the plant refused saying it only made 
such cars for national leaders 
british newspapers last week reported yeltsin would swap his car 
for an armorplated mercedes benz russian republic officials 
quickly denied the report saying they had received no such offer 
the latest wrinkle came friday when the labor newspaper trud 
reported the konaly motor works east of moscow which makes armored 
vans for banks has offered to build safe comfortable cars for 
yeltsin and his prime minister ivan silayev 
as the recent accident shows an armorplated car today is not 
only a luxury but also a means a safe transportation trud said 
the newspaper did not say whether yeltsin accepted the offer 
and tass did not way whether yeltsin made any comment about it at 
the parliament 
yeltsin has stressed his connection with ordinary people by 
riding in buses and ordinary cars riding a populist appeal he 
made his political comeback this year came after denunciation in 
1987 by president mikhail s gorbachev for demanding faster 
reforms

a man with aids forced an 8yearold 
relative to have oral sex the child and a prosecutor told jurors 
friday in a test case of a new state law 
randall lee dempsey 34 of rural marion is charged with 
criminal transmission of the hiv virus and aggravated criminal 
sexual assault he has pleaded innocent to the charges 
the case is believed the first test of the states new criminal 
hiv transmission law which took effect sept 11 1989 
this is a classic case of child sex abuse in the family 
setting but there is one unique and quite dangerous element to 
this case williamson county states attorney charles garnati 
said in his opening statement 
he dempsey did so after testing positive for the hiv virus 
and he did so after being told by his own doctor that he was 
infected with the hiv virus 
the defense made no opening statement friday 
under the law the attacker must know he is carrying the aids 
virus when he performs an act such as sexual intercourse which 
would expose someone to the virus conviction does not require that 
the victim develop aids 
it is not known if the boy has been tested for the virus 
lawyers say they are bound by state law not to discuss the case 
outside the courtroom 
if convicted dempsey faces up to seven years in prison on the 
transmission charge and up to 30 years on the assault charge he 
was being held in the williamson county jail on 50000 bond 
garnati said dempsey returned to marion from california to live 
with his parents after becoming ill blood tests dempsey underwent 
for the hiv virus in december turned up positive 
the defendants mother will tell you that the defendant never 
really did accept the fact that he was infected with the hiv 
virus garnati told the jury 
garnati told jurors that on may 27 the child slept in the same 
bed with dempsey and that dempsey forced the youth to have oral 
sex against the boys objections 
the boy told a relative the next morning despite dempseys 
promise to give him a pet turtle to keep quiet garnati said 
how did a little 8yearold boy know how to describe something 
like that garnati asked 
the only conclusion is that he is telling the truth and that 
man did it he said pointing at dempsey 
the boy now 9 answered attorneys with short sentences and 
appeared cheerful throughout fridays testimony 
in his crossexamination public defender larry broeking asked 
the boy about statements he made to his father denying that abuse 
occurred but under garnatis questioning the child insisted 
dempsey assaulted him 
after testifying the boy waved happily to dempsey and climbed 
down from the witness stand 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the bodys defenses 
against disease leaving a person prey to lifethreatening 
infections and certain cancers 
the fatal incurable disease is spread by a virus transmitted 
mainly through sexual intercourse shared hypodermic needles and 
from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth 
in infected people the aids virus is found in blood and semen

the nations first laws restricting 
air pollutants in household goods could force some products off 
store shelves and raise the costs of others manufacturers said 
friday 
but the states largest consumer group said thursdays sweeping 
decision by the state air resources board is very fair and will 
be absorbed into the economy providing a better quality of life 
the board which enforces air quality standards and sets 
emission levels ordered a 45 percent cut in household 
hydrocarbons the smogforming pollutants in 16 types of products 
the products include hair sprays floor wax window cleaners 
furniture polish engine degreasers tile cleaners hair mousses 
and gels laundry prewash insect repellents aerosol shaving 
creams nail polish removers oven cleaners windshield washer 
fluids and room airfresheners 
the regulations would remove about 45 tons of hydrocarbons daily 
from the atmosphere an amount equivalent to the pollutants spewed 
by 14 million automobiles the board said 
the new rules will be phased in over five years beginning in 
1993 and mark the first time air pollution from household products 
has been ordered reduced the decision also reflects the boards 
desire to target consumerproduct pollution a departure from the 
panels traditional role of regulating automobile and industrial 
pollution 
we hope we can make the changes in the time required but in 
some cases we dont know said ralph engel head of the chemical 
specialties manufacturers association it will cause some pain 
and it will close some products 
among those that could be forced off the shelves are engine 
degreasers and aerosolpropelled air fresheners because technology 
is not yet available to enable those products to meet the boards 
standards engel said 
his organization represents 426 companies including 
manufacturers of household cleaners disinfectants beauty aids and 
automotive cleaners virtually every product covered by the order 
california accounts for about 12 percent of the companies sales 
the state estimated the regulations could increase costs from a 
penny to 23 cents per product 
however engel said the increases could reach seven times the 
boards estimate and other industry reresentatives said the cost 
of reformulating the compounds would likely drive retail prices up 
harry snyder executive director of consumers union of 
california the states largest consumers group disagreed 
the industry estimates are always 10 times to 100 times higher 
than what the additional costs actually are snyder said 
whatever cost increase there is will be absorbed by the economy 
this is the kind of thing consumers have been asking for and are 
willing to pay for 
the chemical industry cant figure a way to make money off 
these regulations none of them have been willing to sell safety 
he said 
the regulations the most comprehensive in the nation stem from 
a 1988 california law requiring a crackdown on hydrocarbons in 
consumer goods 
for example hair spray the largest producer of household 
hydrocarbons has an average hydrocarbon content of about 94 
percent for aerosol sprays and 70 percent for pump sprays by 1998 
the maximum level of hydrocarbons allowed in hair sprays would be 
55 percent 
windshield washer fluids have the secondhighest rate and room 
airfresheners the third 
products in the 16 categories emit about 100 tons of 
hydrocarbons a day the boards ruling would reduce those emissions 
to about 45 tons by 1998

animal activists protesting a 
statesponsored deer hunt this weekend will challenge a new 
hunterharassment law by making noise to try to frighten off the 
deer their attorney said 
we think it should be proper to make noises in order to alert 
the deer of possible harm boca raton lawyer barry silver said 
thursday 
the activists who have a state permit to gather on a roadside 
also will protest the permits noise restrictions which silver 
said violate freespeech rights 
the activists were to gather saturday outside the camp blanding 
wildlife management area while the hunters are inside the annual 
youth deer hunt in which parents and guardians teach children aged 
8 to 15 to hunt safely is sponsored by the states game and fresh 
water fish commission 
lt jim huffstodt of the game commission said protesters will be 
in a designated area about onequarter to onehalf mile from the 
nearest hunting site 
huffstodt said game officers will enforce a state law that took 
effect on oct 1 that prohibits interfering with hunting trapping 
and fishing and disturbing fish and game animals 
silver said the protesters consider the law vague 
unconstitutional and unfair it seems to us unfair not to be able 
to protect an animal but perfectly legal to destroy it he said 
the protesters are seeking to challenge restrictions placed on a 
permit they received from the florida department of transportation 
don quilio the departments assistant district maintenance 
engineer in lake city said he was surprised to learn that the 
permit prohibited shouting and would remove that restriction if the 
protesters ask him to do so 
but he said he stands by the restrictions against noisemakers 
and any type of noise pollution because airhorns and other 
unusual noises could confuse drivers of passing vehicles

a supermarket manager unleashed a 
terrible anguished cry after he shot a woman he apparently 
mistook for a deer his hunting companion testified friday 
donald rogerson the manager of a supermarket produce 
department was hunting in the woods behind karen woods suburban 
home on nov 15 1988 thinking he saw a deer he fired his rifle 
mrs wood was hit in the chest and died 
a grand jury cleared rogerson but a second grand jury indicted 
him on a manslaughter charge he went on trial tuesday in penobscot 
county superior court in bangor and has pleaded innocent 
the prosecution contends rogerson acted negligently or 
recklessly when he shot mrs wood 37 who was standing behind her 
home in the bangor suburb of hermon she had just moved from iowa 
to maine with her husband and yearold twin girls 
authorities said rogerson was about 180 feet from her when he 
fired defense attorneys contend the shooting was an accident 
the case triggered a fierce public debate over hunting in a 
state where 216476 people bought hunting licenses last year and 
30260 deer were killed peter anderson said he was hunting a short 
distance from rogerson when he heard a shot and moments later 
heard a terrible terrible anguished cry 
i heard cries of oh no no anderson said 
anderson said he ran over and saw rogerson kneeling beside mrs 
wood he quoted rogerson as saying ive shot a human being oh 
god why does god allow this to happen 
anderson said he was afraid rogerson was so distraught he might 
try to kill himself with his rifle 
he also quoted rogerson as saying why did she have to have 
white mittens i saw white mittens i thought it was a deer 
flag 
on thursday prosecutors introduced into evidence the mittens 
found near mrs woods body inspector gary sargent of the maine 
warden service identified the mittens which are white with brown 
leather palms and said they were about the same size as an 
upraised deer tail 
but he added that they were only about half the size of the 
white area that is visible on the backside of a running deer which 
comprises both the underside of the tail and the animals rump

a new proposed compromise for reregulating 
cable tv would require the industry to sell network programs to 
some 3 million mostly rural owners of backyard satellite dishes 
its senate sponsors said friday 
providing details of an accord negotiated over the past two 
weeks sens al gore dtenn and timothy wirth dcolo said 
cable networks could still restrict their programs to subscribers 
of local cable distributors 
but gore said the compromise also now includes critical 
language protecting the backyard home satellite dish market a 
provision that cable operators have vigorously fought the past 
eight years 
the war for satellite television dish owners has been won 
gore said 
however he acknowledged that the bill could still be stymied in 
the waning days of the 101st congress by objections from no more 
than a handful of colleagues and the bush administration 
to those who would continue to block its consideration on 
behalf of the cable industry or the white house i would only say 
that such a move would backfire he said threatening to sponsor 
a tougher bill next year 
wirth said some of the provisions very damaging to the 
cable industry which is headquartered in denver were changed in 
the compromise after the bill was pulled from the senate floor last 
month in response to his threat of a filibuster then 
im not happy with every aspect of it but important 
concessions were made on both sides and i believe the result is 
both workable and fair he said 
wirth described the new provision on backyard satellite dishes 
as a recognition that their primarily rural market is in areas 
that cable and broadcasters cannot now serve and are unlikely to be 
able to serve in the future 
both the senate bill and a similar measure passed by the house 
last month would require cable operators to provide a basic 
tier of service local and public tv stations plus 
governmentaccess channels at rates to be regulated by the 
federal communications commission 
rates for cable network programs such as cable news network mtv 
or espn would not be regulated unless anticompetitive abuses could 
be demonstrated rates for premium programming such as home box 
office and cinemax would remain deregulated 
the legislation is a response to many consumer complaints about 
excessive rates and poor service in many areas after the industry 
was deregulated by congress in 1986

king hassan ii on friday showed support 
for saddam husseins efforts to link the palestinian uprising to 
any iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
he told parliament the iraqi president had succeeded in linking 
the two issues in international opinion and that this gives saddam 
an honorable way to pull his troops out of kuwait without 
losing face 
this step is sufficient and has woken up the international 
conscience about a solution to the palestinian problem hassan 
said 
iraq invaded the small oilrich emirate on aug 2 
the monarch urged saddam not to push the link too far he 
advised him to rapidly pull out of kuwait while settling for a 
moral engagement by the world regarding the palestinians 
thus the iraqi president will spare the arab nation a war 
that will destroy not only its military potential but its economic 
industrial and agriculture infrastructure the king said 
hassan said israel would profit from such a war 
morocco is one of the few arab countries to have contributed 
troops a token deployment of 1200 men to the usled 
multinational force defending saudi arabia and tightening the 
united nations embargo against iraq and occupied kuwait 
saddam and the palestine liberation organization have said any 
withdrawal from kuwait must be accompanied by an israeli pullout 
from the occupied west bank and gaza strip captured by israel from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the demands gained heightened world interest this week after 
israeli police killed 19 palestinian rioters and wounded 140 at the 
temple mount in jerusalem sacred to both jews and moslems 
arab league sources reported friday that morocco agreed to a plo 
call for an urgent meeting next week to discuss a common arab 
response to the killings

a hospital said friday it was reviewing an 
incident in which a mentally ill woman gave birth in a tree planter 
after being kicked out of an emergency room because she was causing 
a disturbance 
were reviewing the case and its probably going to take a 
little while because it involved more than one agency dc 
general hospital spokeswoman ann chisholm said 
hospital officials declined further comment 
two police officers who heard priscilla jones screaming in the 
tree planter early sept 9 helped her give birth to a 3pound 
5ounce boy police said 
the homeless woman had falsely claimed to be pregnant on many 
occasions over the last three or four years according to victoria 
roberts administrator of luther place shelter where jones 
sometimes lived 
jones is heavyset known for violent outbursts and frequent 
claims of pregnancy and it may not have been apparent she was 
pregnant 
no one believed her even most of our workers until a month 
before she actually delivered when we had a sonogram done 
roberts said 
the night before the birth jones walked to the shelter in 
obvious distress roberts said 
it was very obvious she was in labor she said the two 
women who called an ambulance told them that her contractions were 
about five minutes apart what we dont know is whether the 
ambulance crew conveyed that information to the hospital 
jones has lived on the streets for about 10 years her violent 
rages and pregnancy claims probably are known to employees of a 
number of groups who operate services for the homeless several 
police officers and possibly the paramedics to arrived to help 
roberts said 
the ambulance drivers probably recognized her weve had to 
call police because she has been violent in the past she said 
emergency room officials escorted her out after she began 
screaming jones walked about a block and gave birth roberts said 
sgt joseph goodwin and officer patricia newkirk were driving by 
in their patrol car when they heard the womans shrieks police 
said after the baby was born they took the woman and child back 
to the hospital where they were admitted 
the baby remained at dc general on friday and luther place 
workers were trying to convince jones to move into the shelter 
robert said 
she is severely ill and very resistant to help and this has 
been very traumatic for her she said clearly mistakes have 
been made we have a health care system that is simply overloaded 
and not able to deal with the reality of the situation

the soviet government friday announced it was 
taking urgent steps to fight organized crime and black 
marketeering which have spread rapidly as private businesses have 
opened across the country 
the decree by the council of ministers or cabinet said law 
enforcement agencies will receive better material and technical 
supplies and new staff the official soviet news agency tass 
reported 
in addition special units of the kgb will be set up to combat 
organized crime and a law enforcement center will be established 
to coordinate the activities of the kgb interior ministry police 
and other agencies 
president mikhail s gorbachev had promised on wednesday that he 
would propose tough measures that will represent a powerful 
weapon in the hands of law enforcers and authorities 
as gorbachev has edged the country from a centrally planned to a 
marketbased economy protection rackets have preyed on fledgling 
small businesses black marketeers have also dealt in an 
everwidening circle of goods ranging from cigarettes at 5 a pack 
to personal computers at 42500 
the decree appeared aimed at such activity which is widely 
resented by ordinary citizens who scrape by on salaries averaging 
425 a month 
but it also seemed to be part of a conservative backlash against 
economic reforms and an attempt to inject discipline into the 
crumbling central planning system 
many soviet entrepreneurs operate in legal gray areas buying 
materials at subsidized state prices and selling finished products 
for as much money as people will pay 
such activity would be legal in westen countries but is 
branded as speculation or profiteering by some soviet officials 
the decree could bring a crackdown on numerous cooperative 
businesses from restaurants to dressmakers and small construction 
firms which buy and sell goods without government approval 
on sept 27 gorbachev issued a related decree threatening to 
fine businesses that fail to fulfill goverment contracts the move 
was widely viewed by soviets as an attempt to bolster the central 
planning system at a time when many factories and farms are trying 
to bypass moscow and trade directly with each other 
gorbachevs initiatives have sometimes appeared contradictory 
he has both advocated transition to a market system and tried to 
keep the old economic system running he has declared allegiance to 
the socialist ideal while also calling himself a radical 
and a pragmatist 
tass provided few details on the law and order decree it did 
not say how many personnel would be added to law enforcement 
agencies whether the agencies budgets would rise or what tactics 
they would use

the security council reached broad 
agreement friday night on a resolution condemning israel for the 
police killing of 19 palestinians and asking a un investigation 
into the deaths diplomats said 
colombian ambassador enrique penalosa a member of the security 
council said there is general agreement on a resolution and 
that members hoped for a meeting and vote soon 
we expect a unanimous vote said yemeni ambassador mohammed 
abdulaziz sallam we are pleased with the condemnation and the 
call for action 
informal closed consultations were delayed while delegates 
sought approval from their governments on the latest draft 
the agreement would avert a us veto of a harsher plo 
resolution condemning israel and would preserve the fragile usled 
coaltion against iraq that would have been jeopardized by a us 
veto 
the accord reached after five days of marathon negotiations and 
us lobbying indicated the nonaligned movement had split on the 
issue and was not wholehertedly in the camp of the palestine 
liberation organization 
the plo said it still objected to the latest draft one of at 
least four documents the past four days but the plo appeared to be 
isolated 
the plo resisted a moderate draft resolution backed by the 
united states britain and others which condemned israels use of 
force on the temple mount in jerusalem last monday but also 
parceled out blame to palestinian stonethrowers 
palestinians on the mount were hurling rocks down on jews 
praying at the western wall or wailing wall when police 
intervened and later began shooting 
the draft resolution also asked the un secretarygeneral to 
send a mission to investigate the violence and report its 
conclusions about ensuring the safety of palestinians in the 
occupied territories 
its time to fish or cut bait us ambassador thomas r 
pickering told reporters friday on entering the council chamber 
the united states was bent on avoiding using its veto power 
fearing a veto could endanger us credibility in the arab world 
and undermine the usled coalition against iraq 
its drafting of a tough resolution condemning israeli security 
forces was a rare gesture against its israeli ally and marked a 
significant shift america commonly shields israel in the security 
council by vetoing condemnations 
the plo rejected the us resolution as too weak and insisted 
there be no criticism of palestinian stonethrowers 
it initially sought a threeman security council mission that 
would make recommendations on how to protect palestinians in the 
occupied territories 
israel had rejected such a mission in advance as infringing on 
its sovereignty 
the security council includes five permanent members with veto 
power the united states britain china france and the soviet 
union the 10 other members are canada colombia cuba ethiopia 
finland ivory coast malaysia romania yemen zaire

jean marie le pen leader of the extreme rightwing 
national front party sent an open letter friday to french troops 
in the persian gulf region asking them to consider why they are 
there 
for what reasons have our troops intervened far from our 
borders when our vital interests are not threatened wrote le 
pen a paratrooper in the algerian war for independence in the 
1950s 
president francois mitterrand has dispatched about 13000 french 
soldiers airmen and sailors to the gulf to enforce the un 
embargo against iraq and occupied kuwait 
the contrast between the insufficience not to say mediocrity 
of your salaries compared to the opulence of the arab potentates 
and international companies for whom youve been sent to fight 
shocks many french people le pen told the soldiers 
le pen who favors expelling moslem immigrants from france has 
been one of the few major french political figures to criticize 
mitterrands policy in the gulf 
political observers believe le pen hopes to pick up support if 
the gulf crisis becomes a greater burden for france the national 
front has scored about 15 percent in national opinion polls

the senate late friday approved 20 million in 
new us humanitarian aid to cambodia an apparent replacement for 
the past policy of covert aid to rebels fighting the phnom penh 
government 
senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla 
argued that aid to noncommunist resistance forces should be given 
openly and through humanitarian channels 
it is healthy for us to provide this aid in this form 
boren said this is a policy question that should not be 
discussed behind closed doors it givss us an opportunity to 
involve the american people in an open public discussion of this 
matter 
borens committee voted earlier this year to end the 13 million 
program of covert aid to the noncommunist resistance which is 
allied with the dreaded khmer rouge in seeking to oust the 
vietnambacked communist government 
the khmer rouge ran cambdodia from 1975 until its government was 
ousted by a vietnamese invasion in 1979 it killed more than a 
million of its own citizens 
there is a strong likelihood that in the past some of the 
funds from the united states may have been used directly or 
indirectly to benefit the khmer rouge and its time we had 
restrictions that are enforceable boren said 
opponents of current us policy say the covert aid has helped 
improve the fortunes of the khmer rouge 
this is the killing fields said sen john danforth rmo 
the khmer rouge are still an active organization with pol pot 
their ruthless leader still in control and their methods if 
anything have become more sophisticated in their evil 
the 20 million aid figure apparently was arrived at by 
combining the 13 million covert program with a 7 million overt 
humanitarian program 
senators added the cambodia aid directive to a 153 billion 
foreign aid bill for the fiscal year that began oct 1 as they 
began sorting through a series of proposed amendments 
work on the bill was not expected to be completed until monday 
and then it must go to a housesenate conference committee to work 
out differences between competing versions 
at the same time the senate also voted to strip from the bill a 
provision that would have given 15 million to the united nations 
population fund an agency which conducts family planning programs 
in 138 countries worldwide 
on a vote of 5138 the senate failed to come up with the 60 
votes needed to cut off a filibuster threatened by abortion 
opponents they contended that the un agency should get no money 
because it operates in china whose onechildperfamily policy 
leads to forced abortions and sterilizations 
the united states should not be involved either directly or 
indirectly with such grievous violations of human rights argued 
sen gordon humphrey rnh 
president bush vetoed last years version of the foreign aid 
bill over a similar provision forcing congress to back down

the soviet kgb helped spark last years 
revolutions in eastern european to put progorbachev reform 
communists in power former kgb double agent oleg gordievsky said 
friday 
but the secret agents and their communist party bosses never 
expected the outpouring of anticommunist fervor that followed and 
they were helpless to stop it he said 
here they just lost because they wanted it to stop and it was 
impossible to stop the momentum it was too late said 
gordievsky who worked as a double agent for 13 years until he 
defected to britain in 1985 
gordievsky did not say where he learned about the alleged kgb 
involvement in eastern europes tumult he said he regularly meets 
us government officials and analysts and is a consultant of the 
journal intelligence and national security 
dressed immaculately in a doublebreasted suit the bespectacled 
gordievsky who turned 52 on wednesday was without his redhaired 
wig and beard disguise a security precaution to foil wouldbe kgb 
assassins 
in an interview at a london hotel he talked animatedly about 
his defection which sparked a titfortat expulsion of 31 soviet 
and 31 british diplomats trade representatives and journalists 
despite the goodwill of soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
perestroika and glasnost gordievsky would still face a death 
sentence in the soviet union 
the feelings of irritation evil and unpleasant feelings of 
jealousy and revenge in the kgb and among other traditional soviet 
communist apparatchiks is still the same he said 
gordievsky who said his father and brother were both kgb 
agents became a double agent for the british while posted in 
copenhagen in the early 1970s he said as a result of his 
disillusionment over the 1968 soviet invasion of czechoslovakia 
i knew that all the purges all the brutal brutal repressions 
were true what khrushchev said in his secret speech to the 20th 
party congress was just the tip of the iceberg incredible crimes 
had been committed gordievsky said 
the former spy was transferred to london becoming one of the 
top kgb agents in britain until he was recalled to moscow and 
questioned about his activities 
gordievsky eluded his kgb tail and escaped to the west where he 
has coauthored kgb the inside story to be published in 
britain and the united states on oct 19 
the kgb looked to gorbachev to provide the dynamism and 
discipline necessary to break out of the soviet unions economic 
stagnation and establish a stable correlation of forces with the 
west said excerpts of the book that appeared in saturdays issue 
of the times 
in the months before communist party general secretary 
konstantin chernenkos longexpected death in march 1985 the kgb 
put great care into briefing gorbachev in a way that would allow 
him to impress the rest of the politburo with his grasp of soviet 
and world affairs 
his election as general secretary in march 1985 was not of 
course due wholly or even mainly to support from the kgb but the 
center the kgbs moscow headquarters saw the election 
nonetheless as a major victory 
the books coauthor cambridge university historian christopher 
andrew said despite soviet attempts to discredit gordievsky he 
was in a unique position to know what went on inside lubyanka the 
kgbs headquarters 
oleg kalugin the youngest general in the kgb first chief 
directorate said gordievsky carried away from the first chief 
directorate virtually everything that could be carried away 
its a metaphor for simply saying he knew a helluva lot andrew 
said in an interview 
kgb the inside story reportedly reveals kgb involvement in 
the shooting down of the korean airlines flight 007 in 1983 which 
killed 269 people 
andrew said gordievsky was in london at the time and received a 
series of kgb instructions about the incident 
the book reportedly identifies some key us officials who 
worked sometimes unwittingly for the kgb and the identity of the 
infamous fifth man it is widely believed that a fifth spy worked 
with guy burgess donald maclean anthony blunt and kim philby 
prominent britons who were recruited by the kgb from cambridge 
university 
gordievsky said the fifth man was a member of the british 
intelligence community

interior minister wolfgang schaeuble 
who guided negotiations of the treaty that linked the two german 
states was shot and seriously wounded late friday at a campaign 
gathering police said 
schaeuble 48 was struck by two bullets in the head and chest 
and seriously wounded but his life was not immediately in danger 
interior ministry spokesman roland bachmeier said other reports 
said one bullet hit schaeuble in the neck 
police arrested a 37yearold suspect who comes from the 
criminal drug scene the zdf television network reported 
the interior ministry in bonn said the gunman had been 
undergoing treatment for schizophrenia ard television identified 
him only as dieter k and said he used a revolver in the shooting 
ralf krueger head of the badenwuerttemberg state criminal 
office said there was no evidence the suspect had a terrorist 
background and that he probably acted alone police denied an 
early report that two others involved in the 10 pm shooting had 
fled 
schaeuble is a member of chancellor helmut kohls inner circle 
and was considered a possible successor to the chancellor as 
interior minister he was responsible for many police functions 
including drug probes but not investigating terrorism 
the attack at a restaurant in oppenau in the offenburg 
district outside freiburg in southwest germany was the most 
serious incident since east and west germany reunited on oct 3 
schaeuble was rushed to the hospital in offenburg for treatment 
about 9 miles west of where the attack took place police said 
a security guard who threw himself in front of schaeuble was 
wounded in the stomach according to the interior ministry 
schaeuble was named interior minister by kohl in april 1989 
replacing former minister eduard zimmermann previously schaeuble 
was kohls chief of staff 
a popular boyishlooking figure he has been a member of kohls 
christian democratic union party since 1966 and a strong backer of 
kohls successful efforts to unite the two germanys 
following his smooth handling of negotiations that led up to 
unification schaeuble had been tipped as a future christian 
democrat candidate for chancellor 
many germans recall schaeubles emotional announcement to 
parliament last nov 30 that deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen 
the nations top banker had been killed in a bomb blast 
violent attacks on top politicians have been rare in postwar 
german history although top businessmen have been terrorist 
targets 
schaeuble is said to be one of germanys most heavily protected 
politicians 
after the shooting the suspect was wrestled to the ground by 
members of the ministers entourage until he could be handcuffed by 
police according to ard 
it quoted a munichbased journalist at the scene as saying 
schaeuble was able to speak before being taken to the hospital 
one of schaeubles teenaged daughters witnessed the attack 
said olga piess who was at the restaurant 
the shooting was the most serious attack on a public figure in 
germany since april 25 when an apparently deranged woman stabbed 
social democratic leader oskar lafontaine in the neck during a 
campaign stop in cologne 
lafontaine kohls leading challenger in the december election 
returned to the campaign trail after leaving the hospital weeks 
later

its methodical sixhour journey to its launch pad 34 miles away 
once in place saturday morning nasa crews will make final 
preparations for atlantis launch on nov 7 or nov 8 carrying a

17inch diameter plumbing line which had contaminated seals 
after repairing the leak shuttle crews began to reassemble the 
craft but were interrupted by another setback a 70pound 
scaffolding beam left by workers in the engine compartment 
damaged fuel lines as the orbiter was hoisted upright

a 3yearold texas girl unable to digest food 
was discharged from the hospital friday nearly three months after 
undergoing a liver and small intestine transplant 
on her return home her first meal of all things was airplane 
food 
tracey kay gonzales of corpus christi received a new liver and 
small intestine in a 14hour operation in july her doctors say her 
success will clear the way for transplants on others with 
lifethreatening intestinal defects 
the toddlers quick recovery won her a trip home she left the 
hospital early friday and after weeks of hospital food and an 
occasional meal away from the medical center she graduated to 
airline food 
shell eat anything said traceys mother pam most of 
the time shes talking about food take me here or take me there 
to eat 
bessie peters in the billing department of the airlines 
caterer said passengers aboard traceys plane were served omelets 
with cheddar cheese or turkey muffins or croissants and orange 
juice and milk 
when she arrived at the corpus christi airport tracey rushed to 
see her two brothers gary 10 and tommy 8 whom she last saw in 
april 
she told them the first thing she wanted to do was to play 
football however doctors have said tracey will not be able to 
play contact sports 
before undergoing surgery the girl suffered from short gut 
syndrome in which the small intestine was too short to process 
food sufficiently she sustained liver damage on a highprotein 
diet fed intravenously 
before the transplant she was eating she has taste buds her 
body just couldnt do anything with it childrens hospital 
spokeswoman sue cardillo said friday 
tracey will return to pittsburgh on oct 21 to begin outpatient 
treatment 
while shes home doctors will watch for signs of infection or 
rejection tracey is taking the experimental drug fk506 which 
doctors say is safer and more potent than the common antirejection 
drug cyclosporin 
the drug made traceys operation possible and the survival of 
two other transplant patients on fk506 will make surgery possible 
for others said transplant pioneer dr thomas starzl 
the bottom line is that intestinal transplants are going to be 
practical and are going to be widely used starzl said 
smallintestine transplants have a poor success rate since 
1983 one adult and three children have died within a year of their 
surgeries at pittsburgh hospitals one adult and a teenager are 
still alive 
the small intestine transplanted into tracey works just like her 
own would have if it had been healthy with muscles moving the food 
down the digestive tract 
its a little bit surprising there were studies that 
suggested that that might not be possible starzl said 
while she had her dysfunctional old liver tracey retained water 
and looked chubby thursday night at the hospital dr jorge reyes 
said doctors would gauge traceys recovery by the amount of water 
loss and muscle gain 
part of the assessment is to see how her swelling is coming 
down and how her lean muscle mass is building up said reyes 
another of the girls surgeons 
since the surgery is new its difficult to measure progress he 
said 
her postoperative time was relatively uneventful and she 
recovered in good time but theres really nothing for a base to 
compare it to reyes said

police stepped up security in cairo and put airports on alert 
after the shootings

moussa warned before the vote that iraqis and other arabs had 
infiltrated egypt to undermine the government through terror 
attacks including assassinations egypt has led arab opposition to 
iraqs aug 2 occupation of kuwait

palestinian terrorists sent to egypt by iraq on sabotage missions

palestinians of the abu nidal group 
abu nidal real name sabry elbanna leads a radical 
palestinian faction and is known worldwide as a terrorist

the orange county grand jury indictment against bj west was 
sealed but her attorney bob leventhal said it contained felony 
charges of grand theft and official misconduct the orlando

the presidents of eight latin american 
countries agreed friday to create a fund from windfall oil earnings 
that would be used to help latin countries suffering from low 
prices for other raw materials 
the fund was proposed by the leaders of mexico venezuela and 
colombia all oil producers later the summit of eight presidents 
who met here thursday and friday ordered consultations on how to 
create the fund 
host president carlos andres perez said the fund aims at 
stabilizing prices for traditional latin american exports such as 
oil copper coffee and sugar 
all of latin american nations are recurrently affected by 
dramatic ups and downs in prices of its exports one day it is oil 
next it is sugar and copper perez said at a news conference 
the idea of the fund would be to soften the fall of countries 
whose commodities suffer price swings but it wasnt immediately 
clear how the plan would be carried out 
the eight presidents later released a communique promising to 
intensify their fight against drug trafficking but warning their 
efforts would be useless if rich countries did not curb demand 
a global strategy is needed in the fight against drugs the 
presidents said 
earlier in the week chilean president patricio aylwin proposed 
that oilproducing countries donate some of their export earnings 
when oil prices were especially high 
on friday perez and presidents carlos salinas de gortari of 
mexico and cesar gaviria of colombia proposed the initiative be 
extended to include donations from earnings for other raw products 
such as coffee and sugar 
in practice however oil is one of the few raw materials to 
produce windfall income in recent decades venezuela is likely to 
get at least 24 billion in extra revenue thanks to soaring oil 
prices since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
perez did not explain how the fund would operate or how much 
money would be invested he said all nations would contribute in 
order to receive benefits 
while oil exporters like mexico ecuador and venezuela are 
theoretically favored by skyrocketing oil prices experience has 
shown that oil boom periods result in severe inflation and economic 
destabilization 
several weeks ago perez announced venezuela would create a 
stabilization fund with its extra oil revenue to avoid inflationary 
pressures venezuela has been forced to submit its economy to an 
austerity plan since the last oil boom bubble bust 
the current oil prices dont do anyone any good neither 
producers nor consumers ecuadoran president rodrigo borja said 
thursday 
in addition to borja perez mexicos salinas del gortari 
gaviria of colombia and chiles aylwin the presidents attending 
the summit were carlos menem of argentina fernando collor de mello 
of brazil and luis alberto lacalle of uruguay 
peru is also a member of the rio group but president alberto 
fujimori failed to win congressional authorization to leave his 
country and instead sent a delegation headed by his wife 
the presidents decided friday to expand the group to include 
bolivia and paraguay and to invite one representative each from 
central america and another from the caribbean 
venezuela mexico colombia ecuador and trinidad and tobago 
together produce over 58 million barrels of oil daily 
the other latin countries are net oil importers whose economies 
have been badly hit by high oil prices 
along with the energy crisis the main subject of the latin 
summit was a proposal by president bush to create a hemispheric 
freetrade zone from alaska to patagonia 
bush is scheduled to visit argentina paraguay brazil and 
venezuela in early december 
he will notice our receptivity to his proposal perez said

the 16thcentury mogul rulers of north 
india thought of kashmir as a paradise and left the dusty 
scorching plains for summer holidays in the lush valley surrounded 
by steep himalayan foothills 
they started a tradition and eventually 750000 people visited 
kashmir each apriloctober season 
this year not even 20000 have come a moslem insurgency and a 
harsh government crackdown have made the valley more a battlefield 
than a tourist destination 
soldiers are billeted in srinagars luxury hotels and patrol the 
boulevard along dal lake gunfire echoes in the still nights 
we have been devastated said mohammed yusuf chapri whose 
family has been in the tourism business since 1870 tourism has 
dropped 995 percent 
chapri a burly man in his 50s owns two houseboats the 
floating hotels that made dal lake famous at least 1150 are 
anchored on the lake ranging from economy oneroomers to luxurious 
sixbedroom units richly paneled in walnut 
even in world war ii tourists flocked to kashmir chapri 
said from what ive heard this is the worst year for tourism in 
kashmir in the past 120 years 
the government agrees but says it can do little 
we have to live with the fall in tourism until conditions 
return to normal said ved marwah an adviser to gov girish 
saxena appointed by the federal government 
people dependent on tourism have suffered he said what 
we have done is to ensure that their loans are not called and no 
penalty interest is levied for inability to pay back 
others suffering include tour operators hoteliers and owners of 
shikaras the gondolalike boats that carried vacationers on 
sightseeing trips and floating picnics chapri estimated the total 
number of people dependent on the industry at about 500000 
kashmirs economic disaster extends far beyond tourism 
the valleys largest industry is agriculture which accounts for 
80 percent of its income rice grown in kashmir is consumed in the 
region but apples are sold to other parts of india 
this year the deep red and golden apples of kashmir have been 
picked and stored but few buyers have come 
there are just no traders said an orchard owner who could 
not find buyers for his 16000 harvest this fighting has scared 
them away 
truck owners whose vehicles carried kashmir apples to the main 
wholesale market in new delhi also fear entering the valley 
marwah the governors adviser said state authorities had 
started an applemarketing program but would buy only 100000 tons 
of a crop that totaled 17 million tons 
one economic benefit of the insurgency was greater output of 
handicrafts and handwoven carpets and handicrafts he said as 
marwah explained theres so much trouble people stay more at 
home and if theyre home they tend to work more 
a government fund of 9 milion has been set up to buy 
handicrafts and sell them elsewhere in the country 
tourist shops in neighboring nepal are filled with kashmiri 
shawls jewelry and papiermache boxes which they sell to indian 
japanese and western tourists who used to visit srinagar 
the economy is under stress but the government has done a 
lot marwah said tourism is a vital input but its failure 
doesnt bring the economy to a grinding halt 
in srinigar it is easy to see the effects of the insurgency and 
the limited government efforts to take up the economic slack 
hundreds of people sit aimlessly along dal lake and in the old 
city during daylight hours when the curfew is relaxed 
many housewives use apples in curry because they are cheaper and 
more plentiful than meat and vegetables 
we have been used to the best of times said chapri the 
houseboat owner and now were seeing the worst

during world war ii at what now is fort hood 
texas a black lieutenant in the thensegregated army refused the 
contemptuous order of a white civilian driver to sit in the rear of 
a post bus 
military police were called the young officer who in 1947 
would become famed as the first black to play major league baseball 
was further insulted by the mps he sharply protested and was 
brought up on charges 
the courtmartial of jackie robinson premiering tonight on 
ted turners tnt cable network dramatizes that shameful 
relatively littleknown period in the history of the army and the 
united states tnt deserves credit for the effort 
unfortunately the road to disappointment is paved with good 
intentions and courtmartial is a twohour example of that 
on the bright side andre braugher is firstrate as the proud 
fiery robinson so is dale dye in a small supporting role as a 
tough white lieutenant colonel who respects robinson both as a man 
and a soldier 
the bad news is the script which took four people to write it 
has no real focus as so often is the case with fourhanded 
scrivening 
the movie could have been taut and engrossing had it just zeroed 
in on events leading up to the courtmartial and the trial itself 
instead it often flounders about as it tries to recreate the 
times in which robinson lived telling among other things of his 
love for the coed kasi lemmons he married and of his warm 
strongwilled mother ruby dee 
no real insights emerge just that the women helped keep him 
going when he wanted to quit ucla where he was a sports star and 
after pearl harbor when he was drafted into the army and faced 
bigotry the second he got off the bus for basic training 
the script also has two baseball scouts bruce dern and paul 
dooley who periodically pop in and out of the story one is a 
racist and both work for brooklyn dodgers president branch 
rickey who later hired robinson 
no doubt their presence is intended to get the baseball angle 
in bad move it only clutters things up 
the movie does occasionally show signs of life particularly in 
its depictions of the nastiness of racial segregation in the army 
and the hurt of being called coon and boy while facing the 
same war overseas as whites 
as the film shows robinson refuses to give in seeking more 
seating for blacks in the cafeteria at fort hoods segregated post 
exchange he crisply tells one racist major 
the negro troops are prepared to fight and die just like 
white troops if theyre going to die like whites they might as 
well eat like them 
there are good scenes too showing the friendship between the 
impatient rightly frustrated robinson and the wise knowing boxing 
great he meets in the army sgt joe louis quietly and 
effectively played by stan shaw 
the younger man asking louis how he endures the racist slurs 
hes gotten in the boxing ring comes to adopt the boxers reply as 
his personal motto i hit em first faster and harder 
another plus the films realistic depictions of military 
matters thats largely due to dye a retired marine captain who 
as he did in platoon doubles here as an actor and a technical 
adviser 
its too bad that braughers performance dyes work and 
generally good efforts by the other players go for naught 
but theres little any actor can do with a script that is so 
uneven that its key moment the courtmartial has no high drama at 
all it comes off flatter than a first sergeants feet 
at least tnt is trying to do something other than the major 
networks usual diseaseoftheweek or trashoftheweek movies 
but if tnt executives keep getting scripts as wobbly as the 
courtmartial of jackie robinson they should be made to stay 
after telecast and write 100 times the plays the thing 
 
elsewhere in television 
its been swell molly dodd the days and nights of molly 
dodd are coming to a close but not until next spring the 
lifetime cable network which picked up the series from nbc last 
year has ended production of the saga of a new york city divorcee 
played by blair brown the final 13 episodes of the series 
lifetime made 26 others will start airing in january the first 
lifetime says will reveal the father of mollys unborn baby

for a classic demonstration of how a bear market 
works the stocks of companies in the chemical industry seem to 
possess all the necessary elements 
their prices have been battered across the board in recent 
months as the stock market as a whole has fallen to its lowest 
levels in a year and a half 
the selling has been relentless even for stocks of companies 
that appeared to be wellpositioned in specialized markets presumed 
to be resistant to recessions and the effects of soaring oil 
prices 
we realize that a bear market is tough on everyone says 
paul leming chemical industry analyst at wall streets morgan 
stanley amp co the level of pain and suffering in the chemical 
industry has gone beyond the bounds of good taste however 
through august and september leming said the chemical stocks 
he follows tumbled an average of 25 percent while the standard amp 
poors 500stock composite index dropped 14 percent 
the market seems to be making no distinction between the 
fundamentals of different companies he said the stocks are 
just being taken out and shot 
there are a couple of broad reasons why the chemical stocks 
reaction to recent events has been so pronounced observers say 
first of all the business has a firmly entrenched image as a 
smokestack industry whose fortunes have long been sensitive to the 
ups and downs of the economic cycle whisper recession and the 
chemical stocks feel a breeze 
secondly the industry is a heavy user of petroleumbased raw 
materials putting it squarely in the path of the oilprice 
increases that have followed iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the sharp escalation in oil prices is having a major impact on 
the fundamentals of the basic chemical industry says george 
krug who follows the stocks for oppenheimer amp co 
a good many analysts argue however that the same conclusion 
isnt warranted or at least not to the same degree for companies 
in specialty chemicals for example coatings adhesives dyes and 
cleaning materials which oftentimes are made with the commodity 
chemicals produced by the basic manufacturers 
in many respects specialty chemical companies are a world 
apart from their basic chemical counterparts stephen grant an 
analyst at value line investment survey says in the advisory 
firms latest quarterly report on the industry 
basic chemical manufacturers most likely will have to absorb the 
brunt of the increase in petrochemical costs passing only part of 
the increase through to the specialty companies grant argues 
therefore he says raw materials costs for specialty chemical 
producers probably will continue to advance only modestly 
and for these technologybased companies with proprietary 
products the higher costs should be easy to pass on to 
customers 
nevertheless grant acknowledges specialty chemical makers do 
suffer from exposure to weakness in the markets they supply 
primary end markets include autos construction and electronics 
each of which is in a slump 
as for the chemical industry as a whole most analysts believe a 
fullfledged revival may have to await signs pointing to the next 
upward turn in the economic cycle 
said leming at morgan stanley todays problems the 
predominant one being overcapacity are likely to sow the seeds 
for tomorrows boom as profitability deteriorates there should be 
a slowdown in capacity additions 
we dont believe its appropriate to give up on the chemicals 
forever because we think this group will once again have its day 
in the sun unfortunately that day could be as far away as 1995

the government and parliament flew to 
glamorous berlin en masse to celebrate german unity in the 
traditional capital but this dull little city on the rhine is 
determined they wont escape for good 
during its 41 years as west germanys capital bonn has become 
a symbol of the first successful german democracy mayor hans 
daniels said proudly 
wolfgang schnitzler a 60yearold taxi driver who may lose his 
job if bonn loses the politicians said to my way of thinking 
moving the government to berlin would be a criminal act 
berlin became the symbolic capital on unity day oct 3 but 
bonn still is the seat of government whether the government moves 
is up to parliament 
the bonnberlin competition has taken some nasty turns 
bonn boosters say berlin should not be the seat of united 
germany because it was the center of nazi power in 19331945 
in a newspaper interview published on unity eve daniels said 
bonn which has no triumphal arches has never displayed itself 
with arrogance his notsooblique reference was to berlins 
brandenburg gate and the nazi parades that once passed through it 
backers of berlin say bonn is too small and unexciting to be the 
new germanys political heart 
berlin is supremely suited in view of its location its 
history and its role as a cultural crossroads said walter 
momper mayor of berlin 
in the eyes of the world berlin is in the same class as london 
rome paris and madrid he said 
that kind of talk irritates daniels 
keeping the government and parliament in bonn would make it 
impossible for berlin to gain the power it once held over germany 
he said and the germans would be declaring a national modesty 
modest is an apt word for bonn 
the government is housed in buildings whose architectural styles 
range from drab to dismal parliament meets in the former 
waterworks a vast ugly structure on the riverbank 
visitors spend little time in bonn its bestknown sights such 
as beethovens birthplace the charming market square and the 18th 
century city hall can be covered easily in less than a day 
lawmakers from nowdefunct east germany showed some curiosity 
when they attended the allgerman parliaments first working 
session but left town quickly when it was over some complained of 
trouble in finding a place to eat late at night 
farm tractors pulling loads of manure frequently cause traffic 
jams 
by contrast berlin is home to a seemingly infinite array of 
cultural and historical offerings including the reichstag the 
remains of the wall numerous museums and some of the best music 
and theater in europe 
government does not depend on such things daniels said he 
described bonn on the rim of western europe as a perfect bridge 
between the new germany and the west 
daniels pointed out that moving the government would be 
enormously expensive some experts say the transfer could cost up 
to 65 billion at a time when hundreds of billions are needed to 
absorb and rebuild east germany 
the mayor acknowledges his city would become a virtual ghost 
town if the government left since most of bonns 300000 people 
are somehow linked to it 
bonn also is in the middle of a costly construction program that 
includes a new parliament and the mayor said much money would be 
lost if it were stopped 
chancellor helmut kohl has indicted he is in no hurry to move 
the government 
this is certainly not a question which is of any urgency to 
me as far as the agenda is concerned he said sept 30 
whether the new parliament will agree is another question

the economy is growing and 
unemployment is shrinking exiles have returned and so have 
millions of badly needed dollars sent abroad for safekeeping 
problems still abound 10 months after the us invasion that 
deposed and captured gen manuel antonio noriega but panama is 
gradually crawling out from under years of corrupt military 
leadership and us economic sanctions 
it is a slow process squabbling within the coalition government 
may be scaring off foreign investors and suspicion lingers that 
panama is a country without a plan 
unemployment and underemployment are estimated at about 25 
percent that is down from 35 percent at the beginning of 1990 but 
30000 more panamanians join the labor force each year 
noriega collaborators are in the new civilian police force but 
are being systematically retired and more than half noriegas 
officers are out including the highest ranks graduates of 
military academies are not welcome in the new police who replace 
noriegas panama defense force 
although 2000 people remain homeless because much of the el 
chorillo slum was destroyed in the invasion thousands more are in 
new or renovated housing and the rest are to be housed by years 
end 
officially the invasion cost the lives of 314 panamanians 202 
of them civilians many critics put the toll at several times that 
and accuse the panamanian and american governments of covering up 
but little evidence has been produced 
the economy which shrank about 16 percent in 198789 is 
expected to grow by 7 percent this year panama is resuming payment 
to foreign creditors on a debt that is among the worlds highest 
per capita 
no physical signs of the invasion remain but it is far from 
forgotten 
i think most panamanians feel the invasion was a liberation 
but it definitely left an open wound in the national psyche said 
roberto eisenmann publisher of the independent newspaper la 
prensa 
this is becoming even more evident as time goes on the only 
medicine is to come out of it a demilitarized country if panama 
remilitarizes history will not forgive us 
noriega closed eisenmanns paper and the publisher spent years 
in exile 
they are amateurs he said patiently of the new 
administrtion they were condemned to the opposition for 21 
years they are learning the process 
some new cabinet ministers literally had to look in the 
telephone book to find their new offices he said 
president guillermo endara has been criticized as weak after two 
decades of military rule 
i think if you scratch the surface you will find out many 
people want a weak president right now eisenmann said endara 
is probably the right man for the job at this time in our 
history 
the dictatorship was a parenthesis in our history a long one 
but a parenthesis he said panama now needs to fall back on 
its traditions of democracy and make it work 
panama has no organized political opposition at the moment the 
militarys revolutionary democratic party in power since 1968 
seems to have dropped from sight but still has six members in the 
57seat national assembly 
endaras opposition comes from within the governing alliance 
analysts generally agree elements of the coalition especially the 
christian democrats will break off and bid for power as the 1994 
elections approach 
the president has said he will preserve the alliance as long as 
possible and his government appears to be in no immediate danger 
more binds the parties together than separates them us 
ambassador deane hinton said in an interview they are condemned 
to work together 
outside the government the parties are involved in a political 
feud that sometimes resembles a brawl 
mayor guillermo cochez whose christian democrats hold the 
most national assembly seats suggested in a newspaper column that 
the endara government has few differences from one in the 
noriega period endara who represents the smaller authentic 
liberal party suggested cochez resign 
the three smallest coalition parties teamed up with noriegas 
old party to bump the christian democrats from the assembly 
presidency first vice president ricardo arias calderon called the 
three parties noriega sympathizers 
endara vetoed more than half the first 20 major bills to reach 
his desk second vice president guillermo ford claimed the new 
police force controlled by arias calderon was ineffective against 
crime the two are expected to be opponents for the presidency 
dissent within the government is strange to panamanians after 21 
years of military rule that began with a coup in 1968 by gen omar 
torrijos 
endara and his vice presidents are not the paternal leaders 
panamanians have gotten used to said mayin correa a former 
opposition legislator who has been host of a political talk show 
since returning from exile in miami 
radio stations broadcast a national assembly debate on revoking 
the immunity of three members from the military party accused of 
committing crimes while noriega was in power one called her 
accuser a child molester he said she was a drunk 
ms correa says she welcomed the systems openness but wouldnt 
want to be in the assembly now 
sovereignty issues have affected otherwise good relations with 
the united states 
at the behest of foreign minister julio linares endara has 
suggested the united states owes reparations for damage wrought by 
the invasion no amount has been mentioned 
its a nice issue to beat washington over the head with but 
it isnt going anywhere ambassador hinton said and suggested 
the demand was primarily for internal political consumption 
losses from looting and other causes not stemming from the 
fighting have been estimated at up to 15 billion which is 
generally considered high little was paid by insurance companies 
which cited actofwar clauses 
the nited states has allocated 430 million for panamanian 
recovery with about 130 million dependent on an agreement to 
exchange banking information in criminal cases 
linares the foreign minister has said he will not approve an 
accord that weakens panamas confidential banking system although 
it was used in drug deals under noriega 
hinton said only if you believe it is in panamas interests 
to shield illegal acts is this agreement a threat to panama 
the banking system has been a major factor in attracting 
business more than 100 banks most of them foreign have offices 
in panama 
dario selles president of the panama industrial association 
said in an interview there is worry in the private sector that 
money will go elsewhere if the system is changed 
new investment is critical to panama selles said 
about 80 percent of the economy involves services banking the 
panama canal construction and government work agriculture and 
industry account for the rest 
unemployment is panamas single worst problem and the labor 
pool is growing at about 30000 a year selles said the 
service sector is still big but it is saturated it is important 
but it is not generating new jobs 
we are asking the government to develop some kind of plan 
he said in the past there was no goal no strategy the 
dictatorship didnt have to promise anything

the el chorrillo slum of reeking 
tenements rats crime and disease was no garden spot but to 
thousands of families it was home 
it also was home to gen manuel antonio noriegas headquarters 
and when us forces invaded in december much of el chorrillo was 
burned or blown to splinters nearly 3000 families about 16000 
people lost their homes 
the panamanian and american governments have been working to 
relocate them centers for the homeless are emptying into renovated 
apartments and new subdivisions but not everyone is happy with the 
results 
on a sweltering afternoon a dozen residents of the 24th of 
december project a cooperative apartment building heavily damaged 
in the battle lounged on the front steps sipping beer and local 
rum 
at least the elevator goes to the top now one resident said 
about the 15story building which was reoccupied in july 
before it only went partway and there was no water on the top 
floors 
another countered i had tile on my floor and the looters took 
it and my door wont close all the way the sink leaks 
complaints outnumber compliments 
the united states made us leave said rafael olivardia a 
member of the building committee we left our apartments locked 
then when we came back there wasnt even a bed the tile was 
ripped up the copper plumbing was pulled out of the wall all the 
furniture was gone 
aleyeda teran told of a foot of water accumulating in a 
topfloor apartment during a rainstorm because of poorly plugged 
bullet holes and leaky walls 
it dripped down through apartments on all 15 floors she 
said these things didnt happen before the invasion 
olivardia declared the construction companies did bad work 
but we blame the united states and panama because they paid for the 
poor work we have written letters to everyone but nobody 
responds 
the united states budgeted 25 million for the cooperative 
which houses about 450 families but used only 16 million and 
spent the rest on other buildings 
through the us agency for international development 
washington is financing several options for displaced people as 
part of its panama recovery plan 
those who return to renovated apartments in el chorrillo are 
given 800 a family to replace personal belongings most say it is 
not enough 
others can get 6500 to apply toward small houses in 
subdivisions built by private contractors or to buy land and 
build people with jobs may qualify for loans of an additional 
6500 
families choosing subdivisions get ownership of a lot with 
water electricity and septic tank service and a concreteblock 
house with a metal roof 
many say the oneroom house 6500 buys is inadequte for a 
family in most developments houses offered at that price are 
about 15 feet square with a small division for the kitchen and 
bathroom 
people who qualify for supplemental loans can buy larger houses 
about 850 families have moved into the subdivisions and 270 more 
houses are ready for occupancy 
over the next few months we hope to complete about 250 houses 
a month said kevin kelley of the usaid mission 
there have been some complaints we understand he said of 
the 24th of december project we have looked into them and most 
of them were lodged when the people first moved back 
the contractors were bonded and the buyers have guarantees 
we dont agree that construction was shoddy it was well supervised 
by the panamanian housing ministry and the us army corps of 
engineers we think it was good 
more than 700 families still live in centers including hangars 
at a military base others are with family or friends 
us and panamanian officials say they hope to have the hangar 
residents relocated by years end although many living there have 
been declared ineligible for relocation aid because they did not 
live in el chorrillo 
much of el chorrillo was built at the turn of the century as a 
barracks complex for panama canal construction workers a us 
embassy official said many residents of the decrepit buildings were 
squatters 
many former residents will not be able to return to the old 
neighborhood because most of the land is privately held and the 
owners hope to use it more profitably

tap has become a model for antipoverty efforts across the 
nation three of its programs have been lifted whole to other 
states another which brought safe drinking water and toilets 
first to rural homes in the roanoke valley then all of virginia 
eventually moved to washington as a national program 
chip became taps 30th agency it fit right in 
to get it going brand brought together doctors public health 
professionals lawyers tap veterans state and local officials 
everyone we thought could help he said 
we identified the problem and worked out a plausible solution 
the state health department gave us 118000 and we were on our 
way 
they started the program june 16 1988 with pierce the five 
pediatricians in practice with him and 100 patients it went well 
after a year they grew to 300 patients and more doctors that went 
even better six months later the state upped its ante to 200000 
and the wk kellogg foudation of michigan granted 15 million to 
expand further last august kellogg impressed came up with 
another 23 million to spread chip across virginia 
now chip has more than 900 patients enrolled all six of the 
valleys childrens dentists participate and all but three of its 
19 family doctors and 14 pediatricians chip turned down the three 
because they didnt cover on nights and weekends 
we have a ways to go said peggy balla the chip director 
we have identified 4800 potential patients and hope to get them 
all we get more efficient every day weve worked out a lot of 
bugs our computer programs and all our experience will be helpful 
in the replication of chip in other areas 
one of the bugs was getting prescriptions filled the public 
health office which fills them cutrate closes at 5 pm the 
valleys largest drugstore chain now provides 24hour service at 
even lower prices another bug doctor appointments missed for lack 
of transportation a church donated a van 
thats what community action is all about said cabell brand 
its the key to the whole program 
the chip staff includes six public health nurses and six 
outreach workers they work as teams visiting each patient 
regularly at home case management an essential of the whole 
scheme each team has a case load of about 150 which they agree is 
too many but will improve with more staff 
the nurse has a copy of the same records the doctor keeps she 
sees that his orders are followed medication given appointments 
kept the main complaints doctors had about the habits of medicaid 
patients 
just convincing the parents that they really do have a doctor 
they can call any time they have a question and persuading them to 
do it even in the middle of the night may be the hardest job of 
all said one nurse connie willet 
but watching the way they light up when they finally come to 
realize they are included in the health care system which most of 
us take for granted is really satisfying sometimes i think their 
newfound selfesteem is the best medicine of all 
willets outreach worker teammate darlene brown was able to 
come up with a second bed when roberta mccraw had twins has helped 
her find diapers in an emergency as well as food and clothes the 
five little mccraws also are regular patrons of chips free lending 
library not books toys 
case workers tend to get personally interested in chip families 
one mccraw child now has a good winter coat that darlene browns 
own daughter outgrew another has a coat formerly worn by a child 
of teammate connie willet 
chips doctors get paid at the medicaid rate if the patient 
doesnt quite qualify for medicaid the same rate applies 
qualification in virginia is the same as the federal minimum of 135 
percent of the poverty level but chip stretches that to 150 percent 
to take in the working poor doctors say it covers about 70 percent 
of their regular fees 
but chip does the billing relieves the doctors of medicaid 
paperwork and further makes life easier by sending along with each 
new chip patient a medicalhistory questionnaire already completed 
by the case nurse not to mention seeing to it that his 
instructions are followed and appointments kept 
in the doctors waiting room or in the treatment room 
theres no way to tell a chip patient from any other when its 
time to pay the parent shows a chip card and thats that 
preventive medicine shots checkups what the doctors call 
well care are like fire prevention obviously beneficial but 
hard to measure in dollars how much in future medical bills will 
chip save by giving children a healthy start the childrens 
defense fund a national group says the annual saving is 10 for 
every 1 spent health insurance companies with one eye on that 
huge group of uninsured are keeping the other eye on chip 
we have a chance to do some blowaway things here it seems to 
me said john berry head of blue crossblue shield in virginia 
blue cross has supported chip from the beginning completely 
outfitting the chip office in roanoke with furniture and equipment 
one major financial effect of chip is apparent right now from a 
recent survey of 10000 childrens visits to the roanoke memorial 
hospital emergency room 
it found that nearly half 46 percent were between 3 pm and 
midnight and that fewer than 15 percent were justifiable 
emergency room visits according to dr preston boggess director 
of pediatric education 
in an emergency room with no records of the patient 
available you have to practice defensive medicine boggess said 
that means extensive tests and lab work to cover all the 
possibilities 
they are mostly unnecessary always costly and take time from 
real emergencies but some people have no place else to take a sick 
child 
roberta mccraw has 
the baby was fussing and running a fever and i was scared to 
death she said 
i had never called my doctor at night and didnt know whether 
i should maybe just go ahead to the emergency room 
but i called and he said to bring her in 
it wasnt my doctor but was one in the same building it was 
his turn to work that night 
he examined her and looked at her records and in a minute 
said mrs mccraw amandas teething take her home shell be 
just fine 
and she was

henry f cooper says he still believes in 
former president reagans dream of erecting an impenetrable shield 
in space against a massive missile attack 
but as the new director of star wars cooper is quietly charting 
a more downtoearth course for the multibilliondollar project 
reagan started in 1983 
from his headquarters in the pentagon basement cooper is 
piecing together a plan that shifts the star wars focus away from 
efforts to protect against an allout soviet attack with thousands 
of nucleartipped ballistic missiles 
the new aim is more modest to build a defense against a few 
dozen or few hundred missiles launched accidentally by moscow or 
deliberately by a third world despot 
more than the numbers have changed for star wars officially 
known as the strategic defense initiative or sdi so too has the 
idea at the heart of reagans proposal that a missile defense can 
be found that would make nuclear arms obsolete 
in fact quite a different view is behind coopers approach he 
thinks that while the soviet missile arsenal is still formidable 
and capable of destroying the united states a greater danger is 
that more third world nations are likely to acquire nuclear 
arsenals 
in taking this new tack cooper is acknowledging that congress 
has all but killed star wars in its original form to keep the 
concept of antimissile defense alive cooper is banking on public 
support for a more limited less costly system 
if we can get people to agree that at least limited protection 
is something that we ought to be doing then we can go ahead 
with the research and development it would be a great step 
forward cooper said in a recent interview 
cooper has even found a friendly acronym for his plan pals or 
protection against limited strikes he says it could be put into 
operation as early as 1996 and would cost less than the 55 billion 
price tag of the previous star wars plan 
pals is not yet official bush administration policy but cooper 
said he is making decisions on the assumption that it soon will be 
they hired me to make decisions not to wait until the final i 
is dotted and the final t is crossed he said 
he is the first civilian director of sdi but cooper is no 
stranger to strategic defense he was chief us negotiator on 
defense and space matters from 1987 to 1989 a task that included 
trying to persuade the soviets to drop their objections to sdi and 
to agree on a mutual transition from offensive arms to defensive 
weapons 
in that job cooper says he became acquainted with many key 
members of congress relationships he hopes will help him turn the 
tide of congressional opinion on sdi 
over the past two years the sdi program while moving ahead 
with antimissile technologies on the drawing board has been 
losing ground in the political arena moscow still opposes the 
project and congress has begun cutting the sdi budget which may 
fall this year to 3 billion or less from 37 billion last year 
cooper said the previous star wars goal of defending against an 
attack by thousands of enemy missiles no longer fits the evolving 
picture of a reforming soviet union 
we were thinking entirely of a world of competition with the 
soviet union he said were now beginning to think in terms of 
a world of cooperation 
many in congress believe the changing world order means sdi is 
less important even cooper says that before he assumed the 
directors job last july he harbored some doubt about the bush 
administrations commitment to the project 
i wrestled with the issue of whether or not to come because it 
is obviously a critical period i refer to it as a makeorbreak 
time cooper said adding that before accepting the post he 
talked with defense secretary dick cheney about bushs views 
the secretary believes the president is committed to this 
program he said 
cooper said that he sought no assurances directly from bush 
before taking the job and that he has not been disappointed at the 
absence of heavy presidential lobbying for sdi 
it hasnt bothered me that hes not talking out not 
trumpeting sdi all the time cooper said 
still cooper has taken it upon himself to find a way of 
building or star wars and keeping it from withering 
on the scientific vine 
i didnt come to package it up and put it on the shelf he 
said

is there a smoking gun in the michael milken 
affair 
government prosecutors would like nothing more than to produce 
one in a special presentencing hearing for the junkbond financier 
that began this past week 
but in the first day of the twoweek show in manhattan federal 
court no big bombshells dropped two government witnesses failed 
to directly link milken to the systematic stock manipulation 
alleged by the government 
the first round of testimony still managed to produce some news 
a trader for milkens former employer drexel burnham lambert inc 
revealed he had a secret middleofthenight meeting with milken 
after stock speculator ivan boesky turned states evidence in 1986 
boesky once one of milkens regular customers would become his 
chief accuser 
the extrader cary maultasch described a cloakanddagger 
rendezvous with milken at drexels office in beverly hills calif 
the pair spoke in hushed tones with a guard posted at the door 
milken scribbled his most sensitive comments about boesky on a pad 
and erased them immediately but maultasch couldnt recall exactly 
what was communicated 
the minitrial resumes monday before judge kimba wood who 
is trying to focus her image of milken before pronouncing his 
sentence she ordered the hearing after the government and the 
defense provided her with documents painting widely divergent 
portraits of the exbillionaire 
the hearing covers a handful of allegations beyond the crimes 
milken admitted in his sixcount guilty plea in april wood is 
nevertheless limited to the maximum penalty of 28 yars in prison 
prescribed in the plea bargain 
the prosecutions case hangs on three transactions in which it 
claims milken abused securities laws the defense led by attorney 
arthur liman will try to deflect those blows while promoting its 
alternative image of milken as a misunderstood genius of finance 
and warmhearted dogooder 
the hearing although it takes the milken chase into extra 
innings has left some observers less than excited because of its 
limited scope 
we will never have confidence in knowing what happened said 
albert alschuler criminal law expert at the university of chicago 
law school 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as milken ran the gantlet of photographers and reporters on his 
way to court he could at least take solace in the fact that he 
remains one of the nations wealthiest people 
the latest ranking of forbes magazines 400 richest americans 
put the californian at 115th worth 700 million thats a demotion 
from his days as a billionaire thanks to the 600 million 
settlement included in his plea bargain 
in general the rich got poorer in the past year according to 
the magazine fiftythree of the forbes 400 suffered networth 
declines ranging from 100 million to nearly 900 million 
in contrast to milken most suffered at the hands of the 
economy 
for the first time in the eight years forbes has been publishing 
the register the minimum fortune it took to make the grade 
dropped from 275 million in 1989 to 260 million 
john werner kluge the metromedia tycoon topped the list with 
an estimated 56 billion 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one name missing from the forbes ranking was donald trump whose 
1989 fortune of 17 billion has almost completely disappeared 
trumps troubles continued during the week with word that his 
second book surviving at the top hadnt survived long on the 
new york times bestseller list the paper said the book had fallen 
off the list after only seven weeks his first book the art of 
the deal lingered 48 weeks on the list after it was introduced 
in 1987 
trump was also reported to be negotiating new terms for loans on 
two of his casinos in his continuing efforts to keep his gambling 
real estate and airline empire aloft 
takeover investor carl icahn 65th on the forbes list at 1 
billion also emerged in the trump storyline as a possible investor 
in trumps casino bonds reports said icahn was snapping up the 
sagging notes as a longterm investment

october has been putting in an earnest bid so 
far to live up to its reputation as a villainous month for wall 
street 
in a threeday span this past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials took a drop of 158 points or 629 pecent to a new 
18month low that was more than enough to evoke vivid memories of 
october massacres past in the stock market 
just a year ago there was the friday the 13th minicrash 
when the dow fell 190 points in a single session 
two years before that was the crash of 1987 which culminated in 
a 508point collapse on monday oct 19 
further back in investment annals were the backtoback declines 
of october 1978 a loss of 92 percent and 1979 69 percent 
and of course the 1929 crash which helped to usher in almost a 
decade of economic misery was another october production 
with such past performances to go on it seems no surprise at 
all that investors would be in a jumpy mood the economic and 
political news meanwhile has fallen into step to help ensure that 
no stray element of cheer creeps into the picture 
the stalemate with iraq in the persian gulf has kept relentless 
upward pressure on world oil prices the battle of the budget in 
washington produces nothing but frustration 
corporate profits and dividends tumble but interest rates cling 
stubbornly to their lofty perch 
against this background the debate over the status of the stock 
market seems to have been settled the stock market is in the 
midst of a primary bear market declares richard evans research 
director at the investment advisory service dow theory forecasts in 
hammond ind 
indeed stocks current problems started long before october 
came into view they date back to midsummer when the dow jones 
industrial average closed for two days running at a peak of 
299975 
from that point through thursdays close the average took a 
2116 percent drop 
most recently many wall streeters have been inclined to blame 
at least some of the markets woes on the white house and members 
of congress and their failure to come up with a plan to manage the 
governments finances 
beyond the budget mania there is a sick economy to deal 
with observed robert brusca chief economist at nikko securities 
international in new york 
at the close on friday the dow jones industrial average stood 
at 239802 down 11262 from the week before 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index down 628 at 16442 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market down 1980 at 32756 and the american 
stock exchange market value index down 1251 at 29397 
volume on the big board averaged 15619 million shares a day 
against 17070 million the week before 
the markets malaise is beginning to make some startling 
impressions if stocks dont rally somehow in the next 2 months 
they will post their worst yearly showing since 1974 when the dow 
fell 276 percent 
hope dies hard in the financial world however and right now 
some optimists claim that they at least have contrary opinion on 
their side 
we cannot rule out the potential for a nearterm advance 
especially some time this month when everyone is expecting another 
horrendous october said ralph acampora an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities 
but acampora adds nothing has surfaced to change my mind 
about the primary trend in this market it is down

the first public airing of allegations that 
michael milken abused the nations financial markets opened with 
testimony that the junkbond financier never asked two traders to 
illegally manipulate securities 
a former drexel burnham lambert inc trader also described on 
thursday a secret meeting with milken where the two discussed in 
hushed tones ivan boeskys stunning 1986 deal to cooperate in the

as the wildly swinging price of a barrel of 
crude oil grabs headlines and stirs fears of higher inflation some 
folks might wonder just what is a barrel of oil 
physically its the unit by which oil is sold a relic of early 
days in the industry when drillers filled 42gallon barrels with 
crude oil nowadays however oil is bought and sold in amounts 
equivalent to thousands of barrels 
crude oil is as it sounds a raw unrefined version of the 
centurys most important fossil fuel 
before oil is used by businesses or consumers as gasoline or 
other products it is refined that is a process of cooking and 
distilling that actually turns the 42 gallons of crude into a 
little more than 44 gallons of petroleum products even though 
nothing is added 
you do get more product than the crude said jim williams of 
the american petroleum institute the oil industrys trade group in 
washington 
after you break it up into various gasoline and diesel and 
stuff youve rearranged the molecules its just rearranged 
differently youre just changing the chemical makeup of the crude 
oil to make it more usable 
the 203 gallons that appear through the molecular shuffling is 
known as the processing gain 
the refining is done in stages with the first step occurring as 
crude oil is heated at the bottom of a distillation tower 
the oil turns to gas and rises with various portions of the 
barrel condensing into liquids at different heights of the tower 
at certain points of the tower the refinery equipment collects the 
liquids that can be blended into gasoline at other levels of the 
tower come portions of the oil that can be used in diesel and 
kerosene 
whats left over at the bottom is then put through a similar 
tower that has a vacuum at the top and takes out portions of the 
oil that were too heavy to be collected the first time out 
after that stage the refiner is left with even heavier portions 
of the oil barrel that need to be broken up before they are used 
you keep working it down until you can get it into gasoline 
williams said the heavier the crude the more of this you have 
to do not all refiners can do all of these things 
the different steps that must be taken with different barrels of 
oil are necessary because all oil is not created equal 
crudes range from light sweet the most desirable blend to 
heavy sour the least desirable 
a crudes sweetness measures its sulfur content lowsulfur 
or sweet oil is easier to convert into fuels that meet us 
environmental standards heavy sour has lots of sulfur and 
takes more refining before it can be used as fuel 
when the refining is done a little less than half of the 
barrel 1950 gallons has been converted into finished motor 
gasoline statistics from the federal energy information 
administration show 
the other products from a barrel are distillate fuel oil 861 
gallons jet fuel 420 gallons residual fuel oil 277 gallons 
petroleum coke 160 gallonsasphalt and road oil 139 gallons 
liquified gases 143 gallons petrochemical feedstocks 122 
gallons kerosene 025 gallon finished aviation gasoline 008 
gallon and miscellaneous 298 gallons

nervousness about a possible recession and war in the persian 
gulf kept consumers out of the stores last month giving many of 
the nations retailers a dismal september and signalling a 
difficult christmas shopping season 
i dont see anything to suggest an improvement said jeffrey 
edelman a retail industry analyst with barclays de zoete wedd 
after the biggest retailers issued their monthly sales reports 
thursday 
several companies said their september sales fell from 
yearearlier levels 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co warned 
it could get worse we believe that for the first time in a 
long time we will have two very poor christmases back to back 
many retailers were forced to slash prices and consequently 
their profit margins to bring in sales last christmas feiner 
predicted earnings would decline again in the fourth quarter 
although many companies are being very cautious and preparing for 
the worst another bleak holiday season 
a slump in profits in the final quarter could be devastating for 
retailers who depend on this period for about 50 percent of their 
fullyear earnings 
septembers results came as no surprise august sales which 
normally are boosted by backtoschool shopping showed signs of a 
spending slowdown 
consumers were already nervous about the economy and the 
security of their own jobs when the persian gulf crisis and rising 
oil prices exacerbated recession fears and gave them less money to 
spend on socalled discretionary items such as clothes and 
furniture 
the weather also affected sales as temperatures ran above the 
norm and few consumers were in the mood to shop for winter 
clothing 
feiner summed up the confluence of factors as a multifaceted 
barrage on the consumer 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck amp co said sales 
at stores open at least a year rose 44 percent for the five weeks 
ended oct 6 while sales from all of its stores rose 42 percent 
analysts say sales from stores open at least a year also known 
as samestore or comparable store sales provide a truer picture 
of a retailers performance than overall sales do newer stores 
tend to have extraordinarily robust sales that can skew a 
retailers results 
k mart corp said its samestore sales inched up 07 percent 
although overall sales rose 102 percent 
walmart stores inc the discount retailer that consistently 
outperforms the rest of the industry reported a samestore sales 
gain of 9 percent and a 24 percent rise overall 
jc penney co inc said its samestore sales fell 34 percent 
while overall sales were off 23 percent 
dayton hudson corp reported a 2 percent decline in samestore 
sales although overall sales were up 113 percent 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
said its samestore sales dropped 3 percent while overall sales 
rose 10 percent 
thursdays reports also came as bad news for the economy as 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the gross 
national product a dropoff in spending adversely affects other 
economic sectors including manufacturers who sell merchandise to 
retailers 
retailers are playing a totally defensive ball game 
reducing their orders to suppliers said feiner 
the results announced thursday differ from the monthly retail 
sales report from the government the commerce department includes 
sales from supermarkets restaurants and car dealerships in its 
figures 
in other reports from retailers 
woolworth corp reported a 21 percent gain in samestore 
sales and a 62 percent rise overall 
may department stores co said its samestore sales fell 18 
percent while overall sales picked up 35 percent

the governments first two witnesses against 
michael milken couldnt directly link the former billionaire junk 
bond financier to scheming to manipulate a stock with inside trader 
ivan boesky 
the first public hearing on charges against milken after a 
fouryear probe yielded details about the paranoia and fear that 
gripped milken and others at drexel burnham lambert inc after 
boesky turned states evidence in 1986 
prosecutors have picked three transactions they claim 
demonstrate that milken routinely took advantage of clients and 
rigged the financial markets for his own gain the allegations are 
contained in a presentencing memo that urges a stiff sentence for 
milken 
under questioning thursday from government prosecutors and 
defense lawyers former drexel trader cary maultasch and former 
boesky trader michael davidoff could not link milken to the alleged 
1986 manipulation of wickes co stock 
the government alleges that milken directed boeskys company to 
buy large blocks of stock in wickes cos a drexel client in april 
1986 to push up its price and help wickes retire an issue of 
preferred shares with costly dividend payments 
us district judge kimba wood asked maultasch whether he had 
any reason to believe that milken was involved in the decision to 
get the boesky organization to buy wickes stock the witness 
paused before replying no factual basis 
milken 44 in april pleaded to six separate counts of 
conspiracy and fraud and agreed to pay 600 million rather than 
face trial on a 98count indictment he faces up to 28 years in 
prison 
the government is trying to show that milken manipulated the 
securities markets for his personal benefit the defense is trying 
to prove his crimes were isolated cases of going too far to help 
clients 
we find no nobility in cheating for a client to earn fees 
assistant us attorney john carroll said in an opening statement 
milken attorney arthur liman countered that the government has 
trumped up charges against milken to encompass the problems of 
drexel which also admitted felony crimes 
when someone has the visibility and celebrity that michael 
milken has its easy to say that everything that ever happened at 
drexel was his fault liman said 
liman hammered at the witnesses about whether milken in fact 
had ever directed them to engage in any illegal behavior including 
insider trading they were unable to name any 
maultasch said milken never discouraged him from cooperating 
with prosecutors and suggested he get his own lawyers and never 
told him to destroy any records withhold evidence or lie to the 
government 
he never criticized you for making a deal to testify against 
him liman said not to my knowledge maultasch relied 
maultasch who has been cooperating with the government in 
exchange for immunity from prosecution also testified that he flew 
to beverly hills in a panic after receiving a subpoena on nov 14 
1986 when boeskys cooperation agreement was announced 
maultasch said he met milken at 4 am in a drexel conference 
room with a guard posted outside the door in hushed tones the two 
discussed the boesky securities transactions listed in the 
subpoeana maultasch said milken scribbled notes on a yellow legal 
pad rather than speaking but he could not remember specifically 
what was said 
maultasch said he asked milken about an october 1986 meeting 
with boesky which had been taperecorded by the government and 
milken replied that he was careful but he didnt know if he was 
careful enough 
milken took frequent notes shook his head and furrowed his brow 
as government prosecutors stated their case during the daylong 
proceedings in a packed manhattan federal court 
the hearing is to resume monday with testimony by former drexel 
trader peter gardiner whom maultasch said told him to ask davidoff 
to purchase the wickes stock 
the boesky organization bought 19 million shares of wickes on 
april 23 1985 helping the stock hit a stipulated closing price at 
which the preferred shares could be redeemed 
the presentencing hearing is scheduled to last two weeks and 
each side has 20 hours to present testimony and crossexamine 
witnesses the other transactions to be aired by the government 
involve alleged illegal dealings in caesars world inc and storer 
communications inc

the business editor and a reporter at a prominent southern 
newspaper were ousted in a conflictofinterest dispute that raises 
questions about what personal financial activity is appropriate for 
journalists 
business editor leonard m apcar resigned from the st 
petersburg fla times last week days after firing banking 
reporter james greiff 
the episode at the 350000circulation florida daily began late 
last month when greiff disclosed he had been shortselling stock of 
wells fargo amp co a san franciscobased bank 
after consulting with top editors apcar dismissed greiff on 
oct 3 two days later apcar quit under pressure after the editors 
learned his individual retirement account was invested in a mutual 
fund containing banc one corp of columbus ohio 
business journalism ethics have received increased scrutiny 
since the 1985 insider trading conviction of former wall street 
journal reporter r foster winans who passed along unpublished 
tips about his widely read stock market column 
several editors and journalism professors contacted about the 
st petersburg incident drew a simple ethical rule for all media 
reporters shouldnt own stock or actively trade securities in 
industries they are assigned to cover 
but they also said mutual funds and other passive investments 
generally arent as problematic as profitoriented trading in the 
realm of potential conflicts 
its part of a journalists obligation to stay away from 
shortterm trading of stocks they cover said george harmon an 
associate professor at northwestern universitys medill school of 
journalism 
with a mutual fund youre not controlling what stocks that 
fund owns said harmon a former business editor of the chicago 
daily news it doesnt seem to me that compromises your 
integrity you dont have any control 
times managing editor mike foley said the dismissals involved 
a real disagreement over the newspapers conduct guidelines 
which warn against potential conflicts but dont prohibit any 
investments specifically 
in neither of these cases did i feel that anything improper 
got into the news columns he said 
in shortselling an investor sells borrowed stock on the 
expectation the price of the issue will decline the investor 
profits if the price drops and the shares usually borrowed from a 
broker can be replaced at a lower price 
the risky strategy forbidden to journalists by at least one 
major business publication amounts to a bet that a companys stock 
price will drop 
theoretically a reporter writing a negative article about a 
company could short the stock of that company expecting the 
story to drive down the price greiff said he had not written about 
wells fargo he was accused only of bad judgment not any 
wrongdoing 
following greiffs dismissal apcar said he told his immediate 
supervisor that he had bank stock in an ira but he didnt name the 
bank 
greiff meanwhile said he told times executives that apcar held 
shares of banc one which was mentioned in a story by greiff the 
previous week as a possible suitor for a florida bank apcar had 
edited that story and decided his mutualfund holding presented no 
conflict 
on oct 4 after rumors that apcar owned stock in the bank 
filtered through the newsroom apcar said he voluntarily told his 
supervisor that banc one was in the ira but a day later foley 
asked apcar to resign 
mutual funds typically contain baskets of different stocks and 
other securities their contents usually are decided by fund 
managers not investors in an ira investors cannot withdraw money 
without penalty until retirement 
youre not in a mutual fund for a short period of 
time said apcar 37 hired by the times in early 1989 after more 
than 12 years as a wall street journal reporter youre in for 
the long haul unless you trade and i dont trade 
the times conflictofinterest policy does not specifically bar 
any investments but cautions reporters to avoid even the 
appearance of a conflict and to raise questions with superiors 
greiff 35 a times reporter for more than five years said he 
did not violate any policy written or spoken he said business 
writers were told only not to invest in companies they cover or 
ones based in florida 
within 10 minutes after placing my order with my broker i told 
several people in my department and told len he said i said 
do you have any problem with it and he said no apcar said he 
did not respond immediately to greiffs admission 
it went from being no problem to being a problem to being a 
firing offense in a matter of a few days greiff said 
rules governing reporters investments vary widely dow jones amp 
co which owns the wall street journal has what is considered to 
be the strictest conflictofinterest policy in the nation 
reporters and other staffers are barred from shortterm trading 
and must hold securities at least six months they cannot trade 
futures or options or sell short reporters and their families are 
prohibited from investing in companies related to their coverage 
areas 
the society of american business editors amp writers ethics code 
urges avoiding even the appearance of conflict it calls for 
skirting active trading and other shortterm profitseeking 
opportunities 
some editors said newspapers may be at fault if they discipline 
reporters without precise guidelines 
if there is no specific policy that makes that clear i think 
the newspaper has overreached said sandra duerr business editor 
of the courierjournal in louisville ky 
others said reporters need to be held to the same ethical 
standard they apply to their subjects 
if the press as a whole is going to say that politicians 
should avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest then we 
should hold ourselves to that extremely high standard said karen 
rothmyer an associate professor at columbia universitys 
journalism school

united auto workers union leaders 
had a neutral response to chrysler corp chairman lee iacoccas 
explanation of why the company needs a contract different than 
pacts reached with gm and ford 
well you see he didnt come out with any bloody nose or 
anything uaw spokesman bob barbee said thursday after iacocca 
spoke with negotiators working on a new contract 
the union had indicated iacocca was in for a rough time if he 
poormouthed the no 3 automakers situation iacocca has earned at 
least 46 million in salary and bonuses and exercised stock 
options worth millions more in the last five years 
chrysler which is expected to say it lost millions when 
thirdquarter earnings are released later this month is in the 
worst financial shape of the big three 
iacocca said he neither pleaded poverty nor bargained during his 
meeting with the union which has agreed on a new threeyear 
contract with general motors corp and ford motor co 
iacocca refused to say whether he asked the union to abandon 
pattern bargaining in which the contracts with all three are 
intended to be virtually identical 
we had a nice hours discussion iacocca said i gave them 
a stateoftheunion stateofthecompany message 
talks between the uaw and chrysler were suspended while the 
pattern contract was worked out between gm and the union the 
pattern was adopted at ford with slight modifications 
chrysler previously has bemoaned the cost of healthcare 
coverage for the companys 67000 hourly workers at chrysler the 
average age is higher than at other us and japanese automakers 
we took a lot of areas that we said we would have problems 
with and we said we would discuss them iacocca said 
most of the anticipated loss for the third quarter is attributed 
to down time for retooling at the companys highly profitable 
minivan plants 
iacocca recently has taken the blame for chryslers finances 
saying management mistakes have led to some of the problems among 
those woes are the lowering of chryslers credit rating on wall 
street to the lowest investment grade an exodus of toplevel 
management to retirement or to other companies and a dearth of new 
products for the early 1990s 
iacocca was irritated thursday when asked whether he 
acknowledged such mistakes to the union he said the news media has 
missed his point 
the management mistakes are small compared to 1250 rebates 
created by overcapacity from transplants so put it in 
perspective he said transplants are japanese automakers 
manufacturing cars in the united states 
also thursday the canadian auto workers union representing 
36500 gm workers reached a tentative agreement on a threeyear 
contract 
the pact mirrors the deal the union reached last month with ford 
of canada union president bob white told a news conference 
thursday the union expects chrysler of canada to follow this 
pattern in forthcoming talks white said 
the agreement calls for wage hikes of 75 percent in the first 
year followed by increases of 67 percent and 48 percent in 
addition to costofliving payments over the life of the contract

saturn cars are expected to pull more 
than a third of their firstyear sales from other general motors 
corp divisions especially chevrolet 
about 65 percent of saturns sales during the next year will be 
new business for gm said don hudler saturn corps sales and 
marketing vice president the rest will come from people who would 
buy other gm cars he said 
but by the 1993 model year about 80 percent of saturn sales are 
expected to come from people lured away from other automakers 
hudler added 
well do better as our perception gets out there hudler 
said after the official unveiling thursday of saturns two and 
fourdoor cars 
saturns price range of 7995 to 11775 puts it in the same 
range as a host of imports and with the geo prizm and the cavalier 
both chevrolets 
auto industry analysts have warned about saturns 
cannibalization of gm sales for some time that tactic might be 
good for saturn but doesnt help gm profits 
gm reported secondquarter earnings of 900 million compared 
with 145 billion in the same quarter of 1989 
saturn began shipping cars to its 30 open dealers thursday 
about 1000 cars will be in dealerships or on their way when saturn 
officially goes on sale oct 25 in 30 retailers mostly in then 
hudler drew cheers and applause from several hundred saturn 
employees who got a 45minute break from work to participate in the 
festivities 
mcwherter who was state house speaker when gm announced in 1985 
that saturn was coming to spring hill 35 miles south of nashville 
recalled that his father moved their family from tennessee to 
michigan in search of work in the auto industry 
i want to acknowledge the thousands and thousands of gm 
stockholders for their commitment to tennessee he said before 
driving a dark red fourdoor sedan out of the plant 
mcwherter and the saturn executives were joined on stage by 
saturnunited auto workers coordinator dick hoalcraft and bobby lee 
thompson assistant director of uaw region 8 who drew applause 
when he said he expects saturn to surprise the imports 
i happen to believe in the saturn team to get the job done 
but more important i believe in you the american public 
thompson said to more cheers 
in the crowd was jerry benefield president of nissan motor 
manufacturing corp usa whose company makes sentras and pickup 
trucks 40 miles away 
its pretty benefield said of the saturn 
saturn is an americanmade car designed to look and drive like 
its japanese it is designed to compete with such companies as 
nissan that have taken some of gms market share 
were very very good competitors lefauve said 
its guys like jerry out there making the nissan look good 
and were out there trying to make our car look good 
in the end its the market that decides

the us economy still can avert a 
recession most of the nations top business leaders said today 
but others contended that a downturn already has begun or is 
imminent 
even if the economy does skirt a recession the business council 
forecast calls for no more than a barely perceptible 03 percent 
growth during the second half of the year 
the report prepared for the 100 chief executives of the nations 
largest corporations holding their semiannual twoday meeting at 
this mountain resort was much more pessimistic than one last 
spring projecting moderate growth in the months ahead 
theyre much more worried than they were at mays meeting 
lewis t preston of jp morgan amp co the council vice chairman 
said of the 19 corporate economists who compiled the forecast 
not worried enough in my judgment 
asked whether he thought the economy already was in a recession 
preston told reporters i do several other council members 
agreed 
the councils economic consultants had predicted last spring the 
economy would continue to grow moderately at least through 1991 
a clear majority still expect slow but positive growth 
through the middle of 1991 their new report said although five 
of the 19 economists projected a recession 
the september survey indicates that economic growth is 
expected to slow from the already sluggish 11 percent annual rate 
in the first half of 1990 to only 03 percent in the second half 
before gradually accelerating to a 12 percent pace in the first 
half of 1991 and 26 percent in the second half of next year the 
report said 
although most of the consultants were not forecasting a 
recession they raised the probability of a downturn by years end 
to 39 percent from 22 percent last may the probability of a 
recession by mid1991 has increased from 29 percent to 47 percent 
the report added 
indeed it said an informal poll taken at an oct 2 
meeting indicated that a majority of the consultants had further 
lowered their growth expectations since the september survey as the 
result of additional increases in oil prices and generally weak 
economic reports 
but the poll found that the economists believe any recession 
would be relatively mild and not as severe as the downturns of 
197375 and 198182 
at the same time the report said there is broad agreement 
that the anticipated slowdown will have run its course by the 
middle of next year and that the economy will then revert to a more 
rapid pace of expansion 
not surprisingly the thing that troubles them the most is the 
persian gulf crisis and the big jump that has occurred in both 
crude and product prices preston said at a news conference 
other concerns he added are a weaker economy than forecast 
last spring and federal budget uncertainties including the 
distinct possibility that before this month is over there could be 
a budget crisis or an impasse of crisis proportions 
the council report said economic weakness is expected to be 
concentrated in housing consumer spending on durable goods 
usually expensive items expected to last more than three years 
and business investment 
other highlights from the forecast 
inflation as measured by the consumer price index will reach

treasury secretary nicholas f brady is 
warning that savings and loan rescues will virtually cease within 
the next two months unless congress provides more money before it 
adjourns 
brady in a letter to the democratic and republican leaders of 
the congressional banking committees said 40 billion would carry 
the bailout program through the 1991 fiscal year on sept 30 
the money to cover the losses in failed sampls would be in 
addition to the 50 billion authorized under last years thrift 
legislation it also would be on top of about 60 billion in 
shortterm borrowing which would be repaid as regulators sell 
assets inherited from bankrupt institutions 
bradys letter released thursday and dated wednesday follows 
weeks of pressure from democrats who said they were reluctant to 
provide more money without a specific request from the bush 
administration 
earlier treasury department officials had said a range of 40 
billion to 80 billion more than last years 50 billion was needed 
for sampls but had not made a specific request 
brady said in the letter that it would be appropriate for 
congress to give the administration openended spending authority 
because congress may not want to go along however brady said it 
could provide the 40 billion for the next fiscal year 
the administration also would accept 20 billion to finance the 
program through april treasury officials have said 
the resolution trust corp created last year to dispose of 
failed sampls is projecting that rtc case resolutions will 
virtually cease within the next two months unless additional funds 
are provided brady said 
a proposal before the senate banking committee would provide 57 
billion the extra 17 billoon is included to increase the 
administrations shortterm borrowing authority for sampls under a 
complex formula in last years legislation 
the bill also would cut short a financing mechanism that was 
intended to keep 30 billion in sampl spending from showing up in the 
federal budget deficit 
so far 23 billion has been borrowed through the resolution 
funding corp an offbudget agency known as refcorp under the 
bill the remaining 7 billion would have to be borrowed onbudget 
through the treasury 
the administration raised 5 billion for refcorp on thursday 
selling 30year bonds at an average interest rate of 933 percent 
at a caucus of house banking committee democrats wednesday most 
favored providing less than one years worth of bailout money

the government is predicting that for the rest 
of the century the economies of sun belt metropolitan areas in the 
south and west will grow faster than manufacturingdependent rust 
belt cities 
west palm beach fla topped a list of 54 metropolitan areas 
whose growth between 1988 and 2000 was estimated in a commerce 
department report thursday the city was first in projected gains 
in total personal income population and employment 
other cities ranking in the top 10 in all three categories were 
phoenix ariz orlando fla riverside calif san diego 
sacramento calif and tampa fla 
the fastest growing areas all benefit from strong 
migration flows this has been a part of their economic 
development for the past 25 years and the commerce department 
expects that to continue said economist mark zandi of regional 
financial associates in west chester pa 
each of these areas have a good quality of life pollution 
congestion and crime are not problems for the most part he 
said also housing affordability except for riverside and san 
diego are still pretty good 
other areas projected to have aboveaverage growth are anaheim 
calif fort lauderdale fla atlanta seattle jacksonville 
fla and oakland calif the department said 
the six areas with the slowest projected growth are new orleans 
new york rochester ny pittsburgh cleveland and detroit 
others expected to grow at a belowaverage rate are louisville 
ky st louis and bergen nj 
zandi said the slowergrowing areas in general have either a 
higherthanaverage dependence on manufacturing or on a single 
industry such as oil 
even though output may be growing in manufacturing improved 
productivity will keep growth in the number of jobs down he 
said 
new yorks economy should remain fairly good zandi said but 
its growth ranking is low because there is little room left to 
expand 
west palm beach was projected to have 484 percent total income 
growth adjusted for inflation 248 percent population growth and 
304 percent job growth 
phoenix was second in income growth and third in both job and 
population growth 
new orleans was the only city predicted to have a population 
decline 01 percent and it had the worst job growth 61 percent 
rochester showed the smallest predicted inflationadjusted income 
growth 181 percent new york ranked next to last in all three 
areas 
the commerce department also looked at a fourth statistic per 
capita personal income cities with the fastest growth predicted in 
general ranked low in 1988 those with the slowest expected growth 
for the most part ranked highest in 1988 
however san francisco with a 26309 per capita income was 
expected to grow a betterthanaverage 162 percent to 30582 and 
keep its no 1 ranking 
the average increase for all 54 cities in each area were total 
personal income 269 percent population 106 percent 
employment 158 percent and per capita income 148 percent 
among the nations seven largest metropolitan areas los 
angeles new york chicago philadelphia detroit boston and 
washington only los angeles and washington were expected to have 
betterthanaverage economic growth 
george downey an analyst who worked on the report said the 
commerce department used recent historical trends to predict the 
future the projections do not take into account such extraordinary 
factors as recessions or wars 
these are longterm projections for policy planning for 
people building roads or dams he said

there is no safety defect in jeep cj vehicles 
that would justify taking them off the road the governments top 
safety official says in a ruling bitterly criticized by a consumer 
group spokesman 
jerry r curry head of the national highway traffic safety 
administration said he would not order a recall investigation of 
the vehicles which went out of production in 1986 an estimated 
420000 are still registered for highway use 
three consumer organizations had petitioned the agency to 
conduct the investigation saying the vehicles are dangerous 
because they frequently overturn 
americans have the right to make the choice to drive thejeep cj 
curry said thursday you have to choose the lifestyle 
you want 
the retired army major general said he had ridden thousands of 
miles in the world war ii jeep after which the jeep cj was 
modeled my soninlaw drives a cj and my two granddaughters ride 
in it he said 
the jeep cj is safe if driven carefully he said although 
agency tests showed it and other light utility vehicles are more 
likely to overturn than passenger cars 
currys decision is a serious wrongdoing said ben kelly 
spokesman for the institute for injury reduction a nonprofit 
research and educational group founded by trial lawyers 
kelly a frequent critic of the federal agency during the reagan 
administration said curry has as little commitment to 
eliminating hazardous vehicles from our highways as his 
predecessors since 1980 
for countless americans that is a death sentence kelly 
said for the manufacturers it is a continuing permit to make 
unsafe vehicles 
the jeep cj was manufactured by american motors corp which was 
purchased by chrysler corp in 1987 
chrysler said in a statement the nhtsa findings confirm that 
the jeep cj is a safe vehicle and we are pleased that the matter is 
now closed 
currys ruling is the latest twist in a lengthy controversy 
surrounding the jeep cj amc sold 609356 cj5 and cj7 vehicles 
between 1972 and 1986 when chrysler replaced the cj with the 
redesigned wrangler 
cj rollover accidents caused 116 deaths in 1989 said michael 
brownlee the federal agencys associate administrator for 
enforcement 
kellys group joined the center for auto safety and public 
citizen groups founded by ralph nader in requesting the nhtsa 
investigation their petition said the cjs suspension system was 
defective and its rollbar assembly inadequate 
it is susceptible to overturning because its wheels are closer 
together than those of passenger cars also its center of gravity 
is unusually high because the vehicle is built with extra space 
underneath to accommodate rough terrain 
the agency studied all those claims before deciding not to 
proceed curry said

more than 13 billion in proposed farm program 
cuts devised by the house agriculture committee went today to 
congressional budget writers and negotiators on the 1990 farm bill 
meeting in closed sesson late into thursday night the 
committee approved the package by a 265 vote 
the biggest savings 58 billion would come from a socalled 
triplebase plan which would require farmers to reduce subsidized 
acreage by 15 percent in 1992 and 1993 20 percent in 1994 and 25 
percent in 1995 
pain pain pain rep glenn english dokla said after 
the panels work ended i guess we are going to find out what 
marketoriented agriculture is all about 
he predicted that farmers would see reduced income as a result 
of the changes 
to make reductions is very difficult said agriculture 
committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas we hope we spread 
it around so it doesnt impact in a negative way on farmers 
income 
the plan which reduces agriculture spending by 136 billion 
over five years will be considered by the house budget committee 
which is working to find 500 billion in savings in total 
government spending 
it also would be woven into the 1990 farm bill being worked out 
in a housesenate conference committee if the senate members of 
the committee agree 
the triple base plan gives farmers flexibility to plant several 
different crops on acreage they now are planting in a particular 
subsidized or program crop 
currently farmers keep track of two socalled base land 
areas the acres they plant in certain crops and land they leave 
idle at the demand of the government 
under the new plan farmers would create a third base of acreage 
that they could plant in any program crop wheat corn feed 
grains rice or cotton oilseeds industrial crops experimental 
crops or other commodities for which no substantial domestic 
production exists this acreage would not be subsidized but would 
give farmers the flexibility to answer market demands for certain 
food preferences 
other savings would be achieved by calculating deficiency 
payments on an average price over 12 months instead of an average 
of the first five months after harvest when market prices are 
lowest the government pays farmers the difference between its 
target price and the market price and at harvest time that 
difference is greatest 
other major money saving proposals include 
shifting 25 percent of rural electric administration and all 
but 500 million of farmers home administration direct loans to 
private lenders 
putting a 1 percent user fee on loans for dairy sugar 
tobacco peanuts honey wool and mohair and a 4 percent fee on 
soybean loans 
setting soybean marketing loans at 502 
having a 1991 reduction in wheat acreage of 15 percent 
establishing user fees for the animal and plant health 
inspection service 
a new 5295 billion expansion of the food stamp and nutrition 
programs in the 1990 farm bill would be retained if house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif is able to find money 
from other sources de la garza said 
meanwhile on the house floor thursday the agriculture 
committee fought off an effort by rep mike synar dokla to 
instruct the house farm bill negotiators to insist that at 
minimum pesticide export controls in the house version of the farm 
bill be adopted 
the motion which failed 248162 also would have required the 
house conferees to agree to provisions in the senate bill that 
require the government to immediately stop allowing any produce 
into the united states that carries the residue of a banned 
pesticide 
de la garza pledged to fight for the provision but he said he 
was insulted that synar took the issue to the floor as if he didnt 
respect the chairmans ability to negotiate for it 
on another instruction to house conferees the house voted 
255154 to insist that 10 million be authorized annually in 
fiscal years 1991 through 1995 for a public education program on 
the hazards of tobacco use

in one of its few economic reforms this year 
china opened a national wheat market friday to replace central 
allocation of the nations 85 million ton annual wheat harvest 
more than 200 grain trading companies were to begin dealing on 
opening day at the wholesale grain market in zhengzhou the 
provincial capital of henan chinas wheat heartland the official 
xinhua news agency reported 
the market is one of chinas few experiments in using markets to 
replace four decades of central planning most other reform 
initiatives were halted two years ago when conservatives accused 
the reformists of overheating the economy and generating market 
chaos 
the zhengzhou markets opening was delayed two years by 
inadequate planning and ideological reservations some conservative 
officials have denounced futures trading as speculative 
but the zhengzhou market was allowed to proceed because it will 
help the government manage grain distribution long a serious 
problem although the government buys most grain grown in china it 
lacks a network of modern storage facilities and in bumper years 
much grain is left to rot outdoors serious shortages have occurred 
in some regions while others have surpluses 
china still lacks wholesale markets for the 169 million metric 
tons of rice its main crop harvested annually 
most of the wheat will be sold for future delivery a key 
element of a futures market however william d grossman managing 
director of the chicago board of trades asiapacific office said 
the operatio lacks another element of a true futures market 
standardized contracts 
the board of trade the worlds largest futures market has been 
training and advising chinese personnel but will not be involved in 
the markets management 
a futures market allows buyers and sellers to negotiate a price 
for what they think a commodity will be worth at a future date the 
price holds regardless of subsequent market changes 
the most immediate effect will be to promote circulation in 
the long term it will promote price discovery grossman said 
until now state grain bureaus in each province had to go 
through the central government to buy or sell wheat to other 
provinces setting a price through negotiation the zhengzhou 
market streamlines the process by bringing buyers and sellers 
together individual farmers will still sell their wheat to the 
state and will not be allowed to participate in trading 
commerce minister hu ping said in june that the market will set 
maximum and minimum prices if the price threatens to go above the 
ceiling the market will automatically close if there are no 
offers to buy at the minimum price the state will buy the wheat 
only duespaying members will be allowed to trade said 
grossman and foreigners will be excluded traders will be mostly 
state farms and large consumers like breweries and noodle 
factories 
grossman has likened the zhengzhou market to the chicago board 
of trade when it opened in 1848 it took 20 years before the 
chicago market developed from a cash market to a futures market 
chinese news reports say the government is considering a futures 
market for corn rice and pigs

retail sales jumped 11 percent in september 
artificially inflated by the soaring cost of gasoline the 
government said friday 
sales rose 16 billion to a seasonally adjusted 1512 billion 
the commerce department said that followed a revised 04 percent 
decline in august which had previously been reported as a 06 
percent drop septembers gain was the best since an identical rise 
four months earlier 
august sales too were bolstered by rising gasoline prices which 
took off after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 service station sales 
were up 7 percent in august excluding gasoline sales fell a 
steeper 09 percent in august and rose a lower 08 percent in 
september 
last months performance also was helped by a rebound in auto 
sales which have been slipping most of the year 
auto sales rose 29 percent to 311 billion in september after 
falling 37 percent a month earlier despite the gain they were 
still 49 percent behind last year 
factoring out the volatile auto category sales rose 06 percent 
last month following a 05 percent rise in august 
sales at department stores one of the best gauges of consumer 
sentiment were down 09 percent last month to 176 billion that 
is being taken as a sign that the persian gulf crisis and 
lackluster economic performance in general continue to shake 
consumer confidence 
in a separate private report on thursday major retail chains 
reported disappointing results for last month 
according to the commerce department all retail sales in the 
julyseptember quarter were only 28 percent higher than the same 
period a year earlier that is not enough to account for rising 
prices

california has adopted the nations 
toughest airquality standards for household products ordering a 
45 percent cut in smogforming pollutants from such items as hair 
spray window cleaner and floor wax 
the order thursday by the air resources board will be phased in 
from 1993 to 1998 and could add up to 23 cents to the price of the 
16 types of products covered said jim boyd arb executive officer 
products covered include engine degreaser windshield washer 
fluid furniture polish room air freshener laundry prewash nail 
polish remover insect repellent oven cleaner hair styling gel 
and mousse tile cleaner and shaving cream 
when fully in force the rules would eliminate about 45 tons per 
day of hydrocarbon emissions an amount equal to the emissions of 
about 14 million vehicles currently the household products emit 
about 100 tons of hydrocarbons a day 
no other state has adopted regulations that are these 
comprehensive william sylte the boards chief deputy executive 
officer the federal government he added does not yet regulate 
such product hydrocarbon emissions 
the regulations stemmed from a 1988 california law requiring a 
crackdown on hydrocarbons in hair sprays cleaners and other 
consumer goods the federal government has taken so long in 
getting around to this that the california legislature went ahead 
and authorized the stringent regulations sylte said 
hydrocarbons are contained in chemicals used in the manufacture 
of some of the products or are found in the propellants of others 
once they escape into the atmosphere however they react with 
other pollutants to form urban smog in the same way as hydrocarbons 
from tailpipe exhaust boyd said 
despite potential cost increases he said we expect that 
virtually all of the products currently offered to consumers will 
continue to be available and all of them will be environmentally 
more acceptable than what is on store shelves today 
the arb said some new hair sprays six aerosol and 24 pump 
sprays already have substantially lower hydrocarbons hair spray 
is the no 1 producer of household hydrocarbons followed by 
windshield washer fluid and room air fresheners 
the regulations are patterned after similar rules governing 
paints industrial degreasers deodorants and antiperspirants 
thursdays order marked the second major environmental decision 
by the arb in two weeks 
in the earlier ruling the arb adopted the worlds strictest 
pollution standards for new automobiles requiring all cars built 
between 1994 and 2003 to be up to 85 percent less polluting than 
todays models the decision also required production of 
nonpolluting electric cares by 1998 
the state also has has cut emissions from factories 
we wont meet health standards without controlling these 
household emissions too boyd said

higher oil prices propelled britains annual 
inflation rate to 109 percent in september its highest level in 
nearly nine years but politicians predicted the worst may be over 
although inflation is peaking the worsethanexpected figures 
for september suggest that a decline in the rate will not be as 
fast as had been hoped economists said 
a bit of a shock is the way ian harwood an economist at the 
london investment firm warburg securities described the news 
prime minister margaret thatcher said friday that inflation 
will soon begin to decline linking the pound to europes 
currency system earlier this week will reinforce our own 
financial discipline against it she said 
britain has the worst inflation among the major industrialized 
nations despite mrs thatchers efforts to the contrary she has 
said fighting inflation is her no 1 economic priority 
mrs thatcher speaking at the conservative partys annual 
conference said that signs are clear that the governments 
interest rate policy is working she made reference to a cut in 
base rates by one percentage point to 14 percent earlier this week 
chancellor of the exchequer john major told reporters the hike 
in inflation was where we thought it would be 
in his speech to the conference on thursday major warned that 
recent increases in oil prices had yet to appear fully in the 
inflation statistics but he also predicted inflation would fall 
sharply next year 
the 109 percent rate was the highest level since inflation 
stood at 11 percent in february 1982 and compared with a rate of 
106 percent in august the government said 
the underlying level of annual inflation which excludes 
mortgage payments and a percapita tax rose to 83 percent in 
september from 79 percent in august 
retail prices rose 09 percent in september from the previous 
month the government blamed the hike on a sharp increase in 
gasoline prices to an average of 455 a gallon from 420 in 
august oil prices have risen sharply since iraq invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 
there also were price increases in a wide range of other goods 
and services 
the financial markets which had expected a 108 percent figure 
reacted calmly to the news 
september will be the peak harwood said the bad news 
however is that the unexpected robustness in the underlying rate 
means the fall in the rate will be less than expected 
gwyn hache an economist with james capel and co said what was 
worrisome was that nonoil prices rose more than expected 
although harwood expects inflation to fall below 10 percent by 
the end of the year he said forecasts that it will fall to 5 
percent or lower in 1991 are proving optimistic

wholesale prices shot up 16 percent in 
september as turmoil in the persian gulf battered the us economy 
and fueled a recordbreaking jump in gasoline prices the 
government reported today 
the labor department blamed virtually all of the steep increase 
on higher oil costs that persisted in september following iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
a 206 percent increase in gasoline last month was the highest 
onemonth increase recorded since the government began tracking the 
commodity in 1947 the government said 
the oil shock is hitting with a vengeance and its coming at a 
time when inflation overall is still untamed its just one 
more jolt to an already fragile economy said robert dederick 
chief economist at the northern trust co of chicago 
last months rise in the producer price index the biggest jump 
in wholesale inflation since a cold snap sent prices up 19 percent 
in january followed a similarly sharp increase of 13 percent in 
august that surge was also blamed on higher energy costs brought 
on by the gulf crisis 
it was the biggest twomonth jump in producer prices since 1980 
the government said 
in another economic report today the commerce department said 
retail sales jumped 11 percent in september bolstered by the 
soaring cost of gasoline excluding gasoline sales rose 08 
percent during the month overall sales rose 16 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 1512 billion the commerce department said 
the fallout from the persian gulf conflict has heightened 
analysts fears that higher inflationary pressures will aggravate 
an already staggering us economy 
many economists believe in fact that the nation has already 
slipped into recession the oil shock threatens to intensify the 
downturn deepen it perhaps lengthen it said allen sinai chief 
economist at the boston co 
analysts said the inflation outbreak coupled with todays 
relatively positive retail sales report deepens the dilemma for 
the federal reserve the central bank has been under pressure from 
the bush administration to ease its inflationfighting campaign and 
lower interest rates to spur the economy 
how in the world can the fed ease the consumer at least 
hasnt rolled over and inflation is rebelling the two reports 
give a further reason for the fed to remain frozen in its current 
posture dederick said 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said inflation 
going up is never good news he declined to criticize the federal 
reserves apparent tight monetary policy 
we still are concerned about growth and about preventing a 
recession we think the fed has recognized all these factors and is 
on the right course fitzwater said 
the september rise in wholesale prices would translate into an 
annual increase of 209 percent if prices rose that much each 
month the government said 
that is far above the 3 percent advance at an annual rate in 
the producer price index from january through july before the 
middle east erupted with august and september increases figured 
in wholesale inflation has increased at an annual rate of 63 
percent so far in 1990 the government said 
in september energy costs overall rose 138 percent the 
biggest onemonth jump since the government began tracking that 
statistic in 1974 the government said gasoline jumped 206 
percent while fuel oil rose 213 percent natural gas was up 13 
percent todays report said 
food prices meanwhile were down 09 percent after rising 08 
percent in august fresh fruit prices fell 36 percent while 
vegetables were down 48 percent 
egg prices which had soared 258 percent in august fell 70 
percent the government said 
costs were down for rice pasta beef and pork they were up for 
bakery products chickens and turkeys 
prices for goods excluding the volatile food and energy items 
often taken by economists as a better barometer of underlying 
inflationary pressures rose 06 percent in august this 
socalled core rate rose 03 percent 
passenger car prices were up a sharp 34 percent after having 
risen 08 percent in august the government said 
clothing prices were up slightly for womens mens and boys 
apparel but fell 07 percent for girls childrens and infants 
clothing footwear rose 04 percent 
tobacco prices rose 12 percent and were 136 percent higher 
than they were a year ago 
inflation at earlier stages of the production process was up 
sharply too largely due to the gulf crisis the labor department 
said crude goods jumped 46 percent while intermediate goods 
jumped 18 percent 
an example of the three processing stages would be clothing for 
finished goods cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude 
the various changes put the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1203 in september that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods that cost 100 in 1982 cost 12030 last month 
up from 11360 a year earlier 
the consumer price index which measures the price of goods and 
services at the retail level is due out next week 
analysts are worried that the current inflation outbreak is 
likely to become more entrenched filtering through to the 
thousands of plastic chemical and other products made with 
petroleum oil also figures into products that must be transported 
long distances and shows up in utility costs too

the machinists union at northwest 
airlines said today it is considering a proposal by northwest 
chairman alfred checchi that it choose between laying off workers 
or taking a 10 percent pay cut for six months 
checchi whose airline faces soaring jet fuel costs made the 
proposal wednesday night to guy cook president of the 
24400member international association of machinists at northwest 
the saint paul pioneer press reported today it quoted unidentified 
sources 
cook today generally confirmed the report but said the number 
of layoffs is up in the air he said figures of ten fifteen 
and 20 percent were all mentioned 
another possible scenario is management paying attention to 
some areas to cut costs cook said i have mentioned that to 
checchi 
cook said he planned to respond later today to checcis offer 
the union covers mechanics baggage handlers reservations agents 
and other ground personnel 
northwest would not confirm or deny that a proposal was made 
all i can say is the airline has for some time now been 
considering ways in which we can control expenses in light of 
higher jet fuel costs company spokesman doug miller said 
were looking at a number of possibilities but havent made any 
decision 
northwest employs about 44000 workers about 16500 in 
minnesota a 15 percent cut would amount to 6600 jobs 
other big airlines including usair pan american world airways 
trans world airlines and industry heavyweight american airlines 
have already announced layoffs to cope with a sluggish economy and 
a 65 percent increase in fuel prices the fuel price runup 
sparked by middle east turmoil could add 800 million to 1 
billion a year to northwests tab for fuel 
duane woerth chairman of the 5600member northwest air line 
pilots association union said he planned to meet with checchi 
today 
he said contract provisions with northwest do not allow the 
carrier to lay off any pilots until midfebruary the provision was 
triggered by the airlines participation in government programs to 
allow northwest pilots and jets to shuttle us troops to the 
middle east 
he said the provisions also restrict layoffs to pilots hired 
since aug 28 1989 union figures suggest only 273 pilots would be 
vulnerable to layoff after midfebruary 
if the goal is to prevent layoffs thats something we can 
help construct woerth said suggesting vacation schedules could 
be juggled to help avert job cuts

with companies so computerdependent how can 
they to business if a hurricane or earthquake hits or their 
equipment is knocked out by a power outage or busted water pipe 
mostly likely they dont unless they have a plan to quickly 
retrieve enough data to function 
but what good is the information when the company cant get it 
because the computer system is flooded burned leveled or the 
victim of a brownout 
thats where the disaster recovery industry comes in says ira 
josowitz who helped set up international business machines corps 
yearold 50 million business recovery services center in tampa 
recovery planning is becoming big business as sophisticated 
computer systems take over more of the corporate workload a wide 
range of businesses from mom and pop operations to industry 
giants have elaborate and expensive contingency plans they hope 
they never have to use 
you do it so you can continue to operate its good and 
prudent business said tom green of price waterhouse a major 
accounting and consulting firm 
tampa is a floodprone lightningprone brownoutprone 
environment if something can go wrong this is the place for it 
said green who is among ibms customers in the us canada and 
the caribbean 
ibm is a fledgling in the competitive disaster recovery market 
which traces its roots to the 1970s 
ibm got into the disaster recovery business last year to help 
customers prepare for calamities like hurricanes and earthquakes 
that can wipe out data and computer systems that are vital to their 
businesses said mike hill regional manager 
a company large or small can be back in business in a matter 
of hours at ibms hot site a corporate homeawayfromhome 
executives notify ibm theyre in trouble and retrieve critical 
backup tapes from a vault or storage site sometimes as far as 1000 
miles away they summon key personnel who will keep the company 
alive from the remote laboratory while recouping from the disaster 
at ibm three suites are ready more are planned next year to 
eventually accommodate 12 customers simultaneously the largest 
command center could handle a small army of corporate officials 
with 15 computer terminals monitors phone banks and ibm staff 
trained to assist 
a 5000squarefoot room is stuffed with communications 
equipment in 6foottall cabinets another room four times that 
size holds stateoftheart processors which can handle a billions 
of bits of information 
cost to a business for this riskinsurance is not cheap it runs 
from 125 to 50000 a month depending on company size businesses 
get 72 hours of onsite testing fire drills to work out the bugs 
if they declare a disaster and have to use the site theres an 
added fee of 50000 for the first 48 hours and 25000 a day for 
up to six weeks 
if more time is needed they can bring in equipment and set up 
at the facility free of charge 
among ibms 600 customers are insurance companies 
manufacturers retailers brokerage houses and service providers 
such as hospitals and municipalities eu 
ibm has another key site in franklin lakes nj and other 
smaller recovery facilities in chicago los angeles washington 
philadelphia detroit atlanta and one being built in dallas 
coopers amp lybrand a top accountingconsulting firm with 
operations in 104 countries has joined ibm in a disaster 
partnership to help customers devise a recovery plan a process 
which takes several months 
ibm provides the technology we provide the plan so the 
business can survive said leonard gilbert a miamibased partner 
for coopers amp lybrand 
gilbert said hundreds of businesses devastated when hurricane 
hugo went ashore last year in the carolinas didnt have a disaster 
plan and never came back 
these were the ones that didnt have files key personnel 
ready or a program in place there were no automatic tellers to 
withdraw money customers outside the disaster zone called in but 
lines were down or no one was there if they got through the 
customers went somewhere else gilbert said 
it all depends on how long you can be out of business with 
your computers down he said computers are the lifeline of 
companies today and a disaster recovery plan is something they need 
to have to survive

surging energy prices

the slumping economy cuts into cities and 
states tax collections turning up budget shortfalls that make 
municipal bond investors wary and intent on getting higher returns 
for their risk 
new york city philadelphia and massachussetts have been the 
most recent and widely publicized of those in the creditrating 
doghouse because of widening gaps between the costs of services and 
revenues 
standard amp poors corp last week placed new york city on its 
credit watch list meaning the bond rating agency is reviewing 
the citys ability to pay interest and principal on its 13 billion 
in general obligation bonds philadelphias debt meanwhile has 
been downgraded to junk bond status by both sampp and moodys 
investors services inc massachuessetts recent offering of 1035 
billion of general obligation bonds got a low rating that forced 
yields of nearly 8 percent at auction 
as credit ratings go down yields go up that means 
municipalities already struggling to make ends meet have the added 
burden of paying higher interest rates to borrow money 
investors have driven up the yields for new york city bonds in 
the past week for philadelphia the city couldnt even get access 
to the market for its annual sale of about 375 million in 
shortterm notes amid predictions by city officials that it would 
run out of money by dec 1 
the most serious problems have been confined to the northeast 
however there have been problems in florida as tax collections 
have been hurt by the souring housing market wouldbe immigrants 
to florida from the northeast have had trouble selling their homes 
tax collections have slowed in illinois michigan and ohio 
their manufacturing base and exports continue to do well but 
that may catch up with them said hyman c grossman managing 
director at sampp in charge of municipal bonds analysts also note 
some concern for southern california 
while for some cities and states the tide of severe economic 
troubles has yet to come others have been able to help their 
credit rating steady by keeping spending in line with revenues 
sometimes you have to put a leash on spending and its a tough 
political issue those who can respond without raising taxes all 
the time have the answer grossman said 
before management can lead a municipality through tough economic 
times there has to be the political will to make unpopular 
decisions said neal atterman vice president and director of 
municipal research at kidder peabody amp co 
management by the chief executive and a political meeting of 
the minds between the legislative branch and the executive as to 
how to deal with problem is key for negotiating a strong credit 
rating though economic uncertainty atterman said 
while the liklihood that some municipal bond issuers may miss an 
interest payment or two is growing the chances of a longterm 
serious default on any issue is remote analysts say 
municipal bonds are basically ious issued states and local 
governments to raise money to build highways bridges schools 
hospitals etc 
revenue bonds have been traditionally viewed as less secure 
because they depend on income from a specific project such as 
bridge tolls to pay interest and principal general obligation 
bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer who 
can draw interest and principal payments from general funds 
but it has been the general obligation bonds that have come 
under pressure lately partly due to the poor real estate market 
that has pushed down property assessments 
the slow housing market has been at the root of the northeasts 
problems analysts say but many cities and states are getting 
caught between programs mandated by a higher level of government 
and an eroding tax base

klm royal dutch airlines 
announced friday it was cutting 500 jobs and warned that rising jet 
fuel prices and a weak dollar could wipe out profits this fiscal 
year 
the company also may cut part of its foreign network as part of 
a 231 million costcutting plan over the next three years said 
klm spokesman hugo baas 
but an industry analyst said the measures were too little too 
late 
rob sweers head of institutional investment at the parisbas 
bank in amsterdam noted that the cuts represent only a small 
percentage of klms total workforce of 25000 
under the present circumstances it may not be enough he 
said 
prices of jet fuel have skyrocketed in recent weeks because of 
tensions in the middle east and all the major airlines have felt 
the effects 
at the same time the us dollar on which klms international 
ticket sales are based has been sliding to lows not seen in years 
baas warned that unless both trends are reversed klm will 
probably face a loss in the current fiscal year 
the airline also blames its troubles on the low cost of labor in 
the far east which allows competitors there to operate more 
economically we are living in a totally different social 
system said baas referring to the relatively high social 
welfare costs that boost european wages 
the layoffs will take place in the netherlands where 19000 of 
klms personnel are based 
klm had net income of 340 million guilders or 197 million in 
the fiscal year ending march 31

financial news network the 24hour 
businessoriented cable television service said friday it fired a 
top executive for improper financial dealings and dismissed its 
auditors 
the company said two other employees in the accounting staff 
were put on leave while fnn reviews their status 
chief financial officer c steven bolen 44 was dismissed 
following a board investigation that concluded he received 
compensation payments that were not properly authorized and 
that certain bank accounts administered under his direction were 
not properly recorded 
bolen has been on leave since summer when questions about 
payments to him first surfaced said sources close to fnn who spoke 
on condition they not be identified 
bolen who had been with the company for about five years and 
worked out of its los angeles office earned 185000 annually no 
charges have been filed against him 
bolen could not be located for comment 
fnn said in a statement that it believes all the funds have been 
accounted for fnn spokeswoman amber gordon would not comment on 
how much money was involved 
separately fnn and infotechnology inc which owns 47 percent 
of the news service as well as 97 percent of united press 
international said they have terminated the services of their 
accounting firm deloitte amp touche 
a committee comprised of fnn board members recommended the 
termination because it didnt think the firm would be able to 
complete the audit work in a timely fashion 
deloitte in turn notified fnn infotechnology and its upi 
subsidiary that the financial statements it prepared for them 
should no longer be relied upon 
deloitte said it was withdrawing its 1989 opinion of fnns 
financial health because of fresh information concerning some 
transactions between fnn and upi as well as questions about 1989 
financial statements by bolen 
fnn since has retained coopers amp lybrand as its auditors 
fnn provides business and market news and sports news on 3500 
cable systems throughout the united states and canada the company

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower friday on the chicago board of trade as selling pressure from 
the wheat market eroded the support of a bullish corn and soybean 
crop report 
wheat futures fell moderately amid speculative selling that 
reflected abundant wheat supplies and slack demand the same 
factors that have weighed on wheat prices for several months 
thursdays monthly agriculture department crop report contained 
slightly lower corn and soybean harvest estimates than traders had 
expected which gave those markets an early boost 
but a more significant number in the report was a prediction 
that us soybean stockpiles will fall from about 250 million 
bushels to 175 million by sept 1 1991 analysts said 
gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps floor 
operations at the board of trade said the stockpile number may not 
provide much support for nearterm prices but indicates that 
soybean prices may rise sharply over the next 11 months 
at the close wheat futures were 4 cents to 6 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 267 a bushel corn was 
2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 230 a bushel 
oats were cent to cent lower with december at 119 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cents lower to 4 cents higher with november at

representatives of the house and the senate 
cut 23 percent from the superconducting super colliders 1991 
budget friday as part of congress deficitreduction effort 
the size of the cut stunned the atom smashers supporters and 
threatened its longterm survival 
members of the house and senate appropriations committees cut 
the colliders budget by 75 million to 243 million the committee 
freed 25 million that had been set aside for later use on the 
collider an action that reduced the effect of the cut to 50 
million 
the cut will delay the colliders completion now scheduled for 
1998 and raise its cost proponents said and both those factors 
will harm its support in congress 
the collider housed in a 54mile underground ring to be built 
south of dallas would be used by scientists to study subatomic 
matter 
both the house and the senate earlier approved spending 318 
million on it in 1991 but that was done without an overall budget 
outline 
congress on monday approved an outline telling committees to 
develop spending cuts and tax hikes to meet a deficitreduction 
target of 45 billion in 1991 
the appropriations conferees had been asked to cut 750 million 
from the 1991 appropriations bill for energy and water projects 
the atom smasher still in the beginning stages of construction is 
10 percent of that savings 
randy erben director of the texas office of federalstate 
relations said state officials may consider making up the 50 
million but he added without the reimbursement guarantee wed 
be essentially buying a pig in a poke

its sweatypalm season in the american workplace 
squeezed by tough times more than two dozen major us 
corporations this year are slashing payrolls by several hundred to 
a few thousand workers each 
reflecting this upheaval the us unemployment rate worsened 
for the third straight month in september to 57 percent the 
first time since the 198182 recession that the jobless rate rose 
three months in a row 
behind these figures looms an emerging human toll that could 
have serious repercussions on american industry and the traditional 
bond between employer and employee 
as layoffs ripple through a range of businesses and geographic 
regions the newly unemployed are growing angry and frustrated 
people who still have jobs are worried about losing them 
the situation is exacerbated by the fact that these layoffs 
unlike the bluecollar upheavals of previous recessions are 
hitting whitecollar professionals and other groups that once 
thought themselves immune to corporate costcutting 
all of a sudden theres a whole class of young professionals 
having their hopes dashed said ronald s ebert a psychologist 
at the levinson institute in belmont mass 
the list of giants announcing cuts in recent weeks read like a 
whos who of corporate america chase manhattan corp pan am 
corp digital equipment corp ford motor corp and saks fifth 
avenue among others 
the hardest hit regions so far have been the northeast 
particularly new england the south atlantic region and the 
midwest 
one senior level executive who requested anonymity was earning 
well in excess of 200000 annually at a major midwestern 
packaged foods company when he learned he would be let go in 
september part of companywide layoffs of nearly 1000 workers 
morale in the ranks of many departments including sales and 
marketing suddenly plummeted he recalled 
people are looking over their shoulder and waiting for the 
other shoe to drop he said frankly i think it is getting in 
the way of the business people are concerned about whos going to 
be let go next and whether or not they will have a job the next day 
or next month or next year he said 
things are no better for the victims of the cuts many of whom 
have been left without jobs after long careers 
you can see the hurt in a guys eyes whos got himself an mba 
got himself two kids whove gone to college a house and wife up in 
connecticut making 170000 for last five years all of a sudden 
coming out with no place to go said mark altman president of 
ma management associates inc a new york city recruitment firm 
some dismissed professionals internalize the frustration and 
suffer depression counselors and psychologists say a few on the 
other hand may seek revenge 
its not often the employee sets out to do something terrible 
to the employer said nella g barkley president of 
crystalbarkley corp a new york career consulting concern 
but she said employees have a tremendous potential for 
disrupting the relationship with corporate clients by purposely 
messing up a companys product or by joining the competition after 
dismissal 
of course many companies remain gracious in the way they show 
employees the door 
friday was the last day for the procter amp gamble paper products 
co plant in cheboygan mich a small town on the shore of 
michigans lake huron all that was left for about 150 workers was 
to pick up their final paychecks but 130 others opted to be 
transferred to other plants in green bay wis and cincinnati 
pampg also expanded its retirement package giving benefits to 
workers whose age and accumulated years of service added to 75 or 
more 
im used to getting up and having a job to go to and putting 
my 40 hours a week in now its not going to be there said 
departing pampg electrical technician tracy heath 42 but its 
deer season i think we just have to keep a positive outlook

oil prices slipped friday to close below 40 a 
barrel after declining even more sharply during the day on a rumor 
that iraq was considering retreating from kuwait 
that rumor which spread through the market about midday caused 
oil futures prices to plunge by about 2 a barrel said simom 
trimble an oil analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
but us government officials later said there was no indication 
iraq was considering such a move causing oil prices to return to 
near their morning level analysts said 
on the new york mercantile exchange the novemberdelivery price 
of light sweet crude the benchmark grade of oil closed at 3969 
a barrel down 73 cents on thursday the same contract rose 173 
to close at a record 4042 a barrel 
later contract months were all down 
however prices of some refined oil products rose friday home 
heating oil for november delivery rose 51 cent on the nymex to 
close at 10536 a gallon unleaded regular gasoline for november 
delivery rose 113 cents a gallon to close at 9713 cents later 
contract months for both products were mixed 
natural gas fell 1 cent per 1000 cubic feetoon the nymex to 
close at 195 
oil prices opened higher friday morning after climbing in europe 
on word that the speaker of the egyptian parliament had been shot 
to death by terrorists trimble said that development heightened 
fears of increased terrorism in the mideast 
however other than the rumor about an iraqi withdrawal there 
was little news to affect domestic oil trading the rest of the day 
trimble said 
thomas blakeslee an analyst with pegasus econometric group inc 
in hoboken nj said another factor pushing down oil prices may 
be wariness by traders in keeping oil above the 40 level 
youre seeing a lot of resistance buying above this level 
he said the producers are comfortable with the prices where they 
are now and refiners are a little hesitant to refine at these 
levels 
but trimble said he did not interpret the price retreat friday 
to indicate a change in the direction of oil prices which have 
been driven sharply higher since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait

for all those kremlin rockers screaming i want 
my mtv their wish has come true 
starting this weekend that most american of youthful tube 
treats music television will be beamed to 88 million soviet 
households on primetime tv 
thanks to a deal two years in the making that was inked by the 
new yorkbased cable music video channel and the soviet television 
company gostelradio the hourlong weekly rockn roll show will also 
include several commercials from such us advertisers as la gear 
and wrangler 
its sort of another nail in the coffin in the cold war 
said tom freston chairman of mtv networks its certainly a 
snapshot of a subculture viewers have seen very little of 
in evidence that american rock music is a universal tongue the 
show and commercials are spoken entirely in english with only 
russianlanguage subtitles to guide young rockers 
mtv is the latest in a string of us cultural icons welcomed by 
the soviets since they began liberalizing their economy in the late 
1980s just in the past year purveyors of americanism ranging from 
mcdonalds to pizza hut to time warner movie theaters have set up 
shop in the soviet union 
the mtv programming included in a popular youthoriented soviet 
program called glance consists of two music video shows 
produced by mtv europe the mtv europe fare which is already seen 
in eastern europe will be broadcast for a year on soviet 
television according to the agreement 
european top 20 countdown one of the shows featured in the 
music program will be seen by viewers in 25 countries with the 
addition of soviet viewership freston said 
the other show featured on the program the party zone 
comprises this weekends debut program the episode will feature 
american rappers ll cool j and young mc 
while the program conspicuously lacks any soviet rock bands mtv 
officials say they expect to include some later 
none of the shows advertisers are currently distributing their 
products in the soviet union although wrangler and benetton are 
expected to begin shortly freston said 
but advertising experts say the publicity surrounding a us 
advertisers entry into soviet television may lend products a cache 
that could fuel sales in the united states 
in addition theres a lot of brand recognition among soviet 
consumers for goods they cant legally acquire and that in the near 
future they may be able to legally acquire said thomas 
remington an expert on soviet life at emory university in atlanta 
for its debut on the show la gear is showing a 30second spot 
that stars michael jackson wearing the highfashion sneakers the 
same lagear commercial that is shown in the us and in other 
countries this musiconly ad lacks any spoken dialogue so soviet 
views should have little trouble comprehending it said tom keefer 
vice president of international marketing at the los angelesbased 
la gear 
for the right to air its programming mtv will pay gostelradio 
an undisclosed amount of cash as well as two minutes worth of 
programming time that the soviet television company can sell on its 
own mtv retains six minutes worth of commercial time 
in addition mtv is currently looking into the possibility of 
running its programming on a 24hour basis on a 100000subscriber 
cable television system in leningrad as well as on several smaller 
cable systems

poland will send thousands of tons of food and 
tobacco to the soviet union to help alleviate shortages there in 
exchange for natural gas poland needs badly officials said friday 
the huge barter deal was negotiated during a visit to moscow by 
polish diplomats led by foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski 
skubiszewski met friday with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the agreement benefits both sides soviet consumers have been 
enraged by a lack of cigarettes and meat and polish officials have 
been working anxiously to assure supplies of fuel for homes and 
factories next year 
the polishsoviet agreement reflected new links between moscow 
and its former east european allies as they grope to define their 
economic and political relations 
the deal will not completely solve either countrys problems 
but it may avert hunger in some soviet cities this winter and help 
keep the polish economy from stalling as it shifts from communism 
toward private enterprise 
polish officials are still hoping to obtain firm contracts for 
deliveries of soviet oil 
for decades the soviet union provided a steady supply of both 
oil and natural gas to poland at subsidized prices but this year 
soviet crude oil shipments were cut by about 25 percent after labor 
unrest reduced soviet oil extraction 
also the soviets have announced they will put trade with their 
former east bloc allies on a hard currency basis charging much 
higher prices for oil and natural gas starting jan 1 
dariusz ledworowski polands undersecretary of state for 
foreign economic relations said friday the reduction in soviet 
fuel supplies and sudden rise in prices was a new shock for our 
economy 
under the agreement reached friday ledworowski said poland 
will deliver 10000 tons of butter 100000 tons of sugar 10000 
tons of milk powder 10000 tons of meat and 3 billion cigarettes 
to the soviet union this year 
he said the food and tobacco would have an international market 
value of about 120 million 
in return the soviets will provide 14 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas in the first quarter of 1991 he said those deliveries 
combined with 52 billion cubic meters guaranteed by previous 
contracts with the soviet union would meet 70 percent of polands 
annual needs for imported natural gas 
ledworowski said poland has been unable to obtain similar 
assurances for crude oil deliveries 
in gas we have a guarantee in oil up to now we havent any 
guarantee he said they the soviets are not in a position to 
inform me what they will be doing with oil 
in the past the soviet union has provided about 85 percent of 
polands oil to help make up the shortfall poland has agreed to 
buy half a million tons of crude from iran and has sharply raised 
domestic gasoline prices officials in warsaw said thursday 
as gorbachev has steered the soviet union toward a marketbased 
economy the old central planning system has broken down 
consumers face high inflation shortages of essential goods and 
workers in key industries have threatened strikes

a pullout by iraq from neighboring kuwait almost certainly would 
push down skyrocketing oil prices lowering inflation and improving 
the chances of lower interest rates all of which would help 
bonds 
the governments benchmark 30year bond gained 1 332 point or 
1094 per 1000 in face amount regaining all of a 9 drop 
thursday its yield which falls when prices rise sank to 895 
percent from 906 percent late thursday 
analysts said government reports showing a weak economy in the 
wake of rampant inflating pegged to the middle east crisis were 
somewhat better than anticipated and did not have a major impact on 
bonds 
the labor department reported that wholesale prices shot up a 
steep 16 percent in september an annual rate of more than 20 
percent but analysts said that excluding food and energy prices 
were up 03 percent about half of what was forecast 
also the commerce department said retail sales were up 11 
percent last month a better performance than anticipated 
moving the market though was a statement by a group of iraqi 
exiles that saddam is considering withdrawing from the emirate it 
occupied aug 2 the claim by the kurdistan democratic partyiraq 
was not independently confirmed its quite possible that oil 
prices could immediately fall 10 or more a barrel if iraq 
withdraws from kuwait said scott winningham a market analyst 
with stone amp mccarthy research associates in princeton nj 
if that were to happen it obviously would have positive 
implications for the inflationary outlook and consequently interest 
rates he said 
the federal reserve has been under pressure to lower interest 
rates to spur the struggling economy lower interest rates 
typically translates to higher prices for fixedincome securities 
such as bonds 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose 532 point to 516 point intermediate maturities 
rose 1132 point to 1932 point and longterm issues were up 1516 
point to 1 332 point according to telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 540 to 114676 
yields on threemonth treasury bills were unchanged at 736 
percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 714 percent yields 
on sixmonth bills dropped to 750 percent as the discount rate 
lost 1 basis point to 714 percent yields on oneyear bills fell 
to 756 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis points to 708 
percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 7 percent unchanged from 
late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds closed at 87 1516 up 932 point the 
average yield to maturity fell to 784 percent from 787 percent 
late thursday

the president of the largest union at 
northwest airlines told the carriers top executive friday that 
wage cuts are not an option in solving a cash crunch created by 
soaring fuel costs 
all we have said to this point is that were not interested in 
reducing the standard of living of our members by reducing our 
wages guy cook president of the international association of 
machinists district lodge 143 said were willing to work with 
management in almost any other form to try to find solutions to the 
problem 
cook said northwest chairman alfred checchi has asked the 
machinists union to choose between laying off between 10 percent 
to 20 percent of workers or taking a 10 percent pay cut for six 
months with no job losses 
i called mr checchi early this afternoon over the issue of 
wage cuts to inform him that has to be eliminated from the possible 
solutions cook said friday if layoffs have to be then 
management will have to make that decision 
but i think offering a leave of absence to more senior people 
would go a long way to alleviate some of that cook added 
northwest is not commenting on the details of checchis strategy 
to reduce costs kevin whalen a spokesman wouldnt even confirm 
friday whether checchi is seeking concessions from labor groups 
its pretty sensitive and i cant get into any comments 
whalen said its been no secret we need to look at how we can 
cut expenses 
cook said he delivered his message to checchi friday after 
consulting with union members there was no proposal for the 
rankandfile to vote on cook said 
he said union members have expressed a willingness to increase 
productivity and improve cost efficiency as a way to combat the 65 
percent increase in fuel costs 
northwest is the nations fourth largest airline headquartered 
in the minneapolis suburb of eagan it employs about 44000 
workers including about 16500 in minnesota if northwest trimmed 
15 percent of its total work force such a cut would equal 6600 
jobs 
members of the machinists union include mechanics baggage 
handlers reservations agents and other ground personnel a 15 
percent layoff would affect about 3300 union members 
other big airlines such as usair pan american world airways and 
american airlines have already begun laying off thousands of 
workers in an effort to combat a 65 percent increase in fuel 
prices the fuel price runup sparked by middle east turmoil 
could add 800 million to 1 billion a year to northwests tab for 
fuel 
duane woerth chairman of the 5600member northwest air line 
pilots association union told the saint paul pioneer press 
thursday he planned to meet with checchi friday woerth could not 
be reached friday for comment and whalen would not comment on 
whether a meeting occurred 
woerth said thursday that under contract agreements with 
northwest the carrier cannot lay off any pilots until 
midfebruary that provision has been triggered by the airlines 
participation in government programs to allow northwest pilots and 
jets to shuttle us troops to the middle east 
under its agreement with pilots he said the airline also is 
restricted to laying off only pilots hired since aug 28 1989 
that means only new hires who have been brought in at the lowest 
pay could be laid off union figures suggest only 273 pilots 
would be vulnerable to layoff after midfebruary 
if the goal is to prevent layoffs thats something we can 
help construct woerth said suggesting that vacation schedules 
could be juggled to help avert layoffs

a federal judge friday ordered eastman kodak co 
to pay to polaroid corp 9095 million for infringing on instant 
camera patents ending a 14year legal battle with what is believed 
to be the largest such award in history 
but in his ruling us district judge a david mazznne said 
kodak did not willfully infringe on polaroid patents for instant 
camera and film when it entered the business in 1976 
despite the record size the award was far less than the 12 
billion polaroid sought in its damages lawsuit against kodak and 
the 1 billion to 2 billion predicted by analysts 
kodak had said it should pay 177 million equal to 5 percent 
royalties on the instant cameras and film kodak sold from 1976 
until 1985 
us district judge rya zobel in boston in 1985 ruled that kodak 
had infringed on seven of about 150 polaroid patents on instant 
cameras and film she barred the rochester nybased company from 
the business in january 1986 kodak chairman kay r whitmore said 
in a statement the award would be paid from profits and would have 
no material financial impact on the company he said kodak was 
pleased mazzone ruled the infringement was not willful 
it has always been our firm policy to respect the valid patent 
rights of others and the avoidance of any patent infringement was 
uppermost in our minds in the design of our instant cameras and 
films whitmore said 
i macallister booth president of cambridgebased polaroid 
said in a statement that polaroid was reviewing the decision 
considering the significance of the injury to the company and its 
shareholders 
the statement did not rule out the possibility that polaroid 
would appeal the damages award and a company spokeswoman declined 
to comment 
booths statement said polaroids board would review how to use 
the damages money but will not announce how we plan to apply the 
proceeds when received until there is a final resolution of this 
litigation 
instant photography was invented by polaroid founder edwin h 
land in 1947 and first marketed in 1948 polaroid held a monopoly 
for almost 30 years until kodak entered the field in 1976 
polaroid argued that kodaks competition cut into profits and 
forced polaroid to sell some cameras below cost 
the two companies had a good relationship for decades with 
kodak making film for polaroid but things soured in when polaroid 
introduced the sx70 color instant camera in 1972 
when polaroid tried to work out a deal for kodak to provide film 
for its new camera kodak officials said they would do it if 
polaroid gave them license to create its own instant photography 
polaroid refused and built its own film manufacturing facilities 
the damages award was disclosed after the stock markets closed 
kodak shares fell 275 to close at 3525 in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading while polaroid shares lost 12 cents to 
close at 2937 
david s nelson an analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
in new york said the award amounts to a nearly 20 per share boost 
polaroid stock before taxes the difference is a major factor for 
the value of polaroids common stock he said 
but nelson added that some people will be disappointed that 
the damages with interest are less than 1 billion 
a 207 million damages award against smith international inc to 
hughes tool co in 1986 for copying drill bit technology is 
believed the previous record patent infringement award 
analysts have predicted that a sizeable award would allow 
polaroid to diversify into fields such as information retrieval or 
conventional photography 
kodak already has paid more than 100 million in cash to about 
34 million owners of its instant camera to settle a classaction 
lawsuit seeking cash as part of the companys settlement with 
people who bought the banned cameras 
kodak gave each camera owner a cash refund of 19 to 52 plus 
rebate coupons worth 18 to 30 for use on kodak products

will enable us to accelerate the momentum which has been building 
in our cultural diversity efforts since the grand met acquisition 
the programs that will be funded by this settlement over the next 
few years will improve opportunities for all employees 
paul sprenger lead attorney for the plaintiffs said he was 
pleased with the settlement but i am even more pleased by the 
willingness of grand met and pillsbury to step forward from the 
moment the case was filed to resolve these important issues in a 
way that maximizes the longterm benefits to everyone involved 
according to the settlement detailed in a consent decree filed 
in federal court in minneapolis pillsbury will allocate over four 
years 36 million including attorneys fees and expenses to or 
for the benefit of the settlement class 
the funds will be used to settle the claims of the 14 named 
plaintiffs and to pay awards to eligible former employees fired 
between 1984 and 1989 the funds will also support the cultural 
diversity department at pillsbury 
in addition the settlement will create funds to pay training 
and education expenses and dependent tuition scholarships as well 
as to support career development for eligible current employees

celotex corp citing a crush of 
asbestosrelated lawsuits announced friday it has filed for 
protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws 
kenneth hyatt the companys chairman president and chief 
executive said the filing in us bankruptcy court in tampa will 
allow it to resolve the lawsuits while continuing in the 
manufacture and sale of building products 
the decision to file chapter 11 was forced solely by an 
inability to continue to obtain insurance proceeds to fund the 
enormous costs associated with the massive asbestosrelated 
litigation said hyatt stressing that the company will continue 
its operations fully 
like other companies that once made asbestos celotex and 
whollyowned subsidiary carey canada inc have been fighting 
litigation surrounding the cancercausing insulation material since 
the early 1970s 
by the end of last month there were more than 140000 personal 
injury lawsuits pending against the companies in state and federal 
courts around the country 
settlement and defense costs for such suits have exceeded 587 
million the company estimated most of it paid through its 
insurance coverage 
but celotex said several insurance carriers have disputed 
coverage leading to more litigation to recover under the policies 
celotex said in a statement that through bankruptcy protection 
it hopes to be able to resolve its remaining coverage disputes and 
develop a plan which will permit fair payment of its 
asbestosrelated liabilities 
asbestosrelated cases form the largest number of personal 
injury lawsuits nationwide several dozen companies that 
manufactured asbestos are defendants 
the biggest defendant is the manville trust a fund to pay 
claims established as part of the reorganization of the manville 
corp once the nations largest producer of asbestos
