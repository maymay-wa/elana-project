president bush opened the domestic budget 
summit tuesday by calling the us economy not as strong or 
secure as it should be and urging fast action to trim a widening 
federal budget deficit 
at the same time bush assured the team of 21 congressional 
negotiators there was no immediate crisis participants said 
lawmakers who attended the onehour 40minute session at the 
white house said the president did not bring up the possibility of 
tax increases to cut the deficit nor make any other specific 
recommendations 
but he promised to share the responsibility with congress for 
difficult and unpopular measures to try to slash 50 billion or 
more from the deficit the participants said 
the new york times said in wednesday editions that several 
people at the meeting reported bush rejected a democratic request 
to make a television address to the nation outlining its fiscal 
problems and his proposed remedy the president was reported as 
having said that to describe the problem without proposing a 
solution a solution that cannot be put forward until congress 
agrees to it might cause a financial panic 
without specifying the format envisioned one participant told 
the associated press and others that bush basically expressed a 
willingness to help educate the public 
but it was clear that it has to be done in conjunction with 
the congress and hopefully when we arrive at some solutions 
here continued this participant rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee 
it was pretty clear that were going to share the heat 
democrats who approached tuesdays budget talks with some 
skepticism said afterward they were willing to join the republican 
administration in a fullscale assault on the nations deficit 
problems 
were going into these talks in good faith and with an effort 
to find a constructive solution said house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash were not going in with any other purpose 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he 
could not say whether bushs words to negotiators would diminish 
democratic suspicion that the administration might be setting a 
trap to blame democrats for tax increases 
we are going forward because we believe this is a serious 
problem confronting the nation that we must deal with in a 
responsible nature mitchell said speaking to reporters outside 
the white house 
deficit cuts of the magnitude being discussed by the president 
likely would require a mix of deep spending cuts and tax increases 
but in recent days each side has suggested the other would have to 
be the first to propose any tax increase 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said 
that budget director richard darman told the congressional 
negotiators that the deficit for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
would be 140 billion to 188 billion if the costs of bailing out 
the savings and loan industry are counted 
if those expenses are not included darman said the deficit 
would be about 138 billion range said sasser still far above 
the 64 billion target set by the grammrudman budget balancing law 
the figures were higher than the deficit estimates darman 
provided gop lawmakers with last week sasser said darman did not 
provide an explanation as to why the numbers had increased 
the administration has given us no indication of what the 
components of the solution to the problem should be sasser said 
bush declined to answer questions at a picturetaking session as 
he and other top administration officials met with the 
congressional leaders in the cabinet room pastries and coffee not 
taxes were on the bargaining table 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater afterward quoted bush 
as telling the negotiators that while there was no immediate 
crisis fast action was crucial 
we are fortunate that the economy continues to grow but it is 
important to act while the economy is still growing for growth is 
not as strong or secure as it should be bush was quoted by his 
spokesman as saying 
the american people are tired of seeing the budget process 
seem to fail year after year they would welcome our doing the job 
right and fixing the process at the same time bush added 
fitzwater said bush and the negotiators agreed it was 
important to reach an agreement as soon as possible 
bush cited rising interest rates lowerthanexpected receipts 
and the rising cost of the savings and loan bailout as reasons for 
extraordinary action 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo who will chair 
the meetings when bush is not present said there was really no 
discussion of substance about taxes by bush at the opening 
session 
gephardt said he was giving bush the benefit of the doubt in 
terms of his motives if we try to politicize it the summit by 
carrying on the discussion in public were going to destroy the 
effort gephardt said 
bush brought with him to the opening session vice president dan 
quayle treasury secretary nicholas brady darman and chief of 
staff john sununu 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan asked if the 
negotiators had moved closer or further from a tax hike said 
were not closer or any further to anything theres nothing on 
the table 
the talks are designed to avert deep automatic spending cuts 
that will take place this fall in the absence of action on the 
deficit 
the acrosstheboard cuts would be triggered if the federal 
deficit is higher than the 64 billion target set by law 
the administration had estimated before tuesday that the 
government will miss the targets by 45 billion to 55 billion 
and by as much as 100 billion if the true cost of the savings and 
loan bailout is added to the budget calculations 
the administration also hopes that congress as part of a 
comprehensive compromise will agree to overhauling and 
streamlining its budget process 
however congress seems unlikely to give bush two items that he 
has requested a line item veto and endorsement of a constitutional 
amendment for a balanced budget

the owner of a multimilliondollar candy 
empire accused of beating people with baseball bats in an effort to 
dominate competition in 30 states pleaded innocent tuesday to 
federal racketeering charges 
us district judge marryanne trump barry said the trial of 
candy giant gerald winters probably would begin in late september 
prosecutors say winters and his associates were responsible for 
a campaign of terror that included alleged beatings with baseball 
bats and metal pipes a kidnapping nine cases of arson three 
shootings and at least a dozen threats against competitors 
nine other people were arrested in the case and are free on 
bail winters is being held without bail because a us magistrate 
earlier ruled the businessman was a menace and dangerous 
winters alleged penchant for violence is in sharp contrast to 
the public portrait he had painted for himself in norwood his 
hometown 
after he established the first liquorfilled chocolate bottle 
factory in the united states venture magazine and the accounting 
firm of arthur young amp co named him entrepreneur of 1987 in the 
new business category 
winters a heavy balding man who was led in and out of court 
wearing shackles on his wrists and ankles sat passively as 
assistant us attorney victor ashrafi told the judge he would 
introduce tape recordings and bank records to prove the 
governments charges 
prosecutors say that winters controlled at least 20 related 
companies some with charitablesounding names the companies 
employed teenagers to go doortodoor but the money from profits 
ended up in winters pockets rather than with any charity 
prosecutors say 
defense attorneys asked barry to delay the case until next 
winter because they need to prepare the case which is expected to 
last three months they intend to call about 100 witnesses 
winters has hired highprofile attorney bruce cutler who has 
successfully defended reputed mob boss john gotti 
outside the court cutler said that he has just taken the case 
and could not comment on the charges he said he would offer the 
court a bail proposal to have winters released at a proceeding 
scheduled for may 29

only about a quarter of nursing home residents 
with major depression are treated for it chiefly because their 
doctors and nurses do not recognize the condition a study suggests 
its a public health tragedy said study coauthor dr barry 
rovner 
the medical director of a geriatric institution said the finding 
made sense to him but he added that new federal regulations may 
help staff members spot more cases of depression 
rovner an assistant professor of psychiatry at johns hopkins 
university in baltimore presented his results tuesday at the 
annual meeting of the american psychiatric association 
he and colleagues studied 454 patients admitted to eight 
baltimorearea nursing homes in 1987 and 1988 each patient was 
examined by a psychiatrist at two weeks two months and one year 
after admission 
the psychiatrists were looking for major depression which can 
include not only a depressed mood but also markedly diminished 
interest or pleasure in activities of daily life significant 
changes in weight or appetite insomnia or too much sleep 
agitation fatigue feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate 
guilt and recurring thoughts of death or suicide 
in the examinations two weeks after admission they found that 
57 of the 454 patients or 126 percent met the requirements for 
major depression fortyfour of those patients or 78 percent had 
not been treated for the condition at the home 
over the following year 33 new cases of major depression 
developed and 24 were not treated for the condition combining 
both groups only 28 percent of the patients received treatment for 
depresssion rovner said 
the nursing staff doesnt know how to recognize depression and 
the doctors see the patients once a month he said adding that 
doctors often overlook the condition as well the problem is lack 
of training he said 
another problem may be that when a nursing home resident is 
obviously depressed its wrongly attributed to an understandable 
reaction to being in the home he said 
rovner said he believed his results would apply to nursing homes 
in general because demographic characteristics of the patients and 
the homes matched those of national samples 
most of the nursing home residents had been admitted for 
conditions other than depression he said just over 60 percent 
suffered from dementia chiefly alzheimers disease he said 
rovner said he suspects that treating the depression would pay 
off in reduced health care costs depressed nursing home residents 
in his study declined in mental abilities faster than other 
patients and such declines may lead to more costly health care he 
said 
the findings on untreated depression are not surprising said 
dr steven levenson medical director of the levindale geriatric 
center and hospital in baltimore which includes a nursing home a 
geriatric hospital and a rehabilitation center the nursing home 
was not part of rovners study 
its been suspected for some time that depression is a fairly 
significant problem in the institutionalized elderly and that 
it may be missed or confused with dementia or underdiagnosed 
levenson said in a telephone interview 
in contrast to many other health troubles of nursing home 
residents its a treatable and potentially reversible problem 
he said its worth people looking more closely considering more 
carefully 
federal regulations that take effect oct 1 will encourage more 
careful assessments of nursing home residents he said the 
procedure will help staff members who see certain symptoms put 
two and two together and consider depression levenson said

vicki mercers job as a waitress at 
stellas goodie house was easier before this workingclass town of 
4000 became part of a study aimed at reducing heart disease in 
rural america 
they want dry toast now or a dry bagel or muffin she said 
and they want diet dressings on their salads but what really 
gets me is theyll order deepfried fish or chicken and pick off 
the breading or ill have to blot all the grease off with a 
napkin 
the fuss is apparently paying off for her customers who compare 
cholesterol readings blood pressures and body fat measurements in 
casual conversation 
when we started this everyone called us fat city program 
director bill reger said tuesday now were being recognized as 
one of the most fit towns in the country 
the results of the 33 million lifestyle modification study 
have been encouraging reger said 
twice as many participants exercise regularly compared to when 
the study began in may 1988 and nearly all 1000 participants have 
reduced their intake of fat salt and cholesterol reger said 
participants blood pressures cholesterol levels weight and 
other cardiovascular risk factors were checked every three months 
tests earlier this year found more than half the participants 
had lowered their average cholesterol readings by 15 points from 
2213 to 2063 a reading below 200 is desirable according to the 
american heart association 
their average weight dropped from 1694 pounds to 1664 pounds 
they also reduced their blood pressure by an average of 5 points 
and lowered their resting pulse rates by four beats per minute 
results of the studys final health screening in april will be 
released june 9 
reger said the most substantial improvement has been in the 
cholesterol readings 
theres no more red meat as far as im concerned said mary 
jo kull 68 whose cholesterol plunged from 266 to 177 i eat 
fruits vegetables pastas brown rice i even bake my own bread so 
i can control the amount of fat and fiber 
i put jelly or applesauce on bread instead of margarine 
the programs impact is evident at stellas and other wellsburg 
restaurants where steamed vegetables fruit plates and oat bran 
bagels have replaced mashed potatoes and gravy ice cream and 
doughnuts as favorites 
the study aimed at developing a health education program for 
rural areas was sponsored by the bayer co and glenbrook 
laboratories the aspirinmakers new yorkbased parent 
organizers said they chose wellsburg situated on the ohio 
river 45 miles southwest of pittsburgh because of its small 
population west virginia registered the nations highest obesity 
rate at 24 percent in a 1986 federal study

most muscovites are scandinavian cant buy 
vodka locally and would say its whistling volga boatmen to 
think that mikhail s gorbachev would ever visit the moscow on 
turtle creek 
still moscow next week will consider whether to send gorbachev 
an invitation to stop by when visits minneapolisst paul on june 
3 township board chairman richard ruble said tuesday 
ruble a 68yearold farmer who sees no irony in his name being 
the same as the soviet currency knows the chances of gorbachev 
traveling 100 miles south of minneapolis to minnesotas moscow are 
slim but youve got to be hospitable 
it would be a perfect opportunity for us to blow our horn 
ruble said though he initially was at a loss to say what 
accomplishments the township could boast id like to brag but i 
cant think of anything 
gorbachevs visit to minnesota comes at the invitation of gov 
rudy perpich who sent him a letter in february saying the soviet 
union could benefit from the us heartlands agricultural and 
technological expertise 
we even have a town called moscow in minnesota perpich said 
in the letter 
time was when there were big plans for the little burg 
there was a waterpowered sawmill and later a steampowered one 
a store with a post office a creamery a hotel a blacksmith shop 
and a schoolhouse said georges denzene freeborn county historical 
society president 
freeborn county heritage published in 1988 by the 
historical society said the first moscow store did a lively 
trade in spirits 
but the railroad went to austin and the village withered on 
the vine ruble said 
there are no liquor stores or other shops at all now in moscow 
and no one of russian descent as far as ruble and township clerk j 
michael taylor know 
theyre mostly scandinavian swedish and norwegian taylor 
said 
so how did the township get its name 
legend has it that when the township was being named a forest 
fire reminded locals of the burning of moscow when napoleon invaded 
in 1812 denzene said

an attempt to inject a little life into the 
traditionally drowsy world of cricket has unleashed a monster 
tired of dull drawn games english cricket authorities decided 
to give the batters a better chance against the bowlers by allowing 
them more time and changing the ball 
its as if someone allowed hitters more turns at bat and slipped 
rabbit balls into american baseball 
as a result english cricket batsmen have run riot 
during a hot sunny week in may they chalked up such vast 
scores that a scoreboard blew a fuse and records were shattered all 
over the country 
in cricket the batting side tries to score runs while the 
bowlers try to get the batsmen out one hundred runs by a single 
batsman is considered a big score and is called a century and 300 
for an entire side is regarded as a good total 
but in the first week of the county championship one player 
alone scored 313 another then hit 291 and a third ran up a 
staggering 366 
when the surrey team scored 707 spectators dozing at the oval 
ground in south london could not have been more astounded had a 
flying saucer just landed on the field 
but then the lancashire team struck back with 863 the highest 
in championship history this century 
on the same day essex scored 761 
the changes extended county championship games from three days 
to four giving batting sides more time to amass runs under the 
threeday system a team on a rungathering spree would often have 
to curtail its turn at bat if it was to have enough time to bowl 
out its opponents and win the match 
the test and county cricket board also altered the seam of the 
ball the seam enables a bowler to hurl a ball that behaves 
unpredictably and cricket authorities reasoned that a thinner seam 
would make it harder for the bowler to bewilder the batsman 
it worked but the big scores also caused headaches for the 
staff who handle the scoreboards when south african jimmy cook 
reached 199 for somerset against glamorgan the electronic 
scoreboard blew a fuse and lost count his final score kept by 
hand was 313 
lancashire had been heading for a firsttime 1000 runs and 
scoreboard keepers were hunting for hook on which to hang the extra 
digit 
the trouble was that after all that action nobody won the 
batsmen had been on the field so long there was no time to bowl 
them out and their scores tended to look not so much like major 
achievements as radioactive mutations 
the conditions have given batsmen a big advantage over 
bowlers complained essex club secretary peter edwards there 
was no chance of a result in our game 
huge totals are all very well but in the end they could drive 
people away from the game 
over the past few seasons it was felt the balance between bat 
and ball had gone too far in favor of the ball said tccb 
secretary tim lamb 
we tried to put it right this season we may find we went too 
far and everything has to be reviewed 
fortunately for him a hardy old standby intervened the 
english weather after the heat wave came heavy rain which forced 
several games to be abandoned and reduced scoring to its customary 
level 
for cricket lovers it has been a strange year from the outset 
first there was the unseemly spectacle of an english rebel 
team touring south africa in defiance of an international boycott 
and having its games so disrupted by demonstrators that the tour 
had to be cut short 
then the official england side actually won a match and 
against the west indies no less 
the west indians are regarded as the worlds finest side and 
england lost the fivematch international series 21 but to have 
won even one game after losing or drawing 24 out of their last 25 
internationals was an accomplishment that merited ecstatic 
editorials in england and copious champagne

english actor dirk bogarde returns to the 
screen after more than 10 years away in daddy nostalgie a 
french production shown at the 43rd cannes film festival 
directed by bernard tavernier the film screened monday depicts 
a dying man bogarde trying to rebuild emotional ties with his 
family particularly his daughter played by english actress jane 
birkin 
bogarde 69 portrays a man suffering both physically and 
spiritually knowing he is doomed and has lost touch with his 
family 
filmed on the cote dazur in sunny settings near and in cannes 
the poignant story concerns a bilingual family with the dying 
mans french wife played by french musical comedy and stage 
actress odette laure 
bogarde gives a strong performance as the father who wants to 
drink philosophize and live it up as much as possible before he 
dies 
bogarde who has been in semiretirement for 11 years writing 
novels and autobiographic works in the south of france said at a 
news conference that when bernard taverniers offer came through 
i took it 
the actor known for films such as night porter and 
providence said he had received few tempting script offers 
during his semiretirement and added that maybe this will be my 
last 
travernier said the bilingual aspect was key to the fim 
i used englishborn actors like bogarde and birkin because i 
wanted language to be a dramatic force in the film he said 
bogarde said for me the most tragic moment was when i said 
to miche his wife you never speak english to me any more 
tavernier who was praised at cannes for his 1984 dimanche a 
la campagne sunday in the country said bogarde and birkin added 
to the english dialogue as the movie progressed 
lets ad lib tavernier recalls telling his actors when i 
saw the crew with tears in their eyes i knew something was 
happening im proud of the film

senate judiciary committee chairman joseph 
biden says hell have a flagprotection constitutional amendment 
ready if the supreme court strikes down a law congress passed last 
year 
but rep don edwards head of the house constitutional rights 
subcommittee vowed just as fiercely to resist house passage of 
such an amendment lets say no to weakening the bill of 
rights he said monday 
these divergent views from two key democratic players on 
judicial issues set the stage for what lawmakers in both parties 
agreed could be a divisive new electionyear battle over old glory 
the supreme court holds the key to whether there will be a 1990 
flag fight on capitol hill it is expected to rule in late june or 
early july on whether to uphold the flag protection amendment of 
1989 thats the law congress passed and president bush signed 
in the wake of the high courts decision in a texas case that flag 
desecration is protected by the first amendment 
inside the marblecolumned court the administrations top 
courtroom lawyer solicitor general kenneth starr argued monday 
that the flag protection law does not violate free speech any more 
than a regulation limiting an outdoor loudspeakers volume 
congress can protect those things that are special to us as a 
people starr said nothing prohibits the legislature from 
protecting symbols against physical attack 
but civil rights attorney william kunstler said respect for 
the flag must be voluntary once people are compelled to respect a 
symbol they are no longer free 
the line of questioning by the justices gave no clue on how the 
court ultimately will rule it had struck down the texas statute by 
a 54 margin 
on the sidewalk outside demonstrators exchanged taunts and 
slogans 
shawn eichman arrested last year for burning a flag in 
washington said im just one of the thousands of women who is 
taking a cold hard look at the system defending us women have 
less protection than a flag 
six opposing demonstrators carried a sign saying flag burning 
is a hate crime 
biden ddel said he did not think flag burning would become a 
campaign issue in the fall regardless of how the court rules 
the majority of the members of congress want to protect the 
flag he said 
the nation will not fall because a flag is burned biden 
said but he also said that if the court strikes down the 1989 law 
he would introduce a narrowly worded constitutional amendment 
offering protection for the flag 
such an amendment fell 15 votes short of the twothirds margin 
needed in a senate showdown last october 
house speaker thomas foley dwash who strongly opposes such 
an amendment has said he will permit a floor vote on an amendment 
if the 1989 law is struck down 
edwards dcalif said he is pressing ahead with plans to line 
up the 146 house votes needed to prevent a twothirds vote for an 
amendment 
we designed a statute for the supreme court he said and 
we believe it will be upheld the idea of weakening the bill of 
rights is gaining little momentum across the country 
rep duncan hunter rcalif disagreed saying that congress 
passed what amounted to a good gardening statute that merely 
spelled out how people could lawfully destroy old flags 
the point is the court held that it was constitutionally 
protected speech and to meet the concerns of law a 
constitutional amendment is necessary hunter said 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis a member of the house 
constitutional rights subcommittee said many in congress want 
the supreme court to turn it the existing statute down so badly 
they can taste it because they want to make it a political 
issue

the united states could turn several small 
military facilities over to the philippines government in 
negotiations under way in manila a senior us defense official 
suggests 
its in our interest to be forthcoming said the official 
who spoke with reporters monday on condition of anonymity were 
prepared to talk about anything 
exploratory talks between the two governments opened on monday 
after a largely ceremonial opening session the two delegations 
began the first day of substantive discussions today 
at issue are the future of six us military facilities 
including clark air base and subic bay naval base the lease on the 
installations expires in 1991 
the official predicted the negotiations could take a year to 
complete but washington has made clear repeatedly that it has 
severe limits on the amount of financial compensation it can offer 
and is prepared to leave if the cost is too high the official said 
in 1988 the reagan administration pledged 962 million over two 
years to keep the bases through 1991 congress however cut 96 
million from the bush administration aid request for the 
philippines and filipino officials are unhappy with what they view 
as a breach of the agreement 
costs to relocate the facilities elsewhere run between 3 
billion to 4 billion the official said 
there are ways that we could go that have to do with a 
number of facilities that may no longer be required they could 
be turned over to the philippines he said 
the official said the united states was interested in hearing 
all philippine proposals 
while the united states is not interested in adopting a pure 
rentforbases relationship with the philippine government it 
would look more favorably on expanding the commercial relationship 
involving the bases he said 
he cited such examples as opening more of the ship repair 
facility at subic bay to ships other than us naval vessels and 
expanding the commercial use of clark air base to philippines 
airlines 
the official also said the united states was looking at the idea 
of providing the philippine military with equipment that may be 
removed from europe in the event of successful eastwest 
negotiations limiting conventional arms 
in any case the official said the united states is not 
entering the talks with the intention of giving up either clark air 
base or subic bay naval base or swapping one for the other 
its not our position to trade one facility for another 
he said adding at another point wed like to keep both clark 
and subic 
our bottom line is we want to maintain a military 
presence in the philippines the official said if that 
presence is something that we can change the form of and it 
would become more acceptable to the philippines were certainly 
open to change that form 
meanwhile us officials denounced the slayings of two american 
servicemen on sunday outside clark air base 
these despicable acts serve only to strengthen our 
determination to support the filipino people in their desire to 
live in freedom and democracy said state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
she said new peoples army communist guerrillas were suspected of 
murdering the men 
this is a case where they are trying to cause us to be so 
fearful that we would back away not only from the bases but also 
from our support for the philippine government the defense 
official said were determined not to let that happen 
asked to assess the stability of the government of philippine 
president corazon aquino the official said the administration is 
worried concerned in light of the attempts to unseat her 
after five coups now its hard to suggest that everything is 
stable and fine in the philippines the official said but he 
noted she was able to survive the multiple overthrow attempts 
which says shes a pretty tough capable leader

college students commit suicide at about half 
the rate of nonstudents their age and suicide rates at highly 
competitive schools are not significantly different from those at 
less rigorous ones an expert says 
allan schwartz chief of the university health services mental 
health section at the university of rochester said students are 
less likely than others their age to kill themselves chiefly 
because they have less access to guns 
he reviewed research monday at the annual meeting of the 
american psychiatric association 
recent data for college students show a suicide rate of six or 
seven per 100000 studentyears he said a studentyear is like a 
manhour 10 studentyears can mean one year for 10 students or 10 
years for one student 
the college rate is about half that for an agematched group 
composed equally of each sex he said 
two lines of evidence suggest that lack of access to guns plays 
the major role he said one is research suggesting that male 
students are only 24 percent as likely to kill themselves with guns 
as male nonstudents are 
the other has to do with the fact that guns are far more popular 
among males who commit suicide than with females who kill 
themselves if lack of access to a gun plays a major role in the 
lower suicide rates in college then the reduction should be 
greater among males than among females schwartz suggested 
that is in fact what research shows with the reduction among 
males about twice that noted for females he said 
whatever the pressures of a rigorous school no link between 
suicide rates and college competitiveness has been observed so far 
suggesting that if one does exist it is only minor schwartz said 
other findings also argue indirectly against any relationship 
he said student suicides peak in september march and january 
which are not the times of most acute academic stress he said 
those are the times of first experiencing separation from home 
or of going home or elsewhere where guns may be more available than 
on campus he said 
dr susan blumenthal a suicide expert at the national institute 
of mental health in rockville md said studies have shown that 
access to firearms does contribute to higher suicide rates 
she agreed that competitiveness of a college does not seem to 
play a role in its suicide rates more important might be 
perfectionism in the student himself which might set him up for 
the humiliating experience that precedes 90 percent of suicides 
she said 
she also stressed that suicides stem from combinations of 
several factors including psychiatic illness such as depression or 
psychosis drug or alcohol abuse personality factors such as 
aggressiveness and impulsivity biological factors such as 
deficiency of the brain chemical serotonin genetic factors and 
environmental factors such as loss of social support from leaving 
behind family and friends to go to school 
these factors can be countered with such things as good 
treatment for psychiatric illness the presence of social support 
such as friends parents and school activities hopefulness and 
good problemsolving skills she said

if the 1980s boom on wall street is over 
investors in the stock market evidently havent gotten the word 
despite inflation alarms recession warnings and a barrage of 
other dire predictions the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks synonymous to many with the overall market has surged 
ahead this week to record highs 
the dow industrial average which reflects the performance of 30 
blue chip issues rose 092 to 282245 on tuesday eclipsing 
mondays record high of 282153 the dow has risen 17740 points 
since april 27 
stocks have been changing hands at a pace reminiscent of the 
most exuberant days of the 1980s bull market which generated 
billions of dollars in wealth for investors 
provided that it doesnt fade as quickly as it blossomed some 
analysts believe the revived rally holds out a positive message for 
consumers workers and managers in many sectors of the economy 
they argue that the strength in the markets signals improved 
odds that the economic expansion dating from late 1982 still has 
some distance to run 
the economic data now support the view that the economy has 
settled into a slowgrowth lowinflation pace observed john 
connolly an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc that was not 
the consensus conclusion a couple of months ago 
indeed the prevailing fear in the financial world for most of 
early 1990 has been that inflation was accelerating quite 
possibility setting business on a course toward recession 
longterm interest rates as measured by prevailing yields on 
treasury bonds climbed from under 8 percent at the start of the 
year to slightly more than 9 percent four months later 
then the picture was suddenly scrambled by a labor department 
report on may 4 of much slower employment growth in april than had 
been estimated by private analysts on may 11 separate reports 
showed declines in both retail sales and producer prices of 
finished goods 
worried talk about inflation quickly subsided longterm 
interest rates tumbled close to 85 percent and the stock market 
took off 
in the span of just one week the economic outlook has been 
subject to a dramatic turn of events said douglas schindewolf at 
the investment firm smith barney harris upham amp co 
there are hopes that view will be reinforced wednesday with the 
issuance of the consumer price index for april advance estimates 
call for the cpi one of the mostly widely followed gauges of 
inflation to show a rise of perhaps 01 percent or 02 percent 
after much larger increases in the first three months of the year 
even if those expectations are fulfilled it remains to be seen 
whether stock traders will continue to celebrate the new trend but 
bullish observers say there is no arguing with what already has 
happened to stock prices 
a declining and relatively modest inflation rate combined with 
continued economic growth is always bullish for stocks asserted 
analyst stephen leeb in a recent edition of the financial advisory 
letter indicator digest 
leeb maintains that stocks and the economy also are benefiting 
from an increasing rate of savings in this country and from 
shrinking us budget and trade deficits 
the net result is that the united states is becoming more 
productive and more competitive he said 
some other observers arent quite as enthusiastic yet many 
acknowledge that the economic picture looks clearer and brighter 
than it did through the winter and early spring 
but they remain suspicious about conclusions that rest so 
heavily on data covering a very short span of time 
in addition they say what looks today like a smooth soft 
landing for the economy could start worrying the passengers if it 
shows any signs of turning bumpy 
the recovery in stock prices may have further to go say 
analysts at standard amp poors in their publication the outlook 
its too soon to say however that a new leg of the bull market 
is in progress

a new method of using natural predators to 
eliminate insect or plant pests has proven as effective as 
pesticides and far safer a researcher says 
the method called new association biocontrol involves the 
importation of exotic predators that feed on insect pests or 
undesirable plants said david pimentel professor of insect 
ecology at cornell university in ithaca ny 
nearly 40 percent of the successes in biocontrol today are due 
to these new associations pimentel said monday at a rockefeller 
foundation seminar on agricultural research 
in australia for example two species of prickly pear cactus 
introduced from texas and florida quickly got out of control and 
began to spread over the countryside 
insects that feed on cactus in texas and florida were imported 
to try to destroy the cactus but the cactus were able to defend 
themselves the control attempt failed 
then an insect that feeds on another prickly pear species in 
paraguay was imported the cactus had no defenses against an insect 
it had never before encountered the insects brought the cactus 
under control 
in another example of biocontrol hans r herren of the 
international institute of tropical agriculture in cotonou 
republic of benin controlled the cassava mealy bug an important 
pest in africa with the introduction of a wasp that preys on the 
mealy bug 
the need for such new methods of biocontrol is critical 
pimentel said because of the costs and hazards associated with 
pesticides 
nearly one half of the worlds food is being lost to pests 
despite all our efforts to control these organisms pimentel 
said the united states spends 4 billion per year on pesticides 
saving 16 billion in crops that would otherwise be lost 
but pesticides are failing over the long term in 1945 7 
percent of the us crop was lost to insects before modern 
synthetic insecticides were available pimentel said 
according to figures from the us department of agriculture 
insecticide use has increased tenfold but crop losses to insects 
are now 13 percent pimentel said 
furthermore pesticides are causing an estimated 12 billion in 
losses from contaminated wells and groundwater and 3 billion from 
other harmful effects on the environment he said 
around the world 500000 people are being poisoned by 
pesticides each year and 10000 die by pimentels estimate 
peter kenmore of the united nations food and agriculture 
organization put the figure much higher he said pesticides poison 
4 million people each year in nine countries he studies in asia 
worldwide my guess is its costing 100 billion to 200 
billion in harmful effects from pesticides pimentel said 
many of the costs are indirect american apple farmers are often 
forced to buy bees for example to pollinate their trees because 
pesticides have killed the wild bees that once did the job 
in india despite the use of insecticides to eliminate the 
mosquitoes that spread malaria the annual number of malaria cases 
has increased from 40000 in 1961 to 50 million in 1989 he said 
pesticide makers have argued that reducing reliance on 
pesticides would increase food costs for us consumers 
pimentel has calculated that cutting pesticide use by 50 percent 
in the united states would increase food costs only 06 percent 
and that does not include savings from the improved health of 
farmworkers and the improved state of the environment he said

lawmakers are optimistic that north koreas 
decision to return the remains of five us soldiers killed in the 
korean war will lead to better relations between the united states 
and the communist nation 
this is a humanitarian gesture at this time and we hope we 
can get into other areas at a later date rep gv sonny 
montgomery dmiss said monday of the first north korean 
repatriation since 1954 
montgomery chairman of the house veterans affairs committee 
will head a sixmember congressional delegation that travels to the 
border village of panmunjom on may 28 to receive the five sets of 
remains 
the delegation will then give the remains to the us military 
which will take them to a laboratory in honolulu for identification 
montgomery said north korean authorities told them that two sets 
of remains include military dog tags that should enable authorities 
to identify them quickly 
the defense department estimates that about 8200 us 
servicemen were unaccounted for at the end of the war with 345 of 
those listed as possible prisoners of war 
i am very hopeful that this will be the first brick if you 
will in improving the relationship which will mean literally 
hundreds of remains said rep frank mccloskey dind a 
delegation member said at a news conference with montgomery 
us officials have been working on obtaining us remains from 
the 195053 korean war since november 1989 montgomery said he 
credited the work of china in assisting the us effort and 
mccloskey acknowledged the help of the soviet union 
the united states and north korea have no formal diplomatic 
relations and the us military has 43000 troops in rival south 
korea to deter an attack from the north 
im looking forward to ending this chapter on the korean war 
and getting on with a better relationship mccloskey said 
in addition to montgomery and mccloskey the delegation will 
include reps james h bilbray dnev bob stump rariz bob

senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine says hell huddle with fellow democrats to discuss the 
future of us policy in angola which is opposed by some prominent 
black americans 
mitchell met monday with a group of blacks who said they want 
congress to end us support for the anticommunist rebels seeking 
to overthrow the angolan government 
failure to intervene to stop the carnage in angola would be 
inconsistent with the traditions of the democratic party said a 
statement issued by the blacks headed by randall robinson 
executive director of the lobbying group transafrica 
to us such a failure will raise serious questions about how 
the democratic party views the impact of american policy on african 
people and on the interests of africanamericans they said 
other at the gathering included richard hatcher former mayor of 
gary ind and bill pollard of the naacp 
mitchell said he and his colleagues would hold meaningful 
goodfaith talks with other democrats about us policy in 
angola a mineralrich former portuguese colony in southwestern 
africa 
specifically the black americans want 
an end to military assistance to the prowestern rebels headed 
by jonas savimbi 
an open debate on the merits of us policy in angola 
recognition of the angolan government 
robinson said us policy in angola was deplorable 
disgraceful at a time he said the soviets have sharply reduced 
military aid to luanda moreover the marxist government in angola 
wants better ties with the united states he said 
there simply is no logic or common sense to the continuation 
of a policy that results in the devastation of a country that poses 
no conceivable threat to american interests robinson said 
the united states with the support of the 
democraticcontrolled house and senate intelligence committees 
has provided millions of dollars in secret aid to savimbi who 
controls much of the southern part of the country 
robinson estimated as much as 80 million flows annually to 
savimbi and his unita guerrillas who have been fighting a civil war 
for nearly two decades the civil war has left thousands of people 
dead and wounded 
besides mitchell senators attending the meeting were alan 
cranston of california thomas daschle of south dakota and david 
pryor of arkansas 
the united states has called for a negotiated peace in angola 
along with free elections in which savimbi would be allowed to 
participate the two sides recently met in portugal

fewer dropouts are receiving high school 
equivalency certificates either because they do not take the 
general educational development tests or they cannot pass them a 
study said today 
the drop in the numbers of people taking and passing the tests 
combined with the limited gains in the nations high school 
graduation rate are a cause for deep concern said douglas r 
whitney director of the ged testing service sponsored by the 
american council on education 
individuals dropping out of high school now will form a large 
part of the work force for the next 50 years or more said 
whitney for them the ged is an avenue toward productive 
employment and participating in the life of the nation 
our failure to help these dropouts resume their education 
threatens our continued social progress and economic prosperity 
he said 
the ged tests usually are taken by adults who did not complete 
high school but want to prove they have acquired a level of 
learning comparable to that of high school graduates passing the 
tests usually qualifies adults for better employment as well as 
postsecondary education 
the councils annual report on the ged program said that 134 
percent fewer ged diplomas were issued last year in the united 
states its territories and canada than the previous year in 1988 
435318 diplomas were issued compared with 376879 in 1989 
the number of people taking the test fell 7 percent from 734087 
in 1988 to 682728 in 1989 the report said their average age was 
262 years and the highest year of schooling completed was the 
sophomore year of high school 
the report showed that more than 31 percent of the 1989 
testtakers were 19 years old or younger 38 percent were between 
20 and 29 18 percent were between 30 and 39 and about 11 percent 
were older than 40 also nearly 54 percent reported they were 
planning to continue their education or training beyond high school 
the number of people taking the tests dropped by about 19 
percent in kentucky indiana about 18 percent michigan about 19 
percent and ohio about 16 percent officials said the reduction 
could be partly explained by a general decline in population 
however officials said shifting demographics would not explain 
why growing states like california arizona and texas issued fewer 
ged diplomas in 1989 while pennsylvania with a stable population 
showed a significant increase 
the drop in california and arizona was about 18 percent and 
about 17 percent in texas the increase in pennsylvania was 19 
percent 
fourteen other states also had increases in the number of ged 
diplomas issued with a 71 percent gain in maine and a 16 percent 
gain in florida 
wayne patience ged associate director said the tests were 
revised in 1988 to include an essay and questions that test 
higherlevel thinking skills he said only 684 percent of those 
tested in 1989 met the score requirements for earning a ged 
diploma down from 724 percent in 1988 and 741 percent in 1987 
the education department recently reported a oneyear decline in 
the nations graduation rate after only slight improvements in the 
past 10 years the annual wall chart showed high school 
completion rates fell from 717 percent in 1987 to 711 percent in 
1988 
the 1980 census reported that more than 51 million adults did 
not have a high school diploma the number is expected to be 
greater when the census bureau issues its reports for 1990 next 
year officials said

the signing by the united states and iran of a 
105 million settlement of small claims rising out of the islamic 
revolution removes an irritant in the frayed relations between the 
two nations but leaves larger contested claims unsettled 
and the settlement of some 2300 claims of up to 250000 each 
does not address the major point of friction between tehran and 
washington the continued captivity of six american hostages held 
in lebanon by kidnappers with ties to iran 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler noted monday that 
president bush has said repeatedly that a good place to start the 
normalization of relations would be the release of all american 
hostages 
the settlement which was signed late sunday does clear the way 
for the iranunited states claims tribunal at the hague in the 
netherlands to deal with about 16 billion in major contested 
claims 
negotiations still are under way on about 400000 worth of 
small claims against the united states most of them filed by 
iranian soldiers undergoing training in this country who lost 
possessions when they were ordered expelled after the iranian 
revolution 
a senior us official who briefed reporters on the settlement 
on condition he not be identified noted that irans claims against 
the united states include some 10 billion for military properties 
he said that while the united states believes some of those 
claims have value for others running into the billions of 
dollars our view and the iranian view are far apart 
the settlement of the small claims must now be approved by the 
tribunal which was established under the 1981 algiers accords that 
set the terms for the release of the americans held hostage at the 
us embassy in tehran for 444 days 
once the tribunal approves the 105 million will be paid to the 
united states in one lump sum 
subsequent distribution to a large variety of claimants 
including many americans who lost their personal possessions when 
they fled tehran after the 1979 revolution against the government 
of shah reza pahlavi will be made by the justice departments 
foreign claims settlement commission 
the us official said there is no way to predict how long that 
process might take but experience indicates it could be as long as 
two to four years 
however us officials said payments will be made to claimants 
far faster than if the tribunal were to attempt to deal with them 
case by case 
the state department said that originally 2795 us small 
claims were filed with the tribunal which to date has decided only 
36 of them an additional 72 claims were settled by the parties 
themselves and approved by the tribunal 
the settlement agreement covers 2361 small claims still pending 
at the tribunal ten other claims were dismissed for lack of 
jurisdiction 326 were filed but voluntarily withdrawn and 415 were 
not forwarded by the state department because the filing deadline 
had expired 
under the terms of the settlement us claimants will receive 
about 50 million 
an additional settlement of about 55 million was earmarked to 
repay a loan to iran from the us agency for international 
development 
but officials noted that the terms of the agreements leaves the 
final distribution of the 105 million payment up to the us 
government 
remaining before the tribunal are irans claims arising out of 
the foreign military sales program and claims by us oil companies 
whose property was expropriated

black leaders say president bush will 
jeopardize his tremendous popularity if he vetoes a civil 
rights bill expanding protection against job discrimination 
bush met with more than a dozen black leaders monday in the 
first of a series of listening sessions on the legislation still 
awaiting final action in both the house and senate 
while the white house on monday backpedaled a bit from a veto 
threat the justice department made last month it still expressed 
concern that some provisions are tantamount to hiring quotas 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks jr said the civil 
rights groups agreed to have their top lawyers sit down with the 
administrations top attorneys to search for common ground 
but one adviser drew days iii said there is a tremendous 
gap that has to be bridged 
days a yale law school professor who was the carter 
administrations chief civil rights attorney said white house 
chief of staff john sununu had voiced concerns about ghosts 
walking about in the legislation in the form of business 
leaders fears of quotas 
bush spent more than an hour with the black leaders twice as 
long as planned 
the president would like to sign a civil rights bill and we 
will be working toward that end white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said before the meeting he said we are not repeating 
the veto threat 
the administration concedes that two supreme court rulings 
narrowing minority workers rights should be reversed and has 
offered its own legislation to do that 
but it is unwilling to go along with the civil rights 
establishment which wants to reverse a halfdozen rulings and give 
women the job protections that minorities now enjoy 
hooks called it a question of paramount importance to the 
black community he praised bushs past pronouncements on civil 
rights and appointments such as making gen colin powell who is 
black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
the president has acted in such a way that for the first time 
in my memory a republican president enjoys a tremendous 
popularity said hooks the civil rights bill in my judgment 
will become a litmus test 
john jacob president of the national urban league said bush 
has used the white house as a bully pulpit to preach justice and 
fairness and equality and we saw this legislation as an 
opportunity to put into action those words 
alixe glen a deputy white house spokeswoman said there is 
room for negotiation but there are certain principles that 
wont change 
the white house remains concerned that the legislation would put 
a burden of proof on employers so great that the only way of 
staying out of court is to have a quota she said 
bush will hold two more listening sessions wednesday with 
leaders of hispanics groups asianamerican women religious 
organizations and the disabled sununu is meeting separately with 
business and labor groups 
arthur fletcher chairman of the us commission on civil 
rights defended the bills approach saying it would mandate not 
quotas but goals 
youre talking to the person who wrote the philadelphia plan 
who put goals targets and timetables in the first plan that was 
ever issued 20 years ago said fletcher who was an assistant 
labor secretary in the nixon administration 
all businesses pursue goals said fletcher recently picked 
by bush to chair a revived civil rights commission 
robert woodson a black conservative attacking both the 
congressional bill and bushs alternative 
woodson president of the national center for neighborhood 
enterprise said the remedies would help only wellpaid blacks in 
unions or professions not poor unskilled blacks 
bush should go back to the drawing boards and really construct 
legislation that addresses the critical needs of people whose 
brains are being blown out in these inner cities said woodson

economists who predicted only two weeks ago 
that the federal reserve soon would nudge interest rates higher now 
say the central bank is satisfied with the inflation outlook and 
will leave monetary policy unchanged 
statistics that pointed to an economic downturn in april have 
dispelled some analysts belief that the economy would soon break 
free of its sluggishness of recent months 
they had been reasoning that renewed inflation would accompany 
any rebound and require the central bank to squeeze credit 
but now after looking at new economic reports in the last 10 
days they say the fed doesnt need to crack down at least for 
awhile 
the unemployment rate in april jumped to 54 percent from 52 
percent the first increase in nearly a year retail sales 
unexpectedly slumped for the second month in a row and inflation 
at the wholesale level improved for the third consecutive month 
if youre sitting at the federal reserve youre bound to 
breathe a sigh of relief after seeing those numbers said 
economist lyle gramley of the mortgage bankers association of 
america a former fed board member himself 
the central banks federal open market committee which includes 
the seven board members and the presidents of the systems 12 
regional banks meets behind closed doors today to set monetary 
policy between now and its next meeting on july 2 
my guess is the fed will decide not to change policy said 
gramley 
the federal reserve last pushed up the benchmark federal funds 
rate the interest banks charge among themselves for overnight 
loans in march 1989 when it hit 10 percent 
as concern grew that a recession was nearing the fed cut the 
rate through the last half of 1989 until it reached 825 percent 
then it paused waiting to see which way economic winds were 
blowing 
a consensus for a more restrictive monetary policy appeared to 
be developing but with the release of the april reports the winds 
changed 
the guys pushing for tightening pretty much got their heads 
handed to them said economist michael k evans a 
washingtonbased consultant if they raised rates now i would be 
shocked the economic statistics are just not pointing in that 
direction 
other arguments against a more restrictive monetary policy 
include the start of budget talks today between bush administration 
officials and congressional leaders fears of a regulatory credit 
crunch as bank examiners toughened their audits and international 
concern about the weakness of the japanese yen 
if the budget talks succeed in producing budget director richard 
darmans stated goal a 45 billion to 55 billion deficit cut 
the fed will have to stand ready to ease interest rates to provide 
economic stimulus against the dampening effects of higher taxes and 
reduced government spending 
but the central bank would look for results not just rhetoric 
before easing monetary policy analysts said 
the fed is not going to act on a political promise it 
will wait until it sees the whites of the eyes of an agreement 
said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co in new york 
he said another factor arguing against a shift to tighter credit 
was last thursdays unprecedented meeting between american bankers 
association and the nations three top bank regulators federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan federal deposit insurance corp 
chairman l william seidman and comptroller of the currency robert 
clarke 
it shows there is some concern that the banking system is 
tightening without being preceded by fed tightening jones said 
although fed members traditionally focus more closely on 
domestic developments currency exchange market movements also 
point away from higher rates 
a week ago finance officials from the group of seven industrial 
powers the united states japan west germany britain france 
canada and italy warned of the undesirable consequences of a 
weak yen which had fallen more than 10 percent since the start of 
the year 
the consequences include a deterioration in the us trade 
deficit a weak yen makes japanese goods more affordable in the 
united states and american goods more expensive in japan 
the yen has since strengthened but an increase in us interest 
rates could threaten the recent progress by making 
dollardenominated investments more attractive than those based on 
the yen

the bush administration is calling for 
increased effort to protect taxpayers from a nearly 800 billion 
potential risk posed by quasiprivate agencies that back loans to 
housing agriculture and education 
previewing a study to be issued later this month treasury 
undersecretary robert r glauber outlined the administrations 
recommendations for avoiding a savingsandloanstyle crisis among 
the socalled governmentsponsored enterprises 
at the end of 1989 taxpayers were standing behind 768 billion 
in loans and guarantees issued by such entities as the federal 
national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan 
mortgage corp freddie mac and student loan marketing association 
sallie mae he said 
the recommendations presented to the house ways and means 
oversight subcommittee on monday 
private stockholders in the enterprises should put more of 
their own capital at risk providing an incentive to operate 
soundly glauber said some of the enterprises are among the most 
thinly capitalized of us financial entities 
at least two independent creditrating agencies such as 
standard amp poors corp or dun amp bradstreet should regularly 
evaluate the enterprises they would be required to meet the 
standards applied to the healthiest corporations with a triplea 
rating those that couldnt would have five years to meet the 
standards or break their ties to the federal government 
the government regulator charged with making sure the 
enterprises operate safely should be separated from the regulator 
who makes sure the enterprises live up to their original purpose 
for instance the department of housing and urban development would 
continue to ensure that the mortgage and home loan associations 
provide affordable housing but some other agency that has no 
interest in promoting housing should make sure they dont go 
bankrupt 
the value of government support for the enterprises should be 
disclosed because of the governments implied backing the 
enterprises can borrow at interest rates far below those paid by 
comparable fully private corporations congress and taxpayers 
should be told how much this backing is worth so they can decide 
whether its being put to good use 
glauber declined to comment on the soundness of specific 
governmentsponsored enterprises but in response to a question 
from the subcommittee chairman rep jj pickle dtexas he 
conceded that many would not receive a triplea rating 
the general accounting office congress auditing agency which 
is also studying the enterprises testified that none of the 
enterprises appears near failure 
nevertheless prudence dictates that the government not wait 
for a crisis before protecting its interests said richard l 
fogel assistant comptroller general at the gao 
an enterprise experiencing serious financial difficulties 
could pose tough and possibly expensive decision for the congress 
like those faced in the farm credit and thrift crises he said 
no one wants to see those experiences repeated 
government oversight is adequate for some of the enterprises 
but not for three of the largest fannie mae freddie mac and 
sallie mae fogel said 
david maxwell fannie mae president said in response that his 
organization welcomes strong government supervision and standards 
but he questioned whether private creditrating agencies were in 
the best position to evaluate the soundness of governmentsponsored 
enterprises and whether requiring a triplea rating was reasonable 
the eight enterprises included in the studies and the areas they 
finance are farm credit banks agriculture banks for 
cooperatives agriculture federal home loan banks housing 
federal national mortgage association fannie mae housing 
federal home loan mortgage corp freddie mac housing student 
loan marketing association sallie mae education college 
construction loan insurance association connie lee education 
and federal agriculture mortgage corp farmer mac agriculture

the federal election commission dismissed a 
democratic party allegation that a political action committee for 
foreigncar dealers made more than 800000 in illegal donations to 
two republican senate campaigns in 1988 
the commissions lawyers urged the panel to open an enforcement 
action based on the allegations against one of the campaigns that 
of florida sen connie mack but that recommendation was rejected 
by the fecs three republican members quashing the complaint 
macks campaign agreed to pay a 3500 fine to settle a lesser 
allegation that it violated disclosure laws by not listing the 
occupations and addresses of donors in its final preelection 
fundraising reports to the fec 
the agencys decisions on the major allegations in the complaint 
filed by the democratic senatorial campaign committee were made in 
a closed meeting six months ago but they were not made public 
until monday because of the confidential negotiations with the mack 
campaign on the lesser allegation 
the case involved the auto dealers and drivers for free trade 
pac which spent nearly 3 million to influence 1988 congressional 
elections relying heavily on socalled independent expenditures 
the fecs general counsel had urged the commission to accuse the 
auto dealers pac and the mack campaign of violating election laws 
that recommendation said there was reason to believe a 326000 
advertising campaign by the pac supporting mack did not qualify as 
an independent expenditure and therefore was an illegal 
contribution 
but the sixmember commissions three republican appointees 
refused to accept the recommendation four votes are needed for the 
panel to begin an enforcement action 
the commission voted 50 to accept the general counsels 
recommendation that it dismiss the portion of the democratic 
senatorial committees complaint alleging the auto dealers pacs 
521000 effort on behalf of thensen chic hecht rnev was 
coordinated with hechts campaign hecht lost his race with 
democrat richard bryan 
the fec attorneys said that while the pacs ads were similar to 
official campaign ads there was no evidence of coordination 
the democratic committees electioneve complaint alleged the 
spending by the auto dealers pac on behalf of mack was illegal 
because there was coordination between the pac and campaign 
mack was in a close race with democratic rep buddy mckay and 
the committee unsuccessfully sought a preelection ruling from the 
fec ordering the pacs florida advertisements off the air mack 
ultimately won by just 35000 votes of more than 4 million cast 
pacs and other groups are allowed to pay for ads and other 
materials supporting or opposing candidates but such efforts 
qualify as independent expenditures only if there is no contact or 
coordination with the campaigns 
if there is coordination the ads would be considered 
contributions and subject to limits the dealers pac already had 
donated the maximum amounts to mack and hecht before launching the 
advertising campaigns 
in its complaint the democratic committee said the pac and mack 
campaigns both had hired the same advertising firm multimedia 
and a texasbased political consultant karl rove 
in response the dealers pac said it retained multimedia and 
rove for 1988 campaign activities but hired a separate firm for the 
florida ads to avoid any conflicts still the fec general counsel 
said the pac failed to prove there was no coordination and 
recommended that the commission open an enforcement case 
the commissions reasons for rejecting the recommendation were 
unclear the panel traditionally includes in the public record a 
statement explaining its vote but it has yet to do so

attorney general dick thornburgh is 
reassigning two top aides in an apparent attempt to erase the 
impression that he runs the justice department through a tight 
circle of political loyalists 
robert s ross jr the attorney generals chief of staff was 
assigned monday to organize a new office of international affairs 
within the department before returning to private law practice in 
two or three months said senior department officials 
david runkel thornburghs press secretary who has been 
repeatedly accused by reporters of providing misleading and 
inaccurate information will no longer serve as the departments 
chief spokesman said the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
runkel has been appointed chief of communications and thornburgh 
will soon select a new spokesman officials said 
the realignment is intended to transfer much of the 
decisionmaking power within the justice department from 
thornburghs personal staff to the deputy attorney general 
officials said 
the moves were announced three days after deputy attorney 
general donald b ayer who has held the no 2 post in the 
department for only six months announced plans to resign effective 
may 25 
ayer quit because he was frustrated with the lack of operating 
authority he was given by thornburgh said an administration source 
who described ross as the real deputy attorney general 
the officials said thornburgh plans to give his new choice to be 
deputy attorney general william p barr the operating authority 
traditionally conferred on the holder of that office 
barrs appointment by president bush will give thornburgh the 
opportunity to make the longcontemplated changes the officials 
said barr an assistant attorney general will serve as the acting 
deputy while his nomination is pending in the senate 
it was never his thornburghs intention to have a small 
personal staff attempting to run the department said one 
official 
but since he took office in august 1988 late in the reagan 
administration thornburgh had relied on a small cadre of aides who 
served him when he was governor of pennsylvania 
ross and runkel are members of a trio of longtime aides who 
formed what many justice department career officials came to call 
the harrisburg mafia murray dickman the third member of the 
triumvirate will remain on thornburghs staff 
lowerranking officials have complained of the difficulty 
getting quick decisions from thornburghs office because they found 
it difficult to pierce the inner circle 
when the dust settles you are going to see a washington team 
in place one official said of the changes 
ayers resignation announcement came two weeks after it was 
disclosed that thornburgh had ordered him to withdraw a letter 
expressing justice department support for proposed sentencing 
guidelines for corporations convicted of crimes 
thornburghs aides said the attorney general had not authorized 
ayers letter other officials however said ayers letter merely 
expressed a longstanding department policy now being questioned by 
the white house 
an fbi investigation ordered by thornburgh into the unauthorized 
leak of information about a criminal probe involving the office of 
rep william h gray iii dpa identified runkel as a secondary 
source of the news story 
while thornburgh defended his longtime aide the disclosure of 
runkels role in the episode was a political embarrassment

list she said i sent away for dry flies from a mail order 
company and put it in maxs name so the the flies could be a

its baaaaaaack the return of the 
twoheaded calf 
the publics fascination with a mounted twoheaded calf has led 
a museum to put the oddity back on display beginning today 
the calf died at birth in 1922 and its heads were mounted and 
displayed at the west overton museum from about 1930 to 1987 said 
director kimberly bringe the oddity was popular among museum 
visitors especially children 
still ms bringe thought no one would notice when she put the 
calf away because it was deteriorating 
she was wrong parents who had seen the calf as children 
repeatedly asked about its whereabouts and several people offered 
to buy it 
i think people are naturally attracted to oddities ms 
bringe said of the thousands of displays and artifacts we have 
here people always want to see the twoheaded calf its like 
a shrine i call it the divine bovine 
the calf reconditioned by a taxidermist is being put on 
display in the childrens area each year about 3000 people visit

alexander dubcek says he is satisfied he did 
the right thing in pressing prague spring reforms that brought 
on the 1968 sovietled invasion and a generation of hardline 
communist rule for czechoslovakia 
i wouldnt have done it differently i can face the people 
in the public squares today unlike nowdiscredited leaders swept 
out of power in his and other east european countries the past 
year dubcek said at a news conference monday 
dubcek czechoslovak communist party chief at the time of the 
invasion was restored in pragues peaceful revolution last winter 
to the post of federal assembly president after living for two 
decades in political oblivion 
after the news conference dubcek gave vice president dan quayle 
his suggestion how lithuania and other baltic republics should 
handle their quest for independence for soviet rule 
they should engage moscow in prolonged negotiations and take 
pains to avoid provoking the soviet military he was quoted as 
saying by a bush administration source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the talk with quayle concluded the first visit to north america 
by dubcek who was returning home aboard a special czechoslovak 
government plane 
asked if he felt the 1968 invasion was triggered by reforms 
being too bold or too cautious dubcek said his 1968 policies 
derived from reality and were not dependent on personal 
approach 
czechoslovak traditions of democracy and scientific and 
industrial skills made it ripe for change in 1968 although we 
attempted something not possible for us to reach at that time he 
said 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev deserves help and 
understanding in his reform efforts dubcek said 
he appealed for understanding of gorbachevs difficult 
legacy of economic domestic and foreign relations problems 
it is necessary to alter views about the soviet union and not 
be against everything there he said adding that the soviet 
union needs help in many fields diplomatic economic and political 
first of all 
czechoslovak and soviet conditions are very different he said 
but the two countries today share aims of democratization 
decentralizing their economies and easing divisions between the 
people and the state 
dubcek he said he is against collective guilt apparently 
meaning ousted communists should be judged by specific actions not 
party membership he said measures are being taken to recover 
wrongly diverted public funds 
efforts are being made to identify those former comrades who 
signed the letter inviting warsaw pact armies to intervene in 
czechoslovakia dubcek said but he added that it doesnt really 
matter how many signatures there were because nothing can 
justify the invasion which was the doing of the respective 
countries a decision of the governments of the participating 
countries 
czechoslovakia was invaded by units from poland hungary east 
germany and bulgaria in addition to the soviet union

the accounting firm price waterhouse is being 
required to give a partnership and back pay to a woman who argued 
that she was denied the promotion because she was not sufficiently 
ladylike 
the decision monday by us district judge gerhard gesell could 
mean ann hopkins will become a partner in the firm on july 1 and 
receive up to 400000 in back pay according to james h heller 
one of her attorneys 
shes won her case heller said if they will take her 
back thats what she wants to do 
heller said he believed this to be the first time a federal 
judge has ordered a firm to make someone a partner 
ms hopkins formerly a senior manager at price waterhouse left 
the firm in 1984 and has worked as a consultant to the world bank 
price waterhouse has not indicated whether it will appeal 
heller said 
the case already has been to the supreme court which ruled 63 
last may that employers must bear the burden of proving they did 
not discriminate illegally once there is evidence bias played a 
part in personnel decisions 
gesell earlier had decided that there was evidence that price 
waterhouse discriminated against ms hopkins but he also found 
that the firm had other reasons which could have been grounds for 
denying her the promotion 
the supreme court decision sent the case back to gesell for 
further hearings based on the altered standard of proof

more than 27000 hyundai workers 
demanding higher pay and a shorter work week struck the countrys 
largest auto plant today halting production at the facility in the 
port city of ulsan 
the walkout came only a week after the plant 200 miles 
southeast of seoul reopened at the end of a weeklong strike that 
work stoppage was in protest of the april 28 police crackdown on 
strikers at the nearby hyundai heavy industries co shipyard 
union and company officials at the plant which produces 2600 
vehicles a day said about 22800 workers showed up at the plant 
for a solidarity rally and followed the unions decision the 
previous night to launch an indefinite strike 
the remaining 4200 workers on strike worked the night shift and 
would be staying home today the action shut down production at the

a synthetic version of an aids virus fragment 
may be tested later this year to determine whether it can protect 
unborn babies from developing aids 
dr arye rubinstein professor at the albert einstein college of 
medicine in new york said monday that studies in his lab have 
shown that mothers infected with human immunodefiency virus 
hivthat causes aids will not pass the disease to their unborn if 
their immune system develops a particular type of antibody 
rubinstein said the bodys immune system makes this antibody in 
response to a specific protein found in the gp120 molecule which 
is part of the surface of the hiv virus 
in a paper published in the may issue of the proceedings of the 
national academy of sciences rubinstein said his laboratory was 
able to correctly identify infants who would become hivinfected by 
assessing the level of this pnd antibody in their blood of their 
mothers 
in a talk monday at the town forum on aids sponsored by the 
institute for advanced studies in immunology and aging rubinstein 
said his group plans to conduct trials later this year of a vaccine 
that uses a synthetic version of the pnd protein

georgias communist party leader rejected 
nationalist demands for immediate independence saying such a move 
would jeapardize democratic reform introduced by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the partys stance toward independence is expected to be a key 
issue at the georgian party congress which opens today just 13 
months after 20 people died in clashes between soviet troops and 
proindependence demonstrators in tbilisi the republics capital 
givi gumbaridze who became the georgian party leader after the 
april 1989 clashes said he opposed calls for independence similar 
to declarations recently made by the baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia he has advocated more autonomy for the southern 
soviet republic but not immediate independence 
gumbaridze in an interview published monday by the national 
communist party newspaper pravda said those who sought an 
immediate political and economic break with the soviet union could 
only upset the process of democratization known as perestroika 
initiated by gorbachev 
political boldness and political rashness are absolutely 
different things that exclude each other he said 
some people are eager to seize power by means of 
ultrapatriotic calls for immediate independence gumbaridze 
said elsewhere he said some top officials refuse to give up 
privileges and allow the party to renovate itself 
the only way to real independence and economic prosperity is 
to build a new genuinely democratic society without renouncing 
everything already achieved gumbaridze said 
gumbaridze said the communist party should still be viewed as 
the leading political force in the republic even though the 
georgian supreme soviet in march removed the constitutional article 
that granted the party a monopoly on political power 
some people are forgetting that it was the communist party 
that stopped the sliding of our country to a catastrophe gave the 
green light to perestroika and opened the way to glasnost and 
democracy gumbaridze said 
gumbaridze said the congress would set the party on a course 
that will provide georgia with political and cultural growth and 
a moral revival of the people 
but mamuka tsagareli a spokesman for the radical party of 
national independence in the republic said georgias communist 
party ought to disband 
the communist party of georgia is a criminal organization 
which has utterly discredited itself for the 70 years of the 
communist regime in georgia tsagareli said 
tsagareli said his group which advocates georgian independence 
from the soviet union was not planning any action today because it 
does not want to interfere with the actions of another political 
party and it is too busy preparing for its own congress on may 23

reformminded legislators condemn a newly approved 
bill making it a crime to insult or slander the soviet president 
saying the measure could be used to terrorize and persecute 
government opponents 
the supreme soviet passed the measure protecting the honor and 
dignity of the president on monday less than two weeks after an 
unofficial may day protest in red square that saw thousands jeer 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other leaders 
alexander n yakovlev a close aide to gorbachev has said the 
soviet leadership was insulted by the demonstration 
the new bill provides for a fine of up to 3000 rubles about 
5000 at the official exchange rate or two years in a labor camp 
or three years in jail for slandering or insulting the president 
an offense conducted with the help of the news media could be 
punishable by a jail term of up to six years tass said it said a 
newspaper radio or tv station carrying such material could be 
fined up to 25000 rubles about 41600 and be suspended from 
broadcasting or publishing 
it is not aimed at the protection of the presidents dignity 
and honor it opens up a possibility to persecute undesirable 
citizens said progressive deputy sergei belozertsev i am 
afraid a wave of terror and repressions set off by this unfortunate 
law will sweep the country in the near future 
the bill has an accompanying resolution expected to be passed 
today stating remarks critical of the president and his policies 
should not be confused with insults or slander belozertsev said 
but it remains unclear how legitimate criticism will be 
separated from insults or slander in a country that has a long 
history of laws to stifle dissent 
who is to decide what is an insult asked belozertsev who 
opposed the measure he called ignorant and reactionary 
ilmars bisers deputy chairman of the council of nationalities 
said the law places the interpretive powers into the hands of local 
judges 
gorbachev who on march 15 was elected to a more powerful 
presidency has said he wants to use the office as a unifying force 
for the entire country but criticism of his policies and pressures 
from several republics for autonomy or outright secession have 
become even more acute since gorbachev took the post

east germanys defense and disarmament 
minister says the future of the disintegrating sovietled warsaw 
pact could be decided at a meeting of the alliance next month 
it now appears as though the warsaw pact is in the process of 
dissolving itself said the minister rainer eppelmann whether 
it has a militarypolitical future depends on the meeting of the 
disarmament and defense ministers on june 7 
he did not specify where the meeting will be held 
eppelmann a lutheran pastor was named east germanys defense 
and disarmament minister last month in the countrys first 
noncommunist government 
he said other eastern european countries were questioning their 
role in the warsaw pact 
the hungarians have signaled that they want to leave the pact 
the czechs want to let it stagnate and with the poles its not 
clear eppelmann said 
the minister said he told his soviet hosts on a recent visit to 
moscow that a german republic cannot belong to the warsaw pact 
eppelmanns remarks carried by east germanys official adn news 
agency were some of the most pointed comments to date from within 
the sevennation warsaw pact 
bulgaria and romania are the two other members 
questions have been increasing about the continued existence of 
the military alliance since a democratic upheaval swept eastern 
europe last year 
facing growing pressure at home soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev has been yielding control over moscows longtime allies 
in europe 
east germany was one of the soviet unions staunchest allies 
under the german states former hardline communist leaders 
eppelmann said it will be necessary to hold the warsaw pact 
together as a political alliance at least for an interim period 
he said he was pressing for a total european solution to 
defense issues 
moscow officials already have proposed the breakup of the 
opposing military alliances the north atlantic treaty organization 
and the warsaw pact but those proposals have been met with 
skepticism in washington 
europeans in recent months have been talking increasingly about 
a continental solution for security issues as the various nations 
come closer together 
the question of military alliances and allegiances is a major 
point in the continuing german unification talks 
moscow says a united germany cannot remain in nato the united 
states west germany and their allies insist on such a membership 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has 
offered to let soviet troops stay in what is now east germany for a 
limited time during the unification process 
in addition the bonn government is now negotiating a possible 
takeover of some of the costs of maintaining the 380000 soviet 
troops in east germany once the west german mark becomes the 
currency for both countries on july 2

hoping to deflect charges of racism against 
arizona gov rose mofford has called the legislature into special 
session to create a new martin luther king holiday 
the bill would designate both king day and columbus day as paid 
holidays for state employees it would wipe out a bill signed by 
mrs mofford last year to create a paid king day by making columbus 
day an unpaid holiday 
the kingforcolumbus bill so angered king opponents and 
columbus supporters that they joined forces and gathered nearly 
twice the needed signatures to have the law suspended pending a 
referendum this november 
a senate committee was to hold a hearing on the new measure 
today while legislative leaders predicted passage before weeks 
end opponents vowed to gather at least 43350 signatures and force 
a referendum after all 
among those pressing for a referendum is former republican gov 
evan mecham who was removed by impeachment in 1987 and is running 
for governor again 
fortyseven states have some sort of official holiday honoring 
king arizona has an unpaid holiday for him proclaimed by mecham 
the third sunday in january 
the other states without official king holidays are montana and 
new hampshire 
mrs mofford mechams successor been pushing for the new bill 
she said lawmakers should settle the issue rather than put it on 
the ballot for all arizonans to decide weve never voted on a 
holiday before she said 
addding a king day to the holiday list rather than swapping it 
for columbus day would cost the state an 500000 to 35 million 
but mrs mofford said the cost was worth it to avoid bad publicity 
over the lack of a king holiday 
i would trade that any time for the amount of money it could 
cost us in the end the democrat said citing possible sports and 
convention boycotts im embarrassed because were being referred 
to as a racial state 
controversy over a king holiday has dogged the states 
politicians for years democratic gov bruce babbitt declared a 
holiday by executive proclamation as he was about to start a 
presidential bid in 1986 but republican attorney general bob 
corbin called it an illegal encroachment on the legislatures role 
and mecham rescinded it days before it would have taken effect 
the ensuing uproar included marches tourist boycotts and 
convention cancellations the furor also fueled a recall drive 
against mecham but he was removed by impeachment on other grounds 
before the recall vote could be held 
last years bill was a mistake that the legislature made 
mrs mofford said 
asked why she had signed it with such ceremony last year if she 
considered it such a mistake she replied you dont veto a moral 
issue i never thought that it would come to this

the environmental protection agency 
has pronounced most of the abandoned love canal neighborhood safe 
for people to move back in 
epa administrator william reilly endorsed a 1988 study of the 
virtual ghost town removing the last federal barrier to the sale 
of 236 homes or twothirds of the homes evacuated in the 70s 
because of an underground leak of toxic chemicals 
reilly said monday the study by the state and the epa was 
legally and scientifically sound and should not be overturned as 
neighborhood and environmental activists had requested 
there is no undue health risk to buying homes and raising 
children he said 
new yorks love canal area revitalization agency plans to sell 
60 to 75 homes a year for three years beginning this summer said 
james carr the agencys planning director about 200 people 
already are signed up t buy homes 
among them is philip palmisano a retired bar owner who lives in 
nearby north tonawanda with his wife and son 
im no scientist or chemist but you have to take somebodys 
word on it he said the government wouldnt let us move in 
there if it wasnt safe would they 
the homes to be sold are in a ring around a huge dump in the 
middle of the neighborhood all are two or more more blocks from a 
sixblocklong pit left over from a canal project where tons of 
pcbs dioxin and other toxic chemicals were dumped by hooker 
chemical co in the 1940s and early 50s 
in the 1950s the canal was covered and homes and an elementary 
school were built nearby the federal government declared the 
neighborhood a disaster area in the 1970s and more than 2500 
residents were evacuated 
the homes probably will be sold by bid for 50000 to 60000 
or 10 percent to 15 percent below market price in the area carr 
said 
lois gibbs a former love canal housewife who led the fight for 
federal aid to residents said no adequate assessment of the health 
risks to future residents has been made by the state or the federal 
government 
the law states specifically that they must do a risk 
assessment and they havent gibbs said monday from her 
arlington va home she said she and the natural resources 
defense council will sue to block resettlement 
in january gibbs and other environmental activists had met with 
reilly to ask that love canal be turned into a hazardous waste 
research center 
if the area is resettled love canal will become the precedent 
for resettlement of other areas said gibbs now executive 
director of the arlingtonbased citizens clearinghouse for 
hazardous waste 
advocates of resettlement stress that state health officials 
have ruled the area safe sewers have been cleaned and so have 
nearby creeks officials said 
i think theres a strong perception in niagara falls that lois 
gibbs was a lot of hot air carr said

the worlds population of 53 billion may nearly 
triple in the next century and pose a serious threat to the 
environment unless family planning efforts are redoubled according 
to a un report released today 
the next 10 years will decide the shape of the 21st century 
they may decide the future of the earth as a habitation for 
humans said dr nafis sadik executive director of the united 
nations population fund 
only six years ago the report said population growth appeared 
to be slowing everywhere except africa and parts of south asia and 
world population seemed likely to stabilize around 102 billion 
toward the end of the next century 
today the situation looks less promising it said 
progress in reducing fertility rates has been slower than 
expected 
if fertility reductions continue to be slower than projected 
the mark could be missed yet again in that case the world could be 
headed toward an eventual total of up to 14 billion people mrs 
sadik said 
she told a news conference that the best and quickest way to 
reduce population growth is to invest in improving womens 
status access to education health and access to family planning 
the un population fund report recommended that spending on 
family planning in developing countries be doubled to 9 billion by 
the end of the century 
mrs sadik said she hoped the united states will resume support 
for the funds activities last year she said the us congress 
voted to contribute to the fund but president bush vetoed the bill 
us abortion opponents had charged that because the un agency 
operates in china which has a onechildperfamily policy the 
money would have indirectly supported forced abortions 
every year during the 1990s the population will increase by 90 
million to 100 million people roughly equivalent to the current 
population of eastern europe or central america the report said 
over the decade a billion more people will inhabit the planet 
equivalent to an extra china it said 
the 1990s will see faster increases in human numbers than any 
decade in history mrs sadik said 
the choices of the next 10 years will decide whether world 
population trebles or merely doubles before it finally stops 
growing they will decide whether the pace of damage to the 
environment speeds up or slows down she said 
world population growth continues to be grossly out of balance 
with 90 percent of the increase in developing countries and the 
biggest growth in the poorest of them said the state of world 
population 1990 report 
at the start of the 1990s the choice must be to act decisively 
to slow population growth attack poverty and protect the 
environment the alternative is to hand on to our children a 
poisoned inheritance it said 
according to the latest un projections the report said the 
world has overshot 1984 targets and is on course for a total nearer 
11 billion than 10 billion 
in 15 countries 13 of them in africa birth rates rose between 
the early 1960s and 1980s and in 23 more countries they fell by 
less than 2 percent it said 
in china the worlds most populous nation mrs sadik said 
family size still increased from 23 to 25 partly because of the 
age structure of the population and rural couples having more 
children 
she said countries in which women had the lowest status and 
participated least in society tended to be the ones with the 
highest birthrates and countries with sustained political support 
for population programs achieved the best results

taiwan wants to establish a mission in 
china to promote trade and other unofficial ties a government 
spokesman said today 
although the nationalist government is the sworn enemy of 
communist china and has refused official contact with beijing 
hostility has thawed in recent years leading to rising trade and 
other exchanges 
government spokesman shaw yuming said the mission would be a 
positive measure that could help solve the many problems 
arising from exchanges with china and will contribute to the 
stable and peaceful development across the taiwan straits 
he said the government should fulfill its obligations to 
assist our businesses in trading with china instead of taking a 
handsoff attitude 
although the mission would be considered unofficial it would 
receive government funding officials said 
under the plan china would be allowed to set up a similar 
office in taiwan but shaw noted that beijing has shown some 
suspicion about the plan if the two offices are to have equal 
status 
the nationalist government retreated to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to the communist forces in china 
although the nationalist government still claims to be the sole 
legitimate rule of all of china beijing considers taiwan a runaway 
province 
shaw said government mainland affairs committee proposed today 
to sanction any taiwanese indirect investments in china other than 
hightechnology products or projects that could harm national 
security 
taiwan authorities only allow investment in china if it is 
channeled through companies in third countries indirect investment 
totaled an estimated 1 billion last year 
many of the islands largest entrepreneurs want to directly set 
up factories in china to utilize cheap labor and land

slapping a tax on air isnt a well 
grounded idea vermonts supreme court says 
the ruling monday ended a legal tussle over air space between 
the cities of winooski and burlington 
fed up with noisy planes from burlingtons airport winooski a 
few years ago sent burlington a 90222 property tax bill for use 
of winooski air space 
william wargo who argued the case for winooski said the 
airport noise lowers the smaller citys property values 
but the supreme court ruled in burlingtons favor upholding a 
judges ruling that the tax couldnt be imposed on an imaginary 
surface 
the court said federal law recognizes certain imaginary 
surfaces above the earths surface extending from runways but 
they are not subject to taxation 
moreover the court said the surfaces encroaching on winooskis 
air space are established by the federal government not by the 
city of burlington 
the ruling eased a bit of tension in the clavelle family 
burlington mayor peter clavelle grew up in winooski and is the 
son of raymond clavelle winooskis longtime collector of 
delinquent taxes 
in my heart i didnt feel it would pass but with the judicial 
system you never know the elder clavelle said 
his son lauded winooski for its creativity 
but i would have been real surprised if they would have 
prevailed said the burlington mayor and we would have had a 
big hole in our budget if they would have prevailed so im very 
pleased

secretary of state james a baker iii is on 
his way to moscow to try to work out arms control agreements with 
the soviet union for signing at the fastapproaching washington 
summit 
bakers aides are not predicting success by the end of the 
week we should know a lot more a senior us official said 
before takeoff monday 
the four days of talks are bakers last chance to work out 
agreements with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze for 
signing during the may 30june 3 visit of soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
the two sides are in disagreement on several key issues 
gorbachevs problems at home also could get in the way 
the general assumption is that he has increasingly acquired 
more of the formal power said the senior official who demanded 
anonymity on the other hand his difficulties with the economy 
and nationalities and the general level of dissatisfaction have 
perhaps limited his ability to use that power 
other topics baker will take up with shevardnadze starting 
wednesday include the restive baltic republics and outbreaks of 
antisemitism in the soviet union as well as accords on space the 
environment and trade being prepared for the summit 
on his way baker stopped in new york to make a speech 
promising to keep american troops in europe even if the treaties 
are concluded 
even if all soviet armed forces return to the ussr and 
conventional arms control moves forward the soviet military will 
retain forces many times larger than those possessed by any other 
single state baker said 
he said the north atlantic treaty organization would not 
dissolve either to prevent war we must continue to deter 
aggression and contain the residual threat baker said 
he suggested the western alliance take on more of a political 
role however and consider holding a solid political and 
military dialogue with the soviet union and the countries of 
central and eastern europe 
bakers first meeting in the soviet union will involve the 
middle east he will see egyptian president hosni mubarak who is 
visiting moscow wednesday afternoon 
administration officials said last week baker does not plan to 
overhaul his strategy for getting stalled talks going between 
israel and palestinian arabs mubarak has been acting as a 
middleman between the bush administration and the palestinian 
liberation organization 
right after the mubarak meeting baker holds his first round 
with shevardnadze he is to see gorbachev friday morning and is 
scheduled to wind up his stay in moscow with a news conference 
saturday 
the most dramatic candidate for a summit signing a treaty 
declaration to reduce longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines is far from complete us and soviet negotiators have 
been wrangling for weeks over ballistic missiles with multiple 
warheads and over cruise missiles packed on jet fighters 
baker in a concession is prepared to inch closer to the soviet 
position on cruise missiles limiting their range to 500 miles 
instead of 625 miles but is looking for something in exchange 
said a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a separate treaty to reduce troops tanks airplanes and other 
nonnuclear arms in europe is moving slowly in negotiations between 
nato and the warsaw pact in vienna 
that treaty is designed for signing at a 35nation summit before 
the end of the year but president bush and gorbachev would like to 
report progress when they meet here 
the biggest obstacles are which airplanes and helicopters to 
limit and how compliance would be ensured 
we will be making our best effort within our interests to 
get the treaties done the senior official said 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
we have always said we hoped we could conclude a start strategic 
arms reduction treaty this year and that we hoped to be able to 
resolve all major issues in start by the summit 
if we do accomplish all that so much the better if we do 
not we will keep working at it she said 
bush last week offered to halt production of us chemical 
weapons if the soviets set a schedule for demolition of their 
stockpiles and accept other us demands 
baker will follow up the offer with shevardnadze but an 
agreement depends on the soviets accepting bushs demand that the 
two sides be allowed to retain small stockpiles of poison gas until 
40 nations agree to a global ban and implement it 
shadowing bakers trip is the unrest in lithuania and the 
partial economic blockade moscow has imposed on the baltic republic 
to try to diffuse a drive for independence 
the bush administration has urged the two sides to settle their 
differences through negotiations otherwise baker told congress 
recently pressure could build to impose us economic sanctions 
against moscow 
congressional sentiment is strongly on the side of the 
lithuanians bush and baker have publicly supported independence 
but also stressed the importance of maintaining good ussoviet 
relations

salaberrydevalleyfield quebec ap a mohawk newspaper 
editor was behind bars today on charges of murdering a fellow 
indian in a gun battle over casino gambling on the st regis indian 
reservation 
doug george an outspoken 35yearold opponent of gambling 
pleaded innocent monday in quebec provincial court in the may 1 
slaying of harold edwards 31 
the slaying of edwards and another mohawk the same day prompted 
hundreds of new york and canadian police to break with their 
handsoff policy toward indian matters and enter the 28000acre 
reservation to keep the peace 
george was being held without bail on charges of seconddegree 
murder which carries a life sentence with parole eligibility in 10 
years 
his brother david george 42 pleaded innocent to dangerous use 
of a firearm and was released on his own recognizance 
authorities have yet to file charges against three antigambling 
mohawks who also were arrested sunday in edwards slaying 
the 9000member reservation straddling the us border has been 
torn by violence for nine months over whether to allow gambling on 
the reservation 
the reservations six casinos attract busloads of gamblers 
providing jobs and revenue but opponents say gambling also brings 
drugs money and prostitution and undermines traditional mohawk 
ways 
members of the progambling warriors society a selfappointed 
security force said edwards was neutral on gambling authorities 
gave no motive for his slaying

us military pilots could force suspected 
drug smuggling planes to land for inspection rather than simply 
wait for them to do so under a bush administration proposal 
pilots who disobey orders to land would face up to five years in 
prison under the proposal contained in the administrations new 
antidrug bill the los angeles times reported today 
the proposal would let the customs service coast guard and the 
military do everything we can short of shooting the bad guys 
down an unidentified administration official told the newspaper 
authority to shoot down planes has been proposed by sen mitch 
mcconnell rky but the administration said that option posed an 
unnecessary risk to innocent pilots 
currently us pilots who intercept suspected drug smugglers 
over american airspace have no authority to force planes to land 
they can only follow them until they land when a search is 
permitted 
authorities have complained the restriction allows smuggler 
pilots to drop drugs into the united states with little fear of 
prosecution 
the administration bill which is to be unveiled wednesday has 
generated concern that authorities could force innocent pilots to 
land and submit to searches 
were all for efforts to stop drugs but you have to be 
reasonable said cheri farha of the 300000member aircraft 
owners and pilots association 
the customs service has devoted 100 planes to drug interdiction 
the military 50 planes and the coast guard 10 aircraft

us delegates at an environmental 
conference sought to soften tough european proposals including a 
timetable for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions 
the united states came under sharp criticism monday at the 
unsponsored meeting for opposing a new environmental aid fund 
for developing countries and for refusing to endorse stricter 
antipollution measures 
we are a country with a thick skin said john a knauss the 
chief us delegate in response to the criticism 
delegates at the 34nation conference were discussing the text 
of a final conference declaration to be issued wednesday the 
debate found the united states at odds with many of its western 
european allies 
i think well find a wording that is acceptable to all said 
knauss head of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
another us delegate speaking on condition of anonymity said 
washington opposed the proposal for a third world environmental aid 
fund because it did not want to create a new bureaucracy to perform 
a task that could be handled by the world bank 
the first day of the ministeriallevel talks on monday was 
marked by discord environmentalists protesting outside the 
conference hotel in this norwegian port city voiced fears that the 
final declaration might end up being too vague 
carlo rita di meana the environment commissioner for the 
european community expressed concern about the us stance 
he said the united states appears to be deserting us at a 
time when industrial nations are acting together to protect the 
environment and developing countries are starting to become aware 
of environmental concerns 
the main point of contention in the draft declaration is a 
proposal by european nations that calls for stabilizing emissions 
of carbon dioxide by the year 2000 carbon dioxide is among the 
socalled greenhouse gases believed to contribute to global 
warming 
the united states has objected to imposing expensive 
requirements on industry to combat what it considers unproven 
environmental hazards only britain and the soviet union have given 
unofficial support to us efforts to move back the timetable for 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions 
the united states is also objecting to another provision in the 
draft declaration that says precautionary preventative action 
should be taken to protect the earth even if scientists disagree 
on its value 
a us delegate speaking on condition of anonymity said 
washington did not object so much to the contents of the draft 
declaration proposals but rather to their timing 
the delegate said the united states wants first to study a un 
report on climatic change due out this fall before entering in any 
new environmental agreements 
he added that the united states was willing to compromise on any 
proposal except for one calling for new funds for environmental 
research washington expects to spend about 1 billion on climate 
research in 1991 he said 
knauss refused during a news conference to be drawn out on 
specific issues under negotiation but he said evidence is still 
lacking on how the emission of carbon monoxide and other 
greenhouse gases will effect global temperatures 
scientists agree that emissions of manmade pollutants 
especially the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels 
is causing heat to be trapped and will result in a warming of the 
globe but the extent of the warming and how specific regions of 
the earth will be affected is not clear 
the bergen conference called action for a common future is a 
regional followup session to consider environmental protection 
recommendations following the 1987 release of a report by the un 
world commission on the environment and development chaired by 
norways former prime minister gro harlem brundtland

the philippines formally told the 
united states today that the lease for us military bases expires 
in september 1991 us and filipino officials said the move does 
not prevent a new accord from being reached 
the notice of termination was presented today by foreign 
secretary raul manglapus during the second day of talks on the 
future of the installations including clark air base the subic 
bay naval base and four smaller installations 
police arrested about 50 people today after they staged a 
motorcade to demand the bases be closed fortytwo people were 
arrested during antibases protests when the talks began monday 
communist guerrillas opposed to the bases shot and killed two 
us airmen near clark on sunday and claimed responsibility for the 
slayings in a statement today 
although largely symbolic the serving of the notice of 
termination highlighted differences between us and philippine 
officials over when the lease on the six installations actually 
expires 
manila believes the 1947 military bases agreement allows the 
installations to remain until sept 16 1991 the united states 
however maintains they could stay one year longer 
the government of the philippines hereby notifies the 
government of the united states of america that the 1947 
philippinesunited states military bases agreement ends on sept 
16 1991 and cannot be extended the notice of termination said 
todays announcement of termination also gave the government of 
president corazon aquino a way to display its own people its 
independence from the united states 
in my opinion the aquino administration still wants the bases 
to remain but they are putting up a drama because there are many 
demonstrators and there are problems said opposition sen juan 
ponce enrile a former defense minister who now says he opposes the 
bases 
critics of the bases have accused the government of caving in to 
american demands by agreeing to discuss a new bases treaty such 
criticism mounted after us jets from clark flew air cover for 
government forces during a failed coup which almost toppled mrs 
aquino 
today 15 may 1990 marks an historic moment for all 
filipinos said philippine panel spokesman rafael alunan we 
have taken that first step in terminating an agreement that was 
executed in 1947 during the days of lingering us colonialism in 
the philippines 
alunan told the associated press that the notice given by 
manglapus to chief us negotiator richard armitage did not rule 
out a new bases agreement 
our constitution mandates is to be open to new ideas to lead 
us to a new negotiation for a new treaty alunan said it does 
not preclude new negotiations for a new treaty 
stanley schrager spokesman for the american panel said the 
move brought out longstanding differences between the united states 
and the aquino government on the termination date 
in 1966 the two governments agreed that the bases agreement 
would extend for 25 more years subject to termination upon one 
years notice by either government 
according to the us interpretation the philippines would have 
to wait until sept 16 1991 to give one years notice 
but in 1986 a few months after mrs aquino took office the 
constitution was rewritten to state that after expiration in 1991 
of the agreement concerning military bases foreign military 
bases troops or facilities shall not be allowed in the 
philippines unless provided for under a new treaty 
the timing was not anticipated but the serving of the notice 
was expected schrager said of the announcement us officials 
speaking on condition of anonymity said they hoped a new agreement 
could be negotiated and ratified before september 1991 making the 
difference of opinion on the expiration moot 
the claim of responsibility for the slayings of the two us 
servicemen came in a signed statement by jayar sigua spokesman of 
the communist new peoples army regional 
this incident serves as a warning to the us government and 
its local puppet regime sigua said we will not stop until all 
us bases and all american occupational soldiers are kicked out of 
our country 
the assailants shot and killed airman john h raven 19 of 
delta junction alaska and airman james c green 20 of craig 
colorado outside a hotel near clark air base outside angeles city 
about 50 miles north of manila

the vatican and romania today reestablished 
diplomatic relations broken by the former hardline communist 
regime 40 years ago 
with the move the holy see has completed the restoration of 
official ties with all countries that had cut relations after the 
communists came to power in eastern europe after world war ii 
pope john paul iis native poland which is predominantly roman 
catholic restored ties last july hungary did so in february and 
czechoslovakia followed suit in april two days before the pope 
paid a historic visit to the country 
the vatican reported it had reached agreement with romania on 
restoring ties two weeks ago after a visit to the country by 
archbishop angelo sodano the holy sees foreign affairs chief 
after coming to power the romanian communists adopted harsh 
measures against organized religion that included suppressing the 
eastern rite branch of the catholic church 
in july 1950 relations with the vatican were cut when the 
government gave the papal envoy three days to leave the country 
with the fall of communist regimes over the past year the 
vatican has moved quickly to expand its influence in eastern europe 
two months ago the vatican made a major breakthrough in romania

the onset of aids in people with mild 
infections of the hiv virus can be delayed with early treatment of 
azt and makes it almost a whole new drug a leading researcher 
said 
a study released monday in the may 15 issue of the annals of 
internal medicine said people who took azt were more than twice as 
likely not to develop aids or aidsrelated complex than those who 
received a placebo 
that study and a similar one last month in the new england 
journal of medicine prompted the federal food and drug 
administration in march to allow physicians to prescribe the drug 
for patients with the virus who have not developed aids symptoms 
it means we can recommend intervention to prevent serious 
illness just as we would for mild hypertension to prevent stroke or 
heart disease said dr margaret fischl lead author of the study 
in the annals of internal medicine 
the data shows remarkably that if you give zidovudine azt 
orally before someones immune system is severely damaged or they 
are severely ill you will delay development of aids she said 
because azt is licensed for almost all phases of hiv 
infection she said it represented a quantum leap in treatment 
intervention 
she said the study also showed the drug was welltolerated 
with minimum side effects only 1 percent of those getting the 
minimum dose experienced serious side effects she said 
azt is the only drug definitively shown to at least slow the 
usually fatal course of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the latest study examined 711 people with mild symptoms of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection or hiv the precursor to 
aids a placebo was given to 351 people while azt was given to 360 
of those getting the drug 15 developed aids or aidsrelated 
complex within about 11 months of those who did not receive the 
drug 36 developed aids or aidsrelated complex 
the results were more conclusive for those with more advanced 
hiv infection 
the illness is measured by the concentration of cd4 t 
lymphocytes a cell important in forming antibodies the lower the 
count the more advanced the illness 
among those whose cd4 t lymphocyte count fell between 200 and 
500 per square millimeter 34 subjects who received the placebo 
developed aids or aidsrelated complex compared with 12 who 
received azt 
among those whose cd4 t lymphocyte count fell between 500 and 
799 two subjects who received the placebo developed aids or 
aidsrelated complex compared with three who received azt 
in an editorial researchers from the university of british 
columbia cautioned treating patients with counts between 200 and 
500 
the available data do not address the question of whether 
early intervention prolongs life or improves its quality the 
editorial said 
whereas the selective use of zidovudine in such persons should 
be endorsed for the present we eagerly await the results of 
ongoing trials that will help resolve these important issues the 
editorial said

rival christian forces ignored a church 
plea for a ceasefire today and kept up the shelling duels that 
have scorched their enclave police said 18 people were killed and 
42 wounded 
in west beirut street gun battles broke out between moslem 
factions loyal to iran and syria killing six more people and 
wounding 15 
the artillery bombardment that raged into a seventh day in east 
beirut and the surrounding christian hinterland worsened the plight 
of thousands of trapped residents 
todays deaths raised the casualty toll in the christian 
fighting to at least 1022 dead and 2726 wounded since jan 30 
when army gen michel aoun moved against militia chieftain samir 
geagea to seize control of the christian enclave north of beirut 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual head of the maronite 
catholic sect issued a ceasefire appeal before midnight urging 
aouns troops and geageas lebanese forces militiamen to disobey 
their commanders and lay down arms but the bombardment raged past 
daybreak aoun and geagea are both maronite catholics 
they simply opted to disobey the patriarch not their 
commanders said a police spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing rules it seems they cant stop fighting 
police said geageas mobile 40barreled rocket launchers spread 
along the enclaves coastline poured fire on aouns 155mm howitzer 
batteries in the upper metn mountains at a rate of one round per 
second through most of the night 
flames leaped through the night sky fires burned out of control 
in scores of devastated apartment buildings fuel storage tanks and 
filling stations 
marlene kenaan a 27yearold secretary reached by telephone at 
her home in the mountain resort town of brummana said she spent 
the night with her parents in the underground wine cellar 
we felt the door of hell has been flung open and we were 
roasting under merciless bombardment ms kenaan said 
wine bottles danced all night and we kept drinking them to 
shore up our spirits she quipped 
the moslem fighting started at midnight and pitted the 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god irans main lebanese 
ally against the syrianaligned secular amal arabic for hope 
the factions have been struggling on and off since 1987 to 
control the 12 million shiites who make up lebanons largest sect 
the latest casualties brought the overall toll to 1041 killed and 
3076 wounded in three years 
police said hezbollah fighters hurled grenades and fired 
jeepmounted 106mm guns in an attempt to expel amal from west 
beiruts old jewish quarter 
amal stopped the assaults with rocketpropelled grenades and 
armorpiercing rockets 
syrian troops in charge of west beiruts security ringed the 
lowincome neighborhood to contain the fighting which ease at 
midmorning 
shopowners removed glass shards and debris under the watchful 
eyes of helmeted syrian troops toting automatic rifles and 
shoulderfired rocket launchers 
dozens of wrecked cars smoldered amid heaps of smokeblackened 
burned fruits and vegetables 
go ahead and take pictures a veiled woman cried as 
photographers reached the scene of the fighting show the world 
how brutal are our men

communist rebels today claimed 
responsibility for the weekend murder of two american airmen and 
they threatened further attacks until all us military facilities 
shut down

regional made the claim in a signed statement sent by courier to 
the associated press 
this incident serves as a warning to the us government and 
its local puppet regime sigua said we will not stop until

south african president fw de klerk will 
meet with president bush at the white house several days before 
black leader nelson mandela for talks on dismantling their 
countrys racial segregation system 
us officials said today de klerk will visit the white house on 
june 18 in the first official call by a south african president in 
more than 30 years 
mandela who will tour six us cities and be honored with a 
ticker tape parade in new york city arrives in the united states 
about june 20 and will meet bush about a week later officials of 
his african national congress said monday 
bush issued the invitations to both men last february as soon 
as de klerk released mandela from prison where he served 27 years 
for plotting to overthrow the south african government 
de klerks decision to free mandela and lift a ban on the anc 
opened the way for talks between the white minority government and 
the black majority on rewriting the countrys constitution to grant 
blacks political power 
us officials said the decision to schedule de klerks visit 
before mandelas was dictated by the two mens busy itineraries and 
did not signal a preference for either leader 
but organizers of the mandela visit a coalition of labor and 
black civic groups were angered especially because they had 
objected to bushs invitation to de klerk in the first place 
randall robinson head of the transafrica organization said 
inviting de klerk to the white house before mandela was 
insensitive in light of the south african governments 
oppression of blacks and its lengthy imprisonment of mandela 
joseph lowery president of the atlantabased southern christian 
leadership conference said mandela is expected to meet with 
atlanta business and civil rights leaders and lay a wreath at the 
tomb of the late civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
mandela 71 will address a joint meeting of congress to thank 
us leaders for their support during his incarceration and for 
their efforts to obtain his release 
but he is also expected to warn that despite some reforms 
adopted by the white government of president fw de klerk the 
impression that apartheid is gone is wrong it remains firmly in 
place said the ancs washington representative lindiwe mabuza 
mandela will urge us leaders to keep intact the economic 
sanctions imposed by congress in 1986 so that pressure is 
maintained on the south african government to carry through with 
the reforms she said

china stands to lose nearly onefourth of its 
total exports and most of its sales to the united states if 
washington cancels its mostfavorednation trade status the vice 
minister of trade said today 
we are very concerned that the good economic and trade 
relations the two countries have established over the past 10 years 
could be destroyed the minister shen jueren said in an 
interview with american journalists 
he estimated china would lose about 10 billion worth of exports 
annually an even greater loss than us analysts have estimated 
china exported about 43 billion worth of goods worldwide last 
year including about 12 billion worth to the united states 
mostly garments shoes and toys 
the uschina business council in washington has estimated that 
chinese exports to the united states would fall 50 percent 
shen said some chinese workers would lose their jobs especially 
in exportoriented coastal provinces but did not provide any 
figures 
china is a large country and we can bear the burden if we have 
to shen said 
china and the united states have given each other 
mostfavorednation trade status since 1980 entitling each to the 
lowest available tariffs on exported goods without it the average 
tariff on chinese goods would jump to more than 50 percent from the 
current 9 percent the uschina business council estimates 
chinas status must be renewed each year with june 3 the 
deadline for a decision president bush is expected to support 
renewing the special trade status but may face stiff opposition 
from congressmen who believe china should be punished for last 
junes crackdown on the studentled prodemocracy movement 
as early as april chinese officials began warning that 
suspension of mostfavorednation status would set back political 
and cultural relations as well an article in the official china 
daily said suspension would be shortsighted and chided china has 
never yielded to pressure from outside 
shen however avoided polemics and instead appealed on behalf 
of chinas reformers 
many friends in the united states say they want china to 
continue its reforms and opening to the outside world but if mfn 
is canceled this will create difficulties for the reform and 
opening up this is a contradiction he said 
shen said china in return would suspend mostfavorednation 
treatment for us goods but refused to say whether other 
retaliation was possible 
the united states sold about 57 billion worth of goods to 
china last year led by wheat airplanes and parts and fertilizer 
asked if the trade ministry was pressing the government to make 
concessions on human rights he said i think our government has 
done quite a lot in this regard 
in the past two weeks china has ended martial law in lhasa 
tibet and announced the release of 211 people who took part in 
last years massive prodemocracy protests both moves were widely 
seen as intended to counter congressional criticism of its human 
rights record 
however hundreds of protesters remain jailed many still 
without formal charges many of those released have lost their jobs 
chinese leaders also have refused to express regret for ordering 
the army to open fire on protesters in beijing resulting in 
hundreds and possibly thousands of deaths 
only a few countries including albania cuba vietnam and some 
soviet bloc states do not receive mostfavorednation from the 
united states

police say the beating of a vietnamese man was a 
bias crime but it was not related to a blackled boycott of two 
koreanamerican groceries blocks away 
a man and a girl who allegedly took part in the attack were 
arrested monday both live in the flatbush neighborhood of 
brooklyn near the scene of the assault early sunday 
tuan ana cao 36 suffered a fractured skull in the attack he 
was listed in guarded condition at kings county hospital 
originally police had linked the beating to the nearby grocery 
store boycott saying the attackers had yelled antikorean slurs at 
cao but officials said monday that the attack began with an 
argument over a broken window 
the incident contributed to racial tensions in the city already 
on edge as two juries continue deliberating in the bensonhurst 
racial attack case two white youths are charged with murder in the 
death of a black teenager killed by a mob he encountered in the 
bensonhurst neighborhood last summer 
the grocery boycott began jan 18 after a black woman allegedly 
was roughed up by workers in one of the stores because she had 
refused to let them look in her purse though boycott organizers 
insist it isnt racially motivated pickets outside the stores have 
shouted antikorean slurs 
because of the slurs allegedly uttered during the beating 
sundays attack was classified as a bias assault but police 
commissioner lee brown said it was neither premeditated nor related 
to the grocery boycott 
ulner alsaint 18 was charged monday with felonious assault and 
possession of a dangerous instrument a claw hammer that was 
recovered brown said alsaint allegedly hit cao over the head 
fracturing his skull he told police he struck cao in selfdefense 
a 13yearold girl was charged as a juvenile with criminal mischief 
at a news conference monday brown provided this account 
shortly after 2 am sunday a group of teenage boys left a 
neighborhood party and met a group of younger teenage girls coming 
from another party the 13yearold threw a bottle shattering a 
groundfloor window in a nearby apartment building 
some vietnamese men in the apartment went outside to find out 
what happened and a dispute erupted brown said 
the attack was classified as biasrelated because some in the 
group screamed koreans get out of america police said but 
they also yelled other antiasian slurs 
the 13yearold girl said she threw the bottle to be one of 
the group and did not aim for the window according to brown 
police said monday that the initial confusion over the attack on 
cao stemmed in part from the difficulty of interviewing him through 
a translator when he was still disoriented from his injury police 
had originally said cao was the victim of a robbery attempt shortly 
before the beating but now say this was not the case 
in a televised speech friday mayor david dinkins he called for 
an end to bigotry and hate he said monday he had not expected his 
words to deter all biasrelated crimes

prime minister toshiki kaifu said today he will 
apologize for japans wartime aggression when he meets south 
koreas president next week but the government is less willing to 
have the emperor make a similar statement 
i think i should express frank regret about our mistakes in 
the past and apologize for them kaifu told parliament he was 
responding to an opposition question about news reports that south 
korean president roh taewoo expects an apology from emperor 
akihito 
kaifu did not comment on whether the emperor would make an 
apology during rohs threeday trip to japan which begins may 24 
japan ruled korea as a colony from 1910 to 1945 and koreans 
have bitter memories of harsh treatment under the japanese along 
with the legacy of their countrys division since the wars end 
leaders of japans governing liberal democratic party expressed 
strong opposition to a royal apology 
we should not use the emperor for political purposes ichiro 
ozawa secretary general of the party told a news conference 
the matter is delicate for the japanese touching on the nature 
of the emperors role under the postwar constitution and recalling 
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late emperor 
hirohito had for japans wartime actions 
six years ago hirohito told then south korean president chun 
doohwan that he sincerely regretted the unfortunate past between 
the two countries 
japanese media quoted roh monday as saying korea was unsure 
whether hirohitos statement was an apology or not and that he 
expected a definite apology from emperor akihito 
akihito succeeded to the throne after hirohito died in january 
1989 
roh said it was clear from history which country had been the 
aggressor and which had been the victim and that japan and korea 
needed to have a proper understanding of history to be able to 
cooperate in the future news reports added 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said the wording of 
what the emperor would say had not yet been decided he stressed 
that while the constitution prevents the emperor from taking a role 
in politics or government the prime minister would speak 
sincerely and honestly about the past 
watanabe said he was confident the situation would improve and 
japan and south korea could move toward greater cooperation he 
indicated that rohs visit would be used to announce new joint 
projects between the two countries 
he declined to give details but said there would be cooperation 
in the areas of technology culture and exchange visits

the fatal fire aboard the guided missile 
destroyer conyngham has prompted the navy to examine the possibly 
faulty installation of a fuel oil strainer aboard its ships 
a statement monday from atlantic fleet headquarters said the 
ships strainer used to separate fuel oil from water so 
contaminated fuel can be recycled is among the possibilities that 
caused the fire 
the may 8 fire killed one crewmen and injured 18 others while 
the 27yearold conyngham was on a training missing 80 miles off 
the north carolina coast the fire was extinguished in about two 
hours with the help of two other ships 
but the navy cautioned no conclusion has been made on the cause 
of the fire various methods of replacing the strainer or 
repairing it were given to ships and their maintenance officers in 
a message that was sent to all navy ships 
it is practice to issue instructions as quickly as possible 
when potential problems are identified after an incident the 
stament said uss conyngham has a fuel oil strainer like the one 
described in the message 
the message said the strainer could have caused the fire and 
outlined proper strainer installation it added that a 
quarterinchthick stainless steel shaft has shown evidence of 
cracking in the past 
cmdr william r williams captain of the conyngham said friday 
that a fuel oil leak apparently started the blaze that swept up the 
middle of the ship from a forward fireroom on the right side of the 
vessel 
the fire quickly rose through passageways burning through decks 
and sending smoke through berthing spaces he said the decks were 
red hot with fireballs periodically exploding out of hatches he 
said 
the conyngham which was scheduled for decommissioning next 
year is now docked at norfolk naval station awaiting a decision on 
whether it will be repaired

river managers today released record amounts of water from a dam 
to unburden the foaming bloated trinity river forcing thousands 
of texans from their homes downstream residents vented their anger 
with threatening calls 
sirens blared monday each time dam operators opened huge steel 
gates to increase the flow of water into lake livingston about 60 
miles northeast of houston below the dam an estimated 7000 
people were urged to evacuate 
whats scary is what we know is coming said alanna shaver 
whose family left its hardin home in favor of a trailer next to a 
red cross shelter 
as the water has risen so have the tempers of those in the way 
of the water the trinity river authority said it has fielded 
numerous threats 
were very security conscious and we obviously have some 
unhappy campers out there the authoritys john jadrosich said 
theyre not satisfied that weve released too much water or not 
enough 
livingston dam operators today released water at a record rate 
to keep up with the high water reaching the reservoir from 
torrential rain two weeks ago hundreds of miles to the north the 
release rate was up to 77000 cubic feet per second and officials 
said that is expected to increase throughout the week the previous 
record was 75000 cfs in june 1973 
theres not a whole lot that can be done at this point 
jadrosich said its a giant flood a texassize flood 
flooding since april 15 has claimed 12 lives in texas and one in 
oklahoma where the danger was mostly over 
the flooding also may have led to a murdersuicide by a 
louisiana farmer a neighbor said desoto parish farmer james 
mcmullen 58 shot his 58yearold wife billie and himself 
sunday said sheriffs capt marvin melton 
the threat of losing all of his crops may have been too much for 
mcmullen said neighbor and close friend tommy dugan mcmullens 
300 to 400 acres of wheat and 800 to 900 acres in cotton were 
threatened by flooding 
damage to texas agriculture has been estimated at between 500 
million and 700 million since heavy rain fell in oklahoma and 
texas two weeks ago 
scores of people remained out of their homes in louisiana 
because of the rising red river it was expected to flood 600 
square miles there including 200 square miles of cropland said 
maj jack scherer of the army corps of engineers 
the red subsided slightly in parts of arkansas but the threat 
of flooding near garland remained national guardsmen and 
volunteers sandbagged levees in the town about 20 miles from 
texarkana 
what theyre doing now is placing sandbags at the base of the 
levee to clamp down on the areas where its seeping under like 
youd bend a water hose to cut off the water said john upton 
secretarytreasurer of the levee district 
in washington sen david pryor of arkansas asked the general 
accounting office to look into the way the corps regulates water 
levels in the region some farmers and others have blamed the corps 
for some of the flooding 
the corps has been criticized for not releasing enough water 
from some of the facilities in advance of the heavy rains to 
provide for additional flood storage capacity pryor wrote 
i am unsure as to whether or not these standard operating 
procedures are the best procedures we could be using to protect 
life and property 
jadrosich said earlier releases from lake livingston would not 
have made much difference 
this is the kind of flood you can expect to see every 100 
years he said this will become known as the flood of 1990 
as the level of the 90000acre 55mile lake livingston rises 
dam operators open the 12 flood gates a little wider the releases 
depend on hourly reports from about a dozen inspectors who report 
gauge readings upstream 
beer and nerve medicine were big sellers at romayor grocery 
15 miles below the dam said kimbel lambert a clerk whose father 
owns the store 
hordes of sightseers converged on the combination 
grocerygasoline station residents leaving the area also stocked 
up there 
we have a kitchen in the back and all well nobodys cooking 
its just kind of eat and run so theyre buying snacks cokes 
beer mainly beer nerve medicine yknow lambert said

the nations top judge today urged congress to 
streamline death penalty appeals so long delays will be eliminated 
the system at present verges on the chaotic chief justice 
william h rehnquist told the american law institute a group of 
lawyers and judges the system cries out for reform 
noting that the average time between sentencing and execution is 
seven or eight years rehnquist said the eight years is 
consumed not by structured review but in fits of frantic action 
followed by periods of inaction he said 
more than 2200 death row inmates across the nation are awaiting 
execution but through the 1980s no more than 25 have been put to 
death in any one year 
rehnquist said congress should change how federal courts review 
capital punishment cases from state courts in ways recommended by a 
committee he appointed two years ago 
that committee headed by retired supreme court justice lewis f 
powell recommended last september that death row inmates be 
limited to one chance to attack their state court sentences in 
state appellate courts and one chance in federal courts 
currently inmates may file several challenges in federal 
courts usually after several unsuccessful appeals in state courts 
the result is that at no point until a death sentence is 
actually carried out can it be said that litigation concerning the 
sentence has run its course rehnquist said in criticizing the 
current system 
the powell committees report was denounced by civil liberties 
lawyers 
rehnquist last october sent the powell committee report directly 
to congress rather than refer it to the us judicial conference 
the federal courts policymaking body which he heads 
fourteen of the judicial conferences 27 members wrote congress 
to request hearings on the conferences recommendations which 
differ significantly from those of the powell committee 
the judicial conferences proposals were hailed by the same 
civil liberties lawyers who had panned the powell committees 
report 
rehnquist today criticized the judicial conferences 
recommendations along with bills introduced by sens joseph biden 
ddel and strom thurmond rsc 
the chief justice said bidens proposal would actually 
exacerbate the delays and repetitiousness of the present system 
he said thurmonds proposal which would eliminate most federal 
court review of death penalty cases is not yet needed 
while this approach might commend itself some years hence it 
does not do so at the present time rehnquist said

decision to uphold an order barring them from going within 50 feet 
of such clinics

rights 
jewitt called mondays action a little stumble along the 
way adding we feel well be victorious in the long run 
lynne randall who operates an atlanta clinic that has been a 
frequent target of the protests welcomed the action we have to 
balance womens right to privacy with peoples right to protest 
she said 
since july 1988 when atlanta hosted the democratic national 
convention city police have arrested 1320 demonstrators at 
operation rescue sitins many of the protesters barricaded 
abortion clinics blocking patients and employees from entering or 
leaving

the remaining western hostages three israeli servicemen and 
several of his men held by shiite moslem factions 
hezbollah withheld public comment on lahds offer but the 
communistrun voice of the people radio station in beirut quoted an 
unnamed hezbollah source as replying israel and its puppets must 
free all the prisoners unconditionally 
one of the unarmed hezbollah activists sponsoring mondays 
sitin said the protest was our initial reaction to the agent 
lahd

their release leaves 16 western hostages including six 
americans in lebanon the hostage held longest is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
seized march 16 1985 
hezbollah has demanded a reciprocal gesture from the united 
states for polhills and reeds releases saying the release of 
shiite prisoners by israel and the sla would help resolve the 
plight of the kidnapped westerners 
israel has said that any prisoner swap must include the three 
israeli soldiers captured in lebanon in 1986 
israel holds about 9000 arabs in its jails there are also 
about 300 shiites held by the sla in the khiam detention camp in

the louisiana supreme court has again refused 
to stop the execution of dalton prejean condemned to die for 
killing a louisiana state trooper at the age of 17 
since his conviction for the 1977 murder of trooper donald 
cleveland prejean now 30 has received 10 stays of execution and 
spent more than 10 years on death row in the louisiana state 
penitentiary at angola 
he is scheduled to be executed early friday 
cleveland was killed in lafayette after stopping prejeans car 
on a routine traffic charge that murder occurred soon after 
prejean was released from a juvenile detention center where he had 
been sent for killing a cab driver when he was 14 
by a vote of 52 monday the state supreme court denied a claim 
that the psychiatric evaluation administered before prejeans 1978 
trial was inadequate and the jury therefore never learned that 
prejean was retarded 
the us supreme court last summer rejected the argument that 
prejean should be spared because he was only 17 when the murder was 
committed other motions have argued that the black man should not 
be executed because he is mildly retarded because an allwhite 
jury convicted him and because the jury was never told he had been 
was abused as a child 
prejeans lawyers prepared to turn to gov buddy roemer and the 
federal courts again to win another reprieve 
weve just been sweating this one out said lawyer sam 
dalton i dont think we have time for anything else other than 
another telegram to the governor telling him to do the right thing 
this time id like to try again but i dont know that we can 
were very disappointed but were committed to pursuing this 
until the end said attorney andrea robinson i hope the us 
supreme court agrees with us and agrees with him 
the governor said he had discussed the case with his legal 
counsel 
our plans are to proceed with the execution im never happy 
with these things but i do not as a representative of the people 
have a choice roemer said monday 
roemer said he would be willing to discuss the case with defense 
attorneys but he has twice spurned a state pardon board 
recommendation that prejeans sentence should be reduced to 
irrevocable life imprisonment 
several courts have suggested that prejeans attorneys have been 
filing repetitive appeals aimed mostly at delaying the execution 
last fall the 5th us circuit court of appeals criticized 
defense lawyers for what the judges called an abuse of the appeals 
process the judges said prejeans lawyers were intentionally 
filing motions just before the scheduled execution dates so that 
judges with no time to review the paperwork would have to issue 
stays

the senate voted overhwelmingly today to limit 
debate and proceed with a bipartisan bill providing 600 million to 
states and cities hit hard by aids 
the senates 953 vote to limit debate was necessary to begin 
considering amendments after an opponent sen jesse helms rnc 
erected procedural roadblocks in the way of the bill 
helms had acknowledged that his lonely objection was futile and 
that the senate would ultimately approve the twoyear spending 
authorization 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine responded today 
to helms assertion that money was being spent on a disease spread 
through immorality 
mitchell said the government provides money through medicare to 
treat people whose smoking caused lung cancer or heart disease or 
whose reckless driving caused injury and should do no less for 
people with aids 
the congress doesnt refuse to care for these people because 
it is their behavior which led to the disease mitchell said 
as is the case of smoking and lung cancer we can do no less 
for those american men women and children with aids he said 
we must act now to provide emergency support to our nations 
cities and towns who continue to struggle to meet the overwhelming 
needs of aids patients 
helms said monday that the bill was a result of aids 
hysteria and neglects the role immorality has played in this 
crisis 
ive never heard once in this chamber anybody say to the 
homosexuals stop what youre doing helms said if they 
would stop what theyre doing there would not be one additional 
case of aids in the united states 
the only senators joining helms in voting against the debate 
limitation were sens gordon humphrey rnh and steven symms 
ridaho 
the bill has 65 senate cosponsors more than enough for passage 
said one of the sponsors sen edward m kennedy dmass 
a bipartisan group of supporters described the measure as 
emergency relief for communities and public health systems 
overburdened by people suffering from aids or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
the time has come to recognize aids as a national disaster 
that is disproportionately affecting certain areas of the 
country said sen alan cranston dcalif they cannot be 
expected to cope with this crisis alone 
under the bill 13 metropolitan areas would qualify for 300 
million atlanta boston chicago dallas houston los angeles 
miami new york newark nj philadelphia san francisco san 
juan puerto rico and washington dc 
those areas have reported 60 percent of the nations aids cases 
sponsors said the money would be used to care for aids patients 
and to bolster support programs 
another 300 million would go to states to develop comprehensive 
aids care programs especially services to small cities and rural 
areas 
opening debate monday pitted helms against a fellow conservative 
republican sen orrin hatch of utah 
hatch disputed helms assertion that ending homosexual behavior 
would halt the disease saying the aidscausing virus continues to 
be transmitted through other means 
it is foolish to say it just all comes because of highrisk 
homosexual conduct he said 
hatch said the lifestyles of aids sufferers shouldnt matter and 
cited federal estimates that as many as 1 million to 15 million 
people may be infected with the virus including as many as 25000 
children 
are we going to hold it against these children because their 
mothers are intravenous drug users hatch asked 
this is a bill to try to alleviate pain and suffering he 
said 
in a speech and an exchange with hatch on the senate floor 
helms charged that homosexual activity was to blame for the disease 
and called the bill another legislative flagship for the militant 
homosexual lobby he said money for research into cancer and 
other diseases was drying up while spending increased for aids

an attorney for retired ohio autoworker john 
demjanjuk today challenged the admissibility of two photo lineups 
used to identify demjanjuk as a sadistic death camp guard and 
convict him of nazi war drimes 
in his appeal before a fivejudge supreme court panel defense 
attorney yoram sheftel also attacked the trial court for failing to 
halt prejudicial press coverage of the trial 
a threejudge panel in april 1988 found demjanjuk 70 guilty of 
committing crimes against humanity and crimes against jews and 
sentenced him to death 
the trial judges accepted the testimony of survivors who 
identified the ukrainianborn demjanjuk with the help of 
photographs as ivan the terrible who operated gas chambers at 
treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland more than 850000 
jews perished there in 194243 
demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken identity and that he 
was incarcerated in german pow camps after being captured while 
serving in the soviet red army 
sheftel began the appeal monday by challenging the israeli 
courts jurisdiction to try an extradited suspect for war crimes 
and accusing the trial judges of being biased 
he expanded on the bias argument today blaming the judges for 
the emotional atmosphere surrounding the trial including a dec 1 
1988 attack in which a holocaust survivor threw acid in sheftels 
face at a funeral sheftel suffered an eye injury and still wears 
dark glasses as a result 
he said the assault followed a spate of inflammatory press 
accounts of the trial he cited an article that questioned his 
credibility and readiness as a jew to defend an alleged nazi 
collaborator 
this was a bloodletting report sheftel said the court 
didnt intercede or say anything after such reports the message 
is that such an action attacking sheftel would be heroic 
he also disputed the admissibility of two photograph lineups 
aided by the photos eight treblinka survivors singled out 
demjanjuk as the notorious guard ivan 
sheftel displayed a poster containing blowups of the lineups and 
said there were seven flaws in the identifiction process 
one lineup involved a page containing eight photographs 
including a 1951 shot of demjanjuk that he had filed with his 
application for a us immigration visa 
the second included a disputed picture of demjanjuk from a 1942 
identity card that the soviet union supplied to israel it 
purportedly is from the trawniki camp which trained death camp 
guards 
sheftel has claimed the trawniki document is a forgery 
he said today the photographs were improperly shown to the 
survivors demjanjuk for example was never called for an 
inperson lineup sheftel argued 
he noted rulings in both the united states and israel that a 
suspect should participate in person in criminal indentificaton 
procedures only if a suspect refuses should photographs be used 
sheftel said 
another flaw sheftel said was that none of the other head 
shots in either lineup resembled demjanjuk hair color shape and 
size of faces were clearly different 
it is like putting a photograph of a black suspect among seven 
white men where have you heard of such a thing sheftel said 
demjanjuk wearing a brown prison uniform sat flanked by two 
police guards and listened grimfaced to the daylong proceedings 
his wife vera and his son john jr watched from the front row 
asked about the appeals chances john jr said he was hopeful 
they have the courage to make a decision based on the facts and 
the law and the conviction will be overturned

the bodies of three slain palestinians 
including an israeliappointed village leader were discovered 
today in the west bank and a 14yearold arab died of wounds after 
being shot earlier by a jewish settler 
throughout the israelioccupied lands palestinians staged a 
protest strike to mark the 42nd anniversary of the founding of 
israel which led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of 
palestinians 
israel was founded may 15 1948 israelis mark independence day 
on april 30 according to the hebrew calendar 
the army clamped curfews on about 200000 palestinians in five 
gaza strip refugee camps to prevent clashes during the anniversary 
the army spokesman said the bodies of three slain palestinians 
were discovered in the west bank villages of balaa rafat and 
assira alshamaliya the villages are far apart 
he said the army was investigating the deaths which apparently 
were unrelated 
the victim in balaa was identified as farid saleh yassin a 
60yearold village leader appointed by israel arab reporters said 
six masked men abducted yassin from his home monday and stabbed him 
to death before dumping his body on the outskirts of the village 
a leaflet distributed in the village accused yassin of being a 
collaborator 
arab reporters said the decomposing body of ziad ahmed yassin 
25 no relation to farid was found near his home village of assira 
alshamaliya residents said ziad a laborer was abducted friday 
night by four masked men as he was returning home 
residents in rafat told reporters they were unable to identify a 
body found today that was badly battered and mutilated with stab 
wounds 
at least 213 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs during 
the 29month uprising most on suspicion of cooperating with 
israel the army says only a small number actually did cooperate 
also today israeli hospital officials confirmed the death of 
sameh ahmed abu sheikh 14 of qalqiliya arab reporters said he 
suffered bullet wounds in the neck and face sunday when an israeli 
settler fired on stonethrowers 
his death raised to 687 the number of palestinians slain by 
israeli soldiers and civilians fortythree israelis also have been 
killed 
in other developments state comptroller miriam ben porath said 
top army commanders share the blame for negative news coverage of 
israels handling of the uprising because they sometimes delay or 
withhold information 
long delays in getting out the army version of events which have 
already been reported promptly by arab sources have damaged the 
credibility of the army spokesman her report said 
an army official speaking on condition of anonymity said no 
one denies that sometimes in order to achieve reliability you have 
to sacrifice speed 
the comptroller also criticized the housing ministry for 
offering special financial incentives to lure ultraorthodox jews 
to the west bank settlement of betar southwest of jerusalem 
the report said the ministry offered each family willing to buy 
an apartment in betar an interestfree mortgage of 42000 and an 
additional grant of 7000 about 8000 housing units are planned 
in betar 
the comptroller said the enticements were offered in violation 
of standard criteria such as granting preferential mortgage 
conditions only to army veterans many ultraorthodox jews receive 
exemptions from army service to study 
also today israeli legislator yossi sarid demanded the defense 
ministry reveal details of five cases of alleged brutality by 
soldiers against palestinians 
in four of the cases troops reportedly seized palestinians 
took them to outoftheway places and beat them until their arms 
and legs were broken sarid said in the fifth incident 
palestinian detainees were left tied up for hours outside an army 
lockup in freezing temperatures

nasa technicians today removed a 
faulty valve that forced the agency to delay the launch of the 
space shuttle columbia from this week to the end of may or 
beginning of june 
a filter on the valve was torn allowing debris to enter 
columbias cooling system said lisa malone spokeswoman for the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
were pretty glad we did find the problem malone said 
now well be on the right track of putting everything back 
together 
columbia had been scheduled to lift off wednesday or thursday 
with seven astronauts and the 100 million astro observatory 
capable of examining sources of ultraviolet and xray radiation 
last week however engineers spotted a problem with the valve 
and nasa postponed the mission two to three weeks 
technicians working on a makeshift platform in columbias 
payload bay about 10 feet above the covered observatory began 
draining toxic freon refrigerant from the shuttles cooling system 
friday they completed the work late monday then cut out the 
valve about the length of a hand and some attached plumbing 
it was the first time such a procedure had ever been performed 
at the launch pad 
replacing the bad valve is expected to take nearly three days 
malone said the cooling system then will be refilled with freon 
and the entire system will be tested 
nasa is expected to set a new launch date early next week 
columbias nine to 10day flight will be the first spacelab 
mission since 1985 and the 36th shuttle mission 
the faulty valve was sent to a nearby rockwell international 
service center for analysis rockwell built columbia and the other 
shuttles

mayor marion barry pleaded innocent today to 
six new drug charges alleging he used cocaine over a fiveyear 
period 
i feel fantastic today i got a great defense team barry 
said outside the courthouse after entering his plea 
barry lawyer r kenneth mundy told us district court judge 
thomas penfield jackson that we enter a plea of not guilty to a 
14count indictment handed up last thursday against the mayor 
the new charges accuse barry of five misdemeanor counts of 
cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy the 
mayor took drugs as far back as 1984 the new indictment alleges 
barry previously pleaded innocent to eight charges brought feb 
15 alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and possessed 
cocaine on five occasions the new indictment includes all 14 
charges 
i am anxious to get this trial on by june 4 if it can possibly 
be done said jackson 
mundy said the last thing we want is a continuance pushing 
back the starting date of the trial the judge brought up the 
possibility that mundy might ask to sever the new charges into a 
separate case mundy did not indicate if he would take that 
approach even if all soviet armed forces return to the ussr and 
conventional arms control moves forward the soviet military will 
retain forces many times larger than those possessed by any other 
single state baker said 
he said the north atlantic treaty organization would not 
dissolve either to prevent war we must continue to deter 
aggression and contain the residual threat baker said 
he suggested the western alliance take on more of a political 
role however and consider holding a solid political and 
military dialogue with the soviet union and the countries of 
central and eastern europe 
bakers first meeting in the soviet union will involve the 
middle east he will see egyptian president hosni mubarak who is 
visiting moscow wednesday afternoon 
administration officials said last week baker does not plan to 
overhaul his strategy for getting stalled talks going between 
israel and palestinian arabs mubarak has been acting as a 
middleman between the bush administration and the palestinian 
liberation organization 
right after the mubarak meeting baker holds his first round 
with shevardnadze he is to see gorbachev friday morning and is 
scheduled to wind up his stay in moscow with a news conference 
saturday 
the most dramatic candidate for a summit signing a treaty 
declaration to reduce longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines is far from complete us and soviet negotiators have 
been wrangling for weeks over ballistic missiles with multiple 
warheads and over cruise missiles packed on jet bombers 
baker in a concession is prepared to inch closer to the soviet 
position on cruise missiles limiting their range to 500 miles 
instead of 625 miles but is looking for something in exchange 
said a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a separate treaty to reduce troops tanks airplanes and other 
nonnuclear arms in europe is moving slowly in negotiations between 
nato and the warsaw pact in vienna 
that treaty is designed for signing at a 35nation summit before 
the end of the year but president bush and gorbachev would like to 
report progress when they meet here 
the biggest obstacles are which airplanes and helicopters to 
limit and how compliance would be ensured 
we will be making our best effort within our interests to 
get the treaties done the senior official said 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
we have always said we hoped we could conclude a start strategic 
arms reduction treaty this year and that we hoped to be able to 
resolve all major issues in start by the summit 
if we do accomplish all that so much the better if we do 
not we will keep working at it she said 
bush last week offered to halt production of us chemical 
weapons if the soviets set a schedule for demolition of their 
stockpiles and accept other us demands 
baker will follow up the offer with shevardnadze but an 
agreement depends on the soviets accepting bushs demand that the 
two sides be allowed to retain small stockpiles of poison gas until 
40 nations agree to a global ban and implement it 
shadowing bakers trip is the unrest in lithuania and the 
partial economic blockade moscow has imposed on the baltic republic 
to try to diffuse a drive for independence 
the bush administration has urged the two sides to settle their 
differences through negotiations otherwise baker told congress 
recently pressure could build to impose us economic sanctions 
against moscow 
congressional sentiment is strongly on the side of the 
lithuanians bush and baker have publicly supported independence 
but also stressed the importance of maintaining good ussoviet 
relations

a us military team flew to laos today 
to excavate two us warplane crash sites that may yield the 
remains of american servicemen missing in action from the vietnam 
war a us official said 
after the two to threeweek excavation in southern laos the 
team will survey other sites and then cooperate with the laotians 
in a joint field investigation to try to resolve some discrepancy 
cases said jim williams spokesman of the us embassy in 
bangkok 
discrepancy cases which the united states considers of 
highest priority are those in which us officials say the 
laotians should have information they include cases of airmen who 
were known to have survived crashes but were never heard from again 
the 17member us team is from the joint casualty resolution 
center and the central identification laboratory both based in 
honolulu and entrusted with accounting for americas wartime 
missing personnel 
williams said these would be the fourth and fifth excavations 
jointly conducted with the laotians this year 
joint surveys of the two crash sites in march 1989 and in 
january this year found evidence that the sites may yield the 
remains of americans missing in action he said 
he said a total of 2303 americans are listed as missing in 
action from the vietnam war which also involved fnam 
williams said a march 1989 joint excavation resulted in the 
accounting for seven missing americans 
a joint excavation in january this year recovered remains that 
are still being analyzed he said no remains were found in the 
most recent dig in march

a soviet author living in the united states 
said today that writers in both superpower countries are forced to 
censor themselves 
inner censorship also exists in the american literature even 
though there is no such thing as the ideological totalitarianism in 
this country vassily aksyonov told the house subcommittee on the 
interior department and related agencies 
the subcommittee is conducting hearings on a request for 175 
million in fiscal 1991 for the national endowment for the arts the 
government artsfunding agency this years appropriation was 171 
million after funds were sequestered for the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing bill 
future funding has been threatened by a controversy surrounding 
a pair of photographic exhibits the exhibits included graphic 
depictions of homosexual acts and images considered by some to be 
sacrilegious 
aksyonov said that totalitarianism created the atmosphere in 
which soviet writers learned to censor themselves by hewing to the 
requirements of partymindedness populism and socialist 
realism 
in the united states he said the inner censorship looks 
subtler less imposing since it was created not by big brother 
but rather by our generous big sister mrs market 
on the surface everything looks logical and harmonious if one 
doesnt take into account that the public taste had been 
meticulously developed by the market itself rather than by 
literature he said 
aksyonov was the first in a series of witnesses including 
oscarwinning actress jessica tandy of driving miss daisy to 
testify 
others scheduled to appear were cellist yoyo ma writer george 
plimpton folklorist alan lomax actresses jane curtin and jane 
alexander theatrical producer producer joseph papp who refused an 
nea grant because of strings attached to funding this year and 
artists robert rauschenberg and roy lichtenstein 
aksyonov who teaches literature and writing at george mason 
university near washington dc was exiled from the soviet union 
in 1980

attorney general dick thornburgh today 
encouraged state and local drug war officials to provide both 
prison space and alternative sentences for drug law violators 
as a former governor im well aware of the resistance that 
you face thornburgh told the officials gathered at a conference 
called by the office of national drug control policy he described 
that response as notinmybackyard the kneejerk socalled 
nimby response 
yet thornburgh said citizens should be aware of the obvious 
alternative would they rather have dangerous felons at large in 
their own back yard or have them incarcerated in their 
neighborhood the answer and choice are clear 
he noted that the federal government is spending 14 billion 
this year to build more federal prisons and that 376 million 
seized from drug traffickers is helping to pay for new federal 
prison cells 
thornburgh said that seizures of such assets and the federal 
governments ability to share seizures with state and local 
officials sends a crystalclear message to those who might dabble 
in the drug business simply put as we say to the drug profiteers 
you make it we take it 
he also said that alternate means of punishment are available 
and should be expanded and that such options will be explored at a 
conference after labor day called in washington by the national 
institute of justice 
that conference will feature officials who are running such 
programs as boot camps intensified supervised probation and 
electronic monitoring in which prisoners stay home and their 
whereabouts are monitored by use of an electronic bracelet said 
harri j kramer a justice department spokeswoman 
thornburgh spoke a day after louis sullivan the secretary of 
health and human services told the conference that the government 
has hard facts not smokeandmirrors projections showing a 
steep decline in cocainerelated medical emergencies in the united 
states 
sullivan said reports from the drug abuse warning network showed 
a drop of nearly 20 percent in cocaine emergencies in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 after several years of increases 
now this decrease represents just one data point in an 
ongoing series of reports so we cannot describe it as a trend 
he said but let me say this the results i am reporting today 
are not smokeandmirrors projections assumptions extrapolations 
or hunches like some youve heard recently 
todays results are hard and fast data reflecting actual 
reported incidents of cocainerelated medical emergencies 
sullivan said as such they confirm what several surveys have 
indicated over the past year that we are making significant 
headway in our efforts to establish a drugfree america 
dr edgar adams director of the epidemiology division of the 
health and human services department said the drug abuse warning 
network which reports on 431 emergency rooms in 21 cities listed 
2300 cocainerelated medical emergencies in the first quarter of 
1985 
he said the number increased steadily to 10200 in the second 
quarter of 1988 and then leveled off at around 11000 in the 
fourth quarter of last year the reports declined to 8627 adams 
said he said the number of cases was down in 19 of the 21 
metropolitan areas and remained stable in the other two

compensate baghdad for nearly 100 tons of steel parts seized on 
suspicion they were to be used to build a giant gun capable of 
firing shells hundreds of miles 
minister tariq azizs visit to italy began shortly after police 
blocked export of the material most of which was about to be 
loaded at a naples dock for transport to the middle east 
police said the parts ordered by iraq and manufactured in 
italy were thought to be components of giant artillery 
aziz today reiterated iraqs contention the material was 
destined for petrochemical projects 
officials at the state steel company which made the parts have 
said the design provided by iraq raised no suspicions among 
technicians they said iraq paid about 4 million for the material 
during his visit aziz was to meet with un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar about stalled iraniraq peace talks but he 
also met monday with italian foreign minister gianni de michelis 
over the parts seizure 
iraq on monday said it would take legal action against britain 
italy turkey greece and any other countries that take illegal 
measures to stop exports of equipment ordered by iraq 
britain turkey greece and west germany have all seized 
material meant for baghdad and suspected of being weapons 
components 
aziz said today that while he made no threats in his meeting 
with de michelis he said iraq would demand compensation for 
material that was paid for but not delivered future trade and 
other deals could be jeopardized he said 
if italy insists on not giving iraq the material then they 
have to pay the sum paid by iraq aziz said 
the iraqi said de michelis told him the matter was under 
investigation by magistrates who will decide the outcome italy 
bans arms sales and deliveries to iraq as well as to iran libya 
and syria

gun iraq would show it off to everybody

an israeli propaganda campaign 
aziz was asked about gerald bull the canadian arms designer who 
helped iraq develop missile research bull was assassinated in 
brussels in march

something to do with iraqi firms but i cannot confirm and i cannot

the dalai lama said today he was pleased 
with progress over the past two days in reforming his increasingly 
ineffective governmentinexile despite conservative opposition to 
change 
up to now everything has depended on me but i am getting 
older the 54yearold buddhist monk said in an interview a 
democratic system of government is more important than an 
individual person 
on monday 368 representatives of the 120000 tibetans overseas 
elected for the first time the governmentinexiles kashag or 
cabinet which has headquarters in the northern indian town of 
dharmsala previously they were nominated by the dalai lama 
but only three of the seven seats were filled in two rounds of 
balloting conservative opponents of the dalai lamas plan to 
separate himself from the daytoday governing of the tibetan 
movement handed in blank ballots and dropped out of the race for 
cabinet seats 
with a laugh the dalai lama said he would be happy to work with 
a cabinet of three that is what the people wanted we are on the 
road to democracy he said 
the dalai lama who won the 1989 nobel peace prize for his 
advocacy of nonviolence in tibets struggle against chinese rule 
ordered the changes friday when he dissolved the kashag and the 
assembly of tibetan peoples deputies or parliament 
the spiritual and temporal leader of the worlds 6 million 
tibetans said he wanted his movement to become more democratic 
many tibetans oppose the reforms because they fear the 
responsibility that democracy entails said tenzin namgyal tethong 
a newly elected cabinet member 
in the past they thought the dalai lama would handle 
everything now the people realize that their participation is also 
important said tethong the dalai lamas chief representative in 
washington the dalai lama is telling us to get involved in the 
movement again it is a challenge 
tethong is joined in the cabinet by the dalai lamas younger 
sister jetsen pema known for her work with tibetan children and 
in education and kelsang yeshi a former minister for culture and 
religious affairs 
another reason for opposition to reforms is that many tibetans 
revere the dalai lama as a living god and feel his authority should 
not be challenged by a government outside his control 
i am just a monk maybe a popular one but just a monk the 
dalai lama said with a chuckle 
tethong said the next step will be to reform elections and the 
parliament he said a new expanded body will be elected by the end 
of the year and will better represent the exiled tibetan community 
tethong and later the dalai lama said the reform was necessary 
to rebut charges from beijing that tibetans live in a backward 
feudal society dominated by conservative monks and superstition 
the dalai lama said changes in eastern europe have convinced him 
of the fragile nature of chinese communism he said he believes 
that within 10 years tibetan exiles will be able to return to their 
mountainous homeland 
the governmentinexile also has been criticized for not taking 
advantage of proindependence protests in tibet in which scores 
died over the past two years on may 1 china lifted martial law in 
the tibet capital of lhasa after more than 13 months 
communist china claims tibet has been part of china since the 
13th century but tibetans claim their land has been an independent 
nation since antiquity 
chinese communist troops marched into tibet in 1950 nine years 
later chinese security forces brutally crushed an uprising 
forcing the dalai lama to flee with 80000 followers to india where 
he set up his governmentinexile

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will 
visit minnesota on june 3 while he is in the united states for the 
summit meeting gov rudy perpich announced today 
in a statement from his office the governor said he was 
officially notified of the visit this morning by yuriy v dubinin 
soviet ambassador to the united states dubinin told perpich that 
the soviet leader would stop in minnesota from 1 pm to 7 pm 
june 3 
gorbachev would like to meet with representatives of the 
business community and agricultural leaders in the state perpich 
said in the statement the statement didnt indicate whether 
gorbachevs wife raisa would accompany him 
president gorbachevs visit to minnesota is a tremendous 
compliment to the people of minnesota perpich said 
earlier before the plans for the visit were confirmed perpich 
had pronounced the prospect of a visit from gorbachev bigger than 
the super bowl and said hed like to take the soviet leader to 
meet his parents 
its almost too good to be true yet said the governor who 
extended the invitation in a feb 26 letter i didnt believe it 
at first the russians are coming can you imagine 
i think its bigger than the super bowl he said the super 
bowl comes to minneapolis in 1992 
business leaders meanwhile savored the opportunity to forge 
closer ties to the soviet union in such areas as high technology 
and food processing 
gorbachev is to arrive in washington on may 30 the talks are to 
conclude by june 3 
when asked the one place he would take gorbachev perpich said 
what comes to me almost immediately is hibbing to visit my 
father and mother perpichs 90yearold father a retired miner 
immigrated from yugoslavia in 1920 and his mother 78 is the 
daughter of immigrant parents 
richard bohr executive director of the minnesota trade office 
said the invitation to gorbachev may have been kept alive in part 
by the soviet leaders fascination with nikita khrushchevs 
visit to iowa in 1959 
albert eisele a former control data corp employee who said it 
was his idea to invite gorbachev said the iowa trip generated good 
publicity for khrushchev but he said a visit to minnesota would 
have economic purposes as well 
minnesota has high technology health care food processing 
packaging and distribution and education everything the soviets 
need said eisele a lobbyist in washington for that reason we 
would very much want him to come and establish a closer 
relationship 
robert schmidt a former executive of control data said the 
twin cities business community will propose a forum to meet with 
gorbachev 
there are lots of things going on here in the state of 
minnesota that i always thought would be of interest to 
gorbachev schmidt said 
from 1969 to 1979 when trade was interrupted by the soviet 
invasion of afghanistan control data sold more than 150 million 
worth of computers to the soviets schmidt said 
schmidt said the soviets have colossal agricultural problems 
that could be solved with the technology of minnesota companies 
geo a hormel amp co for example is interested in modernizing 
food packaging storage and distribution in the soviet union he 
said many soviet farm products spoil before they reach the market 
schmidt said 
vern freeh vice president of international affairs for land 
olakes inc said the dairy cooperative is trying to open an 
agricultural operation south of moscow 
other minnesota companies doing business in the soviet union 
include automated controls maker honeywell inc and grain merchant 
cargill inc 
freeh said gorbachevs decision to extend his stay in the united 
states is the mark of a very astute politician 
if he says i want to see the middle of your country and the 
west coast people will say hey theres quite a guy freeh

electionyear promises bumping against the 
constraints of deficit reduction are complicating the 1990 farm 
bill 
as negotiators from congress and the white house start their 
budget summit today the house and senate agriculture committees 
continue efforts behind closed doors to write their bigmoney 
commodities programs 
staffers say the senate committees proposals could make it into 
the open by wednesday for a vote by the panel 
the house however is moving more slowly as a task force 
composed of agriculture subcommittee chairmen and ranking 
republicans review the promises made at subcommittee level 
we have promised policies we do not have money for rep 
kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the committee has said 
the house agriculture committee also is getting pressure from a 
small group of lawmakers who say theyll attack the farm bill on 
the floor if its price support programs are too protective of 
farmers with high incomes 
that group led by reps richard armey rtexas and charles 
schumer dny represents a problem agricultural interests in the 
house have with congressmen who dont need farmers to get elected 
the entire house and the onethird of the senate is up for 
election this fall 
in the senate where every member has a farm constituency the 
money is a little looser though the budget summit may change that 
the talks are aimed at finding enough savings to hold next 
years federal deficit to no more than 64 billion the target set 
by the grammrudman balancedbudget law 
white house budget chief richard darman has said that 60 
billion to 100 billion in deficit reduction might be necessary 
republicans said monday that among their chief goals will be 
reductions in domestic spending including farm price supports 
the bill the senate agriculture committee has been working on 
was introduced by the socalled prairie populists led by sen 
bob kerrey dneb and including sens thomas daschle dsd tom 
harkin diowa kent conrad dnd and james exon dneb 
their proposal while not quite living up to the fiery 
language of the groups press conference calls for higher loan 
rates and target prices as well as an optional bushelbase supply 
management program all paralleling the most progressive concepts 
still alive on the house side said the national family farm

chancellor helmut kohl has found that the 
road to german unification is paved with obstacles and marred by an 
occasional pothole 
the latest trouble is a state elections setback that pushed kohl 
to suggest joint german voting a year earlier than planned to 
regain his partys momentum 
kohl and his coalition allies agreed today that elections for a 
united german government should occur as soon as possible that 
brought immediate criticism from the opposition social democrats 
the chancellor conceded a bitter defeat in sundays 
elections in two west german states the social democrats defeated 
his conservative christian democratic party and won control of the 
upper house of parliament the bundesrat 
the social democrats have opposed kohls plans for a quick 
unification proposing a more cautious approach 
hans klein the chief government spokesman said today that all 
sides were unanimously agreed there should be allgerman elections 
at the earliest possible date 
he was not more specific but alfred dregger parliamentary 
leader of kohls christian democrats said he favors either 
replacing the dec 2 federal elections with allgerman ones or 
holding the allgerman vote when the current legislative period 
ends jan 13 1991 
finance minister theodor waigel said he believes an allgerman 
vote will occur this year 
the lower house the bundestag is the actual lawmaking body 
but bundesrat approval is needed for legislation that has direct 
consequences for the finances of west germanys 11 states 
kohls defeat was just one of a growing list of obstacles that 
are plaguing kohls ambitious plans for a rapid unification these 
include 
moscows flat refusal to budge from its position that a united 
germany may not belong to the nato alliance 
polands call for a formal guarantee that a united germany 
will have no claims to its western border 
the threat by east germanys social democrats to pull out of 
the government if unification does not provide strong social 
benefits 
the strong disagreement between east germans and west germans 
over how much property west germans will be able to buy in east 
germany 
that disagreement also reflects east germanys strong fear of 
economic domination by the larger and economically more powerful 
west germany 
the whole thing is going to quickly and just hasnt been 
thought through said one woman during a demonstration of 
shopkeepers monday in east berlin 
east german tenants are banding together to fight what they 
predict will be skyrocketing rents as a result of unification 
others fear the evergrowing number of west germans coming back 
to claim property they abandoned while fleeing the communists after 
world war ii 
east german women are demanding a retention of their nations 
liberal abortion law rather than west germanys more restrictive 
regulations 
in west germany anxious citizens are worriedly pointing to the 
astronomical costs of unification that could run into hundreds of 
billions of dollars 
they are also concerned over predictions of high inflation 
similar to the huge price increases that preceeded the nazi era 
west german voters took their dissatisfaction to the ballot box 
on sunday leading to a resounding defeat for kohls christian 
democrats 
strong support for christian democrats in east germany would 
help kohl if allgerman balloting were held in december but such

communist rebels claimed 
responsibility tuesday for the weekend slaying of two american 
airmen and threatened more killings until all us military members 
leave the country 
also tuesday president corazon aquinos government formally 
told the united states that the lease on the six us military 
bases here expires in september 1991 and cannot be extended 
the move was largely symbolic and us and filipino officials 
said it does not rule out a new accord 
police arrested about 50 people tuesday after they staged a 
motorcade to demand the bases be closed 
in a statement to news organizations the central luzon command 
of the new peoples army said it punished the two americans 
airmen john h raven 19 of delta junction alaska and james c 
green 20 of craig colo because of us aggression and 
intervention in the internal affairs of our country 
the two were shot sunday with 45caliber pistols at close range 
while waiting for a ride near clark air base 50 miles north of 
manila a companion airman 1c randall moore escaped uninjured 
this incident serves as a warning to the us government and 
its local puppet regime the statement said we will not stop 
until abuses by american officers and soldiers have ceased we will 
not stop until all us bases and all american occupational 
soldiers are kicked out of our country 
us authorities banned the 40000 troops defense department 
civilians and military dependents from leaving their bases in the 
wake of the killing those living offpost were ordered to stay 
home when off duty 
the statement did not mention the may 4 killing of us marine 
gunnery sgt john fredette near subic 50 miles west of manila 
us officials believe the rebels were also responsible for killing 
fredette 
the communist rebels fighting the philippine government for more 
than 21 years have repeatedly threatened to kill americans 
in 1989 rebels gunned down us army col james nick rowe 
a decorated vietnam war veteran in october 1987 rebels killed two 
enlisted airmen and a retired us air force sergeant near clark 
us and philippine officials began the second day of talks in 
manila to decide whether to enter formal negotiations on a new 
bases agreement 
although there is growing opposition in the philippines to the 
us bases many filipinos support them because they pump an 
estimated 1 billion into the economy every year 
in a surprise move foreign secretary raul manglapus the chief 
philippine delegate presented a formal notice of termination 
for clark air base the subic bay naval base and the four smaller 
us installations 
the government of the philippines hereby notifies the 
government of the united states of america that the 1947 
philippinesunited states military bases agreement ends on sept 
16 1991 and cannot be extended the notice said 
rafael alunan spokesman for the philippine panel said the 
notice given by manglapus to chief us negotiator richard 
armitage did not rule out a new agreement 
our constitution mandate is to be open to new ideas to lead 
us to a new negotiation for a new treaty alunan said it does 
not preclude new negotiations for a new treaty 
although largely symbolic the move underscored differences 
between the two governments over when the bases must close if no 
new agreement is reached 
the philippines maintains the current agreement allows the bases 
to remain until sept 16 1991 the united states claims they could 
stay one year longer 
the 1947 military bases agreement allowed the united states to 
maintain installations here for 99 years in 1966 the agreement 
was amended so that the pact would remain in force for 25 more 
years subject to termination upon one years notice by either 
government 
according to the us interpretation the philippines would have 
to wait until sept 16 1991 to give one years notice 
in 1986 a few months after mrs aquino took office the 
constitution was rewritten to state that after expiration in 1991 
of the agreement concerning military bases foreign military 
bases troops or facilities shall not be allowed in the 
philippines unless provided for under a new treaty 
philippine officials say the new constitution supersedes the 
1966 timetable 
stanley schrager spokesman for the us panel said american 
negotiators were surprised by the timing of the philippine notice 
he said the us hopes a new agreement can be reached before 
september 1991 making the difference of opinion on the expiration 
moot

the 20th anniversary of two slayings 
during protests at jackson state passed unobserved this morning on 
a quiet sunny campus where a handful of students and staff handled 
betweensemester business 
the shootings were something that hit the news real fast 
and sort of got real hushed said cass parker an assistant 
chemistry professor and former student at jackson state the 
students interest has changed tremendously there seems to be a 
resurgence in student interest but its not the same i guess 
its a little subdued 
there was no observance of the day james earl green and phillip 
gibbs were shot to death mainly because school was out said 
parker a jackson state student from 19711975 classes ended may 
12 and will resume june 12 
on may 2 about 300 people attended a convocation and held a 
candlelight vigil at a marble memorial dedicated to gibbs and green 
at about 1205 am on may 15 1970 law enforcement officers 
opened fire on students at thenjackson state college during a 
protest on the vietnam war and civil rights issues 
the barrage of rifle and shotgun fire lasted about a minute 
killed were gibbs a 21yearold prelaw major from ripley who was 
taking part in the protest and the 17yearold green a jackson 
high school student who was walking through the college campus on 
his way home from work 
the shootings followed by less than two weeks the deaths of four 
students at kent state university in ohio during an antiwar 
protest there 
author and poet margaret alexander walker the featured speaker 
at the may 2 ceremonies chided students for not turning out in 
greater numbers to remember the dead however school officials 
noted later that classes wernt dismissed for the days events 
the school had about 3700 students in 1970 and has about 7150 
today 93 percent of them black 
students were not discussing the convocation said parker 
it was just another something else that happened 
tracie archie a 20yearold political science student was 
showing a friend around campus this morning and stopped by the 
memorial briefly 
they had it in the paper but a lot of students didnt know 
about it she said there wasnt much talk about the 
shootings my mother told me about it

a woman was convicted of manslaughter and 
assault today in the beating death of her newly adopted 2yearold 
child and her husband was found guilty of assault but acquitted of 
the more serious charge 
monroe county judge donald wisner found bernice kittelberger 
32 guilty of seconddegree manslaughter and seconddegree assault 
in the death last august of maurice west who died just eight weeks 
after coming to rochester from a cincinnati foster home 
wisner found gerald kittelberger 30 innocent of the 
manslaughter charge but convicted him for seconddegree assault 
the couple had waived a jury trial and did not testify in their 
own defense 
the judge allowed the kittelbergers to remain free without bail 
until sentencing july 25 the manslaughter conviction carries a 
maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and seconddegree assault 
has a maximum sentence of seven years 
the trial was attended by maurices former foster parents from 
cincinnati jan and dale west the wests had wanted to adopt 
maurice but were turned down because they were white and the child 
was black 
the wests have criticized adoption officials for placing maurice 
with the kittelbergers who are black arguing there was inadequate 
investigation and followthrough 
monroe county medical examiner dr nicholas t forbes testified 
that he believed maurices death was a direct result of repeated 
and severe beatings he said he could not however say exactly 
what caused the child to die 
witnesses testified that maurices face legs buttocks and 
genitals were severely bruised and swollen and that there were 
partially healed burns on the palms and backs of his hands 
in a statement to police mrs kittelberger said maurice died 
after choking on oatmeal both kittelbergers told police that they 
had beaten the child with a belt a paddle and a stick wrapped with 
tape to punish him for resisting toilet training 
defense attorneys argued that medical experts had been unable to 
pinpoint the specific cause of maurices death and asked that the 
charges be reduced to thirddegree assault a misdemeanor 
thomas cocuzzi who represented mrs kittelberger acknowledged 
that she had used inappropriate force on maurice but that is not 
enough for you to convict her of either of the counts he argued 
alvita eason kittelbergers attorney said her client was not 
home the morning maurice died at the time forbes suggested the 
child received a fatal injury 
but richard a keenan assistant monroe county district 
attorney said kittelberger had beaten maurice himself and knew his 
wife was beating the child

industrial production fell 04 percent in 
april in what analysts called a sign of continuing weakness in 
manufacturing 
the federal reserve today attributed the drop to a 14 percent 
decline in production of cars and light trucks 
industrial production excluding motor vehicles and parts was 
unchanged in april and has shown little movement since january 
the nations central bank reported 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgrawhill a lexington 
mass forecasting organization said the report was in line with 
all the other signals that we have had that the industrial sector 
is the weak link right now in the economy 
industrial production had risen 05 percent in march and 09 
percent in february the advances were revised from increases of 
07 percent originally reported for march and 08 percent for 
february output had fallen 10 percent in january 
last month people were talking about accelerating growth 
said thomas runiewicz an econmist with the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa this kind of brings us back to our senses when you 
discount the auto sector it really shows the economy is flat 
ms latta said the drop in auto production was not as bad as 
it looks 
if the auto industry was producing full tilt she said it 
would have to cut back sharply because of slow sales that in 
turn would produce further job losses 
indeed richard w rahn chief economist with the us chamber 
of commerce said the weak 01 percent growth in industrial 
production in the last 12 months has been accompanied by a loss of 
280000 factory jobs 
output at factories producing both durable and nondurable goods 
fell 06 percent in april durable manufacturing was off a full 10 
percent while nondurable output slipped 01 percent 
mining production however rose 09 percent while utility 
output gained 06 percent 
the fed said its industrial production index in april stood at 
1087 percent of its 1987 base down from 1091 percent in march 
the fed also reported the operating rate of the nations 
factories mines and utilities which usually move in tandem with 
industrial production dipped 05 percentage point to 830 percent 
in april the operating rate measures not only output but also 
changes in productivity levels 
the overall manufacturing operating rate fell 07 points to 822 
percent the rate at factories producing durable goods fell a full 
percentage point to 807 percent while the rate at plants making 
nondurable goods slipped from 846 percent in march to 843 
percent last month 
the operating rate at mines rose 09 points to 883 percent 
while it jumped 05 points to 866 percent at utilities

worked late into the night to sign agreements early today on 
guarantees of free elections media time and campaign funds and 
fairness 
the first postwar multiparty elections will be held june 10 a 
runoff will be held a week later

the udf said in a separate statement that there are no conditions 
for holding free honest and democratic elections in bulgaria 
according to bta the nikola petkov party urged the present 
government of former communists to resign and be replaced by an 
interim coalition able to ensure democratic preparations for free 
elections 
the party said it would contest the june 10 elections but 
leveled harsh accusations against the socialists who govern alone 
and dominate national politics 
the socialists reject blame for the imprisonment torture 
murder or repression of hundreds of thousands of people in the 
stalinist 1950s the nikola petkov party charged 
it also claimed that the former communist partys functionaries 
have weapons that voters are being threatened and that there are 
cases of physical violence

bidding for a chance to oust gov kay orr 
in oregons primary for governor attorney general dave 
frohnmayer is favored to win the gop nomination to replace retiring 
democratic gov neil goldschmidt secretary of state barbara 
roberts is unopposed on the democratic side 
in senate races twoterm democrat james exon of nebraska has no 
primary opposition and former republican rep hal daub is favored 
to win the nomination to challenge him oregon sen mark hatfields 
bid for a fifth term is opposed by one longshot challenger in the 
gop primary six democrats are seeking their partys nomination 
including businessman harry lonsdale who criticizes hatfields 
antiabortion views 
in pennsylvania gov robert p caseys opposition to abortion 
is at odds with prevailing political stands nationally the 
democratic party favors abortion rights and the gop seeks to ban 
abortion 
casey who in november signed a tough antiabortion law is 
being challenged in the primary by lawyer philip s berg who has 
based his underdog campaign on that issue 
i believe that this primary election will be decided by voters 
who will choose to reaffirm individual rights berg said 
casey who is seeking a second term has asked voters to look 
beyond abortion to his administrations efforts to clean up the 
environment tackle drugs boost economic development and increase 
aid to education 
i think this election is going to be a referendum on my 
record casey said 
on the republican side prochoice auditor general barbara hafer 
is challenged by marguerite peg luksik of johnstown who 
opposes abortion hafer has the endorsement of the republican state 
committee 
i would say im a long shot but anybody on the ballot is 
viable and im on the ballot mrs luksik said win or lose i 
think its been good for the state

elected governor of any state is expected to overcome a primary 
challenge from omaha businessman mort sullivan

percent partly because of lingering resentment over a state tax 
hike early in her administration

director of the democratic governors association kay orr is one 
of the most vulnerable incumbent republican governors and we have 
a very good group of opponents

especially with advertising revenues going through what one called 
the worst cycle ive seen in years

circulation and street sales the newspaper will not be delivered

he said hes not trying to compete directly with the kansas city 
star a morning paper with daily circulation of 297000 
rose said he got the idea for a newspaper in march when the 
kansas city star co stopped publishing an afternoon edition and 
merged it with the morning newspaper after years of declining 
afternoon circulation 
i dont want and i dont need 50000 to 100000 readers

change thats exactly where ralph ingersoll ended up 
ingersoll started the tabloid st louis sun to compete with the 
st louis postdispatch for morning readers but the sun shut down 
last month after only seven months ingersoll cited homedelivery 
costs and inadequate street sales 
roses newspaper unlike the much larger st louis sun has an 
editorial staff of four it will consist mostly of news from wire

the antiabortion group operation rescue spent 
more than 50000 for november demonstrations that kept women out 
of washingtonarea clinics in violation of a court order a federal 
judge was told today 
attorney larry eisenstein who represents the national 
organization for women and planned parenthood said operation 
rescue and its leaders should be found in contempt of a nov 8 
order that prohibited blockades of abortion clinics 
he asked that they be fined a large enough figure to deter 
them from returning in the future 
police arrested more than 700 protesters during a nov 17 
demonstration on charges that they violated a new district of 
columbia law 
todays hearing in us district court came one day after the 
supreme court by a vote of 54 turned down operation rescues 
request for emergency help the court let stand a georgia judges 
injunction that keeps members of the group at least 50 feet away 
from any atlanta facility where abortions are performed 
however in atlanta today operation rescue protesters defied the 
supreme court decision and entered an abortion clinic police said 
five persons were arrested after they entered the atlanta 
surgicenter and chained themselves together 
there are similar legal challenges to operation rescue 
demonstrations at abortion clinics in other states 
at todays hearing before us district judge louis f 
oberdorfer eisenstein showed videotapes of three november 
demonstrations in an effort to prove that operation rescue project 
rescue and their leaders violated oberdorfers injunction 
now and planned parenthood name five individuals as defendants 
along with the two organizations only one clifford gannett was 
in court today 
eisenstein said he would present witnesses to show that gannett 
was active in the blockades nov 11 and nov 17 at the hillcress 
womens surgicenter and the washington surgi clinic in violation 
of the order 
eisenstein also said he would show that organization rescue 
which says it is in debt spent well in excess of 50000 and 
maybe well more than 100000 on the november operations 
he said that 1989 donations to the two organizations exceeded 
700000 and that they deposited more than 11 million in bank 
accounts 
the high court monday rejected an emergency request by operation 
rescue members who said the atlanta injunctin is violating their 
freespeech rights 
operation rescue spokesman bob jewitt called mondays action a 
little stumble along the way adding we feel well be 
victorious in the long run 
lynne randall who operates an atlanta clinic that has been a 
frequent target of the protests welcomed the action we have to 
balance womens right to privacy with peoples right to protest 
she said 
since july 1988 when atlanta hosted the democratic national 
convention city police have arrested 1320 demonstrators at 
operation rescue sitins many of the protesters barricaded 
abortion clinics blocking patients and employees from entering or 
leaving 
operation rescue members michael hirsch gina robertson william 
haynes steve britt and pamela sekulow said in the court appeal 
that the atlanta injunction deters them from engaging in prayer 
picketing leafleting and other forms of peaceful expression on 
public forum streets and sidewalks 
the state judge who issued the injunction is considering a 
request to modify it and a formal challenge to the injunction is 
before the georgia supreme court 
operation rescue founder randall terry who spent time in jail 
until a contempt of court fine for violating a similar injunction 
in new york was paid called mondays court action an outrage 
our rights are being denied because were prolife christians 
if we were homosexuals does anyone really think that we would be 
denied access to a public sidewalk terry said

china has canceled a 550 million deal with a 
us defense contractor to modernize its f8 fighter jets the 
state department said today 
under the 1986 deal grumman corp was to equip the planes with 
sophisticated electronics and navigation and radar equipment 
the chinese government has decided not to proceed beyond the 
development phase at this time said richard boucher the state 
dpartments deputy spokesman 
boucher declined to speculate on the reasons for the decision or 
the employment impact at grumman he said the development phase of 
the project will be completed this fall 
but a us official who commented on condition he not be 
identified said the chinese apparently were concerned about rising 
costs and the fact that immediate delivery of the sophisticated 
gear is barred by the ban on military exports imposed by the united 
states after the crushing of chinas prodemocracy movement 
we have not made any deliveries and we will not make any until 
circumstances change boucher said 
they made the decision they didnt want to proceed with the 
production phase lt cmdr edward lundquist a pentagon 
spokesman told the los angeles times earlier 
the chinese embassy in washington would not comment on the 
decision however the times quoted unidentified defense industry 
sources as saying the chinese had expressed concern over cost 
overruns on the project 
dubbed peace pearl the agreement ranked among the largest of 
its kind reached between china and the united states in the 1980s 
the deal was touted at the time as the basis for strategic 
cooperation against the soviet union 
under peace pearl the chinese air force and grumman based in 
bethpage ny were to upgrade 55 planes at 10 million each but 
one unidentified industry analyst told the times the cost overruns 
could total 200 million 
mariam reid a grumman spokeswoman referred questions about the 
deal to the pentagon 
the bush administration suspended us military sales and 
deliveries to china last year after the government crushed the 
prodemocracy movement 
the administration also expelled 40 chinese officers assigned to 
the peace pearl project at grumman in bethpage and at 
wrightpatterson air force base near dayton ohio but it allowed 
longterm military programs such as peace pearl to continue and 
eventually allowed the chinese officers to return to the united 
states 
the arms modernization pact was signed in 1986 after 
thendefense secretary caspar w weinberger offered the idea during 
a 1983 trip to beijing

the widow of singer harry chapin has 
settled for 65000 a lawsuit in which a writer accused her of 
interfering with publication of a biography of chapin 
sandy chapins lawyer tony curto who had maintained in court 
that there was no interference with the book described the 
agreement monday as settlement of a nuisance 
the writer peter coan sued the chapin estate for 9 million in 
1984 alleging that the biography he contracted to write for 
pedigree books three years earlier was suppressed because the 
estate threatened legal action the book was published in 1987 by 
ashley books of long island 
coan said he accepted the settlement because pursuing the case 
would have cost much more in time and money 
chapin was killed in a car crash on the long island expressway 
in 1981 his widow lives in huntington bay

as white house deficit negotiations got under 
way tuesday a brookings institution report disputed president 
bushs inaugural speech assertion that the nation has more will 
than wallet 
whats lacking it said is not wealth but leadership 
the question is not whether america has enough wallet but 
whether it has the will to use its abundant wealth to solve the 
problems that it faces wrote henry aaron a senior economist 
with the liberal research organization 
the country has plenty of wealth the report said 
the united states is a nation blessed with the highest per 
capita income its national product is 2 times larger than that of 
the secondlargest economy the report said it is enjoying its 
longest peacetime expansion 
facing no military threat or economic crisis the united states 
can muddle through without absolute decline aaron said 
yet americans cannot escape the reality that decisions taken 
during this decade will determine whether the chronicle of growth 
at home and influence abroad continues or flags he said 
the report setting national priorities by nine brookings 
researchers is intended to take a centrist stance toward 
problems on the budget foreign policy defense trade global 
warming education health care and political paralysis 
it was a coincidence that the booksize report came out the day 
talks were opening between bush and congressional leaders on ways 
to take as much as 100 billion out of the projected deficit 
bush who said on inauguration day that the united states cannot 
solve all the worlds problems because we have more will than 
wallet has consistently opposed a tax increase to reduce the 
deficit 
but a tax increase could emerge from the budget talks even 
though both parties have shied away from advocating one the talks 
are expected to last for weeks and could drag on throughout the 
summer 
writing about the political impasse that has made deficit 
reduction difficult political scientist thomas e mann said the 
most striking and unsettling feature of american politics is 
the stark contrast betweeen the extraordinary pace and scope of 
change occurring outside the country and the political immobilism 
within 
mann said bush was unlikely to adopt daring solutions to the 
nations economic problems and was almost sure to prefer to stick 
with a political strategy that barring a deep recession is very 
likely to lead to his reelection in 1992 
but mann argued by accepting a modest increase in taxes 
weighted toward those highincome households that reaped most of 
the economic benefits of the 1980s the president could help the 
country and enhance his own reelection prospects 
such a course he said would eliminate the deficit lower 
interest rates increase investment fuel economic growth and not 
incidentally neutralize efforts by the democrats to mount a 
populist critique of the gop 
these presidential initiatives could break the policy logjam 
help the country begin to deal with its longterm challenges and 
put the republican party in a position to increase its strength at 
all levels of elective office he said 
he said however that it was doubtful that either party would 
adopt unconventional strategies to deal with the nations problems 
aaron labled the problem a psychosis of poverty and 
helplessness 
he blamed it on an extended consumption binge arising from 
the countrys refusal to save more and to cut both personal and 
government spending or to tax itself enough to scale down the 
deficit 
depressed saving slows growth of worker productivity he 
said it is conventional wisdom that because of the deficit the 
united states cannot afford to solve serious problems of health 
care education and infrastructure 
in fact failure to attack these problems and the deficit 
simultaneously stems from a deeper common source american leaders 
have been unwilling or unable to try to persuade the people of the 
need to cut spending to raise taxes or to take other controversial 
actions 
in a proposal to convert the deficit into a modest surplus by 
1995 economist charles l schultze raised the possibility of 
cutting or taxing social security benefits raising taxes by 1 
percent of the national income cutting spending on such middle 
class subsidies as the farm program school lunches for middle 
class children disability compensation to veterans with low 
disability ratings and subsidies for merchant vessels 
he also raised the possibility of imposing user fees for grazing 
on federal lands and raising interest rates for rural 
electrification loans 
that the nation can muddle through sustaining large budget 
deficits without a cyclical crisis does not mean that deficits do 
no harm and can be ignored schultze wrote a successful 
economy ought not only to avoid recession and inflation but also 
to provide for future growth

the united states should consider military 
strikes against air terrorists and conduct covert operations if 
direct action is not possible a presidential commission 
investigating the bombing of pan am flight 103 recommended today 
the sevenmember commission also called for notification of 
passengers when there is a credible bomb threat and it recommended 
major changes in the federal aviation administrations security 
operations 
the us civil aviation security system is seriously flawed 
and has failed to provide the proper level of protection for the 
traveling public the report said this system needs major 
reform 
the report also called for a halt to the faas order for 
widespread installation of sophisticated plastic explosive 
detection devices saying the machines likely would not have 
detected the bomb that blew up flight 103 
the commission called the faa an agency that simply reacts to 
disasters and doesnt do enough to prevent them 
the sevenmember panel headed by former labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin spent nine months investigating the dec 21 1988 
bombing which killed all 259 people aboard the jetliner and 11 
people on the ground in lockerbie scotland the panels budget was 
1 million 
despite the commissions sharp criticism of government efforts 
faa administrator james busey said he welcomed the report busey 
said an faa group would meet with the independent commissions 
staff to implement those recommendations that meet the faas one 
essential criterion to help eradicate airline terrorism 
the commissions recommendations are a welcome contribution to 
our efforts of the last year to enhance aviation security and to 
attack the global threat of terrorism in our skies busey said 
members of the commission which included four members of 
congress and two former military figures handed a copy of the 
report to president bush and victims family members this morning 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we certainly 
agree that we need to be as aggressive as necessary to fight 
terrorism but he declined comment on the reports specific 
recommendations 
bush told the commissioners they had done an excellent job 
fitzwater said the president said well take it and get right to 
work on the problems 
paul hudson whose 16yearold daughter melina died on the 
flight said the report appears to validate and document the belief 
of victims relatives that flawed aviation policies and 
procedures permitted the pan am 103 bombing to kill our loved 
ones in the worst terrorist attack in us history 
victoria cummock whose husband john died in the bombing called 
the report a very good first step 
the philosophy of aviation security has got to change its 
got to take hearings legislation and action she said 
the destruction of flight 103 may well have been 
preventable the report said but it said it is impossible to 
say whether the failure of any specific security procedure was 
directly related to the sabotage of the flight 
the united states should pursue a more vigorous 
counterterrorism policy particularly with respect to nations 
sponsoring terrorists the report said 
the commission recommended planning training and equipping the 
military for direct preemptive or retaliatory military actions 
against known terrorist hideouts in countries that sanction them 
it also called for public support of actions to punish 
terrorists 
national will and the moral courage to use it is the 
ultimate means to defeat terrorism the report said 
commission members gave bush a private briefing on the report 
two hours before the president met with families of those killed in 
the bombing 
among other key recommendations in the 182page report 
congress should create the office of assistant transportation 
secretary for security and intelligence 
the federal government should directly manage security at 
domestic airports and conduct a study to assess the safety of us 
airports from terrorists 
the state department rather than airlines should conduct 
negotiations with foreign governments to meet security standards at 
airports used by us carriers 
victims of terrorist attacks aimed against the united states 
government should qualify for special financial compensation 
the state department should take steps to ensure that family 
members of victims are given prompt humane and courteous 
treatment and services in overseas disasters 
rep john paul hammerschmidt rark a commission member said 
a lot of improvements have already been made in airport safety 
just because the pan am 103 incident was so dismaying and 
shocking 
but he added we were a little dismayed in the way faa had 
handled security back then let me emphasize that isnt true right 
now i think just because of whats happened since pan am 103 
sen alfonse damato rny also on the commission said 
despite recent improvements there is still a great 
vulnerability to terrorism in the aviation industry 
terrorism is a new kind of warfare that were going to 
have to be prepared to deal with damato said 
the commission held five public hearings in washington and 
traveled to europe for interviews with aviation and airline 
officials in france west germany and britain flight 103 
originated in frankfurt and switched to a different airliner in 
london before leaving for new york

the bush administration said today it is 
considering a shortterm loan to nicaragua following an urgent plea 
from president violeta chamorro who declared my country is 
bankrupt 
mrs chamorro in a letter to bush asked for a 40 million 
shortterm loan because congress has not yet acted on a 300 
million aid package that bush is seeking for nicaragua 
we are looking into possibilities of doing something along the 
lines of what she requests white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said 
if we cant get something fairly quickly we are taking a look 
to see if there are some kind of loans or something that can help 
her out in the short term he said 
house speaker thomas foley says he wants to bring the aid 
package to a floor vote this week 
mrs chamorro said the loan money was needed to avoid a 
critical situation that may be looming in the very near future a 
copy of the cable was obtained today 
her request came as food supplies for thousands of nicaraguan 
rebels based at demobilization camps are expected to be exhausted 
by the end of the week us officials are concerned that the peace 
process in that country may unravel 
the bush administration has been sharply critical of congress 
for its delay on the aid package which also includes another 420 
million for panama 
my country is bankrupt mrs chamorro told bush she said 
that the sandinista party of former president daniel ortega is 
taking advantage of the situation to create instability 
today we face a general strike of the public sector but we 
are determined to struggle on she told bush in the cable dated 
may 11 
she said that nicaraguas reserves are insufficient to fulfill 
our obligations coming due in the next 30 days she also cited a 
70 percent per month inflation rate 
the state department considers the food issue to be crucial 
because once food deliveries to the camps end the contra rebels 
will be forced to look elsewhere for their needs raising the 
possibility of armed encounters with sandinista soldiers 
at present the rebels are stationed in security zones which 
are off limits to the sandinista army the zones were established 
as part of an agreement reached among the contending nicaraguan 
factions after the election of usbacked president violeta 
chamorro in february 
the us role in the process is to ensure a continuing supply of 
food to the camps as well as additional assistance to enable the 
contras to disarm and return to their homes 
but congress has yet to approve an aid package that includes 30 
million for these purposes officials of the organization of 
american states officials who are overseeing the process told the 
bush administration on monday that only five days supply of food 
remains said us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush telephoned foley dwash on monday to relay his concern 
over the situation after receiving a message from mrs chamorro in 
which she outlined what she described as a deteriorating situation 
the officials said 
food must be ordered immediately to prevent a gap in food 
supplies state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
if the nicaraguan resistance must provide their own food its 
members might have to leave the security zones risking fighting 
with the sandinista army this could mean the unraveling of the 
demobilization process 
the aid bill before congress has become bogged down by scores of 
amendments including one relating to federal funding for abortions 
in washington dc 
the economic aid package contains the necessary funds to 
feed the nicaraguan resistance it is urgent that congress pass 
this package quickly if the achievements of the bipartisan accord 
and the nicaraguan election are to be preserved ms tutwiler 
said

battle between gen michel aouns troops and samir geageas 
lebanese forces raged without letup for a seventh straight day 
leaving 18 dead and 46 wounded police said 
the clashes brought the casualty toll to 1022 dead and 2730 
wounded since the battle for control of the 310squaremile 
christian enclave broke out jan 30 
police said six people were killed and 15 wounded in gunbattles 
between the proiranian shiite moslem hezbollah or party of god 
and the syrianbacked amal militia in and around west beiruts old 
jewish district of wadi abu jamil 
police said bearded hezbollah fighters attempting to expel amal 
militiamen from wadi abu jamil tossed grenades and fired 106mm 
recoilless guns mounted on jeeps amal gunmen thwarted the attacks 
the hostilities which began at midnight stopped at midmorning 
when syrian troops deployed in wadi abu jamil separated the 
combatants 
the area was abandoned long ago by its original jewish 
inhabitants 
shopowners removed glass shards and shattered shutters from 
narrow alleyways under the watchful eyes of helmeted syrian troops 
toting automatic rifles and shoulderfired rocket launchers dozens 
of wrecked cars smoldered amid heaps of blackened fruits and 
vegetables 
go ahead and take pictures cried a veiled woman as 
photographers reached the scene show the world how brutal our

they simply opted to disobey the patriarch not the 
commanders said a police spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing rules it seems they cant stop fighting

psychiatrists and psychologists who viewed old 
home movies usually were able to identify children who would be 
diagnosed with schizophreia as adults a researcher says 
the study supports the view that the disease follows an early 
brain abnormality said psychology professor elaine walker of emory 
university in atlanta 
there may be early subtle signs of vulnerability to 
schizophrenia walker said monday 
the project involved home movies that portrayed five infants and 
children up to age 5 who were later diagnosed with schizophrenia as 
young adults thirteen psychologists and psychiatrists were shown 
the films which also included at least one sibling 
the mental health professionals were asked to guess which one 
later was diagnosed as schizophrenic 
their performance was much better than one would expect by 
chance which suggests they were able to spot clues walker said 
the observers said the signs included delayed development of 
motor skills awkwardness and unexpected emotional responses shown 
in the face 
now researchers plan to analyze the movies with objective 
measures of motor development and facial expression to see if those 
factors tend to identify preschizophrenic children walker said 
walker presented her results at the annual meeting of the 
american psychiatric association the study has been accepted for 
publication in a scientific journal she said 
the clues the raters spotted were amazingly predictive dr 
stephen oxley of duke university in durham nc said after 
walkers presentation 
while the results are very preliminary they suggest there may 
be ways to spot children at risk for developing the disease he 
said 
other research also has pointed to possible early brain 
disturbances in schizophrenia he said 
if children at risk can be spotted early perhaps steps can be 
taken to prevent the disease he said further research also might 
give clues about what part of the brain is involved which might 
guide research into treatment he said 
schizophrenia is marked by a loss of touch with reality called 
psychosis and hallucinations delusions disordered thinking and 
inappropriate emotions

the navy has grounded its fleet of h46 sea 
knight helicopters to correct a problem in the rear transmission of 
the twinrotor chopper the pentagon said tuesday 
the decision to ground the fleet was made after an investigation 
of a h46 accident earlier this month said spokesman pete williams 
seventeen marines were injured at the marine airground training 
center at twentynine palms calif when their chopper made a 
rough landing during an airassault exercise 
williams said the navy had found a problem that could lead to a 
loss of drive in the rear rotor system 
the navy is trying to devise ways for the choppers to be 
repaired in field units rather than returning them to maintenance 
depots williams said 
there are 342 choppers in the fleet with 261 assigned to the 
marine corps and 81 to the navy 
sea knight choppers have a crew of three and have been used 
since the vietnam war the 84foot long helicopters built by boeing 
vertol and have been out of production since 1971 
there are various versions of the aircraft the uh46 and ch46 
are used by the navy while the marines use the ch46 version the 
hh46 is used by both services as a search and rescue aircraft

south african president fw de klerk will pay 
a historic visit to the white house in june officials said tuesday 
black leaders called the de klerk invitation a slap on the 
face to nelson mandela who will call on president bush a week 
later 
us officials said de klerk will visit the white house on june 
18 the first official visit by a south african president in more 
than 30 years but white house and state department spokesmen 
declined to confirm the dates 
bush invited the two men as soon as de klerk freed mandela 
leader of the african national congress last february after 27 
years in prison the invitations were designed to boost a process 
begun in talks earlier this month between de klerk and mandela to 
grant political rights to south africas disenfranchised black 
majority 
us officials said the decision to have de klerks visit before 
mandelas was dictated by the two mens schedules and not a 
preference for either leader 
but the anc which represents many of south africas 28 million 
blacks said the administrations decision to invite de klerk for a 
visit especially prior to mandelas was an insult 
it is a slap on the face said mendi msimang the anc 
representative to britain who participated in a news conference 
announcing details of the mandela visit it is not too late for 
the administration to take corrective measures the anc said it 
had not been formally apprised by the administration of the de 
klerk visit 
anc officials said that despite mandelas release from jail and 
the legalization of their organization blacks are still jailed and 
denied basic political rights by de klerks white government 
they noted that de klerk who took office last year still 
opposes giving an equal vote to all blacks and wants to maintain 
veto powers by the countrys 5 million whites 
a coalition of antiapartheid threatened to organize protests 
around the united states unless the de klerk visit is cancelled 
the anc announced mandela would arrive on june 20 in new york 
city where he will be recognized with a ticker tape parade and 
possibly address the united nations general assembly he will 
travel to washington on june 24 for two days at the invitation of 
labor groups predominantly black colleges and civic leaders he 
probably also will stop in boston atlanta miami detroit and los 
angeles 
mandela will thank those groups for their support during his 
incarceration and for the pressure they exerted on congress and the 
business community to impose economic sanctions against the south 
african government since 1986 
but mandela will also appeal to americans to maintain the 
sanctions and intensify the sanctions said tebogo mafole the 
anc representative at the united nations 
he urged those who would reward de klerk for his recent gestures 
to keep in mind that they were brought about through pressure 
yes there have been some steps however they fall far 
short of political equality for blacks he said 
mandela is also expected to ask americans for money to help the 
anc bring its members back from their enforced exile and to build 
up the organization in south africa now that it is legal again 
mandela has asked the international community for 20 million

the typical firsttime home buyer had just 73 
percent of the income needed to purchase a typical starter home in 
the first quarter of 1990 the national association of realtors 
said tuesday 
increasing home prices tappedout savings accounts and 
mortgage rates above the 10 percent mark put the squeeze on housing 
affordability for firsttime buyers the realtors said 
their firsttime home buyer affordability index for the first 
quarter was down from 743 in the last three months of 1989 the 
index was 752 after the first three months of last year 
the realtors composite index which measures housing 
affordability of all buyers stood at 1044 in the januarymarch 
period that was down from 1057 in the fourth quarter and 1065 in 
the third 
the median income of prime firsttime home buyers renter 
families with wage earners aged between 25 and 44 was 23123 
during the first quarter that was 8532 less than the 31655 
needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 90 percent of 
a medianpriced starter home costing 81500 the realtors said 
the median means half of the buyers had greater incomes and half 
less or that half of the homes cost more and half less 
a 10 percent down payment on a 81500 home would amount to 
8150 leaving the typical firsttime buyer during the first 
quarter with monthly mortgage payments of 659 the realtors said 
despite the gap between income and the amount needed to buy a 
starter home firsttime buyers are finding ways to shift from 
renting to owning according to realtors chief economist john a 
tuccillo 
condominiums alternative mortgage instruments help from 
parents with deep pockets and even leaseoptions and equitysharing 
arrangements are among the methods entrylevel buyers are employing 
to make that first home purchase tuccillo said

here in brief are the main points of 
disagreement in arms control negotiations as secretary of state 
james a baker iii begins four days of presummit talks in moscow 
strategic arms reduction talks the two sides disagree on range 
limits for nuclear cruise missiles deployed on aircraft and naval 
forces also the americans are resisting a soviet demand for a 
legally binding limit on future deployments of sealaunched cruise 
missiles other points of dispute include limits on mobile 
landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles and anticheating 
measures 
chemical weapons the soviets are resisting a us plan to 
retain about 500 tons of poison gas or about 2 percent of its 
stockpile after signing a global ban on the weapons as a 
precursor to such a ban the superpowers are negotiating a 
bilateral deal to rapidly reduce their stockpiles to 5000 tons 
but the two sides have disagreed over a timetable for carrying out 
the weapons destruction 
conventional forces in europe the two main obstacles are 
defining limits on aircraft and personnel work also remains on 
four other weapon categories tanks armored combat vehicles 
artillery and helicopters anticheating provisions are in an early 
stage of discussion and the virtual dissolution of the warsaw pact 
has opened new debate about how the treaty would be applied to 
individual nations 
open skies these natowarsaw pact negotiations to allow 
unarmed aircraft of each alliance to fly over the territory of the 
other are snagged on quotas for such flights and what types of 
sensors would be allowed on the aircraft the purpose of the 
flights would be to reduce suspicions about threatening troop 
movements 
nuclear testing talks highly technical and relatively minor 
disagreements remain and settlement is expected in time for 
signing at the ussoviet summit that begins may 30 the aim is to 
set verification measures for two existing but unratified treaties 
that set limits on the yield of nuclear tests

a major review of navy programs will likely 
have no effect on the defense departments planned purchase of an 
attack submarine and guidedmissile destroyer in 1991 a top 
pentagon official said tuesday 
gerald cann an assistant secretary of the navy told a senate 
panel that he doubts the pentagon will propose a cut in the number 
of seawolf ssn21 submarines or arleigh burke ddg51 destroyers 
after the review is completed 
president bushs 303 billion military budget for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 calls for 36 billion for five destroyers 
and other expenses and 35 billion for two submarines and 
additional costs 
no i dont see any changes in 1991 at all cann said during 
an appearance before the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
defense 
following a major review of aircraft programs earlier this year 
defense secretary dick cheney proposed reducing the pentagons 
planned purchase of b2 stealth bombers c17 transport planes and 
other sophisticated aircraft 
cheneys action came in response to the lessening soviet threat 
and increasing congressional sentiment for a reduction in defense 
spending 
but cann an assistant secretary for research development and 
acquistion said he does not expect the naval review scheduled to 
be completed this summer to produce the same results as the 
aircraft review 
im personally confident that when were through with this 
that both the ssn21 and the ddg51 will be validated as proper 
ships to be built cann told the panel 
the assistant secretary also assured the panel that he is 
confident the seawolf will work although half of the funds for the 
nearly 35 billion program will be appropriated before operational 
tests have been completed 
i have relatively high expectations that once we put the 
seawolf together it will do very well cann said 
vice adm dl cooper the assistant chief of naval operations 
for undersea warfare said a study by the cia and defense 
intelligence agency concluded that the submarine in the fleet in 
1995 will be superior to the best threat it might face in the year 
2005

conspired with others to get it during a fiveyear period 
i feel fantastic today i got a great defense team barry 
said outside the courthouse after entering his plea 
us attorney jay b stephens and barry lawyer r kenneth mundy 
said they hoped to begin the trial june 4 but mundy said the new 
charges part of a superceding 14count indictment returned 
against barry last thursday might make it difficult to meet the 
original start date 
we will not be deterred mundy said after the fiveminute 
hearing we want to show the public and the court that we will 
not drag our feet it will not be the defense that stalls 
stephens said the government was prepared to go to trial as 
scheduled 
it is important for the case to be resolved expeditiously and 
fairly he said at a brief news conference

cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy the

barry earlier pleaded innocent to eight charges brought feb 15 
alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and had cocaine in 
his possession on five occasions the new indictment includes all 
14 charges the three perjury charges are felonies 
the new charges add to barrys legal problems in the face of the 
sept 4 mayoral primary barry has not announced that he will seek 
a fourth term but he has been making a series of campaignstyle 
appearances around the city 
one of the drugpossession counts stems from barrys arrest jan 
18 in an fbi undercover sting operation prosecutors say that barry 
was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel 
mundy complained at tuesdays hearing that the governments 
refusal to turn over a list of witnesses might hamper his trial 
preparation

witnesses who will testify against a defendant said assistant us 
attorney richard roberts

produced for the defense he did not elaborate

outside the courthouse barry urged reporters not to question 
him about his legal difficulties

inside rebelheld liberia ap government troops massacred at 
least 32 people before fleeing advancing rebel troops according to 
survivors who showed reporters a pile of 15 bodies 
the survivors said monday that soldiers of president samuel doe 
rounded up people in six villages and shot many before fleeing the 
rebels april 9 
at that time the soldiers were about 30 miles north of the 
strategic port of buchanan about 60 miles southeast of monrovia 
the capital 
the 15 bodies displayed monday deep inside rebel territory were 
in a freshly dug grave that had not been filled in because 
villagers fled to avoid the fighting the survivors said they were 
interviewed in a hospital on the liberian agriculture corp rubber 
plantation an americanowned operation 
the survivors said dozens of people were wounded by the 
government troops they said they knew of 32 killed and it was 
likely there were additional dead that had been dumped in the bush 
does forces have been accused of slaughtering civilians in an 
effort to defeat rebels of former civil servant charles taylor 
whose men invaded liberia from neighboring ivory coast on dec 24 
international organizations say does troops have killed hundreds 
of civilians and the us congress passed a resolution condemning 
the president 
no comment was immediately available on the survivors 
statements 
doe has denied his men have committed atrocities he said the 
rebels often do not wear uniforms making it difficult for soldiers 
to identify them 
international groups say the rebels have killed members of does 
ethnic krahn group in apparent reprisals for attacks on members of 
their ethnic groups 
doe seized power in a bloody coup on april 12 1980 
he initially threatened to kill all the insurgents but later 
offered them the opportunity to surrender 
the us government has called on him to negotiate an end to the 
fighting the liberian president has said he is willing to talk 
but not with taylor himself 
meanwhile an independent newspaper carried a report tuesday 
quoting the british broadcasting corp as saying rebels had taken 
the mining center of yekepa in nimba county in the east 
the government had no comment on the report and took no 
immediate action against the standard newspaper doe has said that 
journalists who make any false claims about the rebels will 
themselves be treated as rebels 
workers at the yekepa iron ore mine interviewed by the bbc 
said government forces fled into neighboring guinea when the rebels 
attacked the mine workers who also went to guinea said the 
soldiers crossed the border which is adjacent to the mine when 
they ran out of bullets 
the port of buchanan is the outlet for iron for the mine and it 
also is near the countrys major airport at robertsfield 
before the government took over the iron ore mine last year from 
a private company it had provided 70 percent of the countrys 
foreign exchange earnings no recent figures are available 
since invading the rebels have pushed out of nimba county to 
the south into river cess county to the southwest into grand bassa 
county and to the west into central bong 
nimba county the secondlargest in population in the west 
african nation produced more than 20 percent of the countrys 
food but more than 80 percent of its 350000 people have fled to 
ivory coast guinea and other parts of liberia which was founded 
by freed american slaves in 1847 
the rebels largely control nimba county home to the gio and 
mano tribes that are their ethnic base

the agriculture department said tuesday it 
wants public comment about designing new food safety regulations 
for some refrigerated meat and poultry products 
products that would be covered by the regulations include 
readytoeat uncured perishable meat and poultry packaged in a 
variety of sealed containers the labels indicate the food is 
perishable or carry instructions to keep refrigerated

in refrigerated cases in delicatessens and grocery stores frozen 
foods or those that consist entirely of cured meat or poultry are 
not included 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said consumer demand for fresh 
convenience foods has greatly increased the variety of these 
products on the market

handled they may pose unique health risks to consumers he said 
we are asking for public comments information scientific data 
and recommendations to help determine what additional regulations 
are necessary to ensure the safety of these products

receive the thermal heat processing used to kill all bacteria in 
traditional canned goods

thousands of striking workers 
paralyzed the government today and vice president virgilio godoy 
said the opposition sandinistas were trying to overthrow 
president chamorro 
it was the most serious threat to the 19dayold government of 
president violeta barrios de chamorro who defeated the leftist 
sandinistas at the polls feb 25 
riot police fired tear gas into the foreign ministry building to 
disperse workers who occupied the building but state employees 
retook the premises immediately and pushed out the police strikers 
ignored threats of massive firings from the government 
it was just one of several government buildings occupied by 
strikers mrs chamorros whereabouts were not immedidately known 
at most buildings police merely stood outside there was no sign 
of any army presence 
telephone telegraph and telex communications went dead cutting 
off nicaragua from the rest of the world workers threatened to cut 
off electricity to the city in the afternoon to be followed by the 
water supply both electrical and water ministries were occupied by 
strikers 
an angry mob rushed foreign minister enrique dreyfus and a group 
of nicaraguan ambassadors who were standing in the porch of a 
restaurant across the ministry parking lot police protected them 
from the mob 
the strike was for higher pay but it became increasingly clear 
the stoppages were a political confrontation between the government 
and the sandinistas in addition to their economic demands the 
strikers issued a new demand that the usbacked contra rebels 
immediately demobilize 
tires were set ablaze in front of about six government 
buildings while loudspeakers at the gate blared sandinista 
revolutionary slogans against mrs chamorro and her government 
violetta start packing your bags the people own the 
government not the beaugois and not one step back were 
some of the slogans chanted by strikers at government buildings 
public school teachers and communication workers joined the 
striking public employees pressing for a 200 wake hike to 
compensate for skyrocketing inflation now estimated at 70 percent 
a month 
the government employees a majority of them sandinistas put 
there by the previous leftist government were also demanding 
restoration of a public service law that provided them with job 
security 
a commentator on radio sandino the sandinista party 
broadcasting station demanded that mrs chamorro who took office 
april 25 for a sixyear term step down she should pack her bags 
and leave the country the radio said 
vice president virgilio godoy accused the sandinistas of trying 
to overthrow mrs chamorros government by encouraging a general 
strike 
the strike broke out last wednesday when mrs chamorro devalued 
the currency for the fourth time since taking office and ordered a 
60 percent pay raise for government employees the government 
workers rejected the raise saying it was too little 
the government declared the strike illegal monday and threatened 
to fire those who failed to return to work by today presidential 
spokesman danilo lacayo said about 10000 public workers out of 
150000 nationwide were on strike 
mrs chamorro appealed to president bush for 40 million in 
emergency aid 
my country is bankrupt mrs chamorro said in a cable to 
bush she said the sandinista party of former president daniel 
ortega is taking advantage of the situation to create 
instability 
mrs chamorro said the emergency funds are needed to tide her 
country over until congress enacts a 300 million aid package 
requested by the administration 
she said the money was needed to avoid a critical situation 
that may be looming in the very near future a copy of the cable 
was obtained today 
today we face a general strike of the public sector but we 
are determined to struggle on she told bush in the cable dated 
may 11 
we are looking into possibilities of doing something along the 
lines of what she requests white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said today if we cant get something fairly quickly 
we are taking a look to see if there are some kind of loans or 
something that can help her out in the short term 
the bush administration also said it would respond to an appeal 
by mrs chamorro who described a deteriorating situation in food 
supplies for thousands of nicaraguan contra rebels based at 
demobilization camps 
sandinista labor union leaders said they are ready to paralyze 
the country with strikes if government does not back off its threat 
to dismiss strikers 
they said they would shut down telephone service public 
transportation schools and banks today 
attempts to contact managua today from new york and mexico city 
were unsuccessful 
there will be an escalation of the strikes and we hope we 
dont have to paralyze the country because we have the capacity to 
do it lucio jimenez of the sandinista workers central told 
reporters monday 
jimenez said a lawyer was petitioning the supreme court asking 
that the labor ministry decree declaring the strikes illegal be 
revoked 
workers are demanding either a 200 percent raise or a minimum 
monthly salary equivalent to 150 they also are demanding that a 
law guaranteeing their rights be reinstated and that the 
government guarantee that there will be no retaliation against the 
strikers 
the average wage in nicaragua is the equivalent of about 30 per 
month 
unemployed nicaraguans said they would be glad to take the jobs 
of the striking public workers with nicaraguas high unemployment 
it is unlikely the strikers could shut down the system for long 
estimates of the unemployment rate run as high as 45 percent

a federal judge tuesday declared 
unconstitutional mandatory drug testing for attorneys applying for 
jobs in the justice departments antitrust division 
the ruling by us district court judge gerhard gesell came in 
the case of carl willner who filed suit after the justice 
department tentatively accepted him for employment and then asked 
him to submit to a urine test 
gesell said testing willner would infringe on the right of any 
citizen not to be searched without a reasonable basis of suspicion 
the antitrust division requirement offends the fourth 
amendment gesell said 
the case is the first major federal decision on applicant drug 
testing involving government agencies said arthur spitzer an 
attorney for the american civil liberties union who argued on 
behalf of willner 
a onetime mandatory preemployment drug test is required of all 
attorneys accepted for positions in the justice departments 
offices boards and divisions component which includes the 
antitrust division 
gesell pointed out that willner would not have access to top 
secret classified information and was not a prosecutor in drug 
cases the us court of appeals has upheld random testing for 
existing employees in the department in those sensitive positions 
but the appeals court has rejected the departments plan to 
require drug tests for all criminal prosecutors and all employees 
with access to grand jury materials 
the judge said in essence that applicants ought to be treated 
the same as existing employees 
in the willner case the justice department had argued that the 
expectation of privacy is less for an applicant than for an 
existing employee singled out for random testing 
the judge enjoined the department from requiring preemployment 
drug testing for antitrust division applicants if there are no 
grounds for suspicion 
just as a beautiful sand dune crumbles if continuously eroded 
by ocean waves said gesell so will this essential precious 
right become a victim if it is modified at times of stress 
the judge said applicants who would be exposed to top secret 
information could be tested 
gesell said willner lacks standing to challenge all 
preemployment drug testing for the entire department or for the 
entire offices boards and divisions component 
in court arguments april 24 justice department lawyer peter 
robbins pointed out that the applicant test is a onetime event 
you dont want somebody enforcing the law turning around and 
violating the law robbins said 
gesells decision would cut severely into the governments 
ability to conduct widespread applicant testing said spitzer 
spitzer said willner now in private practice in washington is 
scheduled to start his justice department job in july

primary republican hal daub of omaha a former congressman was 
expected to defeat otis glebe an omaha landlord for the gop 
nomination 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
recent newspaper polls indicated the democratic gubernatorial 
race appeared to be a dead heat 
boyle who was recalled during his second term as omaha mayor in 
1987 and who lost a comeback bid for that office in 1989 surprised 
many observers when his lowbudget campaign brought him into 
contention for the nomination 
nelson led the democratic hopefuls in spending using television 
ads to get his name and his message to voters an attorney and 
former state insurance director he was criticized for connections 
with companies connected to fallen junkbond king michael milken 
nelson dismissed such shots as neomccarthyism and said his 
activities had been aboveboard 
harris a former state senator said polls showed he was the 
democrat who could beat mrs orr in november 
hoppner supporters had hoped a lastminute endorsement from 
kerrey would help his cause 
each of the democratic frontrunners contended through the 
campaign that he could provide better leadership than mrs orr who 
has smarted from newspaper polls which indicate a flagging job 
performance rating

west germany on tuesday called for 
united german elections as early as december and the proposal drew 
angry responses from opposition politicians in both german nations 
markus meckel east germanys foreign minister and head of the 
east german social democrats said he feared early joint elections 
could result in east germans being dominated in an allgerman 
state 
the east berlin government announced that it plans to hold state 
elections dec 2 the same day as the west german national 
elections 
it was not clear whether the announcement from eberhard stief 
the no 2 official in the east german interior ministry was 
designed as an intermediary step on the way to plans for joint 
national elections in both countries 
west german chancellor helmut kohl met with his own coalition 
partners tuesday to look over a draft treaty that will seal the 
economic merger of the two germanys on july 2 
kohls coalition partners gave their approval to the treaty 
during the session but a few details remain to be worked out 
the planned economic merger wasnt the only topic at the 
closeddoor meeting 
hans klein kohls chief spokesman said all participants 
spoke out unanimously for the soonest possible date for 
allgerman elections 
he did not give a possible date 
but alfred dregger parliamentary leader of kohls christian 
democrats said he favors either replacing the dec 2 federal 
elections with allgerman balloting or holding the allgerman vote 
when the current legislative period ends jan 13 1991 
finance minister theo waigel said he believed an allgerman vote 
would be held this year 
after the meeting kohl said he had not discarded the idea of 
holding federal elections dec 2 but he again left open the 
possibility the german states could hold a joint federal election 
that day 
kohl said that question must be decided in the parliament of 
east germany 
the chancellor said allgerman elections could not occur until 
conclusion of the socalled twoplusfour unification talks 
involving the two german nations and four world war ii victors 
the soviet union the united states britain and france 
the six nations are trying to iron out the international 
complexities of unification such as the military attachments of a 
united germany kohl said he is confident those talks can be 
concluded this year 
kohl suffered a major setback earlier in the week after losing 
control of parliaments upper house to the opposition social 
democrats through two state election defeats 
earlier this month the chancellor had said he did not see 
allgerman elections occurring before the fall of 1991 
but now kohl possibly sensing he would have a better chance of 
winning allgerman elections than the federal vote dec 2 has left 
open the possibility of the joint elections before next year 
hansjochen vogel head of west germanys social democrats 
lambasted kohl for his new position accusing the chancellor of 
misusing the german unity process to try to further his 
political career 
vogels east german allies also warned kohl against being too 
hasty 
meckel said he was worried east germans could become dominated 
in an allgerman state if joint elections were this year 
klein the west german government spokesman said kohl and his 
coalition allies tuesday determined the economic merger will take 
effect on july 2 as planned 
klein said a few important details remain to be worked out 
but that kohl was confident that would occur during a meeting 
between the german finance ministers in bonn on thursday 
he said one of the problems was the lack of information about 
east germanys current economic situation the economic merger 
would involve a drastic overhaul of east germanys embattled 
economy in exchange for massive west german assistance 
under the draft economic treaty east germany would turn over 
all currency matters to west germanys central bank and bring its 
economic policies in line with those of its western neighbor

reports of 73yearold rose marie 
poseys demise were greatly exaggerated but the fight to regain 
her life goes on 
declared dead in march by a us treasury department computer 
mrs posey found that efforts to correct the error prompted more 
official buckpassing than resolution 
im so mad about this i just shake mrs posey said i 
know im not dead but i dont feel so good because of all this 
she learned of her death in april when she didnt receive 
her 87113 monthly pension check the mistake was supposed to have 
been fixed but it lingers in government computers 
on thursday mrs posey got a letter from medicare saying the 
national health insurer had denied a 25 payment for minor foot 
surgery done march 16 
the date of this service was reported to be after the date of 
death said the computergenerated letter addressed to her 
i just want to take a hammer to all these computers mrs 
posey said 
last week mrs posey complained to the railroad retirement 
board which pays her pension and to travelers medicare the 
insurer that handles the boards medicare payments 
but on monday the medicare computer still listed her as dead 
our computer shows her date of death as 123189 said 
debbie petersen a travelers medicare spokeswoman in salt lake 
city utah she blamed the railroad retirement board 
we just pay the claims railroad retirement handles the 
computer system she said we can just look at the screen from 
our end we cant change anything on it 
but bob lehrke the boards district manager in springfield 
blamed travelers medicare 
travelers should already have updated and corrected their 
records he said adding that he was unaware the insurer couldnt 
make computer changes 
once it leaves the railroad retirement board i dont know the 
process of what happens to it he said but our end is clean 
so obviously its something they should correct 
meanwhile mrs poseys mistaken death is taking its toll 
my nerves are just about ready to blow sky high she said

gov l douglas wilder who has been under 
fire for neglecting concerns by fellow blacks ordered state 
agencies tuesday to sell their nearly 1 billion holdings in 
companies tied to south africa 
wilder the nations first elected black governor said he 
wanted his executive order to be implemented as soon as possible 
although details have yet to be worked out 
the time for action is now and we can develop a policy he 
told reporters its not going to be that difficult its not 
going to be unworkable 
virginia is the 27th state to order divestment in companies that 
do business with south africa to protest its apartheid laws 
requiring racial separation 
wilder ordered no new investments in the companies and said 
state agencies and institutions should begin divesting from 
companies with substantive interests in the country 
since he announced the plan saturday during a commencement 
address at norfolk state university he has been praised by blacks 
but criticized by conservatives who had been pleased with his tight 
fiscal policies 
im very pleased hes taking this step i would hope and 
expect more progressive actions said charles e jones an old 
dominion university associate professor who had joined other black 
scholars in criticizing wilders new mainstream conservativism 
it could be a costly process depending on how they handle 
it said state sen hunter b andrews a conservative democrat 
who has frequently tangled with the democratic governor 
wilders order affects nearly 1 billion in state investments 
primarily by the state employees pension fund and several colleges 
and universities 
the governor said he would like to see divestiture completed 
before his term ends in january 1994 
he insisted that virginia would not face the same problems as 
other states such as new jersey which lost as much as a 500 
million by divesting 42 billion in south africanlinked holdings 
in three years 
ours will be prudent and i can say to you that i wouldnt 
necessarily mirror the example of new jersey with reference to how 
they went about handling that matter he said 
wilder said he set the south african policy because university 
board members had asked his administration what they should do 
about such investments 
he said its a valid question whether the state should 
divest from companies doing business in other countries that 
violate human rights such as south korea but that south africas 
system is more oppressive than other nations

us drug agent enrique camarena was tortured 
and murdered because his work had cost a mexican drug cartel more 
than 5 billion a prosecutor said tuesday in opening arguments in 
the trial of four men 
the defendants included the brotherinlaw of a former mexican 
president 
assistant us attorney john carlton said the defendants were 
involved either directly or indirectly with drug trafficking and 
participated in actions that led to the slaying of the us drug 
enforcement administration agent in mexico 
the motivation was drug smugglers anger at devastating raids on 
marijuana plantations carlton said 
the cartels anger and frustration became increasingly focused 
on one dea agent he said 
he said there were meetings in which there was talk of taking 
care of agent camarena 
from may of 1984 to february of 1985 the cartel suffered a 
series of devastating losses which it blamed on the dea carlton 
said the seizures cost the cartel over 5 billion and the 
cartel began a series of retaliatory actions 
on trial are ruben zuno arce the brotherinlaw of former 
mexican president luis echeverria juan ramon matta ballesteros a 
convicted honduran drug kingpin juan jose bernabe ramirez a 
former mexican police officer and javier vasquez velasco who is 
accused of murdering two american tourists in an apparent mistake 
killing 
carlton said vasquez and other drug traffickers mistook albert 
radelat and john walker for dea agents when the two walked into a 
celebration dinner that drug lords were holding in a restaurant 
carlton said much of the prosecutions case would depend on the 
testimony of confidential informants as well as physical evidence 
including hairs found at the house where camarena was slain 
the mention of hair evidence led to a motion for mistrial by the 
attorney for matta 
attorney martin stolar has disputed that the hair found at the 
murder scene was mattas and has asked for further scientific 
examination before it is admitted in evidence 
he said the prosecutor should not have mentioned it but judge 
edward rafeedie denied the motion 
the 31yearold camarena was kidnapped off a street in 
guadalajara mexico in february 1985 testimony at the trial of 
three other men in 1988 showed that the agent was taken to a house 
where he was tortured and interrogated by drug lords before being 
slain along with his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles 
outside guadalajara 
the dea has promised to capture every person involved in the 
slaying so far 22 people have been charged in this country and 
more than 20 convicted in mexico 
among those arrested was a mexican doctor who allegedly 
monitored camarenas medical condition while he was interrogated 
and administered drugs to revive camarena so that the interrogation 
could continue 
the arrest last month of dr humberto alvarez machain enraged 
mexican officials who said he was unlawfully abducted from his 
guadalajara office on april 2 and turned over to us authorities 
in el paso texas the next day 
mexican authorities say a former policeman arrested in 
connection with alvarez machains abduction told them the dea was 
involved an allegation denied by dea officials

the bush administration said tuesday it was 
considering nicaraguas urgent request for a 40 million shortterm 
loan 
my country is bankrupt president violeta chamorro said in a 
friday cable to president bush 
nicaraguas reserves are insufficient to fulfill our 
obligations coming due in the next 30 days said mrs chamorro 
citing a 70 percent per month inflation rate a copy of the cable 
was obtained tuesday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
was looking into possibilities of doing something along the lines 
of what she requests as the push for passage of bushs entire 
300 million nicaraguan aid request continued 
if we cant get something fairly quickly from congress we 
are taking a look to see if there are some kind of loans or 
something that can help her out in the short term fitzwater said 
the comments came as thousands of striking workers in managua 
paralyzed mrs chamorros 19dayold government 
vice president virgilio godoy said the opposition sandinistas 
were trying to overthrow mrs chamorro who defeated president 
daniel ortega in the feb 25 election 
it is unfortunate that the sandinistas despite their promises 
to work with the chamorro government to achieve economic 
reconstruction and national reconciliation are engaging in what 
appear to be politically motivated strikes said state department 
spokesman richard boucher 
as arrangements for a treasury department loan were being 
considered there were indications from capitol hill that lawmakers 
were preparing to act on bushs original aid package but there was 
no telling when funds would actually reach nicaragua 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said he wanted a house vote 
thursday on an authorization bill that would provide 300 million 
for nicaragua and 420 million for panama 
however housesenate negotiators had to resolve their 
differences over the spending package which has been muddied with 
billions of dollars of tackon issues 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said tuesday that mrs 
chamorro has been treated unfairly 
we were telling her that if she was elected she could 
count on us dole said the final result is congress is still 
playing games and she doesnt have anything to show for it 
mrs chamorro told bush that she needed the loan to cover a dire 
economic crisis and to avoid a critical situation that may be 
looming in the very near future she accused the sandinistas of 
taking advantage of the situation to create instability 
the aid also is needed to feed 14000 contra rebels in temporary 
camps where they are disarming under the auspices of the 
organization of american states their supplies are expected to run 
out by the end of the week us officials said 
congress is playing with fire by holding up the aid package 
which includes 30 million for the rebel camps assistant secretary 
of state bernard aronson said tuesday 
he said he didnt know whether mrs chamorro would designate any 
money for contra camps if the 40 million loan was made 
the demobilization process is in grave danger because of the 
shortfall said another administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity hungry men with weapons arent exactly 
going to be lying down 
both the house and senate have approved 720 million in 
emergency aid for panama and nicaragua final approval has been 
delayed in conference committee where the bill is bogged down by 
scores of amendments including one relating to federal funding for 
abortions in washington dc 
the aid package also had been linked procedurally to a 
democratdriven proposal to use aid to el salvador as leverage to 
bring about a negotiated peace in that country 
dole said it was wrong to include el salvador and other addons 
in the panamanicaragua package

nearly twothirds of the nations toxic 
industrial waste is produced by 100 corporations and the chemical 
industry accounts for almost half a private group said tuesday 
washingtonbased citizen action criticized the chemical industry 
for not moving quickly enough to curb toxic releases the group 
said 42 percent of all such pollution comes from chemical plants 
and four of the top five polluters are chemical companies 
however a spokesman for the chemical manufacturers association 
said the organizations members already are committed to making 
signficant reductions in hazardous releases in the coming years 
because of public concern 
citizen action based its analysis on statistics released last 
month by the environmental protection agency the epa figures 
widely reported at the time showed that 46 billion pounds of 
hazardous chemicals were released by factories into the air water 
and ground in 1988 
citizen action said its examination of the data showed that 10 
companies released about 26 percent of the toxic chemicals into the 
environment seven of the 10 are members of the chemical 
manufacturers association 
robert m brandon vice president of citizen action chastised 
the chemical industry trade group for an advertising campaign as 
part of recent earth day observances that promised to 
continuously improve our performance in health safety and 
protecting the environment 
the public shouldnt be fooled said brandon arguing that 
the epa data shows that industry has not done enough to curb toxic 
emissions its time for polluters to take responsible action 
he said the chemical companies should make a commitment to cut 
toxic releases in half within five years 
spokesman jeffrey van said the 170 chemical manufacturers 
association member companies are committed to reducing toxic 
releases he said the volume of chemical industry releases was 
reduced 10 percent from 1987 to 1988 despite an 8 percent increase 
in productivity 
the public has spoken people say the numbers are too high and 
they want them down van said 
the spokesman said he could not provide an industrywide 
estimate on reduction goals but said some large companies are 
planning emission cuts substantially greater than 50 percent 
glynn a young manager of environmental and community relations 
for monsanto co in st louis said the firm plans a 90 percent 
reduction in air emissions of toxic chemicals within two years and 
a 70 percent reduction in all toxic releases by the end of 1995 
monsanto was the second largest polluter of toxic chemicals 
releasing 202 million pounds in 1988 the citizens group said du 
pont chemical released the largest volume 338 million pounds in 
1988 the group said 
du pont spokesman john mcallister said the company plans to cut 
air emissions of toxic chemicals by 60 percent by 1993 and all 
emissions by 35 percent this decade 
citizen action said other companies among the top 10 and the 
amount of emmissions they produced in 1988 are american cyanimid 
189 million pounds shell chemical co 173 million pounds bp 
chemicals 151 million pounds freeport mcmoran 150 million 
pounds amax 113 million pounds allied signal 100 million 
pounds asarco 98 million pounds and vulcan chemicals 93 million 
pounds

on the republican side auditor general barbara hafer who is 
prochoice had party leaders backing in her contest against an 
antiabortion challenger marguerite peg luksik 
incumbent democratic congressmen john murtha austin murphy and 
joseph kolter all of western pennsylvania were in contested 
primaries murtha was criticized for supporting congressional pay 
raises murphy for having a son outside his marriage and kolter 
for not doing enough for his districts economy

stephen f freind architect of the states antiabortion law 
passed in november against newcomer ellen fisher a businesswoman 
who supports abortion rights freind has represented a suburban 
philadelphia district in delaware county for 14 years

casey ignored berg and reminded voters of his efforts to bring 
jobs to pennsylvania and clean up its toxic waste sites trash and 
drinking water problems 
its not a case of writing him off casey said in a recent 
interview its simply a case of following our game plan which 
is the same no matter who is in or out of the race 
casey said abortion was important but not the only issue 
mezvinsky who still owes caseys campaign 50000 from an 
unsuccessful race for attorney general in 1988 bucked the governor 
to challenge singel 
our party should not have leadership thats out of step 
mezvinsky said of caseys and singels opposition to abortion a 
stand that runs counter to the national democratic partys 
position my candidacy is a bridge it allows democrats to have a 
home 
hafer a fastrising republican making her sixth run for office 
in 13 years looked beyond her opponent and aimed her attacks at 
casey she questioned his management of the states budget and 
prisons the budget is slipping towards red ink and the camp hill 
prison erupted in three days of riots in october 
pennsylvanias new law includes a ban on abortions after 24 
weeks of pregnancy except where the mother faces death or 
irreversible harm a 24hour waiting period spousal notice and 
requirements that doctors explain to the woman the likely age of 
the fetus and the risks of and alternatives to abortion

the agency for international development no 
longer encourages lessdeveloped nations to control population 
unless the countries already are committed to such programs 
according to a report released tuesday 
sen patrick leahy dvt said the report indicates that aid is 
not receiving the support it needs to meet the pressing demands 
for contraceptives in the third world 
leahy chairman of a senate subcommittee on foreign operations 
said exploding populations are putting unprecedented pressures on 
the earths environment and threatening to undo everything we are 
trying to achieve with our foreign aid 
the report prepared by the general accounting office a 
congressional watchdog agency said reducing population growth is 
not an aid goal 
that leahy said is contrary to laws passed by congress 
the change in aids policy came during the reagan 
administration when some conservatives objected to giving money to 
birthcontrol programs abroad 
china which received money from the un population fund was 
cited for practicing abusive techniques in enforcing its onechild 
rule 
in the 1980s aid continued with many of its population programs 
but no longer actively promoted smaller families and lower growth 
rates the report said

portauprince haiti ap sixteen of 42 haitians arrested 
after they were deported from the united states are being held 
pending investigation of who organized their trips and provided 
them with falsified documents a us embassy spokeswoman said 
tuesday 
susan clyde said the 16 entered the united states illegally by 
boat or with falsified papers and haitian authorities were 
questioning them about how they left haiti and the source of their 
doctored documents 
in a statement last week the us embassy said it deplored 
the fact that haitians were being swindled by organizers of trips 
doomed in advance 
ms clyde said 27 of the haitians held at the national 
penitentiary in portauprince were deported from the united states 
on may 7 and 15 others were deported on saturday 
one deportee in the first batch had been serving a fiveyear 
sentence in a florida jail 10 were stowaways and the remaining 16 
were boat people or arrested with falsified entry papers 
the deportees in the second batch were serving time in a texas 
prison 14 for drugrelated offenses one for homicide she said 
three of the drug offenders having already served their 
sentences were released maj leopold clerjeune chief of the 
antigang bureau told the associated press on tuesday 
the other cases had been referred to the courts for judicial 
decision and most would probably be released soon clerjeune said 
in miami haitian refugee center director the rev gerard 
jeanjuste deplored the arrests of the deported haitians 
i think its a mistake its a grave mistake of the ertha 
pascaltrouillot government arresting refugees on their return 
and we feel some kind of oppression coming from this regime he 
said 
at this present moment we are calling on the government to 
avoid that mistake and release the refugees who are not criminals 
he added most of them have stayed already a year in jail in 
detention here and its too much dont punish these people 
further 
many haitians try to flee their impoverished caribbean island in 
flimsy sailboats and sail for florida some of these crafts never 
make it on the high seas sinking in bad weather or are detained 
by us officials on arrival in florida or off haiti 
haiti one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere

nbc hoping the past of today will help its 
tomorrows said tuesday it is bringing back joe garagiola as a 
cohost in a shakeup to help pull the talk show out of a ratings 
slump 
also tuesday nbc hired faith daniels as today news anchor 
and dick ebersol the network executive behind a series of moves 
that preceded the slump said he was giving up his job as overseer 
of the program 
garagiola the shows host from 1969 to 1973 will work with 
bryant gumbel and deborah norville 
nbcs surprise announcement comes at a time the once toprated 
show has been sliding deeper into second place in ratings after the 
series of changes including the replacement of jane pauley by 
norville in janary 
since then today has trailed abcs good morning america 
in the ratings with the cbs morning news a consistent third 
garagolia a popular nbc sportscaster until he left the network 
in 1988 will start work in june as will daniels who has been on 
maternity leave since the march 25 birth of her second child 
daniels coanchor of earlymorning newscasts at cbs since 1985 
will anchor news segments on today and anchor the earlier nbc 
news at sunrise 
nbc correspondent katie couric also was assigned as the 
fulltime today correspondent in washington dc 
ebersol said he was giving up his job as the senior executive in 
charge of today hell continue as nbc sports president and as 
a senior nbc news vice president 
almost all the furor of recent months concerning today has 
revolved around my decisions of last fall and i believe i must 
take the primary responsibility for those decisions said ebersol 
the uproar began in september when norville displaced veteran 
correspondent john palmer a friend of pauley as the today 
news anchor and was moved to the shows desk to sit alongside 
pauley and gumbel 
pauley who has refused to blame norville for anything 
reportedly was angered by the moves and finally asked to leave the 
show 
an embarrassed nbc granted her wish she left in december after 
13 years to do primetime news specials this year and anchor the 
nbc nightly news when tom brokaw is on assignment or vacation 
tuesdays today shuffle came five days after nbc news 
president michael gartner also concerned about low ratings for 
nbc nightly news made another surprise move hiring steve 
friedman as that programs executive producer 
the brash wisecracking friedman was executive producer of 
today when it rose to first in ratings 
the today and nightly changes were made three weeks 
before nbc affiliates hold their annual convention in washington 
a network executive speaking on condition of anonymity said its 
likely that many affiliate executives while pleased with nbcs 
primetime success will sharply criticize gartner for the ratings 
woes of the two news shows 
there was no reply by gartner to a reporters request for a 
phone interview in a statement tuesday he admitted that it is 
no secret that in recent months today has been through some 
troubled times 
the departure of jane pauley left people with a loss of the 
sense of family which has been valued throughout the years on 
today these additions are designed to expand the cast and build 
on the strengths of the program 
he also engaged in selfcriticism in referring to the way 
pauleys exit and norvilles entrance were handled 
in hindsight he said nbc news management put 
norville in a difficult position resulting in a more arduous 
transition than we had anticipated

hardline communist borisav jovic of 
serbia took over tuesday as head of yugoslavias collective 
presidency and denounced democratic reforms in two of the nations 
republics 
the nation is wrapped in political and ethnic tensions and 
jovic said in his inaugural speech that the crisis had brought 
yugoslavia to the brink of civil war and its breakup 
he appeared to make conflicting statements about the emerging 
westernstyle democracies in croatia and slovenia criticizing 
efforts to abandon socialism but also supporting laws for secession 
jovic took over as leader of the eightmember presidency from 
janez drnovsek a slovene 
each of the countrys six republics and two provinces has a 
representative on the presidency who holds the top post for one 
year on a rotating basis 
yugoslavias founder josip broz tito designed the system in 
what was seen as an attempt to guard against a power struggle in 
this ethnically mixed country after his death 
the presidency is formally yugoslavias highest governing body 
and is in charge of the armed forces 
yugoslavias communist party continues to rule in principle on 
the federal level but it has been crippled since january when 
slovenian and croatian members walked out of a national meeting 
accusing the serbians of seeking domination 
slovenia and croatia later held the first free elections in 
yugoslavia in 50 years centerright parties won to the 
displeasure of the serbian communists who still advocate their 
partys monopoly of power 
it is evident that there are forces which under the cloak of 
democratic changes are trying to achieve their strategic goal of 
abandoning the socialist orientation of our country even at the 
price of its breakup jovic said in his inaugural address we 
will resolutely oppose this 
however he added that he would work for laws that would permit 
peaceful secession of individual states 
jovic 62 is considered an ally of serbias communist 
president slobodan milosevic who also opposes multiparty 
democracy in yugoslavia 
both support yugoslavias federal system with strong central 
authority but that system has been seriously weakened since the 
free elections in slovenia and croatia 
those republics are demanding that yugoslavia transform itself 
into a loose confederation 
the political conflict is intensifying the deep ethnic rivalries 
that have existed since the country was united in 1918 
the most serious ethnic conflict is in kosovo a province that 
is part of serbia ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of the 
provinces population and the region enjoyed broad autonomy until 
changes last year that gave serbia control of the police judiciary 
and education 
serbian authorities say the changes were necessary to protec the 
provinces serbian minority from harassment 
delo the leading slovenian daily said in a commentary that 
jovic as president will strengthen the positions of the orthodox 
line in yugoslav politics 
in view of the fact that the presidency controls the armed 
forces this development could dangerously worsen tensions 
delo said 
jovic had served as vice president for the past year stipe 
suvar croatias representative in the presidency took over that 
post and formally is next in line for leadership 
however the croatian democratic union won the republics recent 
elections and its leader franjo tudjman said in an interview that 
the new government may recall suva a communist

israels parliament began debate tuesday on 
bills calling for direct election of the prime minister part of 
electoral reforms demanded during widespread protests 
getting the issue to the floor of the knesset or parliament 
was seen as a major step for the reformers 
supporters said passage would set the stage for more sweeping 
electoral reform to would limit political horsetrading 
four separate bills on direct election of the premier were 
submitted for the first of three readings needed for the measure 
to become law 
under the current system voters chose from a selection of 
national party lists the head of the party with the most seats has 
by tradition become prime minister if he can form a coalition 
government 
under all proposals submitted tuesday the prime minister would 
be elected separately from the rest of the candidates for 
parliament a premier would no longer be as dependent on the 
support of small parties to stay in office 
the proposals varied as to the length of the premiers term of 
office and the number of votes in parliament needed to remove him 
from office the idea of directly electing the premier had broad 
support 
a movement for electoral reform began with a small group of 
hunger strikes shortly after the coalition government made up of 
the rightwing likud bloc and leftleaning labor party collapsed 
march 15 
in attempts to form a new government likud and labor tried to 
lure defectors from each others camps and from small religious 
parties with offers of political posts and money 
tens of thousands of people joined demonstrations and 500000 
signatures about 10 percent of israels 47 million citizens 
were gathered in support of electoral reform 
if the bills pass uriel lynn a likud legislator and head of 
the parliaments law committee said his committee would need a 
month to prepare them for the second and third readings he said 
the political situation would determine when they came up for 
debate 
i think part of the public will realize and be convinced that 
a solution for reforming the government lies in the knesset he 
said 
in a rare move state comptroller miriam ben porat announced she 
had begun a special investigation into government funding of 
religious bodies 
this came as sections of the annual state comptrollers report 
were made public 
the report said government funds were given to educational 
organizations affiliated with the ultraorthodox shas party that 
were simply used as a pipeline to party coffers 
it cannot be that those who hold the keys to the public 
coffers use it as their own private cash register the jerusalem 
post newspaper quoted ms porat as saying

the pentagon unveiled drawings tuesday of two 
prototypes of the advanced tactical fighter a futuristic aircraft 
designed to replace the f15 fighter jet 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said the air force decided to 
release the drawings along with some information about the 635 
billion classified program because the two industry teams 
competing for the contract are about to perform airengine 
tests 
the atf is the air superiority fighter of the future 
williams said 
the aircraft he said will use stealth technology to evade 
radar and cruise at supersonic speeds without using afterburners a 
capability known as supercruise 
the combat aircraft will have a speed of mach 15 which would 
double the cruising speed of most presentday fighters 
both prototype airframes are scheduled for flight tests later 
this year and the winning contractor is expected to be chosen in 
july 1991 williams said 
the drawings show two versions of a sharpnosed singleseat 
twinengine aircraft with sharply angled vertical tails 
the aircraft developed by the northrop and mcdonnell douglas 
team has smoothed contours reminiscent of the b2 stealth bomber 
while the lockheed boeing and general dynamics version has a more 
angled design 
no drawings were released for the navy version of the atf 
citing changing world conditions and the nations severe budget 
crunch defense secretary dick cheney announced that he intended to 
delay the purchases of the atf two years until 1996 as a 
costsaving measure 
the air force has said it wants to buy 750 of the jets but 
williams said a purchase of something less than 750 was 
possible 
no one knows today how many planes we would build he said 
to date williams said 28 billion has been spent on the 
program 
although the cost in 1985 was put at 538 billion current 
estimates put it at 635 billion williams said those figures 
include research and development testing and procurement costs for 
750 planes he said 
that translates to a perplane cost of 847 million 
air force leaders believe they need the atf so future 
battlefield commanders can count on the umbrella of friendly air 
superiority and the protection of their forces from devastation by 
enemy air attacks the air force said in a statement 
it will use a firstlook firstkill capability to detect and 
destroy enemy fighters of today and tomorrow the air force 
said 
williams offered no dimensions for the aircraft saying they 
were classified 
the aircraft he said will carry a full complement of medium 
and shortrange arms including the aim120 advanced medium range 
airtoair missile and aim9 sidewinder

a court tuesday fined the irish family 
planning association 750 for selling a packet of condoms in a 
dublin record store 
under irish law condoms can be sold only in pharmacies family 
planning clinics and other health outlets 
a police officer testified in dublin district court that he saw 
a packet of condoms sold jan 8 at the family planning 
associations safe sex information counter in dublins virgin 
megastore 
the officer said he bought a packet for evidence 
district court president oliver macklin ordered the fine 
saying the law is the law the offense is not accidental and i 
take the breach seriously 
a similar prosecution against the record store eight months ago 
was thrown out on a technicality 
the irish family planning association which has been selling 
condoms at a booth in the store since february 1988 is considering 
an appeal 
the law barring such sales generally has been ignored but irish 
observers said there has been pressure from rightwing roman 
catholics opposed to artificial contraception to prosecute the 
store 
ireland is overwhelmingly catholic 
jon obrien the family planning associations spokesman said 
the organization was disappointed with the verdict he said 100 
customers a week buy condoms at the record shop booth 
the association said in a statement that the sales proved the 
demand for condoms was not being met as claimed by government 
officials 
richard branson a spokesman for the record store said the fine 
seems completely unreal in the year 1990 the decade that 
will see the biggest increase in aids 
recent figures show there are 140 known cases of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in the irish republic almost 1000 people have 
been diagnosed as carrying the hiv virus which causes aids

twenty years ago tuesday jackson state 
students and staff swept up broken glass counted bullet holes and 
tried to understand why police killed two people and wounded a 
dozen during a vietnam war protest 
since students and staff were between semesters the anniversary 
of the killings passed quietly on the campus where a dormitory wall 
remains pockmarked by gunfire 
on may 2 about 300 people attended a memorial rally and 
candlelight vigil the featured speaker author and poet margaret 
alexander walker chided students for not turning out in greater 
numbers 
school officials blamed the light turnout on the fact that 
classes werent dismissed that day but some students admitted they 
knew little about the barrage of gunfire aimed at a crowd outside 
the dorm 
they had it in the paper but a lot of students didnt know 
about it said tracie archie a 20yearold political science 
student there wasnt much talk about the shootings my mother 
told me about it 
cass parker an assistant chemistry professor and former jackson 
state student said there was no observance of the shootings 
tuesday partly because of student apathy but mainly because classes 
ended may 12 
the students interest here has changed tremendously said 
parker 36 a student from 19711975 there seems to be a 
resurgence in student interest but its not the same i guess 
its a little more subdued 
at about 1205 am on may 15 1970 police opened fire on 
students at thenjackson state college during a threeday protest 
of the vietnam war and civil rights issues 
killed were phillip gibbs a 21yearold prelaw major from 
ripley and the 17yearold james earl green a jackson high school 
student green had been walking through the college campus on his 
way home from work 
its a part of history that really i think was kept quiet 
parker said but there are students who will never forget what 
happened there are some students that will never let it be 
forgotten 
the protesting students were upset about the shooting deaths of 
four students less than two weeks earlier at kent state university 
in ohio during an antiwar protest students also were angry about 
racial epithets shouted from cars by white jackson residents 
driving through the mostly black jackson state campus 
the night gibbs and green were killed 22 policemen in riot gear 
advanced on the students outside alexander residence center some 
reports counted 75 to 100 students in front of the womens 
dormitory police said there were about 400 
the shooting began after police using a bullhorn ordered 
students to disperse police said they then heard a gunshot 
students said it was more likely a bottle dropped on pavement from 
a dorm window 
the ensuing barrage of rifle and shotgun fire lasted less than a 
minute but every window on the campusside of the fivestory 
building was shot out and the fbi counted 275 bullet holes 
at dawn faculty and staff were camped on the front lawn of the 
dormitory in protest 
family of the dead and injured sued the city of jackson and the 
state of mississippi but a federal appeals court ruled in 1974 
that damages could not be awarded because it was impossible to 
determine who was to blame 
however the court did say that the barrage of gunfire far 
exceeded the response that was appropriate 
today bullet holes are still visible in the walls a black 
stone memorial to gibbs and green occupies a spot where people 
camped that night 20 years ago

china canceled a 550 million contract with a 
major us defense contractor to update its f8 jet fighters 
because of concern over cost overruns and a us export ban us 
officials said tuesday 
under arrangements negotiated in 1986 the grumman corp was to 
equip the planes with a package of sophisticated electronics 
navigation and radar equipment 
richard boucher a state department spokesman confirmed the 
cancellation saying the chinese government has decided not to 
proceed beyond the development phase at this time 
boucher declined to speculate on the reasons for the decision or 
the impact it will have on grummans work force he said the 
development phase of the project will be completed this fall 
defense department spokesman pete williams also confirmed the 
cancellation and said i cant tell you why it was a chinese 
decision 
but a us official who commented on the condition he not be 
identified said chinese officials were concerned about steeply 
rising costs 
the us official said this concern was apparently coupled with 
uncertainty over when the chinese air force could take delivery of 
the equipment 
the bush administration suspended military sales and deliveries 
to china a year ago in the aftermath of the crushing of the 
prodemocracy movement in beijing 
we have not made any deliveries and we will not make any until 
circumstances change boucher said 
williams said that two chinese f8s are in the united states for 
the project and will remain here until the suspension is lifted 
williams said the pentagon was notified of the decision last 
month 
the chinese embassy declined comment 
dubbed peace pearl the agreement ranked among the largest 
military arrangements between china and the united states in the 
1980s and was hailed as a basis for strategic cooperation against 
the soviet union 
the arrangement called for the chinese air force and grumman 
based in bethpage ny to upgrade 55 planes at 10 million each 
one unidentified industry analyst told the los angeles times 
that cost overruns could boost the price tag to 750 million 
the administration not only barred military sales and deliveries 
but also expelled 40 chinese military officers assigned to the 
peace pearl project at grumman in bethpage and at wrightpatterson 
air force base near dayton ohio 
but it allowed longterm military programs such as peace pearl 
to continue and eventually allowed the chinese officers to return 
to the united states

a faulty cooling valve that forced a 
delay in the launch of space shuttle columbia was removed tuesday 
and found to have a torn filter nasa was expected to set a new 
launch date early next week 
the problem prompted the space agency last week to delay 
columbias launch with a 100 million observatory from wednesday or 
thursday to the end of may or the beginning of june 
were pretty glad we did find the problem now well be on the 
right track of putting everything back together said lisa 
malone a spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
technicians working on a makeshift platform in columbias 
payload bay began draining toxic freon refrigerant from the 
shuttles cooling system friday they completed the work late 
monday then cut out the valve about the length of a hand and 
some attached plumbing 
it was the first time a cooling valve had ever been removed at 
the launch pad the 100 million astro observatory columbias 
payload located about 10 feet below the workers platform remained 
safe under protective nets 
the bad valve was sent to a nearby rockwell international 
service center for analysis rockwell built columbia and the other 
shuttles 
pieces of the torn metal filter were found on two other filters 
on the valve malone said pipes next to the removed valve were 
being checked for clues as to why the filter may have torn and to 
assure there are no other problems 
after a new valve is installed probably on wednesday the 
cooling system will be refilled with freon and the entire system 
will be tested malone said 
nasa was expected to set a new launch date early next week once 
the work is completed 
columbias nine to 10day flight will be the first spacelab 
mission since 1985 and the 36th shuttle mission the four 
astronomers who are part of the sevenman crew will operate astro

the pentagons inspector general has 
recommended that an army private allegedly mistreated by his 
superiors over a missing rifle receive an honorable discharge a 
congresswoman said tuesday 
in a letter to rep helen bentley rmd the inspector general 
said the discharge of james griffin iii was improperly 
accomplished and should be upgraded 
griffin was the victim of a ruse designed by army officers to 
extract information from him regarding his missing weapon 
inspector general susan crawford said in the may 14 letter 
griffin was serving with task force arriba in san lorenzo 
honduras in march 1989 when he was charged with loss of his rifle 
the enlisted man contended that the rifle had been stolen but his 
us superiors turned him over to honduran authorities for 
interrogation 
he was released 18 hours later and eventually returned to fort 
bragg nc where five months later he was thrown out of the army 
bentley said 
the army criminal investigation command later searched a private 
house in fayetteville nc and found the receiver part of 
griffins rifle along with a cache of 16 other semiautomatic rifles 
the weapons were part of a cache from a man who had been a 
soldier in honduras with the task force at the same time griffin 
was there the congresswoman said 
the inspector general said the four army officers stationed in 
honduras with griffin were found directly involved in the ruse 
three were given letters of reprimand while a fourth received 
verbal counseling 
all officers received outstanding performance evaluations for 
their time in honduras the inspector general said 
it is accepted by all that private griffin was treated 
unfairly bentley said 
the case was the subject of a recent report on cbs 60 
minutes television program

the bush administration said tuesday that 18 
million in food assistance is being provided to haiti and it called 
on congress to approve a bill that includes an additional 13 
million for that country 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher expressed 
support for the efforts of provisioal president ertha 
pascaltrouillot to move haiti toward free and fair elections later 
this year 
the 13 million aid package includes 10 million for shortterm 
needs such as fuel and food and 3 million to enable international 
observers to monitor the elections and to provide other types of 
electoral support 
we encourage and will support her mrs trouillots efforts 
to overcome the serious obstacles she confronts in bringing genuine 
democratic reforms and a greater respect for human rights to 
haiti boucher said 
the 13 million assistance package is part of a broader aid bill 
that also includes help for panama and nicaragua president bush 
has made numerous appeals to congress for approval of the 
legislation 
in an interview published in tuesdays editions of the new york 
times mrs trouillot who served previously on haitis supreme 
court said she inherited a bankrupt country two months ago 
i was very surprised to see all of the coffers empty she 
was quoted as saying economically the country is paralyzed the 
state cant honor its debts or pay many of its employees 
the final decision on the food aid was made on monday haiti 
will receive 6 million of the 18 million over the near term and 
the remaining 12 will be delivered starting oct 1 boucher said 
haiti has drifted from one political crisis to another since the 
ouster of president jeanclaude duvalier more than four years ago 
mrs troiullot who assumed her duties in midmarch after the 
ouster of former president prosper avril is haitis fifth 
president since early 1986 
mrs trouillot has made clear her intention not to serve as 
president beyond september a deadline that some regard as 
unrealistic in terms of turning over power to an elected successor 
for much of the past 2 years the united states has not 
provided governmenttogovernment aid to haiti but has delivered 
substantial aid through private voluntary organizations this has 
been a reflection of us dissatisfaction with the dictatorial 
methods of the presidents who preceded mrs trouillot the total 
being funneled through voluntary groups this year is 414 million

a man whose daughter died in the terrorist bombing 
of pan am flight 103 spoke out tuesday against military retaliation 
for such attacks and said economic and political sanctions should 
be tried first 
a report issued tuesday by a us presidential commission said 
the united states should consider military strikes against air 
terrorists 
dr jim swire whose 24yearold daughter was killed when flight 
103 blew up said weve always been against the idea of military 
action in response to lockerbie because we didnt feel that we 
wanted families in the middle east to be put in the same position 
as were in thats to say losing those they loved through murder 
whether its organized on a military basis or not 
swire spoke to reporters before the report was released in the 
united states he is the head of an organization representing 
families of british victims of the 1988 bombing over lockerbie 
scotland his daughter flora was among the 270 people killed 
military action should be the last resort but other forms of 
pressure have not yet been tried swire said 
the us commission asked the united states to consider military 
strikes against air terrorists and conduct covert operations if 
direct action is not possible 
the lockerbie bombing is believed to have been a revenge attack 
for the july 1988 us downing of an iranian plane in which 290 
people died the united states said the attack was an accident and 
offered to pay compensation to iran 
swire said syria iran and other countries known to harbor 
terrorists could be forced to cease their activities if the united 
states britain and the soviet union would apply pressure 
they should withhold economic and military exchanges until 
syria ejects all terrorist groups he said 
instead he said america is behaving in a very friendly 
fashion to iran and syria partly because it wants its hostages 
back and partly because they want continuing supplies of mideast 
oil 
there are six americans held hostage in lebanon mostly by 
proiranian groups 
swire condemned the british government for not conducting an 
inquiry into the lockerbie incident similar to the one by the us 
commission a police investigation into the bombing is under way 
the government says no other inquries will be conducted until the 
police complete their work

an attorney for retired ohio autoworker john 
demjanjuk on tuesday challenged the accuracy of photo lineups used 
to identify his client as a sadistic death camp guard and sentence 
him to death for nazi war crimes 
demjanjuks israeli defense attorney yoram sheftel also 
accused the trials three judges of failing to halt a spate of 
negative press coverage and said some of the articles published 
were tantamount to bloodletting 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk 70 was pronounced guilty in april 
1988 of crimes against humanity after he was identified as a cruel 
guard known as ivan the terrible at the treblinka death camp in 
poland more than 850000 jews were slaughtered at the camp during 
world war ii 
demjanjuk who was extradited from cleveland in february 1986 
claims he is the victim of mistaken identity he said he was 
captured while serving in the soviet army and spent the period in 
question in a german prisonerofwar camp 
on tuesday sheftel challenged two key photograph lineups used 
to help eight treblinka survivors identify demjanjuk as the 
notorious camp guard 
one lineup contains the 1951 picture demjanjuk used on his 
application for a us immigration visa the other picture is from 
a 1942 identity card the soviet union supplied to israel it is 
purported to be from the trawniki camp in poland which trained 
death camp guards 
sheftel said demjanjuk was never called for an inperson lineup 
despite israeli and us rulings saying a suspect should 
participate in person in criminal indentification procedures 
sheftel also said none of the head shots resembled the accused 
he said the hair color shape and size of faces were clearly 
different 
it is like putting a photograph of a black suspect among seven 
white men where have you heard of such a thing sheftel said 
sheftel also noted one of the lineups was deemed inadmissible by 
the us southern district court in florida in 1978 in a case 
involving another accused war criminal feodor fedorenko 
demjanjuks picture appeared alongside fedorenkos in the display 
the us court ruled fedorenkos picture was impermissively 
suggestive because it was larger and clearer than the others 
sheftel said 
theres no doubt that demjanjuks photograph is 10 times more 
impermissively suggestive sheftel added but this court never 
bothered to rule on whether this picture was suggestive 
sheftel also accused the judges of bias he said chief justice 
dov levine told the cleveland plain dealer in an interview 
published in may 1988 that innocence must be proven he noted 
this contradicted the legal principle that a suspect is innocent 
unless proven guilty 
sheftel also crticized the judges for the emotional atmosphere 
surrounding the federal trial he cited the dec 1 1988 incident 
in which a holocaust survivor threw acid in his face at a funeral 
injuring an eye 
sheftel who still wears dark glasses because of the attack 
said it followed a series of inciteful press accounts of the trial 
he cited an article that questioned his credibility and jewishness 
for defending an alleged nazi war criminal 
this was a bloodletting report sheftel said but he added 
the court didnt intercede or say anything 
demjanjuk wearing a brown prison uniform listened intently to 
a ukrainian traslation of the proceedings his wife vera and son 
john jr also watched 
john jr said he believes his father will only walk free if the 
judges have the courage to make a decision based on the facts and 
the law

military junta told the official sudan news agency chadian troops 
that crossed into sudans darfur region last week in pursuit of 
libyanbacked chadian rebels have pulled out of the area but did 
not say when or give any further details 
suna said altahir made the statement following a meeting in 
khartoum the sudanese capital with a delegation from darfur 
the statement said without elaboration that the sudanese 
government would compensate those affected by the chadian raid a 
government statement had earlier demanded compensation from chad 
ibrahim idris head of the darfur delegation that met altahir 
told the associated press that chadian troops torched 18 villages 
north of kutum killed 17 people and kidnapped eight others 
the new horizon a government englishlanguage weekly said 
monday that 3000 chadian troops broke into a hospital and killed 
and wounded rebel chadians in kutum 150 miles inside sudan the 
chadian troops had chased rebels across their countrys eastern 
border 
the wounded men of the opposition were arrested inside the 
kutum hospital by the chadian government troops and were 
executed the paper said 
it did not specify how many were killed or when the incident 
happened earlier reports alleged major chadian troop incursions 
last week 
the newspaper report was the latest in a series of incidents 
involving chadian troops and libyanbacked chadian rebels in 
western sudan following a failed coup attempt in april 1989 
the khartoum government said saturday that chadian government 
troops abducted an unspecified number of libyan and sudanese 
citizens during a raid on western sudan and called for their 
release 
the new horizon however said the abducted included 10 libyans 
and six sudanese 
chad admitted that incident but said the people kidnapped were 
libyan agents on a resupply mission to antichadian rebel missions 
in sudan libya protested the incident saying the kidnapped people 
were libyan merchants 
sudans government said it is willing to maintain good relations 
with its western neighbor but expressed determination to exercise 
sovereignty over all sudan including the desolate and lawless 
western region of darfur 
the government has virtually no control over darfur and other 
frontier areas which have been used as a base of operations by 
chadian rebels and the government in ndjamena 
gen hassan abdulrahman sudans deputy chief of staff told 
suna that sudan has opted for peaceful means although its army was 
capable of containing the situation 
sudans strongman lt gen omar hassan elbashir who is touring 
the area said his government would soon sign a nonaggression and 
good neighbor pact with chad similar to one it concluded with 
uganda last year 
the agreement with uganda among other things calls for 
extradition of dissidents

doctors must realize it is often better to let 
extremely small premature babies die despite fears of lawsuits or 
outcries from lobbyists two researchers say 
medical costs nearing 160000 per infant and the chance that 
surviving babies will suffer lifelong health problems led to the 
conclusion by dr david k stevenson and ernle wd young both of 
stanford university 
the researchers writing in the may issue of american journal of 
diseases of children said an estimated 26 billion annually is 
spent on neonatal intensive care in the united states 
the lifesaving efforts result in an average hospital stay of 
137 days at an average cost of 158800 per infant the study said 
stevenson and young said it would be more costeffective to 
address the root causes of prematurity lack of prenatal care 
poor nutrition in pregnant women homelessness and drug or alcohol 
addiction 
but doctors often feel pressured to order aggressive therapy for 
babies even when the treatment may not be beneficial the 
researchers said 
in part this is due to the way in which fear of litigation 
causes medicine to be practiced in a defensive manner in this 
country they wrote 
special interest groups also may influence doctors decisions 
the article said 
we appear to have a more vigorous prolife lobby in this 
country than is evident in either sweden or britain they wrote 
the researchers said a 1984 study found that the percapita 
incidence of extremely premature underweight infants in great 
britain and sweden was impressively lower than in the united 
states 
stevenson is a professor of pediatrics at stanford university 
medical center young is a stanford professor of pediatrics and 
related ethical issues who also serves as codirector of the 
schools center for biomedical ethics 
taking issue with the researchers was dr thomas g storch an 
associate editor of the journal and a member of its editorial 
board in an accompanying editorial he wrote that the technology 
to achieve good results with the very small infants is well 
within our grasp 
money should not be a consideration storch said tuesday in 
a telephone interview 
there is money out there and we as pediatricians need to 
become spokesmen to get the money out there rather than throw in 
the towel and start rationing health care he said 
stevenson and young said the costs of treating extremely 
underweight premature babies those weighing less than two pounds 
do not take into account the lifelong costs of caring for any 
resulting disabilities 
the effects of erring on the side of life are as follows we 
save some who would otherwise have died we do immediate harm and 
inflict longterm suffering on many who survive and we expend an 
enormous amount of money on neonatal intensive care the 
researchers wrote 
they said the decision should be made solely by doctors and 
parents 
once physicians and parents together have collaboratively 
agreed to a strategy for treatment or nontreatment this ought not 
to be subject to arbitrary veto by interested third parties 
whether prolife lobbyists or federal bureaucrats 
in making such decisions doctors must confront the inescapable 
fact that ours is an era of shrinking resources and ask whether 
setting limits is not both necessary and inevitable 
they noted that two respected ethics writers already have 
advocated a rationing of heroic intensive care for the elderly 
it seems to be only a matter of time before the threshold of 
eligibility for very costly hightechnology intensive care for the 
verylowbirthweight extremely premature infant will be raised

eightyearold elizabeth marengo lit a candle 
tuesday for her father 
just for hope said the girl one of about 200 relatives of 
victims of the pan am 103 bombing who gathered to hear a 
presidential commission report on how their government had failed 
them 
still angry over events before and after the terrorist attack 
the relatives met with the president and received folded american 
flags along with official answers they had long sought about the 
deaths of 270 people on dec 21 1988 
i just hope this gets president bush to do something said 
kathy daniels whose husband william was one of the pan am 103 
victims 
my fear is that president bush will put this in a drawer and 
forget about it said susan cohen who lost her only daughter 
20yearold theodora 
relatives of the victims have worked as a group since shortly 
after the plane blew up over lockerbie scotland 
they have bitterly criticized the government for not warning 
their loved ones of threats that preceded the bombing and they 
have been let down since by what they call a government insensitive 
to their concerns 
the relatives said the report released tuesday by the 
presidents commission on aviation security and terrorism bore out 
their worst fears about what had happened they praised the call 
for change 
i think the american public particularly the american 
traveler should be outraged at the commissions findings said 
victoria cummock of coral gables fla whose husband john died 
in the explosion 
they praised portions of the report calling for warnings to 
passengers of credible threats against flights and many 
expressed satisfaction at the call for preparations for retaliation 
against terrorists 
for many of us this has been the most satisfying day since 
dec 21 1988 said bert ammerman head of one of the two formal 
relatives groups ammermans brother thomas died on the flight 
many of the relatives went from the white house meeting with 
bush to the news conference releasing the report almost all wore 
buttons iran killed them some said and many had pictures 
of their loved ones pinned to their chest 
some bowed their heads and cried softly as commission chairman 
ann mclaughlin methodically ticked off the findings of bureaucratic 
failures and described the recommendations 
theres still a tremendous wound said maria marengo the 
mother of three by her late husband louis this does not close 
it 
her daughter elizabeth lit one of the three candles the 
relatives said will burn at washingtons shrine of the immaculate 
conception in memory of the victims the candles were labeled 
justice security warning the three themes the families 
have stressed 
although they felt vindicated by the findings the relatives 
expressed lingering bitterness that the government hasnt come out 
and said who committed the act and made an attempt to bring 
perpetrators to justice 
we have seen since day one a political shellgame going on 
said ammerman pointing to the british german and american 
governments theres no question in our minds that the 
intelligence community knows without a doubt who did this 
it has been widely reported that investigators believe iran 
initiated the act as retribution for the accidental downing in 1987 
of a commercial iranian airliner by the uss vincennes in the 
persian gulf the investigators believe the syrianbased popular 
front for the liberation of palestine general command carried it 
out 
im still very frustrated at the president said wendy 
giebler the widow of william giebler i want him bush to make 
me proud to be an american again he has the power to do that

imelda marcos fraud trial said the former philippines first lady 
was a great friend who prevented his mother from committing 
suicide after his brothers death 
i think the only reason my mother is alive is because of mrs 
marcos hamilton said his voice breaking with emotion 
hamilton said his mother was so distraught when his brother died 
of liver and kidney malfunctions that she wanted to commit suicide 
but that mrs marcos saved her by inviting her to visit the 
philippines 
the actor was compelled to testify for the prosecution after 
being subpoenaed and granted immunity hamilton said he sought 
immunity on advice of his attorneys 
under crossexamination by mrs marcos defense attorney gerry 
spence hamilton described mrs marcos kindness to his family and 
called her a great friend of my family and mine 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of helping her late husband former 
philippines president ferdinand e marcos embezzle more than 220 
million from their countrys treasury to secretly buy four new york 
properties and artwork 
she is charged with racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail 
fraud and obstruction of justice 
hamiltons testimony for the prosecution dealt with a 55 
million loan he received in 1983 from gliceria tantoco a friend of 
mrs marcos who owned rustans department store in manila 
mrs tantoco was charged along with mrs marcos but is a 
fugitive prosecutors have said mrs tantoco acted as an agent for 
the marcoses in the purchase of the new york real estate 
hamilton described the loan as an advance on a contract with 
mrs tantoco under which he would produce films in the philippines 
including one about gen douglas macarthur 
he said he returned the money to mrs tantoco about eight months 
later when the deal fell through because of concerns about how the 
macarthur movie would affect macarthurs widow 
i was able to use a portion of the money for expenses but 
ultimately paid it all back he said 
hamilton testified that part of the money he returned to mrs 
tantoco came from another 6 million loan whose source was not 
revealed 
the actor said he met mrs tantoco in 1979 during a world tour 
to promote his comedy film love at first bite in which he 
played a vampire 
he met mrs marcos through mrs tantoco he said 
hamilton said he never discussed business with mrs marcos and 
described their relationship as social and great friendship 
during a crisis 
although hamiltons testimony was expected his presence late in 
the afternoon caused a stir in the crowded courtroom in manhattans 
federal court 
the tanned actor appeared at ease during his 50 minutes on the 
witness stand except for briefly when he spoke of his brother 
at one point when the attorneys were discussing a legal point 
outside the hearing of the jury hamilton smiled and waved to a 
spectator he recognized 
he occasionally looked at mrs marcos but she appeared to avoid 
making eye contact with him

eight million americans living like third 
world residents along the mississippi river need attention from the 
government now deficit or no deficit members of congress said 
tuesday 
we cant use the budget deficit as an excuse for inaction 
sen dale bumpers dark said at a news conference announcing the 
findings of the lower mississippi delta development commission 
bumpers one of the powers behind the commission said the 
poverty of the region must be addressed cooperatively by the states 
involved and the federal government 
commission member john shepherd said health care in the region 
is worse than some third world countries 
if they werent americans the world bank would come to their 
aid he said 
shepherd said the kind of attention that has been given to 
poverty in the eastern mountain area through the appalachian 
regional commission ought now be given to the delta 
while the commissions report recommends activities that can 
help the region without extensive federal spending bumpers and 
others pointed out that the government demonstrates daily it can 
find money when necessary 
we spent 5 billion last year for one hurricane that spent 24 
hours in the carolinas bumpers said 
if we can spend 50 billion bailing out the sampls if we can 
talk about putting a man on mars if can give aid to eastern 
europe we ought to think about our own people said arkansas 
gov bill clinton chairman of the commission 
were voting this week on 1 billion in foreign aid to 
strengthen democracies rep mike espy dmiss said in 
reference to money going mostly to panama and nicaragua i know a 
region already a democracy thats yearning to be merged 
espy said the groundwork already was being laid in the house to 
carry out recommendations from the commission 
we are anxious to get started he said of a group of 
congressmen representing the lower mississippi area we are 
positioned across the panorama of congressional committees 
a hearing on the report has been scheduled for wednesday by 
subcommittees of the house public works and transportation and 
banking finance and urban affairs committees 
the commission spent 18 months studying the problems of the 
poorest region in the united states and developed a 10year 
economic development plan the area includes 219 counties in 
arkansas louisiana mississippi missouri illinois tennessee and 
kentucky 
the commissions 186page report was touted as a handbook for 
action by its authors 
it offers specific recommendations for improving health 
education housing community development agriculture natural 
resources utilities roads business opportunities and tourism 
for example the region is one of the most naturally rich 
agricultural areas of the country but has experienced setbacks due 
to the trend away from family farming and technological changes 
that displace workers 
the report suggests specific action that can be addressed by the 
federal government states educational institutions or 
agribusiness to revitalize that part of the regions economy

a boston lawyer and a parents group asked a 
federal court tuesday to force federal health officials to 
publicize a compensation program for vaccinerelated injuries 
attorney michael hugo and dissatisfied parents together a group 
of parents whose children have been injured or killed by vaccines 
say the federal government has failed to get word of the program to 
other parents 
hugo a boston lawyer who represents people injured by vaccines 
and the parents group asked the us district court to order the 
department of health and human services to put out information 
about the program in public service announcements to television and 
radio stations in fliers mailed with social security notices and 
in ads in major newspapers 
of particular concern is an oct 1 deadline for claims to be 
filed for children injured by vaccinations before oct 1 1988 
but robert harmon head of the health resources and services 
administration the arm of the department overseeing the program 
said we feel that reasonable efforts to publicize the program 
have occurred 
harmon said officials have conducted press interviews printed 
articles in the health resources and services administrations 
weekly newsletter notified national and all state bar associations 
and sent information to professional organizations journals and 
newsletters 
also the agency plans to have a tollfree hotline working by 
the end of the week he said 
as of may 11 the national vaccine injury compensation program 
had paid 32 million in 62 cases the program is financed by an 
excise tax on the sale of vaccines and congressional appropriations 
the program covers injuries from vaccines protecting against 
diphtheria tetanus pertussis or whooping cough measles mumps 
rubella and polio 
hugo estimated that up to 40000 children have serious though 
not necessarily permanent reactions to the vaccine for diphtheria 
tetanus and pertussis called dtp or sometimes dpt but kenneth 
bart deputy director of the vaccine injury compensation program 
said serious injuries from childhood immunizations are rare and 
that hugos estimate was far too high 
dissatisfied parents together in a separate action tuesday 
asked health and human services secretary louis sullivan to 
withdraw financing for a vaccine study because of an alleged 
conflict of interest involving a member of the study committee 
the group says dr marie griffin a member of the committee 
appointed by the institute of medicine receives financial support 
from burroughs wellcome one of the leading makers of the pertussis 
vaccine 
the panel is reviewing medical evidence on possible adverse 
reactions to the pertussis and rubella vaccines including brain 
damage and death 
in a statement the institute said the burroughs wellcome 
scholar award that griffin received does not pose a conflict of 
interest the grant program is administered by the american college 
of preventive medicine and money for it comes from the burroughs 
wellcome fund a nonprofit foundation the institute said 
griffin who is on leave from her job at vanderbilt university 
school of medicine was attending an outoftown conference and 
could not be reached for comment her secretary said 
about a month after the committee began its work in january one 
member was removed from the panel because of a conflict of 
interest dr floyd denny a pediatrics professor at the university 
of north carolina had testified on behalf of a physician in a 
malpractice case involving the pertussis vaccine

antiabortion activists from operation rescue 
should be found in contempt of court for blockading medical clinics 
in the district of columbia abortionrights proponents told a 
federal judge tuesday 
the arguments came as five members of operation rescue defied a 
us supreme court ban on protests within 50 feet of atlanta 
abortion clinics chaining themselves together inside the atlanta 
surgicenter 
police and firefighters pried the protesters loose from clinic 
property before arresting them tuesday but two were still chained 
at the feet and neck when carried to jail they were held on 
charges of criminal trespass 
in us district court in washington proabortion advocates 
from the national organization for women and other groups testified 
that operation rescue members violated a court order in november 
that prohibited them from blocking entrances to clinics in the 
district of columbia 
us district court judge louis oberdorfer issued the 
preliminary injunction nov 8 in a lawsuit filed by now and planned 
parenthood that anticipated operation rescue protests in the 
district 
more than 700 protesters were arrested in one day of 
demonstrations in november on charges of violating a new district 
of columbia law barring them from gathering within 100 feet of an 
abortion clinic 
at a daylong hearing witnesses said they had seen patrick 
mahoney of boca raton fla and other members of operation rescue 
direct demonstrators to trespass on the property of clinics 
john bates who assisted the abortionrights groups testified 
that mahoney directed the actions of the protesters sitting within 
40 feet of the back and front doors of a clinic in the nov 17 
demonstrations 
under questioning by mahoney bates said he hadnt seen mahoney 
cross the police line bates said he saw mahoney give media 
interviews but couldnt recall precisely what he said 
operation rescue spent well in excess of 50000 and maybe 
well more than 100000 on the november protests said larry 
eisenstein who represents now and planned parenthood 
eisenstein said 1989 donations exceeded 700000 and that 11 
million was deposited in bank accounts 
eisenstein asked that operation rescue and its leaders be fined 
a large enough figure to deter them from returning in the 
future 
operation rescue contends it is in debt 
in atlanta operation rescue spokeswoman jane shepherd denied 
that tuesdays protest was in response to the supreme court 
decision to prohibit the antiabortion group from protesting within 
50 feet of any atlanta abortion clinic she acknowledged however 
that it violated that ban 
when we do a rescue in the city it does not matter whether 
theres an injunction or not she said 
clinic director beth petzelt said protesters pushed their way 
into the clinic about 830 am as patients were being admitted and 
then scuffled with the four or five staff members who tried to keep 
them out 
some demonstrators sat in the waiting room singing hymns ms 
petzelt said while the five men went to the back and chained 
themselves together fastening the chains with halfinchthick 
steel locks 
they attached some of the chains to door hinges or knobs but 
were not able to enter the clinics operating and recovery rooms 
she said 
seven other protesters quietly demonstrated on a sidewalk across 
the fivelane street from the clinic they appeared to be outside 
the 50foot limit and were not arrested 
mondays supreme court decision came on operation rescues 
emergency appeal of the lower court ruling the appeal was rejected 
on a 54 vote 
operation rescue members said the injunction violated their free 
speech rights

the nimble little nintendo men who dodge 
bad guys to rescue the princess now have a bigger prize to capture 
the approval of wary parents exhausted by the video game craze 
as an inducement the japanese toymaker has given 3 million to 
the media lab at the massachusetts institute of technology for its 
ongoing research into how children can learn while they play the 
school announced tuesday 
the gift to establish the nintendo fund will back the work of 
seymour papert a mathematician and pioneer in artificial 
intelligence who directs learning research at the media lab 
making moreeducational models of nintendo could ease parents 
worries about the intense attraction the games hold for their 
children and a tendency to dismiss them as useless diversions 
kids do just love nintendo said gordon cawelti of the 
association for supervision and curriculum development in 
alexandria va which examines the use of computers in education 
but they consume an enormous amount of time something like 
nintendo is captivating but not very educating and its 
addicting 
what underlies paperts approach to workplusplay equals 
learning is a phrase he learned from children papert said in an 
interview children say i like that because its hard fun 
fun does not have to be easy real play can be painful but it 
also has this element of fun and engagement and its something you 
want to do 
one of the criticisms of school ive made is that its not 
connected to childrens real lives what theyre really interested 
in 
papert is widely known for his invention of a computer language 
called logo used in about a third of the countrys elementary 
schools logo lets children program computers 
the new grant does not require mit researchers to devise new 
nintendo games though papert did not rule out the possibility 
nintendo games already are played in 40 million homes worldwide 
half of them in the united states 
with an estimated 90 percent of children of videogame age 
playing nintendo the market seems about saturated a new angle 
could boost sales 
but so far intentionally educational software for kids doesnt 
seem to sell as well as the sort regarded as pure fun educational 
software rang up sales of about 350 million last year compared 
with 35 billion in video games 
video games are to computer technology what soap operas are to 
drama cawelti said powergripping soap operas have no 
theatrical merit but they could have 
but papert believes video games already teach children about 
learning about complex systems and strategy and about 
communicating with others 
parents need to be reeducated to think that fun is the most 
important element of good learning he said 
papert wants the new research to expand on the use of video 
games to teach children about their physical and social environment 
im not against books but computers open up new routes into 
these subject matters he said 
spokespeople at nintendos us offices in redmont wash were 
away for the day tuesday and other officials said they could not 
comment nintendo is headquartered in kyoto japan 
in a statement released by mit nintendo president hiroshi 
yamauchi said we have long felt that we owe a responsibility 
to develop our hard and software to enhance the educational 
opportunities through our machines i am confident this program 
will contribute to a smarter generation than ever existed before

soviet loyalists converged on the 
secessionist parliaments of estonia and latvia on tuesday and one 
baltic premier broadcast an appeal to stave off a coup attempt 
as protesters raised the hammerandsickle flag over his office 
building 
people come here to save estonia prime minister edgar 
savisaar said in a tallinn radio address as a crowd estimated at up 
to 6000 took over parts of the toompea palace government building 
and a square outside 
there is a coup attempt here he said in the broadcast 
monitored in moscow and transcribed by the estonian news agency eta 
tallinn and the latvian capital of riga were described as 
peaceful tuesday night although soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze warned of anarchy in the baltic states as he 
prepared for a round of meetings in moscow with us secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
after savisaars evening broadcast thousands of tallinn 
residents rushed to the palace and hoisted the presoviet blue 
white and black banner that was raised last week when parliament 
restored a 1937 independence charter 
proindependence demonstrators formed two human chains through 
which soviet loyalists were allowed to leave the area eta reported 
calm returned to the city by 750 pm estonian reports said 
finnish television said proindependence crowds guarded government 
broadcasting stations during the night to block any takeover 
attempt 
popular front security guards were also assigned around the 
clock to other government buildings eta reported 
eta estimated the moscow loyalists at 2500 with a core of 
about 400 who tried to overturn a police truck in the palace 
courtyard it put proindependence forces at 3000 finnish tv 
estimated the antiindependence crowd at 5000 to 6000 and 
secessionist demonstrators at 20000 the incident lasted two hours 
a similar confrontation occurred in the latvian capital of riga 
where for the second day whistling and jeering soviet soldiers 
tried to muscle into the parliament building but were blocked by 
proindependence crowds 
about two dozen interior ministry troops wielding truncheons 
helped drive back the soldiers and their civilian supporters said 
ivars embrekts an american working at the latvian parliament 
soviet helicopters scattered leaflets the day before urging 
residents to storm the building 
aris jansons top aide to latvian president anatoly gorbunov 
said unarmed soldiers and military cadets aged 1822 gathered 
outside the building of the latvian supreme soviet or parliament 
and 100 yards away on another square 
the whole street is full of people thousands of people 
and thanks only to special militia units has the situation 
normalized jansons said in a telephone interview 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis in a radio interview 
broadcast as secretary baker flew to moscow appealed to the 
americans to raise the issue of baltic independence with soviet 
leaders 
the steep rise in tension came the day after soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev invoked new presidential powers to decree that 
latvia and estonia violated the soviet constitution by declaring 
independence and that the declarations were invalid 
one speaker at the tallinn rally appealed to gorbachev to 
declare direct presidential rule in estonia according to a report 
from the estonian news service 
it was not clear whether the antiindependence rallies were 
planned with gorbachevs knowledge or were organized solely by 
promoscow forces in the republics 
shevardnadze made ominous statements in an interview with cbstv 
the right to selfdetermination has to be implimented within 
the framework of our constitution if this principle is violated 
then it will mean anarchy i am sure he said 
the mistake of our friends in the baltic republics is that 
first they decide and then they want dialogue but dialogue is 
necessary before a decision is passed 
the soviet parliament in march voted that lithuania violated the 
constitution when its legislature declared immediate independence 
on march 11 gorbachev imposed economic sanctions on lithuania 
blocking deliveries of oil and natural gas 
latvia declared may 4 that it was passing through a transition 
period to independence estonia had taken a similar step march 30 
all three republics were independent until the soviet union annexed 
them in 1940 
second secretary vladislav shved said the lithuanian communist 
party faction loyal to moscow planned antiindependence rallies 
tuesday in factories in the capital of vilnius but managers and 
workers interviewed at two major plants said they knew nothing of 
such rallies 
the state tass news agency reported however that political 
actions were undertaken in organizations and businesses to 
demonstrate solidarity with the striking collectives in the latvian 
soviet socialist republic 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene and president 
landsbergis have said they are prepared to back away from immediate 
independence but have been unable to open negotiations with 
gorbachev 
mrs prunskiene said in an interview broadcast on central soviet 
television that talks between moscow and vilnius should start 
immediately 
lithuanians has 37 million people latvia 27 million and 
estonia 16 million

shaken students and officials at the dormitory also said they

a company has agreed to pay 35 million 
in back pay to women employees in what labor secretary elizabeth 
dole on tuesday called one of the largest equalemployment 
opportunity settlements in us history 
precision castparts corp of portland will pay about 1000 women 
who were steered into traditionally female jobs when they were 
hired the labor department said in announcing the settlement 
tuesday 
the money will be paid to women who worked in hourly 
nonclerical jobs at the companys plants in portland at any time 
from 1978 through 1988 according to roy marvin the companys vice 
president of administration 
precision castparts which manufactures jet engine parts and 
other metal components for the aerospace industry will send 
notices to women eligible for benefits within 45 days marvin said 
women who do not receive notices within 45 days and who believe 
they are eligible should contact the department of labor he said 
the settlement is the result of a compliance review conducted by 
the labor departments office of federal contract compliance 
programs after a complaint was filed in march 1987 
the complaint alleged that the company had violated an executive 
order that prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the 
basis of race sex religion color or national origin the order 
also requires contractors to take affirmative action measures in 
hiring women and minorities 
women represent an important and growing part of todays labor 
force dole said in a prepared statement if america is to 
remain competitive it is no longer just an option for companies to 
employ and promote qualified women and minorities into 
nontraditional jobs it is a business and legal necessity 
this settlement is one of the largest equal opportunity 
agreements in labor department history and further demonstrates the 
departments commitment to eliminating discrimination in the 
workplace 
as part of the settlement the company agreed to provide more 
opportunities for women to transfer to higherpaying jobs within 
the company 
the labor department said its investigation revealed that 
precision castparts ushered women into traditionally female jobs 
that were lowerpaying and provided less opportunity to compete or 
train for higherpaying jobs which traditionally have been filled 
by men at the three plants 
the company said it was denying the allegations but decided to 
negotiate a settlement anyway 
precision said in a news release that it has taken steps to 
increase the percentage of women in its bluecollar workforce and 
in traditional male jobs in particular 
our efforts to increase opportunities for women are already 
showing results marvin said the number of women in 
bluecollar jobs has doubled since 1980 a period when our overall 
employment levels have increased dramatically in percentage terms 
women are now 33 percent of the bluecollar workforce compared to 
26 percent in 1980

the government sought to quell national concern 
over mad cow disease on tuesday but local government officials 
removed beef from the menu in more than 1000 schools 
while agriculture minister john gummer insisted that british 
beef is perfectly safe to eat the publicized death of one of 
britains 7 million pet cats from the disease grabbed the headlines 
gummer said he was letting his four children eat beef and beef 
products 
i would not dream of either allowing that or the public to eat 
beef unless i was wholly and absolutely confident he said in a 
statement 
britains 11 european economic community partners and the soviet 
union earlier banned british beef imports after reports of cattle 
having to be destroyed because they had the disease scientifically 
named bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse 
the mysterious disease affects the brain and central nervous 
system in cattle they foam at the mouth and their legs splay out 
last month humberside in eastern england banned all british 
beef products from its school canteens 
tuesday was the blackest day yet for the 33 billion a year 
cattle industry 
staffordshire banned beef sausages beefburgers and minced beef 
in the countys 570 schools it said it was satisfied solid beef 
cuts are safe 
derbyshire stopped beef servings in more than 600 schools as a 
precaution richmond upon thames took beef off the menus of its 
primary and junior schools liverpool banned british and foreign 
beef from all its kitchens in more than 300 schools and 100 old 
peoples homes and other institutions 
government officials said there was no chance of bse passing 
from beef to humans but the death of jacqueline stones siamese 
cat max aroused widespread alarm 
blood tests and xrays did not indicate what made max ill so it 
was destroyed in april for an autopsy which showed it probably had 
a feline version of bse 
mrs stone said max was the only one of her five siamese cats 
affected and they all had the same food canned meat dried food 
and cooked meat from pet shops and butchers 
she said the cat showed the first sign of illness in january 
when it held up a paw and lost its sense of balance it did not go 
mad she insisted 
bse has a long incubation period perhaps four to six years it 
was first identified among britains 16 million cattle in 1984 and 
more than 13000 of them have been destroyed since then only 22 
were bulls 
the daily telegraph said tuesday only a single animal had the 
disease in 63 percent of the affected herds and 90 percent of dairy 
herds are unaffected 
what causes the disease is unknown autopsied brains examined 
through electron microscopes are holed and fibrous indicative of a 
rotting process 
a sheep disease called scrapie that most resembles bse has been 
known for 200 years and is still not identified the government 
said people have been eating meat from scrapieaffected sheep for 
generations without being harmed 
it was thought that cattle with bse got the disease from feed 
containing protein from the remains of scrapieinfected sheep and 
such feed has now been banned 
last year the agriculture ministry forecast about 350 cases of 
bse would appear each month but in the first week of may the rate 
was up to about 1000 a month 
the ministry is giving 100 percent compensation to farmers 
slaughtering their affected animals and has pledged 20 million 
over three years for research on the disease 
the vegetarian society advised the only logical approach for 
the human population is to avoid beef products altogether

arizonas senate voted 1614 tuesday to create a 
paid martin luther king holiday and wipe out a public referendum on 
the longcontroversial issue despite polls showing most arizonans 
want it put to a statewide vote 
the measure which also restores a paid columbus day holiday 
now goes to the house legislative leaders said it would be passed 
wednesday 
opponents of the measure say a referendum should be automatic 
because the new bill would knock out a scheduled public vote on a 
bill lawmakers passed last year that bill created a king day while 
eliminating columbus day from the list of paid holidays for state 
employees 
last years kingforcolumbus bill so angered king opponents and 
columbus supporters that they joined forces and gathered nearly 
twice the 43350 needed signatures to put the measure into legal 
limbo pending a referendum this november 
if the newest king holiday bill is passed and signed by gov 
rose mofford who called the legislature into special session to 
consider the measure opponents would have 90 days to gather 
signatures to call a referendum 
polls suggest that more than 80 percent of arizonans believe the 
issue should be decided by the voters opponents of the bill 
including impeached gov evan mecham have promised a new 
referendum drive to get the issue back on this novembers ballot 
it was my impression we were supposed to be servants said 
republican sen wayne stump it was never never my idea that we 
were supposed to be the masters 
rightly or wrongly this bill wont go away republican sen 
leo corbet warned as he pleaded with his fellow senators to amend 
tuesdays bill and condition it on public vote 
my opposition isnt to a king holiday he added my 
opposition is to giving another paid holiday to state employees 
at a time when the state faces a potential deficit of at least 250 
million 
controversy over a king holiday has dogged the state for years 
democratic gov bruce babbitt declared a holiday by executive 
proclamation as he was about to start a presidential bid in 1986 
but republican attorney general bob corbin called it an illegal 
usurpation of the legislatures role and mecham rescinded it days 
before it would have taken effect 
mechams action sparked protest marches tourist boycotts and 
convention cancellations by national organizations it also fueled 
a recall drive against mecham but a senate court of impeachment 
ousted him on other grounds before the recall vote could be held 
mecham who is running for governor again has promised to put 
up to 4000 of his volunteers into the field to help gather 
signatures for a referendum and organizers predict theyll get the 
signatures within two months 
the chief sponsor of the latest legislation democratic sen 
carolyn walker said there was no need to let the voters have a say 
in what could become a racially divisive referendum 
i know there are those who say we are taking this away from 
the people she said i would like to remind them that the 
people elected us in the state of arizona as leaders 
the bills impact on the referendum caused one longtime holiday 
supporter democratic sen gus arzberger to switch sides 
i cant vote to take the vote away from the people 
arzberger said i vote no 
but republican sen bill de long who has voted against the bill 
in the past reversed field tuesday saying a recent poll showed 
his constituents now favor the holiday he refused to release the 
poll results 
republican sen doug todd who opposed early king bills before 
voting for last years measure also voted for tuesdays bill 
saying his past votes had helped to build a berlin wall of 
fear bigotry and hatred

norways foreign minister were injured said the conference 
secretariat 
they were all talk and no action said jan heiret a 
representative of the protesters 
the conference ends wednesday and delegates are trying to work 
out a compromise declaration that will take into account us 
objections 
the us delegation has objected to some recommendations 
particularly those on setting binding agreements to limit emissions 
of gases and on establishing a new fund for environmental aid to 
developing countries 
mrs brundtland criticized the us stance saying we can 
pay or pay later 
tom burke of britains green alliance and a spokesman for the 
environmental groups represented praised the meeting it may not 
get us the result we wanted but it got us a lot further in 
contacting governments 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov joined in the praise 
the environment requires urgent joint action to save 
civilization on earth he said in a cable to the meeting 
mrs brundtlands headed the 1987 unsponsored commission that 
issued a report entitled our common future outlining paths 
toward development that would allow third world countries to 
progress while taking environmental precautions

out another note requesting definitions in laymans terms of 
intent reasonable doubt and acting in concert 
meanwhile a second jury deliberated for a ninth day on murder 
and other charges against joseph fama also 19 the accused 
triggerman in the case 
both juries recessed for the day around 730 pm and were to 
resume deliberations at 11 am wednesday 
my guess is theyre hung up on the tougher charges 
assistant district attorney paul burns said of the mondello jury 
after its first note tuesday 
based on notes from the jury burns speculated that the panel 
was at an impasse over the discrimination and homicide charges 
he predicted the judge would give the jurors a socalled allen 
charge wednesday if they continued to report a deadlock 
under an allen charge a judge formally admonishes deadlocked 
jurors to persist and listen to each other with an open mind 
prosecutors say that if the panel is unable to decide all 
counts the judge would have to accept a verdict on whatever 
charges it did agree on the defendant then would be retried on the 
charges on which the jury was deadlocked 
mondellos lawyer stephen murphy said the jurys deadlock was 
hard to read id just as soon take whatever they have and 
leave 
earlier the two panels listened to readbacks of testimony from 
several residents of the bensonhurst neighborhood in south brooklyn 
where the shooting occurred prior to its standstill note the 
mondello jury sent word that they would need fresh clothes if their 
deliberations went into wednesday 
prosecutors allege fama shot hawkins after a mob of whites 
organized by mondello surrounded the black youth who had come into 
bensonhurst with three black friends to look at a used car

with shevardnadze 
interview 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
secretary of state james a baker iii backed by 
three dozen advisers arrived in the soviet capital tuesday to try 
to overcome deep differences over missile reductions that could 
impede success at the washington summit 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is due to see president 
bush in only two weeks and senior baker aides said on the flight 
to moscow that at least four key issues were unresolved 
already the two sides have decided to resume negotiations in 
geneva right after baker concludes his visit on saturday take a 
break for the may 30june 3 summit and then work through the 
summer 
this suggests there is little hope that baker in his talks with 
gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze can settle 
all the remaining issues in time for a summit declaration 
the differences are over restrictions to be placed on cruise 
missiles aboard fighter planes and warships on mobile missiles 
with multiple warheads and on heavy landbased missiles 
also in more than 400 pages of proposed treaty text compiled in 
geneva the two sides have not fixed on a scheme for verifying 
compliance with the reductions in strategic nuclear weapons 
gorbachev is to arrive in washington may 30 after visiting 
canada the previous day after his summit meetings with bush at 
the white house and at the presidential retreat at camp david md 
he is to fly to minneapolis on june 3 to visit with business and 
agricultural leaders and then on to san francisco for a speech at 
nearby stanford university 
two us officials who spoke to reporters traveling with baker 
on condition they would not be identified said the soviets had 
backtracked in talks in washington last month after considerable 
headway was made in february talks in moscow 
there has been some movement to try to pick up the pieces 
one of the officials said of the continuing talks in geneva but he 
declined to venture a prediction of baker success or describe 
recent headway as substantial 
interviewed by cbs news shevardnadze denied any significant 
backtracking in the talks or undue influence by the soviet 
military 
there is a team effort to formulate our arms control positions 
and i wouldnt say that at any point there was any significant 
backtracking on our part it is part of a normal negotiating 
process shevardnadze said in the interview broadcast tuesday 
evening 
on two other arms control fronts the outlook also is cloudy 
completion of a ussoviet accord at the summit pledging to 
cease production of chemical weapons depends on the soviets 
agreeing to a schedule to destroy their stockpiles 
and differences over verification methods and limiting aircraft 
stand in the way of an accord between nato and the warsaw pact to 
reduce troops and tanks in europe 
as baker arrived in moscow gorbachevs difficulties in the 
breakaway baltic republics deepened his domestic troubles might 
seem likely to impair preparations for the summit meeting with 
bush although some administration analysts suggested this week 
gorbachev might be impelled to push for a foreign policy success to 
balance his political problems 
thousands of whistling and soviet soldiers tried to break into 
the latvian parliament in riga the latvian capital a day after 
gorbachev declared independence movements in latvia and estonia 
null and void in lithuania he is maintaining a partial economic 
blockade 
bush and baker while voicing support for selfdetermination 
have withheld any us economic retaliation against moscow 
however baker has informed moscow that the administration is under 
pressure from congress and bush has said there are limits to us 
patience 
baker is due to see gorbachev on friday after talks wednesday 
and thursday with shevardnadze saturday morning has been set aside 
for further discussions with the soviet foreign minister 
while both sides have said heavy emphasis would be put on arms 
control measures baker and his aides also would like to prepare 
agreements on space cooperation the environment and trade for 
announcement at the summit 
and baker intends to make a special point about human rights 
before his first round with shevardnadze he scheduled a meeting 
with jewish refuseniks who have been long denied exit permits

prince charles called on society tuesday to make 
greater use of the skills and energies of retired people 
people tend to take retirement seriously they withdraw into 
the anterooms of society and often do little or nothing stagnating 
and wilting visibly they act out the role in which society has 
cast them he said 
the 41yearold heir to the british throne said greater 
initiatives were needed to tap the skills experience enthusiasm 
and time of retired people 
to retired people he said look about your community ask 
yourselves how your talents and those of your friends could be used 
to benefit not only others but yourselves too 
addressing the annual meeting of the abbeyfield society a 
charity that has more than 1000 homes for the elderly the prince 
said a majority of the almost 13 million elderly britons a third 
of the adult population were active independent and reasonably 
fit 
by this definition old age is not the postscript to the long 
letter of life it is or could be the final glorious concluding 
paragraph he said 
and the challenge is in part how do we offer these millions 
some opportunity to find the right mix of leisure with constructive 
and worthwhile activity he said 
the prince also noted it was a harsh and terrible fact that 
so many old people were lonely 
it is one of the sad paradoxes of this earthly life that 
alongside the advantages of an industrial society we have witnessed 
the parallel degradation of the wider family circle and an 
expansion of the kind of loneliness which is still less common in 
other parts of europe

the nations largest ecumenical body faced 
with dwindling contributions from member churches on tuesday 
unveiled a reorganization plan designed to cut costs and weaken its 
governing board 
we refer to it as a leaner kindlier council said the rev 
j martin bailey spokesman for the national council of churches 
the council represents 32 christian denominations with 42 
million members most major protestant orthodox and anglican 
religions sponsor the council to help further education missionary 
work and other projects around the world 
the reorganization plan was presented on the first day of the 
semiannual meeting of the councils 250member governing board 
bailey said president bush and his thousand points of light 
led to tight finances and forced the reorganization 
member churches are contributing less to the council because of 
inflation and the need to fund social programs once backed by the 
federal government he said 
under the plan the council would combine into four units 11 
divisions responsible for subjects ranging from overseas ministry 
to sacred music 
bailey said the reorganization would remove most decisionmaking 
power from the governing board and give it to smaller boards 
overseeing the new units 
the governing board however still will set policy elect 
officers and approve the councils budget which in 1989 totaled 
446 million 
church leaders said the restructuring will make the council more 
efficient 
we found that a lot of our costs too many of them were going 
for meetings and other administrative functions bailey said 
the councils stewardship commission which develops 
fundraising programs and helps local churches manage their 
finances opposes the reorganization for fear it will lose power 
said the rev e wayne antworth of the reformed church of america 
the commissions cochairman 
the governing board is to vote on the plan thursday if 
approved it will go into effect in 1991 
also thursday the board is scheduled to vote on a resolution 
that would urge the defense department to withdraw troops from the 
philippines by 1996 
another would ask us coffee producers to stop buying coffee 
from el salvador where six jesuit priests were gunned down in 
november 1989 nine salvadoran soldiers are awaiting trial for the 
killings 
on wednesday copies of the new revised standard version of the 
bible are to be distributed 
the revised bible is partly based on the dead sea scrolls which 
predate the greek and hebrew texts used to write the king james 
bible said bruce metzger chairman of the revision committee 
the council has licensed six publishers to print the new bible 
last revised in 1952 it is to appear in bookstores this summer

fifteen years of unleaded gas in the 
tank is helping clean up more than smoggy city air dramatic lead 
decreases also have been reported in forest soil far from urban 
areas 
scientists had feared that toxic lead emissions wafting from 
vehicle tail pipes threatened trees and other forest life but a 
recent study credits the clean air act with bringing relatively 
speedy relief 
its beautiful the curve showing the decline of lead said 
thomas g siccama a forest ecologist at the yale university school 
of forestry and environmental studies 
it has left the forest floor faster than the general community 
of ecologists thought he said 
in 1980 siccama and two other scientists william h smith of 
yale and donald l mader of the university of massachusetts 
documented that lead levels in massachusetts forest soil had jumped 
significantly between 1962 and 1978 
the amount of lead per square meter had increased from 682 
milligrams to 1160 
siccama smith and others including andrew j friedland of 
dartmouth college and arthur h johnson of the university of 
pennsylvania began looking more closely at forest surface soil 
typically a mat of organic matter 2 to 4 inches deep 
they took samples in forests extending from pennsylvania through 
new hampshire 
over the past year they and other researchers reviewed the 
data their work has not yet been published but siccama said clear 
trends were apparent 
at a cathedral pines forest test site near cornwall conn yale 
graduate student julie tritschler found lead had fallen 26 percent 
since 1980 down from 1275 milligrams per square meter to 940 
at hubbard brook in west thornton nh lead levels in 1975 
were approaching 1100 milligrams per square meter by 1988 they 
had fallen to under 800 milligrams per square meter siccama said 
michael j kellett northeast regional director for the 
wilderness society was encouraged by the lead decreases but 
cautioned that it is important to learn where the lead is going 
because it might end up in underground water supplies 
siccama and others say the decline in soil lead levels is almost 
certainly because of mandated unleaded gasoline use in new cars 
that began in 1975 
that was the whole point of the law siccama said it is a 
oneonone connection we know it has gone down in the rain and 
weve followed it going down in the soil where we knew it was 
accumulating

lawyers turned to the us supreme court on 
tuesday in what they called their last hope of heading off fridays 
execution of a man convicted as a teenager of killing a louisiana 
state trooper 
if they turn us down i dont think well have time for 
anything else said sam dalton the lawyer for dalton prejean 
prejean a twotime killer was sentenced to death 12 years ago 
for the 1977 murder of state trooper donald cleveland 
now 30 he has been on death row longer than any inmate in 
louisiana his case has been championed by death penalty opponents 
who say he should be spared because he is nearly retarded with an 
iq of 76 and because he was a teenager when cleveland was killed 
successful appeals have staved off 10 dates with the electric 
chair but dalton acknowledged he is not optimistic about chances 
for an 11th 
hopeful he said not optimistic 
gov buddy roemer reiterated tuesday that he will not intervene 
despite public protests 
ive reviewed this case personally now on two occasions 
roemer said with his killing in coldblooded murder a police 
officer the law is clear in louisiana he shall die from 
execution 
cleveland was killed after stopping a car in which prejean was a 
passenger for a broken taillight 
prejean acknowledges that he shot cleveland in the face 
but he maintains that he should be sentenced to life in jail 
not executed because he suffered emotional problems and brain 
damage from childhood 
the killing came shortly after prejean was released from a 
reform school where he served time for killing a cab driver when 
he was 14 
dalton said he asked the us supreme court for a stay this time 
on the basis of remarks by state supreme court justice james l 
dennis who dissented monday when that court refused to block the 
execution 
the court rejected 52 daltons argument that a psychiatric 
evaluation administered before prejeans 1978 trial was inadequate 
some justices saw it as rehashing an old issue but dennis said 
the appeal raised some questions that should be decided in court 
dalton said those questions include whether it would have 
affected the jurors if they had known prejean was braindamaged and 
consequently not totally responsible for his acts 
the us supreme court last summer rejected the argument that 
prejean should be spared because of his age at the time of the 
crime 
other appeals have been based on prejeans mental capacity his 
conviction by an allwhite jury prejean is black cleveland was 
white and the fact that the jury was not told he had been abused 
as a child 
the state pardon board has recommended that prejeans sentence 
be reduced to irrevocable life in prison

the chief justice of the united states called 
on congress tuesday to limit death penalty defendants to just two 
appeals one in their state court and one in the federal system 
there is no limit to such appeals now and generally each case 
sees several appeals filed in each court system 
as a result chief justice william h rehnquist said in an 
address to the american law institute the result is that at no 
point until a death sentence is actually carried out can it be said 
that litigation concerning the sentence has run its course the 
system at present verges on the chaotic 
a committee appointed by rehnquist last fall headed by retired 
supreme court justice lewis f powell recommended the twoappeal 
limit rehnquist sent the report directly to congress bypassing 
the us judicial conference the policymaking body for the 
federal courts he heads 
fourteen of the 27 members of the conference wrote congress to 
request hearings on the conferences recommendations which differ 
significantly from those of the powell committee 
civil liberties lawyers generally criticized the powell 
committee recommendations 
there are now more than 2200 prisoners under sentence of death 
around the united states during the 1980s there have been at most 
25 executions a year 
noting that the average time between sentencing and execution is 
seven or eight years rehnquist said the eight years is 
consumed not by structured review but in fits of frantic action 
followed by periods of inaction

a drunken driving defendant pulled a 
gun and shot a courtroom bailiff who tried to grab the weapon from 
him as he aimed it at a judge tuesday authorities said 
the shot hit two of the bailiffs fingers and grazed the face of 
the suspect but neither man suffered lifethreatening wounds said 
monroe county sheriffs spokeswoman becky herrin 
charges against peter anderson 22 of miami included attempted 
murder aggravated battery and bringing the weapon into a 
courtroom ms herrin said 
the trouble began as judge william ptomey conducted a traffic 
session in the small courtroom which was crowded with about 50 
people 
the judge called anderson on charges of drunken driving not 
having a valid drivers license and refusal to sign his citation 
anderson approached the podium and handed assistant state 
attorney leo bueno a dead white flower said ms herrin 
when the judge asked what the flower was for anderson replied 
that the charges against him were ridiculous ms herrin said 
ptomey ordered a bailiff to sit anderson in the jury box to allow 
him to cool down she said 
but as the bailiff approached anderson allegedly pulled a 
38caliber revolver from his waistband 
the judge yelled out a warning and bailiff ron dowmond 62 
walked up to anderson 
he grabbed the gun with his right hand and at that point the 
gun went off said ms herrin the bullet grazed his middle 
finger and entered and exited his index finder it also grazed the 
defendant on the left neck and cheek 
the bullet then hit a wall and bounced off a ceiling beam 
showering particles down and causing a considerable amount of 
confusion and panic she said 
a spectator ran to a sheriffs substation and deputies entered 
the courtroom and helped subdue anderson she said 
anderson was treated for superficial wounds and released to 
sheriffs deputies 
dowmond was taken to cedars hospital in miami for evaluation 
dowmond speaking later from his hospital bed said he got 
ahold of the gun and turned it away from the judge theres no 
doubt in my mind the judge was the target 
after the shooting sheriff allison defoor ordered that either 
physical searches or portable metal detectors be used to check 
people entering the building ms herrin said

said he would not post the bond and would serve the five months 
a january chancery court order prohibited fountain from 
operating the bethel childrens home here because he refused to 
submit to a new state law requiring registration of such 
institutions 
the law was adopted last year after a youth court ordered the 
state to take custody of bethels almost 100 juvenile residents 
because it had found several incidents of abuse and neglect 
on may 4 state officials again searched the 28acre church 
compound for illegally housed juveniles but found none the 
investigators believe fountain was tipped off and moved the youths 
that order to remove children was issued by youth court 
chancellor robert oswald after a 16yearold boy who ran away from 
the home testified that during his 13 days there fountain forced 
more than a dozen children to work nine or ten hours a day on 
various chores the teenager said he ran away because he was going 
to be beaten 
fountain disputed the accusations 
on tuesday fountain told oswald you are biased against 
bethel and the attorney generals staff who lobbied for passage of 
this law shouldnt be allowed to prosecute me under this law 
oswald said he has an obligation to uphold the law and 
appointed a lawyer for fountain although the minister said he did 
not want one

about 500 inmates at the maryland 
correctional institution returned voluntarily to their cells 
tuesday night after refusing to leave a courtyard during an 
eighthour standoff officials said 
greg shipley a corrections division spokesman said prisoners 
began returning to their cells shortly before 10 pm 
earlier state police who had been waiting outside the prison 
were seen entering the grounds about 9 pm shouts could be heard 
from prison cellblocks but activities inside the prison could not 
be confirmed 
the prison was locked down after about 500 inmates gathered in a 
yard during a recreation period and refused to return to their 
cells about at 2 pm said greg shipley a corrections division 
spokesman 
they are simply milling about in the middle of the 
courtyard shipley said earlier at this point we dont know 
what they want 
after a brief scuffle three guards were taken to a hospital for 
treatment of bruises and then returned to the prison he said

people conducting drug deals in their 
public housing units could lose their leases without being charged 
with a crime under a program housing secretary jack kemp unveiled 
tuesday 
a judicial order for forfeiture of assets is a very powerful 
weapon kemp told several hundred state and local drug war 
officials at a conference called by the office of national drug 
control policy it allows the public housing authority to take 
over the traffickers unit immediately 
kemps proposal was announced as officials elsewhere in the bush 
administration were readying a package of other antidrug measures 
to be sent to congress on wednesday 
a provision of that package would give the immigration and 
naturalization service greater authority to deport noncitizens 
without hearings 
duke austin chief spokesman for the service said it would add 
a small number of serious drug offenses such as trafficking or 
possession with intent to distribute to the list of serious crimes 
for which conviction can bring deportation without hearings 
those hearings and subsequent appeals can take two years 
the housing program which kemp said will start next month drew 
immediate criticism from the american civil liberties union 
kemp said it targeted serious drug traffickers because the 
standard of proof for a forfeiture order is evidence beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the apartment has been used for the 
commission of a drug felony 
congress specifically identified leases as forfeitable assets in 
the 1988 antidrug act said bud albright jr deputy general 
counsel for the department of housing and urban development 
the public housing asset forfeiture demonstration project to be 
launched by hud and the justice department and carried out by local 
housing authorities with local us attorneys will be conducted in 
23 cities nationwide kemp declined to identify them 
in addition kemp said hud is proposing new regulations for 
section 8 rent subsidies those he said will ensure that persons 
convicted of drugrelated or violent crimes and evicted from public 
housing will not be allowed to use section 8 vouchers for other 
rental property 
albright said the regulations should be sent to the office of 
management and budget on wednesday and should be published in the 
federal register next month 
the aclu said the proposal takes a solid principle of american 
jurisprudence which is that you are innocent until proven guilty 
and turns it on its head 
it suggests the government can punish people in advance of a 
conviction aclu spokeswoman colleen oconnor said 
it also discriminates against people who are poor and 
dependent on federal programs and turns a program designed to 
help people into a means of enforcing the drug laws she added 
albright said some individual public housing authorities already 
have seized leases from drug traffickers but the program announced 
by kemp will be a nationwide hit to raise the consciousness of 
drug dealers and of the public that this is something we can use 
and we intend to use

lawyers for 2 live crew produced a 
rhodes scholar and a music critic tuesday to support their claim 
that the rap groups millionselling recording isnt obscene just 
misunderstood 
us district judge jose gonzalez jr issued no ruling tuesday 
after a twoday hearing on a lawsuit by the group to have its 
sexually explicit album as nasty as they wanna be restored to 
broward county store shelves 
the judge did not indicate when he would rule lawyers for both 
sides said they expected it would be within a week 
expert witnesses for the miami group talked about musical 
cultural literary and political values to the album which 
gonzalez and the rest of a packed courtroom heard played in its 
entirety on monday 
john jolly representing broward county sheriff nick navarro and 
his department didnt put on any witnesses saying earlier that 
the groups album spoke for itself and was smut 
its got a good beat you can dance to it but you should give 
it a zero it has no value jolly told the judge in final 
arguments tuesday 
the rap groups attorney said those who may be offended by 2 
live crews music need to see it is a product of the inner city 
which is unfamiliar to the majority culture in the united states 
you have to see anything new and understand where it has come 
from and what it is attorney bruce rogow said in his closing 
arguments 
the rappers sued after a broward county circuit court judge 
found their album was probably obscene and a sheriffs detective 
visited stores around the county warning retailers they could be 
prosecuted for obscenity violations 
carlton long a rhodes scholar from gary ind spoke about 
africanamerican historical and cultural significance and political 
importance in the album which has drawn the criticism of gov bob 
martinez and authorities in several other florida counties and in 
other states 
the music is political simply in that you have a group of 
artists who are saying im going to express myself the way i 
express myself said long who said he will teach political 
science at columbia university this year 
long said he did a cultural analysis of the album at the groups 
request he detailed the cultural background in which making 
selfaggrandizing statements boasting about sexual prowess and 
trading insults are common he said people outside the culture 
should work to understand whats being expressed 
then you discover what theyre saying isnt all that 
dissimilar to what other people are saying long said 
he called the 2 live crew music one slice of the pie one 
aspect of black culture 
john leland music critic for newsday of new york testified 
about hiphop from which rap developed his descriptive 
testimony with his own sound effects such as 
boomboombahboom and wikkawikka drew laughter from the 
judge and spectators 
this is a new music leland said its difficult to 
explain in terms other than that i think its a whole new way of 
looking at music 
the groups use of profanity tells its audience the rappers 
are in leisure mode leland said 
the album as nasty as they wanna be has sold nearly 2 
million copies while sales of a toneddown version as clean as 
they wanna be lag far behind at about 300000

a judge tuesday told the first of comedian 
johnny carsons four wives that her petition to get more money out 
of the tonight show host has a little glitch in it she 
married another man after divorcing carson 
state supreme court justice phyllis gangeljacob noted that joan 
jody carson mother of the stars three sons was married to 
donald buckley an ad executive for about six years after she 
divorced carson 
carsons lawyer stanley arkin called the suit extortion 
and a baldfaced holdup he told the judge there is no basis 
for this lawsuit 
mrs carson who married the comic in 1949 and divorced him in 
1963 entered into a 1970 deal with carson in which he would pay 
her 13500 a year until 1999 whether she remarried or not 
that deal superseded an agreement that would have given her 15 
percent of carsons income for life unless she remarried 
mrs carson married buckley 15 days after signing the 1970 
agreement 
she says she cant live on 13500 and needs more 
i dont have enough money to buy a house mrs carson said 
even though she and her lawyer raoul felder admit she has almost 
400000 in the bank 
look at carsons other wives she said they have 
dresses that i see in the magazines that cost more than i earn in 
five years 
mrs carson who hasnt spoken to her first husband in more than 
30 years said she brought this action against him now because i 
may not be able to do this later when im really in need 
felder called carson an economic mugger who makes 40 
million a year and could easily afford the 120000 a year that his 
first wife is asking 
arkin said she is entitled to nothing more than the 13500 he 
noted that buckley now an antiques dealer gave mrs carson a lump 
sum of about 200000 in a divorce settlement 
felder questions whether his client was competent to understand 
and sign the 1970 agreement he pointed out in court that she had 
been in mental hospitals at least four times 
the judge asked felder whether support should survive 
remarriage she was remarrying three weeks later its a little 
glitch in the case 
felder never answered the question 
the judge reserved decision

engineers opened floodgates wider tuesday 
to release a record flow of water from a floodburdened reservoir 
and some downstream residents who had not already evacuated called 
for help 
parts of arkansas flooded since may 1 were declared a federal 
disaster area by president bush as national guardsmen labored to 
shore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the red 
river which continued its steady climb toward a 45year high 
in neighboring louisiana residents stacked sandbags around 
homes near the red river and some evacuated 
its bad said rep jim mccrery rla who toured the 
flooded regions its the worst flood weve had here in my 
lifetime 
elsewhere creeks and rivers rose sharply in western and central 
missouri including the kansas city area as thunderstorms 
continued to dump heavy rain throughout the region many streets 
were flooded and more rain was expected 
residents of lowlying areas along the trinity river in 
southeastern texas braced for the worst as engineers at lake 
livingston dam cranked open the taps to release a record flow of 
88000 cubic feet per second to protect the dam from a record 
flood releases of more than 20000 cfs cause at least some 
flooding below the dam 
the rivers crest was expected to reach the dam by wednesday 
and releases could reach 100000 cfs that day or thursday causing 
the worst flooding in 80 years in the small communities downstream 
lt gen henry hatch of the us army corps of engineers flew 
over the area tuesday and said the lake livingston dam appeared to 
be working as planned 
meanwhile gov bill clements asked federal officials to add 
four more texas counties to the 29 listed in a presidential 
disaster declaration issued earlier this month because of flooding 
and storm damage 
many residents of communities south of the dam heeded early 
warnings and moved to higher ground although there were last 
minute stragglers who called for help as water covered the roads 
out of their subdivisions 
they chose to stay now theyve become frightened and they 
want out said jim mitchum liberty county emergency management 
coordinator adding that people were helped by the early warnings 
flooding along the trinity began two weeks ago in the 
dallasfort worth area forcing hundreds of people from their homes 
the flooding and storms that caused the flooding killed 12 
people in texas and one in oklahoma and could cause up to 700 
million in agricultural damage in texas alone officials estimate 
in arkansas agencies differed on the numbers of houses affected 
by flooding on the arkansas and red rivers the state office of 
emergency services estimated 493 houses sustained some kind of 
flood damage said spokesman gary talley red cross spokesman david 
threkelsen said their count stood at 337 but that surveys were 
continuing 
the presidents disaster declaration makes federal funding 
available through the federal emergency management agency to 
supplement the recovery of residents and businesses in crawford 
faulkner jefferson little river perry pulaski and sebastian 
counties 
the disaster declaration was requested last week by gov bill 
clinton who renewed the requested tuesday saying devastating 
flooding unprecedented in recent history continues to this day 
clinton estimated that losses to public and private property 
will exceed 20 million 
sandbagging continued in earnest on a weakened levee protecting 
the town of garland ark from the red river said talley the 
river had crested in the area he said but it probably will be 
late wednesday before it receded 
national guard maj david lively said sandbagging along the red 
river could continue until the weekend 
if the levee breaks near an army corps of engineers command 
post at garland a town of about 600 people well have time to 
sound a horn and tell people to get out said lt bob page of the 
miller county sheriffs office 
in louisiana about 300 homes have been evacuated along the red 
river from shreveport southward as the river climbed toward a 
45year high 
emergency workers ringed homes with sandbags in a lowlying area 
of shreveport where the red was expected to crest wednesday at 
348 feet about 5 feet above flood stage that will be higher than 
a 1957 flood but not a record 
water is expected to cover 600 square miles including 200 
square miles of cropland said maj jack scherer of the corps of 
engineers in shreveport 
water continued to recede in southern and eastern oklahoma but 
additional localized flooding threatened an area of northern 
oklahoma after thunderstorms dumped more than 7 inches of rain 
overnight on elgin kan a small town just across the 
kansasoklahoma line 
that much water means some rises on some of the local creeks 
and rivers but its a situation where the rainfall is very 
localized so we really dont expect any widespread flooding 
said david andra of the national weather service in norman okla 
in mississippi the national weather service said the leaf and 
bowie rivers should drop below flood stage by wednesday allowing 
37 people who went to a red cross shelter monday at the university 
of southern mississippi sports arena at hattiesburg to return home 
hattiesburg received 797 inches of rain from saturday night 
through tuesday morning

a federal appeals court on tuesday lifted a 
lowercourt ban on construction of an observatory imposed out of 
fear for the survival of an endangered species of squirrel 
the order by the 9th us circuit court of appeals was praised 
by the university of arizona which wants to build the telescope 
one environmental group however said it would head to congress 
immediately to try to stop the project 
at 8 am washington time we go to congress and we ask them 
whether the endangered species act still exists said robin 
silver a phoenix physician and spokesman for the maricopa audubon 
society 
environmental groups have fought the construction on mount 
graham near safford in southeastern arizona contending it would 
lead to extinction of the mount graham red squirrel the university 
denies the project would harm the squirrel 
two house subcommittees have scheduled a hearing in washington 
june 26 on the observatory they are to consider environmental 
groups allegations that highlevel coercion was behind a report by 
us fish and wildlife service biologists which found no danger to 
the squirrels survival and led to congressional authorization for 
the project 
us district judge alfredo marquez cited those allegations and 
concerns about the red squirrel in explaining the 120day 
injunction against the observatory that he issued march 26 
but the appeals court panel judges jerome farris and harry 
pregerson said it did not appear that the evidence presented to 
marquez constituted new information that revealed effects of the 
proposed telescope project not previously considered by congress 
when it authorized the project 
as a result the panel said it appeared that opponents claims 
of violations of the endangered species act and another law the 
arizonaidaho conservation act do not raise a serious question 
the court lifted marquezs orders blocking construction 
specifying that marquez could reinstate the ban should subsequent 
proceedings reveal effects of the project not previously 
considered marquez has scheduled a hearing on the suit july 16 
were very pleased that the appellate court thought the 
project should proceed university of arizona spokesman steve 
emerine said in a statement well have to study the order to see 
exactly whats required of us we would hope to begin construction 
in perhaps four to six weeks 
the observatory dispute prompted recent comments by interior 
secretary manuel lujan that he saw no difference between various 
kinds of squirrels and thought the endangered species act was too 
strict president bush disavowed lujans suggestion for relaxation 
of the act

this sunday the stillgrowing cable industry 
will gather in atlanta home of ted turner and cnn to start the 
national cable television associations annual fourday convention 
but hovering over the usual convention exhibits panel 
discussions dealmaking and whoopee will be the specter of a 
possible return to federal regulation that cable systems largely 
shucked six years ago 
its a big concern for the industry says ncta president james 
p mooney one he thinks may not be fully warranted 
if there is action by congress or the federal communications 
commission he says increasingly im convinced that it will be 
modest in scope 
cable operators may particularly worry about a return to 
regulations giving cities power over the rates cable systems charge 
customers mooney says but he says he doubts either congress or 
the fcc will do anything that would hamper the continued growth of 
cable 
and says thomas s rogers president of nbc cable and business 
development its a good bet there wont be any bill enacted this 
year despite more than a dozen reregulation proposals pending in 
congress 
once just a means of getting a clear broadcast signal into 
homes cable now also is a programming giant and a collective rival 
of nbc abc and cbs nbc and abc themselves are active in cable 
notably nbcs new cnbc channel and abcs 80 percent ownership of 
the espn sports channel 
once a minor player on the tv scene cable now is in nearly 58 
percent of the nations 921 million homes with televisions 
according to nielsen estimates 
but with its growth has come criticism that includes consumer 
complaints to congress over increases that have occurred in cable 
rates since cable was broadly deregulated and cable systems 
generally allowed to set their own rates 
the ncta contends the worst is over 
mooney agrees noting that a general accounting office study 
shows that in the two years after deregulation began basic cable 
rates rose 29 percent and the overall customer bill went up 14 
percent 
but in the 14 years before deregulation cable rates lagged far 
behind the us consumer price index he says and cable wasnt 
allowed to develop as a programming medium because we didnt have 
the money to do it 
it has that now but consumer grumbles continue according to a 
wall street journalnbc poll in march it found that 62 percent of 
those surveyed generally like what their cable systems offer 
but 37 percent it said are dissatisfied with cables cost and 
question whether the rates are reasonable the survey of 1003 
registered voters had a 3 percent margin of error nbc says 
the rate issue provokes much of the capitol hill action yet 
its an enormously difficult one for congress to confront 
particularly given the policy reversal that it represents says 
nbcs rogers 
he refers to the 1984 cable deregulation act he helped draft as 
a staff member of a house telecommunications subcommittee 
two reports expected soon in washington may have some impact on 
the legislative front one due in july from the fcc concerns the 
state of the cable industry today and what if any changes are 
needed 
the other to come at the end of june from the gao is an update 
on cable rate increases 
what cable offers today is lightyears from what it was five 
years ago says kay koplovitz president of the usa network 
which says it serves 53 million homes now the question is can 
it stabilize without regulation and will it stabilize without 
regulation

war has broken out in the housing market and 
some innocent buyers and sellers are walking right onto the 
battlefield without knowing it 
while the alleged goal of the combatants is the right to serve 
homebuyers which they assert is a privilege a right and a duty 
the underlying reasons clearly involve their own selfinterest 
it began when real estate agents sought to offer computerized 
menus of mortgages and rates available in their areas and then seek 
a second fee for what they claimed was an additional service 
the mortgage bankers association of america whose members do 
not sell houses but who arrange financing for a fee usually paid 
by the lender say the practice is illegal that to accept a 
second fee was in effect a kickback 
the battle has now reached a rather bombastic level with the 
national association of realtors declaring the issue fullscale 
war and blaming the mba of publicly tossing about distortions 
red herrings and untruths 
some realtors seem to think the mba is also slurring their image 
as americans the realtor news quotes one as sayingthe mba is 
effectively telling you dont be americans dont be innovators 
dont be entrepreneurs 
according to the realtors the mba is trying desperately to 
wrap itself in the flag of proconsumerism and has succeeded 
in planting many articles in the general news media 
those articles it states allege that you and your fellow 
brokers and agents are ripping off the consuming public when you 
are compensated for services in addition to brokerage 
the mba has done a lot more it has been contacting federal 
lawmakers and state officials and has succeeded in enacting 
restrictions in connecticut illinois new york pennsylvania 
rhode island and virginia 
the mortgage bankers maintain that when real estate agents 
accept a fee for helping a homebuyer choose a mortgage they are 
violating the real estate settlement procedures act which outlaws 
referral fees and kickbacks 
the realtors are outraged that their actions should be tainted 
with such terminology as they see it they perform two services 
the first is finding a house for the buyer and the second is 
finding a mortgage for the buyer 
two different services two different fees they say adding 
that everyone prefers the high level of comfort accorded by 
onestop shopping 
just a minute say mba members what is this talk about a 
commitment to the buyer real estate agents they point out have a 
commitment to serve the seller who pays their commission are they 
claiming a dual commitment 
and by the way some add how does the buyer who pays the 
extra fee know that the agents commitment isnt to a particular 
lender instead of to him 
the cloud that hung over the department of housing and urban 
development has cast a shadow on the issue twice hud issued 
informal opinions saying it was permissable to charge the borrower 
an extra fee for extra services 
but it seems hud has issued no regulation as opposed to an 
opinion one limiting the practice was composed but never signed 
the mba says because outgoing hud secretary samuel pierce thought 
it should be left for incoming secretary jack kemp 
jacki grumbacher mba vice president for communications says 
war with the realtors is mainly in their minds the mba has not 
declared war she says and it is not out to deny the realtors or 
their customers anything 
our goal is just to get a stricter interpretation of the act 
on the books she says

a 29yearold eritrean battle for independence 
from ethiopia has become the longest war in africa and one of the 
worlds most obscure fought in a region where travel is difficult 
and dangerous an associated press correspondent spent nine days in 
eritrea this is his report 
</TEXT>

just south of this neat town built of 
rock and adobe are towers of sandstone boulders hundreds of feet 
high where the people take cover during daylight in case of 
bombing raids 
we cannot stay down there during the day said mariam 
teglest 32 a soldiers widow with three children it is much 
too dangerous when the planes fly 
she was speaking of sovietbuilt mig fighterbombers of the 
ethiopian air force which had bombed the town of about 20000 
people twice in a few months 
afabet is one of a dozen or so major towns in eritrea 
ethiopias northernmost province where rebels have fought for 
independence since 1961 rebel forces captured the town in 
february early in their biggest offensive of the war 
the conflict began 29 years ago as a small uprising by scattered 
guerrilla bands and has grown into a toetotoe slugging match by 
armies of thousands of soldiers armed with heavy artillery tanks 
and other modern weapons 
it is a war the eritreans appear on the verge of winning 
despite the ethiopian militarys total dominance of the sky and its 
vast superiority in manpower the government has a military force 
of about 320000 men largest in black africa 
the eritreans do not divulge the size of their army the 
international institute for strategic studies in london says 
30000 but some recent visitors to the region believe the true 
strength is double that or more 
in three decades the war has touched almost every part of this 
barren mountainous province the size of england 
afabet is tucked into a desert valley that evokes the american 
southwest here and elsewhere people hide by day and work by night 
in caves or camouflaged stone buildings and under the spreading 
branches of the ubiquitous african thorn tree 
weve created the worlds largest underground economy said 
haile menkerios a harvardeducated economist grinning at his play 
on words he is on the central committee of the rebel eritrea 
peoples liberation front 
weve learned not to expose ourselves he said with a sweep 
of the arm that covered hills dotted with cave mouths and stone 
huts almost undiscernible from a few yards 
eighty miles north of afabet is orota the main rebel base camp 
it sprawls through a deep narrow valley crosshatched by canyons 
and surrounded by rugged peaks so high the sun reaches in for only 
a few hours a day 
enemy planes fly into this maze at great peril 
orota is a supply and military training base site of a 
detention center for thousands of prisoners of war a civilian and 
an army hospital schools for children of soldiers manufacturing 
plants and repair shops for trucks tanks and other military 
vehicles 
the hospitals stretch for three miles down the main valley to 
reduce the threat from bombing wards and operating theaters are 
hidden in tents under thorn trees in caves and in nearly invisible 
buildings hewn from the same sandstone as the surrounding mountains 
i think frank lloyd wright would be proud of us said 
menkerios grinning again at his reference to the architect who 
believed buildings should harmonize with their natural surroundings 
a pharmaceutical factory hidden in caves makes everything from 
saline solutions to malaria pills and sanitary pads for women 
one in four rebel soldiers is a woman many of them commanders 
in an army with no ranks or sex discrimination 
everything in orota is powered by electrical generators most of 
which are cranked up only after sundown when the vast camp stirs 
to life 
sovietmade field telephones captured from the ethiopians 
connect the scattered complex they look like early edison models 
but they work 
nearly everything is captured scavenged donated or handmade by 
a people used to getting by on next to nothing this province on 
the red sea is one of the poorest in one of the worlds poorest 
nations 
nothing is thrown away artillery shell casings filled with sand 
and welded together form the supporting pillars of a new school 
disposable hypodermic syringes become light switches old tractor 
and truck tires are turned into wash troughs 
the eritreans claim that they do not have the support of foreign 
governments and that all their military hardware from tanks to 
kalashnikov assault rifles has been captured from the ethiopian 
army 
officials and some diplomats in addis ababa ethiopias capital 
say the eritreans have received arms and money from several arab 
countries around the red sea that oppose the sovietsupplied 
government of president mengistu haile mariam eritreas population 
is split about 5050 between moslems and christians 
a few reporters allowed behind rebel lines in recent months saw 
nothing but old and often battered sovietmade military equipment 
nothing in orota except the crowded hospitals suggests the huge 
battles being waged around asmara the eritrean capital a 16hour 
drive south over rutted trails even experienced drivers can lose in 
the dark 
on a roughly northsouth line running nearly 100 miles betweem 
asmara and the sea the rebels are fighting more than a third of 
ethiopias armed forces mostly conscripted and poorly trained 
young men 
at the beginning of their february offensive the rebels 
surrounded and cut off asmara including an estimated 1 million 
civilians and the governments 120000man 2nd revolutionary army 
three times since early april the 2nd army pushed eastward in 
an attempt to recapture its nearest outlet to safety the red sea 
port of massawa each time an eritrean force no more than half the 
size stopped it cold 
reporters who visited massawa in late april could hear the 
thunder of artillery and tank barrages day and night at the front 
40 miles away the fierce exchanges often made windows rattle 
the rebels claim they killed wounded or captured 30000 
ethiopian soldiers when they took massawa in a threeday battle in 
early february and have inflicted similar casualties along the 
ghinda front 
journalists who have seen the remains of massawa been guided 
near the front by the rebels and talked with deserters from 
mengistus army believe the numbers are not greatly exaggerated 
whatever the number of dead and wounded on either side the 
ethiopian 2nd armys inability to break out of asmara illustrates 
the rebels military prowess 
most of mengistus other forces are occupied far to the south in 
the neighboring provinces of tigre wollo and gonder with an 
uprising by the smaller tigre peoples liberation front 
the tigreans known to coordinate military moves with the 
eritreans have spent 15 years fighting to overthrow mengistu and 
establish a new national government 
eritrean fighters and their leaders predict the long war will 
end in a few months 
come back soon said asmellash abraha who was detached from 
other duties to play host to three visting journalists ill show 
you asmara i am anxious to see it myself its been a long long 
time since i was last there

president mengistu haile mariam 
who built a marxist regime on the ashes of a feudal empire he 
helped bring down in 1974 is a man with many problems and some 
predict a limited future 
his army has suffered battlefield setbacks in recent months 
particularly in the northernmost province of eritrea where rebels 
appear on the verge of winning a 29yearold war for independence 
another insurgent group swept out of its stronghold in tigre 
province just south of eritrea 10 months ago and has pressed its 
fight to overthrow mengistus government to within 50 miles of the 
capital 
the soviet union preoccupied with its own economic and 
political problems has threatened to close the tap that has poured 
billions of dollars worth of military hardware into ethiopia since 
1977 
mengistu spurned the united states and its western allies when 
he achieved power 13 years ago and they are in no hurry to improve 
relations 
major elements of mengistus own army attempted a coup last 
year he said in a recent speech he had survived nine assassination 
attempts 
with all those problems and burdened by a collapsing economy 
that has never been robust mengistu signaled a change of course 
two months ago from now on ethiopia will favor freemarket 
economics and welcome foreign investment he said 
giant posters of marx and lenin came down in addis ababa but 
those showing mengistu in various poses as a revered leader remain 
it looks like a deathbed conversion a western diplomat in 
addis ababa said on condition of anonymity if you believe that 
mengistu has had a true change of heart you probably also believe 
in the easter bunny 
mengistu joined other army officers in 1974 when he was a 
major in overthrowing emperor haile selassie three years later 
he reigned supreme 
he created the marxistleninist workers party of ethiopia in 
1984 in 1987 mengistu established the peoples democratic 
republic of ethiopia formally dropping his military rank of 
lieutenant colonel to become a civilian president 
ethiopia is ruled by a small group agreeable to mengistus every 
plan according to the memoirs of dawit wolde giorgis a former 
member of the party central committee who defected to the west 
dawit major human rights groups and other critics accuse 
mengistu of ordering or participating in the executions of dozens 
of rivals and of imprisoning thousands mengistu has denied the 
claims

peace talks aimed at ending nearly three 
decades of war between eritrean rebels and the ethiopian government 
are stalled and unlikely to resume 
preliminary discussions with former president jimmy carter as 
chairman began in atlanta last september and moved to nairobi the 
capital of kenya two months later 
negotiations in nairobi ended with the government and rebel 
delegations clearly at odds but agreeing to continue talks under 
the joint mediation of carter and julius nyerere former president 
of tanzania 
a third round was tentatively scheduled for early march in 
nairobi but foundered on a dispute over whether the united nations 
should send an observer 
eritrean rebels see un participation as de facto recognition 
of their movement which controls 80 percent of the eritrean 
countryside president mengistu haile mariams government opposes 
it for the same reason 
carter invited the united nations to take part on behalf of the 
rebels and said his offer was rejected 
rebel leaders said the invitation should have been sent jointly 
by them and the representatives of mengistus government and 
accused carter of doubledealing which the former president denied 
the issue will ultimately go to the united nations ali 
sayed abdalla foreign minister of the eritrean peoples liberation 
front said in an interview the un must guarantee any accord 
so why not agree to have it represented as an observer at the peace 
talks 
a western diplomat in addis ababa ethiopias capital said i 
see absolutely no chance for a resumption the military situation 
has changed radically since september and the government seems to 
be reeling i suspect the eplf feels it can stand pat on its 
demands

pope john paul ii watched with satisfaction 
as the democratic spirit triumphed over communism in eastern europe 
but the winds of change that swept the world which the pontiff 
so encouraged have made some roman catholics wonder when the 
revolution will touch their own church 
john paul for his part wonders what the winds blowing from the 
west hold for his newly liberated flock in the east it is a moment 
of great joy for the church and also poses new challenges 
critics like the rev hans kung the swiss theologian punished 
for his liberal views have said the triumph of prodemocracy 
movements in eastern europe left the vatican as a last bastion of 
totalitarianism 
several liberal catholic groups in the united states have drawn 
up a statement urging the pope to share his power the call to 
reform was signed by one bishop and some prominent theologians 
nuns and priests 
calls for drastic change are nothing new in the papacy of john 
paul a native of poland where open catholic dissent in the long 
communist era was unthinkable 
during a historic visit last month the pope hailed the strength 
of the faith in czechoslovakia which he said was deepened and 
purified by lengthy suffering he also warned of dangers 
inherent in renewed contacts with the west 
unfortunately not everything the west proposes as a 
theoretical vision or as a concrete life practice reflects gospel 
values john paul told his bishops he urged them to prepare 
immunizing defenses against such western viruses as 
secularism and hedonistic consumerism 
john paul who was 70 on may 18 is in the 11th year of his 
papacy and vatican insiders believe those hoping for radical 
reforms will be disappointed 
i dont feel such changes will happen under this pope a 
senior vatican official said invoking the usual ground rule of 
anonymity 
for example the congregation for the doctrine of the faith the 
guardian of doctrinal orthodoxy is preparing a document on the 
churchs moral teaching expected to be an answer to criticism from 
theologians 
much of such criticism has come in the past year from 
theologians in western europe concerned about the church ban on 
contraception and the popes exercise of power particularly his 
choice of bishops 
for the pope and vatican there is no contradiction in seeking 
democracy in civil society while not applying it to the church 
on his flight to the united states in 1987 a reporter told john 
paul some american catholics felt the church was not democratic 
enough 
the catholic church is not a democratic institution he 
replied it is an institution governed by jesus christ a 
theocratic one 
while the imperial trappings of the papacy have been removed 
popes are installed now not crowned john paul reminded 
brazilian bishops earlier this year that power in the church comes 
from above not below 
to the pope christian teaching has been entrusted to the church 
by christ to be accepted in its entirety he has said repeatedly 
that people who accept only what they want cannot consider 
themselves good catholics 
john paul is not responsible for the teachings most frequently 
criticized the ban on artificial birth control and divorce 
mandatory priestly celibacy and the prohibition on women in the 
priesthood but he has not tolerated dissent or doubts about them 
for him the reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s 
were the churchs revolution and now it is a matter of containing 
their excesses 
kung who has questioned papal infallibility the celibacy rule 
and other church teachings was stripped of his right to teach as 
an official catholic theologian in december 1979 little more than 
a year into john pauls reign pope paul vi who died in 1978 had 
merely warned kung 
in an interview with the swiss newspaper basler zeitung in 
december kung said the last diehards sit today in the vatican 
the last ones who have not yet realized that the world no longer 
tolerates authoritarian and totalitarian systems 
the new us statement published in march as an advertisement 
in the new york times said the church was crippled by its 
failure to address fundamental justice issues within its own 
structures among the signatories was emerson moore an auxiliary 
bishop in the new york archdiocese 
these are the voices from the west an important question for 
the pope is whether there will be voices of dissent from the east 
now that the churchs long trial under communism is over 
moving quickly to keep pace with the political changes john 
paul while in czechoslovakia called bishops from eastern and 
western europe to an unprecedented synod to be held next year

the little mermaid disney vhsbeta 2699 rated g 
 
the best video news these days is the availability of walt 
disneys the little mermaid for the home screen 
this rhapsody of animated excellence has been sharply 
transferred to video losing none of its richness and texture and 
its been priced at 2699 making it accessible to just about all 
families 
its a movie thats worth embracing dozens of times and youll 
want to add it to your video library based on the hans christian 
andersen story the musical is the first animated feature based on 
a fairy tale from walt disney pictures since sleeping beauty 
reached theaters on jan 29 1959 
no one does it like disney and disney truly does it best the 
drawings and backgrounds are full and brilliantly colored and 
tinted animation techniques incorporate the smallest and most 
insignificant nuance and detail breathing life to both the sea 
world creatures and the humans above 
the disney characters move not with the plodding awkwardness of 
cartoon creatures but with all the alacrity of live actors when 
the mermaid ariel moves through the sea there is an actual sense of 
water motion of flotation her ruby hair fans out as she bobs in 
place her tail eases through currents and actually propels 
sebastian the crab skitters sideways on tiny claws and shoots 
through the water with tiny legs moving like crazy

this set of videos based on the railway series by the rev

american children the stories are very british and entirely take 
place on the railroad tracks 
with ringo starr as narrator the stories include thomas gets 
tricked and james learns a lesson and feature live action 
animation there are moral messages galore about friendship 
believing in oneself and honesty all very good values for 
youngsters and oldsters as well but they are not presented in an

harlem nights paramount home video vhsbeta priced for 
rental market rated r 
 
paramount home video wisely priced this eddie murphy disaster 
for the rental market rather than for sales its hardly worth the 
low cost of rental let alone the 90 or so youd have to spend if 
it were for sale 
murphy who directed and wrote and was executive producer of 
harlem nights has set his movie in the perfect era for 
interesting characters situations music and nuances 1938 his 
cast includes some of the jewels of vaudeville film and 
television including richard pryor della reese redd foxx danny 
aiello and arsenio hall 
but the movie is largely uninteresting and a turn off 
the direction is tentative in spots the pacing is as slow as 
molasses and the dialogue when not peppered with obscenities is 
filled with lengthy explanations about what action the characters 
may or may not wish to take 
murphys writing is about as snappy as a sunday school lesson 
the constant obscenities become a distraction and an eventual 
turnoff and seem to be used when the writer and director cant 
invent something more creative 
surprisingly its not the two foulmouthed bad boys of comedy 
who steal the show pryor and murphy but the women reese is 
fierce as vera the madam at pryors club shes not just heavy 
shes huge and she literally swings her weight around as a 
cursing tough evil mama with a heart of gold 
and then theres sunshine lela rochon veras no 1 whore 
sunshines charms are so magnificent one character says she can 
make a man change his religion from catholic to baptist 
its worth suffering through this film just to catch rochon who 
has appeared in dozens of tv commercials and done guest stints on 
various sitcoms shes a natural beauty and a comedic joy who has 
some of judy hollidays timing and carole lombards sauciness 
shes an actress to watch in the future

womans day one of the seven major womens 
service magazines is being put up for sale so hachette sas us 
publishing business can trim its debt and concentrate on magazines 
with international potential 
the proposed sale comes amid sluggishness bordering on recession 
in the advertising environment for magazines that has been keenly 
felt at womans day the nations 10th largest magazine by 
circulation last year 
industry analysts said hachettes decision to abandon the 
fiercely competitive womens service segment illustrates the 
difficulty facing a company that owns only one title in competing 
against companies that each own two titles in the same category 
the new york times co hearst corp and meredith corp each own 
two of the socalled seven sisters publications 
hachettes diamandis communications inc said monday it has 
hired the investment banker veronis suhler amp associates inc to 
conduct an auction for womans day over the next several weeks 
circulation at womans day fell 155 percent to 47 million last 
year according to the audit bureau of circulations that knocked 
it to sixth from third place among the seven sisters leading only 
redbook at 39 million 
advertising pages were down at four of the seven magazines in 
the first quarter of the year with womans day suffering the 
deepest drop at 221 percent that was followed by a 191 percent 
decline at family circle according to publishers information 
bureau 
the decision to sell womans day which was founded in 1937 and 
is sold mainly at the supermarket checkout counter marks an abrupt 
reversal for hachette 
a year ago diamandis communications was reported to have been 
close to an agreement to purchase mccalls magazine another 
leading womens service magazine 
but mccalls was sold instead for a reported more than 80 
million to the new york times co which also publishes family 
circle 
hearst owns redbook and good housekeeping while meredith owns 
ladies home journal and better homes amp gardens 
hachette was finding it hard to compete on a standalone 
basis said peter appert who follows the media industry for cj 
lawrence morgan grenfell 
he said the other owners were able to attract advertisers by 
offering them package deals in both of their magazines in doing 
so he said owners of two magazines can often get more ad revenue 
overall than if the magazines were sold separately to advertisers 
richard kostyra who oversees evaluation of media for the ad 
agency j walter thompson said the womens service magazine field 
is one of the most competitive categories for attracting 
advertising 
these magazines are oftentimes viewed interchangably there is 
tremendous pressure on publishers to compete by offering ad rate 
discounts or other deals to advertisers he said 
early speculation about who might be interested in womans day 
included each of the current owners of womens magazines and bauer 
publishing co lp the german company that brought out first for 
women magazine last year 
in announcing the proposed sale peter diamandis president and 
chief executive of diamandis communications said the company wants 
to concentrate on creating or buying special interest magazines 
with an international appeal 
the company already publishes 18 special interest magazines 
including road amp track popular photography and boating it also 
publishes the fashion magazine elle which is published in 17 
countries 
didier guerin president of hachette publishing inc which 
oversees diamandis communications said womans day was not a good 
candidate for international expansion 
he said the magazine is very american because of the way it is 
sold supermarket checkout sales are not popular outside the 
united states he said

manufacturing employment may be on the decline 
nationwide but business leaders in illinois are struggling to 
attract people to highly skilled wellpaying jobs in the precision 
metalworking and plastics industries 
state business and government leaders launched a campaign monday 
to attract workers into the industries which need to fill an 
estimated 24000 jobs in illinois over the next five years 
businessmen say a shortage of young entrants to the labor 
market a lack of knowledge about the field and a stigma against 
manufacturing work are hampering efforts to fill the jobs 
the industry has had a chronic problem for many years in being 
able to attract and train skilled metal workers right now were 
finding the shortage is getting even more severe said bruce 
braker executive vice president of the chicagoarea tooling amp 
manufacturing association 
there simply are fewer young people coming into the labor 
market he explained the baby boomers are working right now 
weve got the birth dearth 
association members were joined monday by gov james r 
thompson who outlined a statewide effort to help the group attract 
and train the new workers 
of the estimated 24000 openings 8000 would be for skilled 
precision metalworkers and 16000 for machine tool setup and 
operating positions 
toolanddie makers and machinists create the tooling that 
makes possible mass production of products ranging from computers 
and satellites to automobiles and appliances thompson said in a 
statement 
the states departments of commerce and community affairs 
employment security and the board of education along with the 
mayors office of economic development will work with the 
association to recruit high school graduates and displaced workers 
into training programs operated by the association and community 
colleges 
precision metalworking jobs pay apprentices 15000 to 20000 a 
year and 25000 to 55000 with overtime for trained workers 
the work involves fabricating parts that fit precisely 
sometimes as accurately as within a micron or 40millionth of an 
inch braker explained 
braker said the group has created a special foundation to fund 
recruitment and training efforts he said between 1000 and 2000 
new workers are needed each year just to maintain overall 
employment but so far the group is graduating only about 200 
workers a year from its training program 
you cant become a toolanddie maker unless you can work with 
trigonometry and can read at the 11th or 12thgrade level he 
said 
precision metalworking has been primarily a white male industry 
braker said so the industry must seek to attract more females and 
minorities 
one problem he said is that upwardly mobile young people 
white and black usually want to go to college rather than into 
manufacturing 
theres a generally negative perception of working in 
manufacturing or with your hands braker said 
many young people think of a factory as a traditionally dirty 
noisy place to work thats not the way it is anymore these 
factories look like science laboratories

the gannett foundation said it has had 
numerous expressions of interest from potential buyers since 
announcing its intention to sell its 10 percent stake in gannett 
co inc 
the foundation disclosed april 25 that its trustees had voted to 
hire an investment banking firm to negotiate the possible sale of 
its 1594 million shares of stock in the media company 
on monday the foundation said it had hired salomon brothers 
inc for the job 
the foundations chairman retired gannett co boss allen h 
neuharth and its chief executive charles l overby repeated 
their preference for selling the stock to the company or to an 
employee stockoption plan 
but we have had numerous expressions of interest from other 
potential buyers and salomon will explore all of those they said 
in a statement 
in trading monday on the new york stock exchange gannett rose 
12 cents a share to 3862 making the foundations stake worth 
about 616 million 
the foundation is gannetts largest shareholder the proposed 
sale of the stake has raised questions about whether the newspaper 
outdoor advertising and broadcasting company has been put into play 
as a possible takeover target 
shortly after the april 25 announcement by the foundation 
gannett co said the company reaffirmed its continuing interest in 
buying back its stock subject to market prices and noted it could 
buy more than 45 million shares under an existing repurchase 
program 
but it added that the company had not by then decided whether it 
would be in a position to buy the stock being sold by the 
foundation 
a gannett spokeswoman said monday the company still had not 
determined whether it will be a buyer of the stock 
the foundation established in 1935 and separate from the media 
company said it was considering selling its stake because it had 
to seek higher income than paid by common stock dividends to meet 
the obligation imposed on foundations to pay out 5 percent of their 
assets annually 
gannett foundation based in arlington va had assets of 
nearly 650 million at the end of 1989 and spent 30 million on 
grants for journalism education adult literacy community projects 
and other philanthropic programs last year 
gannett co also based in arlington earned 3975 million or 
247 share on revenue of 352 billion in 1989 
it owns 83 daily newspapers including usa today and 52 nondaily 
publications 10 television stations 16 radio stations gannett 
news services and the largest outdoor advertising companmy in north

a federal investigator says greyhound engaged 
in unfair labor practices in the 10weekold drivers walkout a 
potential victory for the union because it could force the company 
to give the drivers their jobs back 
jerry hunter the general counsel for the national labor 
relations board authorized the boards regional office in 
milwaukee on monday to file an unfair labor practice complaint 
against greyhound sources said 
if the nlrb files the complaint and it is eventually upheld it 
could force greyhound to give back to union members the 3000 jobs 
that the company gave to strikebreakers since the walkout began 
march 2 
union president edward m strait said he considered hunters 
ruling a major victory because if upheld it protects the 
seniority of our drivers 
im so doggone happy i just hope that this will get the 
company back to the table and make them do some goodfaith 
bargaining strait said 
greyhound said it would appeal any such complaint and predicted 
it would eventually win the issue it noted that hunters ruling 
rejected a claim that the company had failed to bargain in good 
faith and instead focused on a more narrow issue 
the replacement drivers we have hired have permanent jobs 
that has not changed we are confident we will prevail and we 
will appeal all the way to the us supreme court should that be 
necessary said greyhound vice president anthony lannie 
hunter concluded that greyhound unlawfully put into effect 
certain bargaining proposals before an impasse was reached in 
negotiations said sources who demanded anonymity the decision was 
expected to be announced today 
both sides in the dispute which involves 6300 strikers who 
walked out over wages and job security filed unfair labor 
complaints with the nlrb 
while rejecting the unions contention that greyhound had 
engaged in overall badfaith bargaining hunter found merit with a 
union complaint over the illegal implementation of bargaining 
proposals before an impasse said the sources who declined to 
identify the proposals at issue 
the union also had complained it was illegal for greyhound to 
refuse to negotiate until a week passed without violence but 
hunter rejected the claim calling the stall legal under the 
circumstances there were dozens of shootings and bomb threats in 
the first several weeks of the strike 
the union lost on one front hunter asked the nlrb to seek an 
injunction against the union to stop alleged picket line misconduct 
and violence 
hunters decision could have a huge impact because under federal 
law it would make the greyhound dispute an unfair labor practice 
strike rather than a dispute over economic issues 
that is relevant because when a strike is determined to be an 
unfair labor practice dispute employers who hire permanent 
replacements must fill all jobs on a seniority basis essentially 
giving preference to union members who were employed there before 
the strike 
the victory is especially key in the greyhound dispute because 
the company just last week declared the strike over from a 
practical standpoint since it has hired about 3000 replacement 
drivers and said it can get by without union drivers 
the company offered the union only about 620 immediate jobs back 
an offer the union called an insult and vowed to give remaining 
jobs to replacement drivers if the union did not accept its offer 
for a fouryear wage freeze and eliminating 4500 union jobs 
that offer followed a company announcement that greyhound lost 
56 million in the first quarter of 1990

close of 15335 yen after opening at 15182 yen it ranged between

the dollar has declined 675 yen in five days its close today 
was its lowest since 15115 on march 9 
kozo yoshida a dealer with mitsui taiyo kobe bank said the 
yens strength was a reaction to its slide against the dollar 
over the past several weeks 
a couple of recent us economic indicators showing a slowdown 
in the american economy also contributed to dollarselling 
yoshida said 
further us indicators are to be released this week in 
washington they include the consumer price index and housing 
starts in april both to be announced on wednesday and the 
nations trade figures for march due out thursday 
yoshida said the dollars direction will become clearer after 
those reports

issues lost 4561 points or 014 percent closing at 3199704 
points the index started slightly lower but was up 7334 points 
at the end of the morning session 
it declined in the afternoon partly on profittaking said yu 
yoshida an equity analyst with yamaichi securities 
todays decline followed a 53051point gain on monday and a 
53188point gain friday 
the decline was a technical adjustment after a rise that the 
market considered too rapid said yoshida 
but he said the market environment remains favorable to 
investors with the yen stronger against the dollar and interest 
rates declining

major japanese newspapers published ads tuesday 
from texas oilman t boone pickens that accuse the countrys 
biggest automakers of colluding to keep consumer prices high and 
some shareholder dividends low 
pickens accused toyota motor co and its powerful advertising 
agency dentsu last week of attempting to block publication of the 
ads which contend that collusive business practices force higher 
prices on consumers toyota and dentsu denied the allegations 
the takeover strategist charged that toyota intervened because 
of his battle to exercise ownership rights in koito manufacturing 
co an auto lighting equipment maker close to toyota pickens is 
the largest stockholder in koito 
the asahi shimbun the nihon keizai shimbun and the yomiuri 
shimbun all major dailies published identical ads from pickens in 
their tuesday morning editions none of the ads which also blame 
japans big automakers for low returns to shareholders of auto 
parts companies mentioned any automaker by name 
pickens lawyer kanji ishizumi said the ad as originally 
submitted named toyota honda and nissan motor co as leaders of 
separate automobile keiretsu or business groups that force their 
auto parts makers to sell parts at low prices 
however ishizumi said he was forced to drop their names 
because it was the only way to get the ads published 
ishizumi said the fact that all three newspapers ran the same ad 
on the same day illustrates the degree to which the move was 
calculated after pickens made his charges public 
after media coverage of the issue the newspapers compromised 
and printed the ads ishizumi said 
pickens laywer said he was disappointed the newspapers did not 
comply with his request to run the ad on staggered days its 
like fireworks everyone will read the ad and forget about it at 
once he said 
the auto industry is booming but because of the keiretsu we 
believe auto parts makers are forced to sell their parts at 
inappropriately low prices to the makers the published ads said 
we think the automakers as a group damage the profits of 
auto parts makers and reduce the dividends of shareholders by 
beating down the prices of auto parts the ad said 
last week a representive of the yomiuri shimbun said the ad had 
been rejected twice but that the daily paper was considering using 
the ad if it dropped references to toyota and honda two of the 
newspapers biggest advertising clients 
the paper was concerned the ad might confuse consumers added 
ikuo terai of the yomiuris advertising department 
the nihon keizai shimbun denied five days ago that any 
representative of pickens had approached the paper to publish the 
ad 
pickens has said he tried to place the ads in an effort to 
motivate the japanese public to complain about how the big business 
cartels force higher prices on consumers 
the ad requests that japanese consumers with any information on 
unfair practices among carmakers to send it to pickens in 
dallas texas

chrysler corp will begin limited production of a 
twoseat highperformance dodge viper car that reportedly will 
rival the chevrolet corvette a chrysler source said today 
the source speaking on the condition of anonymity said an 
announcement that the no 3 automaker will begin production of the 
car in late 1991 would be made friday in los angeles 
such an announcement seems unusual for a company battling 
shrinking profits and market share and working to cut 15 billion 
from its standing costs by the end of this year 
the source declined to say where the car would be built but 
that all major components would be made by chrysler the price of 
the car will not be announced until just before it becomes 
available the source said 
the car will be powered by a v10 engine according to the 
source there have been reports that the car may carry a v8 but 
the source said a major aim of the viper project was development of 
the v10 originally conceived for truck use 
according to next mondays edition of autoweek magazine the 
v10 engine is capable of reaching 100 mph from a standing start in 
less than 10 seconds a corvette zr1 takes about 115 seconds 
according to a road test in road amp track magazine 
the announcement of vipers production will be during the last 
of a sixcity road show chrysler has been conducting since march 
the program is aimed at boosting interest in chrysler products and 
quality 
a concept version of the viper made its debut in january 1989 at 
the north american international auto show in detroit chrysler 
motors president robert lutz design vice president thomas gale and 
other executives have backed efforts to make viper 
gale said last year the viper was the first project to result 
from chryslers conceptual design and rendering system the 
computerdriven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time 
needed to bring a totally new car to market gale said

ibm said tuesday it would enhance its callpath 
software which links corporate phone systems with computer data 
bases so that the software will work with many brands of phone 
systems 
currently callpath only works with phone systems made by rolm 
the telephone equipment maker owned jointly by international 
business machines corp and siemens ag of west germany 
callpath allows a company such as a mail order house to link an 
incoming phone call from a customer with that customers records in 
the companys ibm computer the system displays the customers 
records on a computer screen in front of a customer service 
representative as the employee answers the phone 
callpath also allows a company to transfer both a telephone call 
from a customer and that customers computerized records from one 
employee to another such as from a customer service representative 
to a supervisor 
callpath works through corporate phone systems called private 
branch exchanges or pbxs 
ibm said two additional telephone equipment makers siemens and 
northern telecom inc have announced their pbxs will have the 
capability to be linked to the enhanced callpath 
ibm also said it has reached an agreement with american 
telephone amp telegraph co to work on making callpath compatibrgicenter 
said a clinic spokeswoman who 
declined to give her name 
there are similar legal challenges to operation rescue 
demonstrations at abortion clinics in other states 
at todays hearing before us district judge louis f 
oberdorfer eisenstein showed videotapes of three november 
demonstrations in an effort to prove that operation rescue project 
rescue and their leaders violated oberdorfers injunction 
now and planned parenthood name five individuals as defendants 
along with the two organizations only one clifford gannett was 
in court today 
eisenstein said he would present witnesses to show that gannett 
was active in the blockades nov 11 and nov 17 at the hillcress 
womens surgicenter and the washington surgi clinic in violation 
of the order 
eisenstein also said he would show that organization rescue 
which says it is in debt spent well in excess of 50000 and 
maybe well more than 100000 on the november operations 
he said that 1989 donations to the two organizations exceeded 
700000 and that they deposited more than 11 million in bank 
accounts 
the high court monday rejected an emergency request by operation 
rescue members who said the atlanta injunctin is violating their 
freespeech rights 
operation rescue spokesman bob jewitt called mondays action a 
little stumble along the way adding we feel well be 
victorious in the long run 
lynne randall who operates an atlanta clinic that has been a 
frequent target of the protests welcomed the action we have to 
balance womens right to privacy with peoples right to protest 
she said 
since july 1988 when atlanta hosted the democratic national 
convention city police have arrested 1320 demonstrators at 
operation rescue sitins many of the protesters barricaded 
abortion clinics blocking patients and employees from entering or 
leaving 
operation rescue members michael hirsch gina robertson william 
haynes steve britt and pamela sekulow said in the court appeal 
that the atlanta injunction deters them from engaging in prayer 
picketing leafleting and other forms of peaceful expression on 
public forum streets and sidewalks 
the state judge who issued the injunction is considering a 
request to modify it and a formal challenge to the injunction is 
before the georgia supreme court 
operation rescue founder randall terry who spent time in jail 
until a contempt of court fine for violating a similar injunction 
in new york was paid called mondays court action an outrage 
our rights are being denied because were prolife christians 
if we were homosexuals does anyone really think that we would be 
denied access to a public sidewalk terry said

a surge in the dow jones industrial average to a 
new record high is persuading many investors that the twoweekold 
stock market rally is far from over 
the optimism about stocks reflects a growing belief that 
inflation and interest rates are headed lower a sharp turnaround 
in sentiment from just last month 
you can almost hear the opinion change said john connolly 
head of the investment policy committee at dean witter reynolds 
inc money thats frozen out of this market wants to get in 
i think its a big bull market said michael metz managing 
director and investment strategist at oppenheimer amp co nobodys 
in the market everybodys underinvested 
the widely followed dow jones average of 30 bluechip industrial 
stocks rose 1995 monday to 282153 topping the previous record 
close of 281015 set on jan 2 
the dow average retreated about 3 points by noon today to the 
2818 level in what brokers called a brief respite from 
profittakers investors who cash in their stock to lock in a 
gain the average has risen by more than 170 points or about 7 
percent since april 27 
broader market indicators also advanced strongly monday and 
about two issues rose in price for every one that declined on the 
new york stock exchange 
the turnaround in sentiment has been so swift that many 
investors have missed the rally analysts said cautious 
individuals and institutional investors have built up big cash 
positions and they should propel stocks to new highs in coming 
weeks and months as they put that cash to work they said 
stock market activity had been very light and prices had traded 
within a modest range earlier this year because of concerns about 
prices and interest rates 
inflation ran at a rate of more than 8 percent in the first 
quarter the highest rate since the early 1980s and other 
indicators suggested the economy was growing at a toofast pace 
that would only worsen price pressures 
economic indicators for april released in the last two weeks 
have alleviated many of those concerns however the unemployment 
rate ticked up to 52 percent wages rose only modestly despite a 
hike in the minimum wage and prices at the wholesale level declined 
most economists believe the federal reserves policymaking body 
will leave its interest rate stance unchanged at its meeting today 
two weeks ago many analysts were predicting the fed would boost 
rates to combat inflation 
reflecting that belief interest rates kept falling monday after 
plunging on friday yields on longterm government bonds which 
topped 9 percent at the start of the month fell to 858 percent 
falling rates are seen as stimulating business activity which 
would be good for corporate profits and by reducing the returns on 
interestbearing investments lower rates can prompt investors to 
switch funds to the stock market 
high rates on safe shortterm debt instruments like treasury 
bills had been irresistible and kept many investors out of 
stocks metz said 
individual investors now have less than 20 percent of their 
funds in the stock market the lowest level in 20 years he said 
mutual funds also have been wary of stocks letting cash and 
shortterm debt securities rise to 12 percent of their portfolios 
the highest level since the 1982 bear market he said 
a slowdown in inflation and credit demand and an increase in 
savings should push rates on threemonth tbills down to 6 percent 
this summer from 787 percent monday metz predicted that should 
send money into stocks and drive the dow industrials toward 3000 
he added 
connolly said the dow could hit 3200 in the next year if the 
scenario of sluggish economic growth and slower inflation holds 
the upside for stocks could be even bigger he added if congress 
and the bush administration reach an agreement to cut the budget 
deficit significantly which should drive interest rates lower 
still 
stocks should gain even without a notable improvement in 
corporate earnings because the market today is driven mostly by the 
outlook for interest rates connolly said 
norm wolff technical market analyst at ag edwards amp sons 
inc in st louis said there is some resistance to further 
declines in bond yields which could hurt stocks also the stock 
market is likely to give up some of its gains in the next few days 
as investors take profits on the rally 
nevertheless the markets surge friday and monday was broadly 
based affecting smaller stocks as well as the big blue chips that 
started the rally wolff noted that bodes well for coming weeks 
he said 
as long as the breadth continues youve got to play it from 
the long side he said

sony corp the brains behind the ubiquitous 
walkman stereo said tuesday it will introduce an electronic 
book system that uses a palmsized player for reading books 
recorded on 3inch compact discs 
sonys data discman player has a screen that displays text 
recorded on cds called electronic books that each can store about 
100000 pages of text more than 300 paperback books sony 
officials said 
the purpose of this product is to create an entirely new 
market instead of having to go to a library or bookshelf for 
information people can have access to it anytime and anywhere 
said sunobu horigome head of sonys general audio group 
he said sony hopes the product will create a new culture and 
approach to information access with an impact similar to its 
walkman portable stereos 
if successful sonys reward could be big in two years the 
japanese market alone for cd information discs including the new 
cd books is expected to grow to about 26 billion according to 
hideo nishikawa general manager of new media development for the 
publishing house iwanami shoten 
sony said it plans to begin marketing the machine in japan on 
july 1 for about 380 overseas sales are expected to begin in less 
than a year after arrangements with local publishers are made 
officials said 
the data discman comes with a cd containing five different 
english and japaneselanguage dictionaries and can be plugged 
into a regular television screen to create a larger display users 
also can listen to regular 3inch audio cds with an earphone 
a small typewriterlike keyboard allows a user to select 
particular entries or portions of the text 
twentyeight japanese publishing companies have formed an 
electronic book committee that cooperated with sony in developing 
the format said nishikawa 
eighteen cd electronic book titles will be released at the same 
time as the data discman titles will include reference books and 
guides to medicine movies travel and entertainment he said 
electronic books are likely to cost an average 20 to 33 
nishikawa said 
novels are certainly possible but the question is how 
successful they will be because of the small screen a sony 
official said the screen can display only 10 lines at a time but 
can be scrolled up or down 
both the cds and player will be sold through regular bookstores 
the players builtin software allows it to display indexes and 
quickly find particular portions of the text 
in an electronic book containing thousands of song lyrics for 
example it can search for those from different time periods or 
with different styles or those with particular themes or words in 
their titles 
other companies also will be able to obtain licenses to produce 
electronic books and players sony officials said 
compact discs use digital codes to record information ranging 
from music to computer programs or databases those that contain 
data used by computers are called cdrom or cd read only memory 
because they generally cannot be altered or rerecorded 
the electronic books use a technical standard similar to cdrom 
sony officials said

president bush and leaders of congress began 
negotiations today aimed at finding a way to break a political 
deadlock over next years federal deficit 
bush vice president dan quayle and top administration 
officials were joined by congressional leaders of both parties in 
the white house cabinet room they sat at a long table adorned with 
plates of pastries but answered no questions about where their 
talks would head 
earlier in the day house majority leader richard gephardt who 
heads democratic participants in the negotiations predicted the 
talks will fail if participants use them to seek political gains 
if everybody tries to politicize this nothing will be 
accomplished said gephardt dmo 
he spoke several hours before bush and congressional leaders 
were to begin negotiations over next years 12 trillion spending 
plan 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that while 
president bush would not put forth any administration proposals at 
todays opening session well make proposals in later meetings 
fitzwater called the summit a feet on the floor and hands on 
the table session 
and reiterating administration assertions that nothing was off 
the bargaining table fitzwater told reporters no preconditions 
no preconditions no preconditions 
many democrats have said they want bush to lead the way in 
proposing any eletionyear taxes or spending cuts 
we have one goal gephardt said thats to do this as fast 
as we can and see if any good can result for the fiscal policy of 
this country 
the goal is to shrink next years federal deficit a task the 
administration says means coming up with 50 billion or more in 
savings fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 
stung by the tax and spend label president reagan attached 
to them in the 1980s democrats say they want bush to detail the 
size of the deficit problem and to lay out his suggested solutions 
they point out that in the 1991 budget he proposed in january he 
put the needed savings at 36 billion 
democrats promised monday that little will happen at the talks 
until the president describes why the problem has worsened they 
also demanded that bush help build congressional support by 
explaining to the public why unpopular painful measures may be 
necessary 
i want to hear what more do we need why do we need it and 
what are the choices the president will accept said rep william 
h gray iii dpa the no 3 house democrat and one of the 
negotiators failure to say those things will mean a deadlocked 
summit 
if those things are only said within the closed door of the 
summit i think that means a failure to put together a meaningful 
package because we wont be able to pass it gray said 
white house officials said bush had no plans to lay out his own 
ideas about reducing the deficit 
hell have general goals about getting the deficit down 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
republicans say they will focus on spending cuts as a way to 
reduce the budget gap they are particularly concerned about 
benefit programs referred to as entitlements such as medicare 
and federal employee retirement payments which account for about 
half of all federal spending each year 
they also want to tighten the budget law to ensure that any 
spending cuts end up as savings and are not simply transferred to 
other programs 
whatever we agree upon expenditure reductions entitlement 
reforms revenues you have to be able to say they wont be spent 
but they have to go as designed to deficit reduction said sen 
pete domenici of new mexico the ranking republican on the senate 
budget committee and one of the bargainers 
democrats will focus more on cutting the defense budget 
as for taxes members of both parties say they will wait for the 
other side to bring them up 
if there are going to be revenues theyll have to propose 
them said sen james sasser dtenn the senate budget 
committee chairman and another negotiator 
the talks were announced last week with both sides saying all 
options were negotiable this represented a departure from bushs 
1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes 
democrats began worrying that they might be heading toward a 
trap however after white house chief of staff john sununu said 
last wednesday that the president would never seriously consider 
tax increases the white house quickly disavowed sununus comment 
but democratic feelings have remained bruised 
one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said budget director richard darman would explain why the 
administration feels the deficit has taken a turn for the worse 
the reasons include the growing costs of the savings and loan 
industry bailout fears of higher interest rates and tax 
collections that have been lower than projected 
after that the official said opening statements and other 
preliminary remarks could last until next week there will be 21 
congressional negotiators and four administration bargainers not 
including bush 
administration officials and lawmakers have said the talks could 
last weeks or months 
the grammrudman budgetbalancing law requires a deficit of no 
more than 64 billion next year

the farm credit system said tuesday its net 
income rose 85 percent in the first quarter reflecting the 
retirement of highercost debt and continued improvement in the 
quality of its loan portfolio 
the system said it earned 191 million in the three months ended 
march 31 compared with 176 million a year earlier 
the farm credit system is a nationwide network of 
federallychartered agricultural lending institutions that are 
cooperatively owned by their borrowers the system is the biggest 
lender to the nations farms

president and chief executive of the federal farm credit banks 
funding corp the systems financing arm 
the system said its net interest income rose to 321 million in 
the latest quarter from 239 million in the same period a year ago 
the rise stemmed mainly from the retirement of highercost debt 
that matured over the past year the system said 
in addition it said the improvement reflected higher credit 
quality of the loan portfolio reflected mainly by a reduction in 
nonaccrual loans to 251 billion on march 31 from 255 billion on 
dec 31 
loans placed on nonaccrual status are accounted for only as 
payments are made rather than when they are due

corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply 
lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade leading a general 
decline that reflected profittaking and aggressive liquidation of 
bullish positions analysts said 
the drop in soybean prices extended losses that now total about 
35 cents a bushel since thursday in the contract for may delivery 
the soybean selloff began friday after the agriculture 
department released a higherthanexpected 1990 soybean crop 
estimate 
the corn market posted its steepest oneday decline this year 
after recently advancing amid concerns about raindelayed planting 
activity 
the sudden drop in crop futures may have been linked to market 
talk of turmoil in the soviet union and fears of a change in soviet 
leadership that could potentially reduce grain sales to moscow 
the memphisbased analytical firm sparks commodities inc 
released new projections of corn and soybean plantings tuesday the 
soybean estimate of 589 million acres was below the usdas latest 
forecast of 594 million while sparks corn estimate of 755 
million acres was above the usdas projection of 748 million 
the sparks numbers were bullish on beans and bearish on corn 
but thats not the way the market acted said john frazier 
director of agricultural commodities trading for gerald inc in 
chicago 
at the close wheat futres were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 383 a bushel corn was 4 cents 
to 6 cents lower with may at 284 a bushel oats were 1 cents 
lower to cent higher with may at 155 a bushel soybeans were 8 
cents to 11 cents lower with may at 613 a bushel

chrysler corp has decided to produce its 
proposed viper sports car featuring a 10cylinder engine a source 
said tuesday a move apparently designed to polish the image of the 
struggling carmaker 
the dodge viper equipped with an engine originally designed for 
truck use will go into extremely lowvolume production late next 
year for the 1992 model year said a company source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
anything that shows people that dodge is back in the 
performance business is good news said david slone general 
sales manager of lynn hickey dodge in oklahoma city 
a viper prototype was introduced last year at an annual auto 
show in detroit and drew huge crowds the twoseat convertible is a 
throwback to the era of sleek muscular sports cars with few 
electronic gadgets 
the prototype has been part of a sixcity tour this spring 
during which chrysler executives have touted the quality of the 
companys vehicles comparing them favorably with those made by 
japanese automakers 
the tour winds up friday in los angeles where chrysler chairman 
lee iacocca is expected to announce that the viper will go into 
production 
such an announcement would come as chrysler car sales and 
profits slip and as the company struggles to carve 15 billion 
from its annual 26 billion budget 
the cost of the viper project hasnt been pinpointed despite 
that expense at a time when the company is trimming back analysts 
and dealers on tuesday were enthusiastic about the project not 
only because of the exotic nature of the car but because of the 
traffic it can draw to dealerships 
slone said he already has noticed an increase in traffic through 
his showroom just because of media attention the viper has received 
weve had people wanting to put deposits down on it he said 
the cars price wont be announced until just before it hits the 
showrooms autoweek magazine said it could be in the 40000 range 
the viper would be entering the exotic sportscar market 
broadly comprised of the corvette zr1 some bmws and porsches 
no firm performance statistics were available but autoweek 
magazine reported that with the v10 engine the viper could go 
from a standing start to 100 mph in less than 10 seconds the zr1 
the hottest corvette ever takes 115 seconds to get to 100 mph 
according to a road amp track magazine road test 
there is an enthusiasts market out there said auto analyst 
mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc in new york i 
think there is room in the market for it viper i think the hot 
cars carry fairly nice profit margins and you wouldnt have to 
put an incentive on them 
i think it will make people sit up and notice chrysler even 
though there arent many vipers around its what they can do in 
styling and performance 
the prototype has distinctive door panels with chromeplated 
exhaust pipes running below them a spy photo appearing in the june 
issue of car and driver magazine shows a viper without the 
sidemounted pipes 
the source said all major components of the car would be made by 
chrysler the source declined to reveal the final assembly site 
but said it would be an existing chrysler factory 
production figures werent available but it could be as low as 
a few hundred a year by contrast general motors corp sold about 
24000 corvettes last year before the introduction of the zr1 
model 
chrysler has said that the viper was the first project to result 
from the carmakers conceptual design and rendering system the 
computerdriven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time 
needed to bring a totally new car to market chrysler officials 
said

optimism over lower interest rates which would makes stocks a more 
attractive investment 
the stock markets rally in the last two weeks has been 
attributed to evidence that inflation is easing which has sent 
interest rates plunging the market also has been bolstered by the 
perception that the bush administration and congress are willing to 
negotiate to reduce the nations budget deficit

some uncertainty about the pending reunification with east germany

soybean futures prices fell sharply tuesday for the third 
straight day amid profittaking and speculative fundselling 
prompted in part by signs that brazilian soybean exports are 
closing the gap between world supply and demand 
on other commodity markets grain futures fell cocoa futures 
retreated oil futures were mixed precious metals were mixed and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
soybean futures settled 8 cents to 11 cents lower on the 
chicago board of trade with the contract for delivery in may down 
10 cents at 613 a bushel 
the decline extended to about 35 cents the drop in the may 
soybean contracts price since thursday when the agriculture 
department released a report projecting rising us soybean stocks 
some analysts attributed the weakness to increased soybean 
exports especially from brazil the worlds secondlargest 
producer after the united states 
brazilian shipments have risen in the past 10 days after a 
monthlong period in which exports of newly harvested soybeans were 
stalled by confusion over president fernando collor de mellos 
harsh economic reforms 
usda figures released monday showed inspections of us soybeans 
earmarked for export last week were up nearly 20 percent over a 
year ago 
the soybean rally of the past three months was a case where 
shipments around the world did not equal demand requirements 
said mickey luth an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
now until you create a deficit problem again youve lost 
your support for the market he said 
william biedermann research director for the brokerage firm 
allendale inc also said the supply picture has improved 
there are 14 vessels en route from south america right now 
he said the reality of those supplies hitting world markets is 
causing users to back off and pull their bids 
corn futures posted their steepest oneday decline this year 
after recently advancing on concerns about raindelayed planting 
activity 
biedermann said there is a growing belief among grain traders 
that the soviet union does not intend to buy any more oldcrop us 
corn a bearish factor in the market tuesday 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 2 cents lower in chicago with 
the contract for delivery in may at 383 a bushel corn was 4 
cents to 6 cents lower with may at 284 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to cent higher with may at 156 a bushel 
cocoa futures settled mostly lower on new yorks coffee sugar 
and cocoa exchange amid profittaking after mondays dramatic gains 
cocoa settled 14 lower to 6 higher with may at 1375 per ton 
crude and heatingoil futures fell slightly tuesday on the new 
york mercantile exchange weakened by speculators cashing in the 
markets gains 
gasoline futures strengthened because of impending higher demand 
from summer vacationers analysts said 
after the close the american petroleum institute released its 
weekly stocks report which showed an unexpected increase of 43 
million barrels in us crudeoil stocks and an unexpected decline 
of 42 million barrels of gasoline distillate stocks were down 
66000 barrels which was within market expectations 
crudeoil futures settled 12 cents lower to 7 cents higher with

a polish bank on tuesday sought to place a 
drexel burnham lambert financing subsidiary into involuntary 
bankruptcy proceedings for failing to pay back a 5 million loan 
the move came one day after yugoslavias central bank sued the 
collapsed wall street firm for more than 70 million in investment 
losses it claims were part a scheme to funnel money into drexels 
parent company 
the parent drexel burnham lambert group inc filed for chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection from creditors in february after failing 
to meet debt payments due to a weakening financial condition 
following its securities fraud guilty plea 
in a petition filed tuesday in us bankruptcy court bank 
polska kasa opieki asked a judge to assign a trustee to liquidate 
drexel burnham trade finance inc a drexel spokesman said the firm 
would exercise its right to convert the case from a chapter 7 
liquidation to a chapter 11 case where the debtor would continue 
managing the company 
dbl trade finance is the second drexel unit creditors have 
tossed into bankruptcy court alongside the parent company 
indicating frustration with progress in resolving payments to 
creditors 
the unit has assets of 88 million and liabilities of 94 
million 
jon arnason an attorney for bank polska said it is owed 5 
million plus 76000 in interest from a 30day loan placed with one 
of drexels european entities in december the money was due feb 
20 
other creditors include the national bank of poland which the 
petition said is owed 12 million and a drexel subsidiary in 
britain said to be owed 28 million 
the subsidiary is owed 28 million from the parent company and 
205 million from drexel burnham lambert trading inc a 
commodities trading unit now in chapter 11 proceedings according 
to the filing 
dbl trade finance engaged in foreign currency trading and 
handled loans in connection with commoditiesbased transactions 
separately the national bank of yugoslavia charged that drexel 
failed to disclose that it used money borrowed from that nation 
last year to help raise cash for drexels parent company 
the central bank claims it lost about 71 million in the scheme 
more than 1 percent of the countrys federal budget it is 
seeking to recover the losses plus 10 million in punitive damages 
we dispute the premise of the complaint but beyond that we 
dont have any comment drexel said in a statement 
the yugoslavian bank was one of four large unsecured creditors 
that last week pushed dbl trading into involuntary bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the bank claims drexel failed to disclose its intended use of 
the borrowed money as well as information about the parent 
companys deteriorating financial condition 
it claims that yugoslavian law requires the bank to make 
safety the primary concern for investing its reserves it said 
investments are restricted to the 100 largest commerical banks 
worldwide and highquality debt securities issued or guaranteed by 
developed nations 
the bank said it had never before lost money in an investment 
transaction 
according to the lawsuit filed late monday in us district 
court in manhattan drexel contacted central bank officials last 
june to discuss investing some of its funds the bank said it had 
not done business with drexel previously 
the bank said it bought a total of 80 million in time deposit 
investments in us dollars and west german marks in september and 
rolled them over in december the investments were placed in banks 
in the name of the commodities trading unit 
the lawsuit states that drexel did not invest the money as 
required but instead transferred it to the parent company the bank 
claims drexel never informed it how it was investing the money 
on feb 13 when drexels parent filed for chapter 11 it sent a 
telex to the yugoslavian bank saying we have been trying to 
reach you urgently our parent company has some liquidity problems 
which we would like to explain to you over the telephone 
when it made the bankruptcy filing drexels parent owed its 
commodities unit 645 million the yugoslavian bank claims its 
investments were part of money upstreamed from the commodities 
unit to drexels parent

miller brewing co said tuesday it will test a 
new barleyonly beer in four markets under a strategy to grab a 
bigger share of the shrinking market for superpremium beers 
the allmalt beer to be called miller reserve will be tested 
in rhode island connecticut richmond va and atlanta starting 
wednesday miller spokesman david fogelson said 
in brewing the product with only barley and no corn or other 
grain fillers the company is using the same approach as for some 
products made by smaller breweries that have grown rapidly in 
recent years 
miller reserve is brewed using a coldfiltered process in which 
contaminants are removed from the beer using a filtration system 
rather than heat pasteurization 
in miller reserve weve brought back the tradition of an 
allbarley beer and gone a step further by using our unique 
draftbrewing process said david krishock new products category 
director for the milwaukeebased brewery 
as light beers have continued growing in popularity the market 
share held by superpremium and import beers has slipped markedly in 
recent years miller hopes miller reserve will seize a portion of 
the shrinking market which averages about 16 million to 18 million 
barrels a year 
miller reserve is being brewed and shipped from the miller 
brewery at eden nc 
milwaukeebased frankenberry laughlin amp constable is to handle 
advertising for the brand the beer packaging includes a 20sided 
bottle and a sixpack carrier with high sides miller said

the dollar opened lower against the yen wednesday 
morning while share prices eased slightly on the tokyo stock 
exchange 
the dollar started trading at 15090 yen down 040 yen from 
tuesdays 15130yen close the dollar has declined 675 yen over 
the previous five sessions 
dealers said the dollars lower opening followed its overnight 
decline in new york where the currency closed at 15083 yen down 
from 15250 yen monday 
after its lower opening the dollar has been moving narrowly 
and it is unlikely to fall as low as 150 yen because some market 
players are buying back the currency whenever it moves lower 
said toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan 
securities co 
the 150yen level is a major psychological barrier for many 
investors so trading is likely to be mixed before the market 
establishes a firm direction kanai said 
he said the majority of participants were sitting on the 
sidelines ahead of the release wednesday in washington of april 
us consumer prices and thursday of march trade data the reports 
are expected to provide further indications of the direction of the 
us economy and interest rates 
the 225share nikkei stock average slipped 157 points or 005 
percent to 3198134 in the first 30 minutes of morning trading 
the nikkei lost 4561 points tuesday 
traders said the index fell in a continued reaction to the rapid 
increases posted last week 
the price of the benchmark no 119 10year japanese government 
bond fell to 8818 from tuesdays close at 8863 that boosted the

us agencies have announced the creation of a 
500 million aid pool to help promote sales by american business in 
the far east against governmentsubsidized competition from japan 
france and britain 
the money initially will go largely for loans to indonesia 
pakistan the philippines and thailand the us agency for 
international development said tuesday 
aid will provide 100 million of the money from its economic 
support fund most of which goes to israel and egypt 
the program will be limited to markets where other governments 
already are engaging in extensive tradedistorting tiedaid 
finance activities aid said in a statement 
tied aid typically requires a third world country to spend 
the aid on products made in the donor country tied aid usually 
takes the form of a loan at a low rate of interest subsidized by 
the donor government 
jeni falkiewicz of the us exportimport bank which also is 
contributing to the aid pool said the money would help businesses 
compete especially against tied aid provided by japan france and 
britain 
successive us governments have opposed tied aid because 
american businesses say its often prevents them from getting 
lucrative contracts overseas us negotiators have failed to win 
agreements outlawing tied aid though 
last week john d macomber president of the exportimport bank 
said he would try to get tied aid outlawed for some categories of 
products including power plants and communications system 
aid said the new pool will support projects in 
telecommunications transportation power and construction 
equipment projects helped by the pool will meet aid criteria and 
will be in line with the priorities of the recipient country aid 
said none of the money will come from its funds marked for 
development assistance 
aid has cooperated with the exim bank on some projects but the 
new pool is the first largescale effort of its kind its formation 
follows statements in congress suggesting that the united states 
reconsider its aid programs to take into account its impact on 
american businesses and jobs 
in addition to the 100 million from aid the exportimport bank 
will provide guarantees on 300 million worth of loans from private 
banks the guarantees enable banks to charge borrowing countries 
lower rates of interest 
the bank also will contribute 100 million from its tiedaid 
credit fund this is usually called the war chest used to 
match offers of tied aid from competing governments the bush 
administration has asked for another 114 million for this fund 
many members of congress would like to appropriate more one 
bill recently introduced would add 1 billion

a japanese gallery bought vincent van goghs 
portrait of dr gachet for 825 million tuesday a record 
auction price for any art work and double the price estimated by 
christies a spokeswoman for the auction house said 
this is by far the worlds most expensive painting 
surpassing the 539 million price bid for van goghs irises in 
november 1987 at sothebys auction house christies spokeswoman 
susan britman said 
the buyer a representative for the kobayashi gallery in tokyo 
was in the room during the approximately 10 minutes of bidding that 
opened at 20 million britman said toward the end of bidding 
only the kobayshi representative and a telephone bidder whose 
identity wasnt disclosed were vying for the painting she said 
portrait of dr gachet an image of the physician who tended 
van gogh during the last weeks before his suicide was painted 100 
years ago 
it had been expected to fetch between 40 million and 50 
million at a sale of major works by impressionist and modern 
artists 
the auction has been anticipated as a key test of the strength 
of the art market prices boomed in the mid to late 1980s but the 
1987 stock market crash and unusual circumstances surrounding the 
sale of irises had cast doubt on whether prices would continue 
to rise 
australian entrepreneur alan bond bought irises largely with 
money borrowed from sothebys the house that handled the auction 
bonds business empire became swamped in debt after the stock 
market crash and he was forced to sell the painting for an 
undisclosed price to the j paul getty museum in march 
dr gachet was lent to the metropolitan museum of art in 
1984 it is from the collection of siegfried kramarsky a 
germanborn new york banker who died in 1961 it was put on the 
block by a trust created under his will 
the portrait of dr paulferdinand gachet was painted six weeks 
before van gogh committed suicide in 1890 
in a letter to artist paul gauguin van gogh wrote that he had 
painted gachet with the heartbroken expression of our time and 
that it was not destined to be understood 
gachet a practitioner of homeopathic medicine was van goghs 
friend and physician he was also close to other impressionist 
painters of the time 
in the painting gachet is shown seated at a table head in hand 
van gogh painted a second slightly larger version of the 
portrait which hangs in the musee dorsay in paris it lacks the 
details of the kramarsky painting and its colors are flatter 
another van gogh from the kramarsky collection was auctioned in 
1987 for 2024 million it too had been lent to the metropolitan

two judges supervising hundreds of asbestos 
damage cases said they might seek to reopen the bankruptcy 
proceeding of the manville corp a newspaper reported 
the judges also suggested that the multibillion dollar trust set 
up by manville to compensate victims of asbestosrelated diseases 
had been mismanaged the new york times reported in wednesdays 
paper 
at a hearing tuesday federal district judge jack b weinstein 
and state supreme court justice helen e freedman ordered the 
manville personal injury settlement trust to explain why it had 
been depleted of cash so soon and why it recently decided that tens 
of thousands of asbestos victims many with fatal diseases would 
not be compensated until well beyond the year 2000 the newspaper 
said 
representatives for other asbestos companies named in lawsuits 
and lawyers for some plaintiffs have said that hundreds of millions 
of dollars were paid as fees to only a handful of plaintiffs 
lawyers helping to create the cash shortage the times said 
the two judges said they might seek to have the bankruptcy plan 
amended so manville which won protection from lawsuits in exchange 
for establishing the trust could lose that protection they also 
said the corporation might be forced to contribute more money to 
the trust 
in a veiled reference to the management of the trust the times 
said the judges reminded one of the trusts lawyers that they had 
the authority to seize the trusts assets and appoint a receiver 
as of march 31 the times said the 25 billion trust had 
received about 152000 claims it has made payments or promised to 
pay more than 935 million to settle 22204 claims the newspaper 
said 
lawyers involved in the manville bankruptcy and litigation said 
more than 200 million had been disbursed to fewer than three dozen 
lawyers who represent plaintiffs the times said 
last month trust lawyers filed bankruptcy papers saying that an 
asbestos plaintiff who filed a claim now would receive 40 percent 
of the claim in 2015 and the remaining 60 percent in 2020 payments 
would be without interest 
the judges gave the trust until june 1 to respond to their 
questions and hinted they would take action then the times said
