a nearly monolithic black vote and almost 10 
percent of the white vote gave jesse jackson a super super tuesday 
while sen albert gore jrs tennessee roots helped him in the 
south exit polls said 
enormous support for the reagan administration fueled george 
bushs sweep powering the vice president to victory among 
virtually all segments of the republican party the polls said 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts was helped in florida by 
older voters lagging among the democrats was rep richard 
gephardt apparently damaged by attacks from dukakis and gore 
suggesting he had flippedflopped on important issues the surveys 
indicated 
while jackson did better among white voters than he did in his 
1984 race for the democratic nomination this is a hell of a 
polarized election in terms of race said sheldon gawiser an nbc 
news poll analyst hes still not making major inroads into that 
vote with the exception of massachusetts and virginia 
jackson polled more than nine in 10 southern black voters polls 
said among white voters abc news exit polls said jackson had 
about 9 percent in the south while the cbs newsnew york times 
poll said he had 8 percent nbc figures ranged from 4 percent in 
tennessee to 15 percent in virginia and 19 percent in massachusetts 
surveys of republican voters as they left the polls found 
overwhelming approval of president reagan and those voters went 
strongly for bush who had stressed his links to the administration 
its coattails theres no doubt about it said gawiser 
reagan is extremely popular in the south and bush is certainly 
riding those coatails 
in georgia and florida for example the cbs newsnew york times 
poll found approval of reagan at the 80 percent level and bush won 
twothirds of those voters said pama mitchell cbs manager of 
surveys 
hes carrying conservatives hes carrying moderates this is 
almost boring its all bush mitchell said 
the support for the vice president was as longstanding as it was 
widely spread sixty percent of the republican voters in georgia 
for instance had made up their minds even before last months new 
hampshire primary and most of them went for bush mitchell said 
however she said bush also won among the republicans who 
decided more recently whom to support and in florida she noted 
he even won four in 10 of the minority of voters who did not 
approve of reagan 
among the democratic candidates jackson as expected enjoyed 
massive support from black voters but also won support from about 
9 percent of the white voters across the south abc news exit polls 
said 
blacks made up 25 percent of the democratic vote and more than 
nine in 10 of them went for jackson abc and cbs reported among 
white voters across the south about a third each supported dukakis 
and gore and 15 percent backed gephardt abc reported 
gephardt is not doing well his negatives are high said 
mitchell of cbs it looks like maybe this stuff has been 
sticking where they say hes been flipflopping 
she also noted that trade issues a keystone of gephardts 
campaign was considered important by few southern voters 
gore meanwhile won support from the 27 percent of democrats 
who called themselves conservative with the backing of 35 percent 
of that group abc said dukakis won 23 percent of conservatives 
jackson 19 percent 
abc said gore also led among the democratic voters a third of 
the total who voted for reagan in 1984 thirtyfive percent went 
for gore 25 percent for dukakis and 15 percent for gephardt 
jackson and dukakis split the moderates with 26 percent each 
and jackson won 43 percent of the liberal vote to 28 percent for 
dukakis abc said 
in florida with its large population of retirees 47 percent of 
the democratic voters were 60 and over cbs reported and 52 
percent of them backed dukakis 
the cbstimes poll indicated that some of gores support 
visavis dukakis stemmed from the tennessee senators southern 
roots fiftytwo percent of democratic voters in the south said 
they were born there and 31 percent of them backed gore to 20 
percent for dukakis thirty percent were for jackson 
gore and dukakis split the white vote in the south 35 percent 
for gore and 33 percent for dukakis mitchell said the two men 
also split those democratic voters 30 percent of the total who 
decided since saturday 
the cbstimes results for the south as a region had a margin of 
sampling error of about 2 percentage points mitchell said the 
results based on state samples varied but mostly were about 5 
percent

delegaterich texas on tuesday sweeping the top three delegate 
states in democratic presidential primaries while vice president

tennessee sen albert gore jr had 166692 votes or 23 percent

paul simon had 13533 votes or 2 percent 
with 2013 of 5616 precincts or 36 percent reporting bush had 
184472 votes or 63 percent pat robertson had 46629 votes or 16 
percent kansas sen bob dole had 40808 votes or 14 percent and 
new york rep jack kemp had 14366 votes or 5 percent 
texas offered the highest number of democratic delegates on 
super tuesday with 183 dukakis also carried florida which has 
136 democratic delegates and massachusetts which has 98 delegates 
also on the ballot threeterm sen lloyd bentsen won 
renomination against democratic primary opponent joe sullivan a 
san antonio college professor republicans seeking to challenge 
bentsen were rep beau boulter of amarillo former state rep 
milton fox of austin georgetown industrialist ned snead and 
houston businessman wes gilbreath 
bush who rents a motel in houston so he can vote in texas 
pushed hard for the biggest prize of super tuesday texas 111 
convention delegates 
texas is the jewel in the crown of the 20state super 
tuesday former us sen ralph yarborough said in reference to 
the state offering more delegates than any other in tuesdays 
primaries 
voter registration was up by more than 500000 and secretary of 
state jack rains predicted the total vote could go as high as 25 
million 
bush who built an oil business in texas led in polls 
throughout the campaign 
as a texan i know our states special needs bush said in a 
letter to potential gop primary voters for 20 years in public 
life and for 20 years in business in midland and houston ive 
prepared for this campaign and the challenge of serving as 
president 
bush has staked a claim as native son in other states he 
was born in massachusetts reared in connecticut and maintains a 
home in maine as well as in washington 
dole insisted he was giving nothing away although his campaign 
appearances were limited and he skipped a major dallas debate 
since texans dont register by political party robertson said 
he was counting on substantial crossover support thats my 
secret weapon ive got tremendous appeal among democrats and 
george bush doesnt he said 
also up for election this year are five seats on the texas 
supreme court a bench wracked by negative national publicity over 
large campaign contributions to judges by lawyers the public 
reprimands of two sitting justices and the failure of the 
ninemember court to even hear the appeal of an 11 billion 
judgment awarded in the texacopennzoil lawsuit

there was nothing super in super tuesday for 
gary hart in the democratic race or for jack kemp in the 
republican there were no cheering throngs no victory parties 
hart whose battle cry was let the people decide when he 
reentered the race last december made no public comment after he 
failed to get into doubledigit percentages anywhere he had said 
last week that so long as i can be treated seriously i will 
continue 
hart listened to the returns on television at his home outside 
of denver 
kemp too dwelled in the low single digits choosing to be with 
his family in suburban washington rather than with supporters 
bad as their vote totals were they didnt approach those of 
others who had stopped campaigning but whose names remained on the 
ballot as ghosts of debates past 
sen paul simon passed up the super tuesday competition to rally 
the democratic troops in his homestate of illinois 
in a sense what happens after tonight is we start the 
campaign over in phase ii and what i want to do is come out of 
illinois with a strong solid vote simon said early in the 
evening 
later he said the super tuesday results confirm that the 
democratic nomination process is in a state of confusion and 
gridlock and that the race is anything but over its just 
beginning 
republican pat robertson also had a poor night though he vowed 
to stay in the race until the national convention in new orleans 
he said if this isnt the one well be back four years later 
rep richard gephardt did well on the democratic ballot only in 
his home state of missouri 
im far from chucking it in because this is a long race 
said gephardt on cbs were going to go on to illinois south 
carolina and michigan and try to get our message across and i think 
i can 
gephardt who has gone into debt said we lacked sufficient 
resources to be able to get our message everywhere on super 
tuesday thats not going to happen in the states that are coming 
up now 
he complained about negative campaigning by michael dukakis and 
albert gore who with jesse jackson split the democratic vote 
we had a situation where we had about 6 million or 7 million 
spent against us by those two candidates against about 1 million 
we were able to spend he said later in an interview with cnn

riot police used truncheons and tear 
gas tuesday to disperse demonstrators who threw up barricades in 
hundreds of blocks in the capital to protest the strongman 
leadership of gen manuel antonio noriega 
reporters saw police beat demonstrators with fists and rubber 
truncheons and carry off at least eight protesters in military 
vehicles a newspaper photographer jose melendez of the mexico 
city newspaper excelsior was slightly injured by birdshot fired by 
police 
the demonstrations were easily the largest since president eric 
arturo delvalle was deposed feb 26 after trying to fire noriega 
the national civic crusade an opposition coalition of political 
parties and civic and other groups said at least 23 people had 
been detained during tuesdays protests by late tuesday the 
crusade said only two of those were still unaccounted for the 
others were released 
small groups of demonstrators most of them young built 
barricades of garbage tires street signs and palm fronds in 
central and eastern parts of the capital 
scores of barriers were set afire and plumes of black smoke rose 
over the city most protesters ran when approached by riot troops 
who jumped from trucks circulating through the capital and fired 
tear gas 
many shopkeepers closed early 
the clang of pots and pans a familiar symbol now of 
antigovernment protest rang out from some apartment buildings 
earlier tuesday foreign minister jorge abadia charged that us 
military maneuvers along the panama canal were a prelude to an 
armed invasion 
abadia told a news conference that exercises begun over the 
weekend by the us southern command were acts of arrogance that 
are intolerable and that panama was suffering the aggression of 
a foreign colossus 
the united states has been calling for noriegas removal since 
his indictment in florida last month on drug trafficking charges 
us criticism of noriega increased after he orchestrated 
delvalles removal 
but a spokeswoman for the southern command speaking on 
condition of anonymity denied any hostile intent in the 
5weeklong maneuvers saying they were regularly scheduled annual 
exercises they involve about 680 soldiers from us military 
installations in panama and us national guard members 
abadia said panama cannot interpret the maneuvers as 
anything but the prelude to an armed invasion of panama and if we 
are mistaken let them demonstrate that were mistaken 
dennis mcauliffe administrator of the panama canal commission 
meanwhile reported that the canal is operating normally though 
uspanamanian tension has caused strain on canal workers 
no slowdown no work stoppage no troubles no problems 
pertaining to payment he said 
the government set up dozens of mobile banks and special cashing 
posts tuesday for retired people who took to the streets monday 
when they could not cash pension checks 
banks have been closed since last week because of a cash 
shortage and fears of a run by depositors 
in miami a us district judge froze panamanian assets in banks 
there after a suit was filed tuesday to prevent noreigas 
government from withdrawing funds a similar order was issued last 
week in new york city and a suit was filed tuesday in boston 
the miami suit was set in motion by panamas us ambassador 
juan b sosa who has refused to recognize the noriega government 
delvalle who remains in hiding in panama is still recognized 
as president by the united states 
abadia said tuesday the us military maneuvers amounted to a 
violation of the 1977 panama canal treaties signed by the united 
states and panama 
noriega head of the 15000person defense forces says 
washington intends to go back on its commitments he has denied the 
drug trafficking charges 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters tuesday 
the reagan administration was still considering possible economic 
and trade sanctions against noriegas government 
in a statement issued at both the white house and state 
department the administration welcomed statements monday by 
delvalle and the opposition parties calling for establishment of a 
government of national reconciliation

china has 20 million surplus workers although 
there are substantial manpower shortages in jobs requiring heavy 
labor the official china daily said today 
the newspaper said surplus workers in the work force of 132 
million are costing the state billions of dollars and are a heavy 
burden to enterprises 
it quoted the director of a boiler factory as saying his 
operation would be more efficient if the current staff of 10000 
was reduced by 4000 
but it said workers in overstaffed plants and unemployed youths 
are reluctant to volunteer for jobs in repair businesses or those 
requiring heavy labor such jobs are filled mainly by surplus 
agricultural workers it said

an attorney for five relatives of challenger 
astronauts says that other families who settled with the government 
and with rocket maker morton thiokol for 77 million were 
shortchanged 
that settlement is woefully inadequate said ronald d 
krist a houston attorney who represented astronauts survivors 
from the apollo spacecraft fire in 1967 as well as three families 
from the 1986 space shuttle disaster 
krist said the four challenger families in the 
governmentcompany settlement should have and would have netted 
more money if they had hired lawyers 
the cost of the fourfamily settlement which came in cash and 
annuities was disclosed in government documents released monday 
the documents show that morton thiokol which produced the 
faulty booster rocket blamed for the jan 28 1986 explosion of 
the space shuttle challenger paid 4641000 or 60 percent the 
governments share of the settlements was 3094000 or 40 percent 
the documents were released by the justice department to settle 
a civil suit brought under the freedom of information act by the 
associated press and six other news organizations 
in court papers the government acknowledged that the four 
settling families did not hire lawyers relying instead on informal 
advice from leo b lind jr executor of the estate of christa 
mcauliffe a 37yearold concord nh public high school teacher 
killed in the explosion lind is the law partner of mcauliffes 
husband steven 
michael d oldak an attorney and exhusband of mission 
specialist judith a resnik represented her father marvin in 
settlement talks with the justice department 
i think it was a big mistake for the four settling families 
not to hire lawyers oldak said monday i think if i hadnt been 
involved they probably may have coerced the resniks into accepting 
their original offer these are people in the midst of their 
grief 
oldak said the original governmentcompany offer was a few 
hundred thousand and i told them nicely what they could do 
with it he rebuffed them again when nearly a year later they 
doubled the offer 
instead marvin resnik settled with morton thiokol last month 
for an amount he put at between 2 million and 35 million the 
government refused to contribute to the settlement 
the governments treatment of the four families was viewed 
differently by betty grissom whose husband gus died in the apollo 
fire 
mrs grissom said she received only 350000 and had to sue 
north american rockwell on her own for that 
i never heard from the justice department she said i 
thought we got an injustice done to us they act like they care 
now but they didnt back then 
it kinda hurts she added it stings that we never got 
treated like that it hurts when i think that theyre getting that 
much money 
the settlements were reached dec 29 1986 with the immediate 
survivors of spacecraft commander dick scobee 46 a retired air 
force officer employed by the national aeronautics and space 
administration mission specialist ellison s onizuka 39 an air 
force lieutenant colonel payload specialist gregory jarvis 41 an 
employee of hughes aircraft co and mcauliffe 
the surviving four spouses and six children will receive more 
than 7735000 because each was given an annuity which pays 
benefits larger than its cost but over a period of many years 
the total dollar amounts they will receive over time and the 
breakdown by family were not released 
among the disclosures 
the justice department did all the negotiating for morton 
thiokol as well as the government the families never spoke to 
company officials 
the rocket maker tried to have the settlements cover any 
property damage morton thiokol might have caused such as 
destruction of the orbiter and payload but the government refused 
although the justice department claims it cannot legally be 
sued by the families of military or federal civilian employees who 
die on duty it contributed 40 percent to each of the settlements 
only the jarvis and mcauliffe relatives had a right to sue the 
government directly all the astronaut families could sue the 
company 
morton thiokol attorney john w adler said the government was 
being unfair to the parents of resnik a 36yearold civilian nasa 
employee because of the governments refusal to participate to 
any degree at all in a settlement the company considered 
acceptable 
resniks mother sarah resnik belfer and jarvis father bruce 
settled with morton thiokol but the government did not contribute 
so did cheryl mcnair wife of mission specialist ronald e mcnair 
35 a civilian nasa employee who had two infant children all five 
were represented by krist 
jane smith wife of pilot michael j smith 40 a navy 
commander has a suit pending in federal court against the company 
the government last month got itself dismissed as a defendant 
because military personnel may not sue the government for wrongful 
death 
justice spokeswoman amy brown said the government made 
settlement offers to attorneys for the resniks smiths and mcnairs 
based on the same formula used for the other families but they 
were rejected she said the government would not offer them 
settlements which exceeded the guidelines used for the other 
families or which were separate from settlements with morton 
thiokol

leonore sarabia clutching her sweater 
against the morning chill awaited jesse jacksons arrival at the 
mirasol housing project a heavily hispanic neighborhood where the 
presidential hopeful was searching out votes for todays election 
she had come to check him out she said even though she 
already knew she would vote for him she didnt really know 
anything about the other five democratic contenders but jackson 
is more for the people she explained as the candidate emerged 
from a limousine 
two days earlier it was tom tranthams dairy farm in the south 
carolina county where jackson grew up there he talked farm policy 
and shared a breakfast of grits and eggs with trantham and a few 
neighbors as cameras and reporters jostled around the table 
the white farmers said they were grateful for jacksons support 
during the 1986 drought when he helped unload truckedin hay but 
they were noncommittal about whether they would vote for him 
i havent made a decision said bertha tinsley her husband 
doug tinsley fetching coffee refills for the jackson group said 
he was a republican and would probably vote gop 
the two campaign stops illustrate the challenge and the success 
jackson has had as he tries to expand his base beyond his core of 
black supporters 
in the south voters today are deciding if he can overcome what 
he describes as an ancient cultural barrier and pull white 
support here as he did in five northern states with fractional 
black populations 
todays super tuesday election with 14 southern states among 
the 20 where voters are going to the polls has shaped up as the 
day when jacksons presidential bid will shine 
it is virtually certain he will be picking up more nonblack 
votes than he did in his 1984 race and he hopes to do well enough 
to lay to rest the socalled electability question the notion that 
he cant be elected because he is black 
casual interviews along the campaign trail indicate jackson has 
engendered considerable respect among southern whites although 
some say the racial issue is not as much a factor as it was in 
1984 they acknowledge it still remains for many 
the older group they wont change jackson supporter thomas 
delong a 57yearold white student at mississippi state college 
said of mississippi voters he and others interviewed said that 
among students a group the campaign is targeting jackson has 
considerable support 
jacksons campus rallies are a big draw and the enthusiastic 
audiences are sprinkled with whites including republicans who 
seem to come as much out of curiosity as anything 
at the university of arkansas white economics student tony 
green was impressed by jacksons powerful delivery commenting 
wow quite a speech 
he said race is not an issue for him but jackson is just too 
liberal he may even vote republican if vice president george 
bush wins the gop nomination he said 
jackson has touted the endorsements of a handful of prominent 
white southern politicians including texas agriculture commissioner 
jim hightower oklahoma state sen gene stipe and tennessean john 
j hooker a former gubernatorial candidate with close ties to 
former sen albert gore sr the father of one of jacksons rivals 
in texas with its large hispanic population he was joined on 
the campaign trail by new mexico gov toney anaya a prominent 
hispanic leader 
and selma ala last week saw a historically dramatic moment 
the white mayor who had had dr martin luther king and other civil 
rights activist arrested more than two decades ago welcomed 
jackson a king protege and longtime civil rights activist giving 
him the key to the city 
mayor joe smitherman then joined jackson for a stroll through 
streets that saw some of the most tense moments of the civil rights 
struggle 
the mayor said he was wrong to oppose the civil rights movement 
and while hes not officially endorsing jackson he supports his 
message the message powerfully hammered home in jacksons stump 
speech is 
that the new south is one of equal civil rights but 
economic inequity 
that greater efforts are needed to fight the drug influx the 
no 1 national security threat 
that multinational corporations are to blame for loss of us 
jobs because they take their business to cheap labor markets 
overseas 
that corporate agribusiness is to blame for squeezing the 
family farm 
that the minimum wage should be increased and health care and 
day care programs are needed for the poor 
that overall hemispheric cooperation is needed to help ease 
latin nations debts increase us exports and make peace with 
cuba and nicaragua 
this is a referendum on economic violence jackson says 
people who are unemployed are rebelling people who have jobs are 
insecure people feel abandoned by the government 
there also is considerable evidence that jackson is benefiting 
from being a celebrity in a contest where the other five candidates 
are a blur in many voters minds 
the other democrats have made multimilliondollar media buys 
compared to jacksons paltry 100000 worth of ads in mostly 
nonmajor markets 
jackson relies on the free media attention that follows him on 
his 18hour campaign days filled with tvoriented events and photo 
opportunities 
campaign manager gerald austin says the chartered dc9 that 
carries the candidate and traveling press corps is jacksons media 
expenditure

its always easy to spot a presidential 
contender going down the tubes in a primary election hes the one 
noisily protesting that the other guy cant possibly get enough 
votes to win the white house 
thats why sen bob dole says vice president george bush cant 
win a national election for the republicans and thats why aides 
to rep richard gephardt and sen albert gore jr are beginning to 
whisper that michael dukakis would lead the democratic party to a 
resounding defeat in the fall 
electablity is looming larger as the issue dole said monday 
as he tried to stir up doubts about the vice president in alabama 
one of several super tuesday states where he looks like a landslide 
loser we ought to nominate a winner instead of a loser 
the unspoken message is that dole fears he is about to be swept 
under by a bush tide of ferocious proportions by the time the votes 
and the delegates are counted in the super tuesday contests 
there will be more talk of that type in the days ahead dole and 
his campaign aides are likely to produce polls charts graphs 
senators and an academician or two to explain why bush cant 
possibly win the presidential race in the fall 
whether that will stem bushs surge in the nominating war now 
unfolding will have to wait for the decision of voters of illinois 
ohio pennsylvania and elsewhere 
but curiously enough the same play is being made against 
dukakis in the democratic race 
gores aide have begun to speak of a very real electability 
problem with dukakis saying he has been unable to attract swing 
voters in the south who will be critical to democratic chances in 
the fall election 
gephardts advisers even less charitable have started to 
whisper alarmingly to reporters about a 50state sweep next fall by 
the republicans if dukakis is the democratic nominee 
such talk is designed to mask the prospect of a gore or gephardt 
failure in super tuesday possibly finishing behind not only 
dukakis but jesse jackson as well and to lay out a rationale for 
remaining in the race 
sen paul simons aides are attempting a variation on that 
theme claiming that no matter what the outcome on super tuesday 
dukakis will be unable to garner enough delegates to be assured of 
the nomination when the democratic convention opens in atlanta in 
july 
in other words dont ask simon why he took one look at the 
south and hustled back home to illinois passing up even a chance 
at most of the 1307 delegates at stake 
even before the first curtain is pulled aside to admit a voter 
to a super tuesday polling booth one outcome seems certain 
super tuesday was conceived as a chance for the south to rise 
again in democratic politics a way to mobilize an entire region 
behind a white moderate to conservative candidate preferably 
from the south and push him firmly along the path to the partys 
nomination 
instead the two men who most nearly fit that bill sen albert 
gore of tennessee and rep richard gephardt find themselves in a 
struggle for survival in the race 
the southern conservative political leaders made their stand in 
the final days of the super tuesday campaign in a last bid to 
salvage something for their work georgia sen sam nunn gov joe 
frank harris and virginia gov charles robb all made 11thhour 
endorsements for gore 
but the southerners concern will be relegated to the back pages 
in a few days 
dole will want the headlines to say that bush cant win a 
national election dukakis rivals will want the same thing said 
about him 
unless of course the vice president and the massachusetts 
governor actually win their respective parties nominations and 
fight it out for the white house in the fall election 
then the chances are that one of them will win

amanda mcbroom the onetime grammy nominee who 
has performed the rose in front of audiences of 60000 
clutched a microphone and stood under a fluorescent light next to 
an old coffee urn 
no times arent tough for mcbroom but they are for the 75 
people who listened politely in a drafty soup kitchen on the citys 
northern border 
few have jobs and fewer have a permanent place to live 
entertainment whether paying to see a movie or a musician is out 
of the question so once a week professional entertainers come to 
them singing a song or telling a joke to a poor but grateful crowd 
im really happy i was here mcbroom as she retrieved her 
coat after a sixsong set in a few hours nightclub patrons would 
pay 10 to hear what the soup kitchen regulars enjoyed free 
its a look at reality mcbroom said you think of the 
homeless as a faceless group thats not so theyre the same as 
me but theyve had bad luck 
the weekly entertainment at the soup kitchen which doubles as 
the storefront good news community church was the idea of the rev 
bob tschannenmoran and his indefatigable volunteer joyce heitler 
who dishes out food each night 
by day shes a teacher and parttime publicist for various 
professional acts around chicago 
we needed something around here thats more than just food 
she said dropping on a bench to wipe her hands in an apron some 
people thought it was frivolous they said our job was to feed the 
poor not entertain them 
well theyre entitled to something extra once in a while 
theyve had hard lives she said 
besides mcbroom the soup kitchen has provided a stage for free 
performances by chicagos famous second city comedy troupe the 
lyric opera magicians and puppeteers 
it does my heart good to see people doubled over in laughter 
especially when they dont have much to laugh about 
tschannenmoran said recently we dont pretend that this is 
solving any problems but i do think for a brief time this 
program is lifting spirits 
the soup kitchen within earshot of the last train stop before 
evanston is tucked between a coin laundry and fast eddies soul 
food last year the kitchen served 20000 meals five days a week 
including 9000 to people age 18 and younger 
a glance around the tables at mealtime finds gaptoothed 
children sitting beside single mothers the youngsters pants are 
often ripped and their jackets dirty and worn outside on a recent 
night the temperature was near zero 
were pretty much regulars said carol barton 31 pointing 
to her 10yearold son shaun 
im a single mother on public aid people on my type of income 
cant afford entertainment you have to use your imagination she 
said this is a bonus in life it gives you a chance to survive 
the rest of the week 
after 30 minutes mcbroom has taken her bows there is another 
evening engagement but she still has a few minutes to sign 
autographs and answer questions 
bette midler is best known for singing the rose in the movie 
of that name but mcbroom wrote the lyrics although the listeners 
couldnt offer her roses each table in the soup kitchen had a soda 
pop bottle with water and carnations 
how many times have you done the rose mcbroom was asked 
a million times she replied but never to a more grateful 
bunch this is a very classy group here good night

m thomas told a meeting of the national association of counties on 
monday but if we look at smog in our major cities in the future 
thats not going to be enough 
sixtytwo cities are on epas list of noncomplying areas for 
ozone a key constituent of smog that worsens breathing problems 
many will slide into compliance as older more polluting cars are 
junked but the worst cities perhaps 20 are bound to have 
serious problems ever meeting the standard epa officials have said 
ozone is formed by the interaction in sunlight of certain 
hydrocarbon and other compounds with nitrogen oxides a product of 
combustion in motor vehicles factories and power plants the 
hydrocarbons can be unburned gasoline from cars other compounds 
from industrial sources and even aerosol propellants to reduce 
ozone formation in urban areas scientists believe reductions in 
hydrocarbons must precede reductions in nitrogen oxides 
at the moment the compliance question is in limbo as members of 
congress wrestle with revisions to the clean air act in backroom 
negotiations congress has imposed a moratorium until aug 1 on 
penalties against noncomplying areas 
telling county officials that the easy days are over in 
pollution control thomas said in the long term well be right 
back at making the tough choices about how we are going to meet 
those standards 
i cant have full responsibility in washington of establishing 
a uniform system of regulations and controls when in fact ive got 
such a diverse group of sources when the smog problem may well 
need to be dealt with by reducing the number of cars on the street 
by telling people they cant drive nearly to the extent they have 
in the past thomas said 
epa made stabs in the early 1970s at reducing auto use in urban 
areas notably boston and los angeles but public and congressional 
opposition prompted the agency to backpedal 
thomas who has said before that a serious commitment to the 
current standards might have to mean cutting down driving 
evidently expects opposition again 
in the smog and other programs he said the public will 
demand of all levels of government far more information on what do 
these sources do in terms of cost in terms of degradation of the 
environment or degradation of their health and on the other hand 
what do our programs do for them in terms of benefits and is it 
worth it to go forward with these programs

farmland prices nationally are headed up for 
the first time in six years but an agriculture department analyst 
says there still are areas where land values are lagging 
were thinking there are going to be rather strong increases 
in the corn belt states and in the northeast says roger hexem of 
the departments economic research service were less certain 
whats going to happen in the south and in the west 
hexems analysis came in an interview and in a report written 
for the march issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
the department is scheduled to issue its annual farmland value 
report on april 14 showing average market prices as of feb 1 for 
the united states as a whole and for each state 
a year ago the feb 1 values showed us farmland including 
buildings were worth an average of 548 per acre an 8 percent 
drop from 1986 to a 19year low farmland nationally rose to a peak 
of 823 per acre in 1982 before starting to slide 
when inflation is accounted for the real value of farmland 
declined even longer from a 1981 peak of 551 per acre to 290 as 
of feb 1 1987 
but a lot has changed during the past year including some 
brightening of the dreary farm export situation improved market 
prices for some commodities and the massive idling of highly 
erodible land under the governments conservation reserve program 
or crp 
nationwide im thinking its going to be up hexem said 
but i dont know how much 
there are still soft areas where land market prices are 
lagging he said some states are gaining faster than others and 
it also depends on what kind of agricultural enterprises prevail 
within the corn belt for example i think that there are some 
indications that iowa will show a pretty good increase where 
another state like missouri might not show as strong an 
increase hexem said 
in texas and oklahoma for example the economy is still kind 
of soft so i think that has dampened demand on the part of the 
nonagricultural purchasers of farmland hexem said on the other 
hand improved cotton prices probably strengthened land values in 
cottonproducing areas 
another factor has been the longterm payments under crp where 
farmers can get annual rental payments for planting grass and trees 
on fragile land those payments have been averaging around 50 per 
acre each year for the 10year life of the contracts 
in his report hexem cited survey results from a number of 
sources that point to rising farmland values last november for 
example more than 500 farmland experts all members of the 
american society of farm managers and rural appraisers were 
surveyed by the university of wisconsin for the usda agency 
over onethird of the respondents indicated that land values 
rose during the augustoctober 1987 quarter while over onehalf 
considered values unchanged hexem said less than a tenth 
indicated lower values 
those reponses point to a strengthening of the market since 
last may june and july when only 28 percent thought farmland 
values had gone up and nearly 18 percent thought they had dropped 
he said 
for november december and january the rural appraisers 
expected continued increases in farmland values hexem said 
surveys last august september and october by several federal 
reserve banks tend to support the national survey by the appraisers 
the federal reserve bank of chicago representing iowa and 
parts of illinois indiana wisconsin and michigan reported that 
values for good farmland increased just over 3 percent during the 
third quarter compared with a 2 percent gain in the preceding 
quarter he said 
but some uncertainties remain in the 1988 land market hexem 
said on the up side demand for farm products is rising and there 
are more manageable inventory levels the crp seems to be 
strengthening prices for lowerquality land in some areas 
on the down side farm income is forecast to be down from last 
years record level in which federal payments accounted for 30 
percent of the net cash income of farmers crop target prices and 
price support loan rates will be down about 3 percent in 1988 and 
current legislation calls for further reductions in 1989 
credit for buying land is available but interest rates edged 
slightly upward in late 1987 and could go higher in 1988 if 
monetary policy is tightened to support the price of the dollar 
hexem said

average incomes have dropped 25 percent in the 
countries of black africa during the 1980s according to the latest 
figures from the world bank 
the seriousness of the shortterm economic outlook must 
not be underestimated eugene vk jaycox the banks vice 
president for africa said in a speech monday to the united nations 
advisory panel on africa 
the bank released 1987 figures showing incomes were down by 4 
percent from a year earlier that drop followed a more than 27 
percent decline reported for 1986 and an average annual decline 
from 198085 of 37 percent 
exports and imports both declined for the year but there was a 
16 percent improvement in prices that africans got for their 
products compared with what they had to pay for foreign goods 
that was a lot better than 1986 when there was a drop of 252 
percent 
gerard rice a world bank spokesman said its economists are 
looking for a better year in 1988 with the average income holding 
steady some countries have had continuous declines since they won 
independence in the 1960s 
the figures cover what the bank calls subsaharan africa 
which includes the whole continent except for south africa and the 
northern tier countries algeria egypt libya morocco and egypt 
carol lancaster who deals with africa at the institute for 
international economics said the countries in worst shape are 
those hit by war and drought such as angola ethiopia and 
mozambique the institute is a private study group financed largely 
by the west german marshall fund 
nigeria the most populous country on the continent and the one 
with by far the biggest economy has been hurt by the drop in the 
price of oil its dominant export the decline in its income has a 
big effect on the overall figure 
the world bank is the single biggest source of loans to improve 
living standards in the third world in 1985 treasury secretary 
james a baker iii said the bank should take the lead in planning 
new programs with heavily indebted countries since then it has 
been giving more emphasis to broad lending programs though the 
majority of its loans are still for individual projects 
for the year ending june 30 it is expected to lend africa 5 
billion 
the international monetary fund the banks sister organization 
is expected to make another 15 billion worth of loans at minimal 
interest 
but the united nations advisory panel on africa said the 
continent also needs about 1 billion a year in relief from its old 
debts most of them to governments and another 1 billion in new 
aid 
africas 200 billion dollar debt is less than half latin 
americas but its population is poorer smaller and growing fast

the supreme court is beginning another 
examination of sex discrimination in the american workplace 
agreeing to decide how difficult it should be for employers to 
disprove charges of sexist stereotyping 
setting the stage for an important ruling likely to be announced 
in 1989 the justices on monday said they will hear an appeal by 
price waterhouse one of the nations leading accounting firms 
the company is accused of allowing sexism some of it perhaps 
unconscious to play a key role in denying a woman a partnership in 
the firm 
a federal appeals court placed a heavy burden on the firm to 
disprove the sex bias charges 
price waterhouse one of the nations socalled big eight 
accounting firms is accused of discriminating unlawfully against 
ann hopkins she quit the firms office here after she was denied 
promotion to partnership a move that would have made her a part 
owner 
ms hopkins joined the firm in 1978 and was nominated for 
partnership in 1982 the only woman among 88 candidates for 
partnership that year at the time the company had more than 660 
partners in 90 offices nationwide 
ms hopkins had been very successful in getting business for the 
company winning government contracts worth an estimated 34 
million to 44 million 
of the 88 candidates in 1978 47 were invited to become 
partners 21 were rejected outright and 20 including ms hopkins 
were placed on hold 
the following year she was told she would not become a partner 
and she resigned in 1984 to set up her own consulting firm 
both her critics and supporters at price waterhouse said she 
sometimes was overly aggressive too harsh impatient with her 
staff and very demanding 
one critic suggested she needed to take a course at charm 
school 
a partner in the firm who urged her promotion told her she would 
stand a better chance of becoming a partner if she would walk 
more femininely talk more femininely dress more femininely wear 
makeup have her hair styled and wear jewelry 
others said her use of profanity was a black mark against her 
ms hopkins then sued price waterhouse accusing the company of 
violating title vii of the 1964 civil rights act prohibiting 
onthejob sex discrimination she said that sex stereotyping 
unconscious or otherwise barred her from being named partner 
the supreme court ruled in 1984 in the case of a woman denied 
partnership in a law firm that professional partnerships are 
covered by the 1964 law 
a federal judge ruled price waterhouse must prove by clear and 
convincing evidence it would not have made her a partner 
regardless of whether sexual stereotyping played a part in its 
decision 
price waterhouse did not provide such proof 
the us circuit court of appeals here last august said there is 
competent evidence that the partnership selection process at 
price waterhouse was impermissibly infected by stereotypical 
attitudes toward female candidates 
the appeals court said even if there is evidence that ms 
hopkins personality played a part in her denial of partnership 
price waterhouse is unable to prove impermissible bias was not 
the determinative factor 
the appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what 
back pay and other remedies the company must provide 
in other matters the court 
ruled that companies have a heavy burden of proof when 
defending themselves against investor lawsuits alleging the 
companies withheld information about merger discussions 
agreed to decide whether states may use antiracketeering laws 
to close down adult bookstores accused of selling obscene 
materials the court said it will review freespeech challenges to 
indianas racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law 
patterned after the muchused federal rico act 
agreed to use a case from canton ohio to try again to decide 
whether cities may be sued successfully by citizens who say their 
rights were violated by inadequately trained city employees 
ruled that financially troubled farmers may not avoid 
foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to pay back 
debts by using their labor and expertise while continuing to 
operate their farm 
said it will decide in a case from chicago whether a criminal 
defendants right to a jury selected from a crosssection of the 
community is violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors 
based on their race

as voters went to the polls today in 20 
states a survey suggested that jesse jackson was leading in seven 
southern states albert gore jr was ahead in three states and 
michael dukakis was in front in the two states with the biggest 
delegate prizes texas and florida 
the abc news poll based on interviews with 8659 voters last 
thursday through sunday in all 16 states holding primaries today 
also found rep richard gephardt ahead only in his home state of 
missouri 
in its survey released monday night abc said dukakiss lead in 
texas was paperthin over jackson and gephardt who were tied 
for second in the state but dukakis had a strong lead in florida 
as well as back home in massachusetts and rhode island 
on the republican side abc said the poll indicates todays 
events look like a blowout for george bush in virtually all 
states except missouri 
overall in the dozen southern states with primaries bush led 
bob dole 60 percent to 20 percent followed by pat robertson at 12 
percent and jack kemp at 4 percent four percent were undecided 
among the democrats in the south jackson led with 29 percent to 
dukakiss 25 percent with gore in third at 21 percent and gephardt 
fourth with 13 percent gary hart was fifth at 5 percent followed 
by paul simon at 2 percent four percent were undecided and 1 
percent supported other candidates 
abc said the southern state results had a margin of error of 
three percentage points in either direction but the samples for 
the nonsouthern states were too small to generate specific figures 
for the candidates 
it also said the horserace figures for the entire south were 
somewhat misleading because the two largest states texas and 
florida make up a large share of the vote it said jackson led in 
most of the deep south with gore the tennessee senator running 
second 
it said jacksons strongest leads were in alabama and 
mississippi where nearly half the voters polled said they support 
him he also led among voters polled in arkansas georgia 
louisiana north carolina and virginia jackson was second in 
tennessee behind gore and second in florida and maryland behind 
dukakis and tied for second with gephardt in texas 
dukakis led among the voters abc polled in florida maryland 
massachusetts rhode island and texas abc said dukakis seemed to 
be headed for second in virginia behind jackson while he was in 
tight battles for second with gore in arkansas louisiana and north 
carolina 
gore had strong leads in tennessee and kentucky and a thin edge 
in oklahoma where abc said gephardt was running only slightly 
behind him 
gephardt was ahead in the poll only in missouri and second just 
behind gore in oklahoma and second to gore in kentucky gephardt 
and jackson were tied behind dukakis in texas abc said gephardt 
was running fourth in most of the other states and was in danger of 
falling below the 15 percent threshold for delegates in a dozen of 
the 16 primary states 
in an earlier abc news poll completed feb 28 jackson led 
dukakis across the south by just 26 to 25 percent followed by gore 
with percent gephardt 13 percent and hart 7 percent simon had 3 
percent 6 percent were undecided and 1 percent were for others 
abc said dukakis has lost a bit of support in the deep south to 
gore but gore has not been able to pull off the southern sweep his 
strategy called for 
it said bushs 6020 lead over dole regionwide is paced by the 
vice presidents strong showings in texas and florida bush was the 
choice of about 40 percent of those polled in missouri and 70 
percent in texas in most states he is getting more than 50 
percent of the vote against his three rivals abc said 
dole averages in the low 20s across the south while robertson 
averages 12 percent kemp averaged only 4 percent in the southern 
states kemps best states in the poll were massachusetts and rhode 
island where he was the choice of about 10 percent of those polled

for the democratic partys most prominent 
noncandidates super tuesday marks a milestone its too late to 
step in and win the presidential nomination through the primaries 
by the numbers it just cant be done 
thats not to say that new york gov mario cuomo new jersey 
sen bill bradley or georgia sen sam nunn couldnt wind up with 
the nomination but as of wednesday they would have to get it by 
making political deals with the announced candidates for delegates 
or by swaying a deadlocked national convention 
neither scenario can be ruled out because none of the three has 
ruled out accepting a draft for the nomination cuomo has gone so 
far as to say he would accept such a draft at a deadlocked 
convention if party leaders made it his obligation 
just last week former president jimmy carter said there was an 
even chance that no democrat would clinch the nomination before the 
july convention in atlanta 
there will be 4160 delegates to the national convention and 
2081 are needed to win the nomination with the passing of super 
tuesday there will be 2279 delegates available from the 31 
primaries and caucuses that remain 
however the problem for any latestarting candidate is that 
most of the filing deadlines to get on the later primary ballots 
will have passed with super tuesday 
a new candidate could get on primary ballots in just five 
states participate in caucuses in six other states in caucuses 
for democrats in guam and the virgin islands and in a primary for 
democrats living elsewhere outside the united states 
in all by winning 100 percent of the delegates available in all 
those postsuper tuesday contests qualified for the candidate 
would wind up with 628 delegates going into the convention 
cuomo talking about the mathematics of a late start said 
number one you cant do it number two its irrelevant because 
i wouldnt anyway 
the major contests still open after super tuesday are the june 7 
primaries in new jersey and california the filing deadlines are 
march 24 for california and april 13 for new jersey 
in california some democrats are trying to collect enough 
signatures to get cuomos name on the ballot in new jersey 
meanwhile a group of prominent probradley democrats announced 
late last month that it would attempt to run an uncommitted slate 
of delegates in the june 7 primary to give bradley strength at the 
national convention if he wanted it 
in new york a group of procuomo democratic county clerks has 
already qualified an uncommitted slate for the states april 19 
primary even though cuomo asked them not to do it the new york 
primary is for 255 delegates 
by getting into some of the later primaries such as california 
and new jersey a new candidate could demonstrate strength among 
the electorate 
cuomo says the nomination shouldnt go to someone who hasnt 
been tested in the primaries the candidates already in the race 
share that sentiment 
if i lose the nomination i want to be eliminated by someone 
who has played in the same league said jesse jackson late last 
year when asked about a possible cuomo convention draft 
nonetheless nunn said last week that if no clear favorite 
emerges from super tuesday the pressure will increase on cuomo and 
the other prominent noncandidates also last week former virginia 
gov charles robb said cuomo was the only noncandidate who could 
possibly capture the nomination at a deadlocked national convention 
while robert beckel democrat walter mondales 1984 campaign 
manager said he thinks the nomination will go to one of the 
current crop of candidates he also said theres a possibility of 
chaos 
you will hear about a cuomo run between now and june 7 im 
convinced of that said beckel whether it will happen or not 
im much less convinced 
david garth the new yorkbased political consultant and 
occasional cuomo adviser said he doesnt expect any immediate move 
from the new york governor 
i think hes going to do nothing until the convention i think 
its going to the convention and at that point hes got some very 
difficult decisions to make said garth hes going to have a 
difficult time at the point saying no

political organizers for gop presidential 
hopeful pat robertson have been asking local pastors to use church 
bulletins to solicit support for their candidate robertson aides 
acknowledged monday 
i dont think its out of line said henry hughes 
robertsons chief organizer in new york state we are not taking 
up collections in church like jesse jacksons campaign 
he said pastors should be free to provide political guidance to 
their congregation as long as it does not actively involve the 
structure of the church 
but several pastors in this rural upstate community disagreed 
i very strongly object to that and i dont support endorsing 
any political candidate the rev d gregory van dussen pastor 
of the bergen united methodist church told the batavia daily news 
van dussen said he received a letter from the regional committee 
of americans for robertson based in rochester asking for the use of 
church bulletins to announce its organizing meetings 
he said the letter steered clear of asking for donations or 
recommendations from the pulpit 
mainly it was for behindthescenes support he said they 
were asking us somewhat diplomatically to use church sponsorship 
and organize support for robertson 
the letter according to the pastor said that robertson was a 
christian candidate presenting the views of christians and that 
christians of like mind would support him 
robertson a former baptist minister and television evangelist 
scored well in the iowa primary last month coming in second behind 
sen bob dole but his campaign has since faltered he predicted a 
win in south carolina saturday but came in a distant third behind 
vice president george bush and dole 
van dussen said it was the first time he has ever received a 
letter asking for the churchs political support he said he has 
asked his fellow clergymen to refuse to allow the robertson 
campaign or any other campaign to use the church for political 
purposes 
another pastor douglas spencer of the first united methodist 
church in batavia said i didnt think the church should make 
that type of decision the church contains people from various 
backgrounds the letter sought institutional support for one 
candidate

in 20 states he managed sometimes to touch down in half a dozen 
states or more in a single day 
he traveled in a fleet of four or five lear jets a curious 
caravan that made for speedy flying time but sometimes meant the

gores campaign couldnt afford a big jet and couldnt locate a 
midsized jet to accommodate the entourage of candidate aides 
secret service agents reporters and television crews

republican rules in eight of todays super 
tuesday states could mean the biggest delegate prize for george 
bush while bylaws and hometown contests for three of the 
democratic contenders may prevent an outright winner 
bush who currently has 126 delegates could pad his lead 
considerably as the four gop candidates battle for 712 national 
convention delegates in 16 state contests including virginias 
nonbinding primary 
while the democrats allot delegates based on a percentage of the 
vote republicans in eight super tuesday states alabama florida 
georgia louisiana maryland mississippi oklahoma and texas 
award delegates on a winnertakeall basis in each district and 
statewide 
the vice president who stands as the frontrunner in many of 
those states is expected to reap the benefits of the gop process 
according to the latest polls bush leads in 14 states that hold 
gop primaries or caucuses including delegaterich texas with 111 
florida with 82 massachusetts with 52 and georgia with 48 
the vice president also is ahead in alabama with 38 delegates

bush is even expected to win in rival pat robertsons home state 
of virginia where no delegates are at stake on super tuesday 
kansas sen bob dole is hoping for some success in missouri 
which has 47 delegates at stake and north carolina with 54 
according to the associated press survey dole has 65 delegates 
heading into the super tuesday events while new york rep jack kemp 
has 35 and former television evangelist robertson has 8 twelve 
delegates remain uncommitted 
the democrats will be competing for 1307 delegates in 21 states 
or territories but the party requires that a presidential 
candidate reach a certain level of support to be eligible for 
winning delegates a system that decreases the chance of a 
clearcut super tuesday winner 
each candidate must receive at least 15 percent of the vote in 
any given congressional district or statewide

contests in three of the candidates home states michael dukakis

counting on success in massachusetts with 98 delegates at stake 
and possibly a large share of the delegates from florida with 136 
maryland with 67 rhode island with 22 and washington with 65 
dukakis chief rival in florida is gephardt who has obvious 
high expectations for missouri with 77 delegates and hopes to do 
well in oklahoma with 46 and plans to fight it out in texas which 
boasts the biggest prize 183 delegates 
gephardt has 50 delegates so far while gore has 2180 jesse 
jackson 2755 paul simon 3550 and 25865 remain uncommitted

democrats in the island state 
gore and gephardt are expected to be locked in a close race in 
arkansas with 38 delegates gore is hoping to grab a large portion 
of delegates in kentucky with 55 at stake nevada with 16 the 
obvious tennessee with 70 and virginia with 75 
in north carolina jackson gore and dukakis are vying for 82 
delegates while in idaho dukakis and gore are battling for 18 
delegates although state officials would prefer an uncommitted 
slate 
three democratic delegates are at stake in american samoa

a federal judges ruling will allow the 
regional bell telephone companies to offer consumers new 
computerized services that do the work telephone answering machines 
now do 
in his decision us district judge harold greene said the 
risks that the local phone companies would monopolize the market 
were outweighed by the benefits this new service and others like it 
would provide consumers 
what has until now been a relatively quiescent market is 
likely to become a broad vigorous and competitive one that will 
make the service available to a broad base of consumers he said in 
a 66page decision monday 
about 10 percent of american households use answering machines 
he said 
besides voice messaging as it is called the bell companies 
also could provide electronic mail services which allow 
computertocomputer transfer of messages greene said 
in addition he outlined a set of computer gateway functions 
the companies can provide to guide a computer user to various 
information services but he restricted these functions to services 
like data transmission billing management and services that enable 
different computers to speak to each other 
in so doing he refused to retreat from his september ruling in 
which he said phone companies could transmit information services 
but could not generate or manipulate the content of the information 
the bell companies generally praised greenes decision as a 
first step toward making a wide range of information services 
available to the public but they said the judge didnt go far 
enough 
we view this as a start but only a start we still are not 
allowed to provide content for information services a bellsouth 
statement said 
the bell companies have lobbied heavily for full participation 
in the information services market so they could provide services 
that would enable consumers with personal computers to bank and 
shop from home make travel arrangements and even read newspapers 
bell atlantic chairman thomas e bolger said the company is 
particularly concerned that greene is continuing to forbid the 
bell companies from electronic publishing of yellow page phone 
directories 
though greenes decision lifts the legal barrier to the bell 
companies offering of voice messaging and electronic mail the 
companies still would need state and federal regulatory approval 
before they could offer the services to consumers 
industry experts and bell company officials say the computer 
software for these services has been developed and could be offered 
to consumers in some parts of the country within one to two years 
greene who oversees the antitrust decree that stripped american 
telephone amp telegraph co of its bell operating companies four 
years ago reiterated in his ruling that the baby bells should not 
be permitted to compete in contentbased information services 
because they continue to control the local phone networks with 
this advantage he maintains the bells could control the 
information services market

fresh snow on the trail continued to slow 
the pace of the 1150mile iditarod trail sled dog race as mushers 
slogged their way down from the frosted peaks of the alaska range 
on monday jan masek of anchorage led a tightly grouped caravan 
of more than 20 mushers to rohn roadhouse a remote logcabin 
checkpoint 271 miles from the start in anchorage 
masek arrived at 310 pm followed eight minutes later by 
lavon barve of wasilla defending champion susan butcher arrived at 
320 pm followed closely by jerry austin of st michael and 
jacques philip of thomery france 
tim moerlein of kasilof pulled in at 331 pm trailed four 
minutes later by fourtime iditarod champion rick swenson in 
seventh position 
by 830 pm half the 52 mushers in the race had made it to 
rohn the rest were spread the 78 miles back to finger lake 
racers were slowed by up to 6 inches of new snow as they mushed 
down to rohn from rainy pass at 3400 feet the highest point along 
the trail 
rohn is a favorite point for mushers to take the 24hour layover 
required of all mushers sometime during the anchoragetonome race 
the isolated cabin provides a refuge from spectators and reporters 
and the dogs often are tired from crossing the rugged mountains 
the race which started at 9 am saturday has been slower than 
last years recordsetting pace when butcher reached nome after 11 
days 2 hours on the trail 
the race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed 
diphtheria serum to nome during an outbreak of the disease the top 
20 mushers will split a purse of 150000 the winner will get 
30000

panamas strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega is emphasizing class and racial distinctions in 
what appears to be an effort to rally support by polarizing society 
the humble the poor the blacks they are the utmost 
authority of this people noriega commander of the countrys 
15000strong defense forces told a crowd friday in the provincial 
town of carriazo 
his regime under mounting economic pressure from the united 
states has tried to characterize domestic opposition as rich and 
white in government newspapers and on official radio and tv 
stations noriegas opponents are termed oligarchs and 
sellouts 
whiteys to the firing squad says graffiti scrawled on 
walls in some of this capitals more affluent neighborhoods the 
message is signed vt for victoria torrijista a populist 
organization that reveres the late strongman omar torrijos 
in speeches noriega repeatedly invokes torrijos killed in a 
1981 airplane crash as inspiration for his defiance of washington 
vt like all groups supportive of the defense forces de facto 
rule is subsidized by the government according to former 
government officials now at odds with noriega 
panama with 22 million people is a racially mixed nation with 
african indian and european heritage as is the case throughout 
latin america people of european or predominantly european 
heritage are generally better off than descendants of those their 
forefathers conquered or enslaved 
compared with the rest of the region there is a relatively 
large middle class but there is also a big gap between rich and 
poor 
the national civic crusade an opposition alliance of about 200 
business professional political and labor groups has struggled 
to overcome the popular perception of it as representative of 
limited and privileged interests 
in the dining room of the opulent marriott hotel ernesto 
gonzalez de la lastra a leader of the crusade rose in response to 
a question about the government claim it is oligarchic 
gonzalez de la lastra in stylish clothes a rolex watch 
gleaming on his wrist and gold chain around his neck escorted 
foodworkers union official martin gonzalez in humbler garb to 
the table 
ill let don martin answer that said the president of the 
association of panamanian executives 
oligarchy means government by the few said the union man 
from a workingclass district just outside the capital of panama 
city so the defense forces and their government is the real 
oligarchy 
noriega does not hold progovernment demonstrations at the 
marriott and those who attend rallies supporting him are poorer 
than the drivers of the cars that join the crusades occasional 
protest caravans through town but the opposition has significantly 
broadened its appeal 
noriega tries to represent himself as the standardbearer of 
the poor said dedys ramos saleswoman at a clothing store in the 
downtown area but it is the poor who suffer more than anyone 
because of him 
from a lowerclass neighborhood mrs ramos earns just above the 
minimum wage of 150 a month and is an adamant opponent of the 
regime 
referring to the beginnings of hardship including the closure 
of banks last week resulting from us economic pressure on 
panama she said 
he noriega is not going to go without he has food and a 
roof but what about those abuelitos little grandfathers who 
cant cash their paltry pension checks thats why you can see me 
out there waving my white hankie with the civilistas civic crusade 
backers 
supporters of the civic crusade which has spearheaded 
opposition to noriega since its formation in june wave white 
handkerchiefs at their demonstrations 
a gallup poll taken in august indicated that nearly 75 percent 
of panamanians would like to see noriega out 
a power struggle earlier this month between noriega and ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle sparked the current crisis 
noriega loyalists in the national assembly dismissed delvalle 
feb 26 a day after delvalle had tried to fire noriega 
noriega was indicted last month in florida on federal drug 
trafficking charges he has denied those accusations

cosi fan tutte may be difficult to sing but 
one wouldnt have known that from the performance given monday 
night as the mozart opera was heard at the metropolitan opera for 
the first time in three years 
because all the singers paid such rapt attention to their vocal 
lines instead of tossing them off the opera in which two men on 
a dare disguise themselves as foreigners and woo each others 
sweetheart was more serious than it sometimes is and it was sung 
glowingly 
one felt the womens real attempts not to fall for the new men 
and the mens pain when they did in contrast to what happened in 
the 198485 season this time the couples paired up as they began 
last time they stayed as they had switched around 
the cast of six principals provided a gem of an evening as james 
levine conducted 
dame kiri te kanawa from gisborne new zealand sang fiordiligi 
susan quittmeyer of new york impressed as one who should be 
heard again when she made her met debut earlier this season in 
the tales of hoffmann that impression was correct as 
dorabella she held her own beside dame kiri they made a splendid 
pair and blended beautifully 
also splendid were the suitors baritone hakan hagegard of 
karlstad sweden engaged to fiodiligi and tenor david rendall of 
london engaged to dorabella 
it was good to have hagegards fine voice back at the met he 
last was heard here as wolfram in tannhauser four years ago 
rendall is a veteran in cosi at the met and sounds even better 
in it than before his voice abosolutely floated 
carlos feller from tarnopol poland made his met debut as don 
alfonso who bets the two men that their sweethearts wont stay 
true to them the bass has been a member of the cologne opera since 
1969 his tones are round and open and he seemed right at home he 
has sung the part at the glyndbourne festival and the washington 
opera and recorded it 
dawn upshaw from nashville was another delight as the maid 
she was singing instead of heikyung hong who was originally 
announced 
set designer hayden griffin solved the problem of an opera with 
six principal singers on a huge stage by setting action inside a 
large wooden frame on the met stage simply and effectively side 
panels were turned for indoor or outdoor scenes 
the evening had a minor problem with hats in the first scene 
dame kiri had difficulty taking hers off then it fell to the 
floor then the easel on which miss quittmeyers hat rested 
clattered over later hagegards fur busby fell off but nobody 
missed a beat

washington state has filed suit in federal 
court to challenge a navy claim that its civilian shipyard 
employees are barred by the federal hatch act from participating in 
todays presidential precinct caucuses 
us district judge jack tanner promised a ruling this morning 
the states suit contends that prohibiting federal workers from 
speaking at their party caucuses unconstitutionally violates their 
right to free speech said david bryant a spokesman for the 
washington secretary of states office 
bryant said the suit asks tanner to clarify the intent of the 
hatch act by interpreting conflicting sections of the 
regulations 
a bill to revise the hatch act and allow workers to participate 
in partisan political activities on their own time overwhelmingly 
passed the us house of representatives last year it is still 
pending in the senate 
the hatch act regulates political activities of federal workers 
officials at the puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton told 
workers recently they can attend the political caucuses scheduled 
in neighborhoods across washington state tonight but cannot 
discuss candidates 
in washington the precinct caucuses are the first step in the 
monthslong process leading up to a selection of delegates to the 
national presidential nominating conventions this summer at stake 
ultimately 73 democratic national convention delegates and 41 gop 
delegates 
the caucuses provide the only opportunity for most washington 
voters to express a preference for a presidential candidate 
obviously addressing the caucus is part of the activity 
said james sommerhauser representing professional and technical 
engineers local 12 in bremerton but most federal employees are 
so intimidated by the hatch act theyre afraid to participate 
sommerhauser said his union represents 1800 federal workers at 
the yard and elsewhere in kitsap county the yard employs 11600 
people 
rep norm dicks dwash whose district includes the shipyard 
said over the weekend that the navys outrageous claim that its 
civilian shipyard employees cant participate in the caucuses is 
one more good reason to change the hatch act 
dicks commented after leaders of both major political parties 
said they thought the navy order violated free speech guarantees 
shipyard spokesman bruce andrae earlier defended the order on 
the basis of the hatch act 
that law includes one provision allowing a government employee 
to express his opinion as an individual privately and publicly on 
political subjects and candidates 
but another provision cited by the navy forbids addressing a 
convention caucus rally or similar gathering of a political party 
in support of or in opposition to a partisan candidate for public 
office 
yard workers learned of the issue when they read a page 1 
article in the feb 25 edition of the base newspaper that said 
when the caucus discussion in favor of one candidate or another 
is held you may not participate 
laura baumgaertner a spokeswoman for the washington dc 
office of the merit system protection board which enforces the 
law agreed the law bars government workers from speaking up at 
caucuses

the soviet unions surprise call for 
security council condemnation of the iraniraq war of the 
cities was greeted by western skepticism and renewed us calls 
for an arms embargo against iran 
iraq said the un body should stick to its ceasefire 
resolution while iran supported the soviet proposal and called 
again for condemnation of iraq 
under the circumstances the security council has to do 
something in order to eliminate the damage of the further 
escalation of the military conflict between iran and iraq soviet 
ambassador alexander m belonogov told reporters monday after 
closeddoor security council consultation 
but when asked whether the soviet union would approve an arms 
embargo he did not reply directly and said more diplomatic efforts 
were needed 
iran and iraq fighting a 7yearold war have fired dozens of 
missiles at each others cities since last tuesday killing 
hundreds of civilans 
us ambassador herbert okun told reporters after council 
consultations that a soviet resolution on the war of the cities 
should not undercut or erode security council resolution 598 of 
july 20 which demanded an immediate ceasefire and provided for 
sanctions against the belligerents 
we dont need a new resolution we need observance of the 
resolution which is already in front of us he said 
the united states has been pushing for an arms embargo against 
iran and the 15member security council is working on an embargo 
but it has not been approved 
iran on monday again called on the security council to condemn 
iraq for escalating the latest round of missile bombardment of 
tehran and baghdad 
iraq is trying to spoil the atmosphere for a political 
settlement by escalating the current conflict said irans acting 
ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati 
the iraqi ambassador ismat kittani told reporters after the 
council session that his government will insist the council act 
within resolution 598 and that other action sought by the soviet 
union be secondary 
moscow has been under international pressure to agree to 
punitive action against iran or both belligerents it has been 
wooing iran and is reluctant to impose an embargo against the 
tehran government 
western diplomats said the new soviet proposal might be intended 
to deflect world criticism delay an arms embargo resolution by the 
council and portray moscow in a positive light as an initiator of a 
strong peace proposal 
some of the missiles used by both iran and iraq have been made 
in the soviet union according to experts but the soviet union 
denies that iraq is using sovietmade missiles in its bombardment 
of tehran 
the soviet ambassador said he expected a meeting on the soviet 
request today or wednesday but none was scheduled

with a soviet deadline drawing closer pressure is 
mounting on negotiators seeking a settlement to end the 9yearold 
war in afghanistan 
it remained uncertain monday whether pakistan which is 
representing the afghan guerrillas and does not recognize the 
sovietbacked afghan government will drop its demand for a 
broadbased transitional government to replace the existing regime 
after soviet troops withdraw 
the transitional government could ensure the safe return of more 
than 5 million refugees from pakistan and iran because guerrillas 
vow to fight on if the sovietbacked government remains in power 
sources close to the talks which continue today said the 
afghan government has shown some flexibility giving hope that a 
compromise could be worked out perhaps with pakistan signing the 
pact in return for assurances that an interim government would be 
formed within weeks 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev says moscow will begin 
withdrawing its estimated 115000 soldiers in midmay if the accord 
is signed by midmarch 
pakistani president zia ulhaq was quoted monday as saying an 
afghan peace accord must and will be signed soon 
there is no question of the accord not going through zia 
was quoted as telling the gulf news a united arab emirates 
newspaper allowing it to be dropped is no option 
pakistans chief representative in the peace talks acting 
foreign minister zain noorani said islamabad hopes for soviet 
cooperation even though his country wants an interim government to 
replace the sovietbacked regime 
it is in their interest too to see that there is peace and 
calm after they leave said noorani after talks resumed monday 
after a weekend recess 
a representative of the largest group in the sevenparty 
alliance of moslem guerrillas reiterated on monday that the 
resistance is determined to fight on if a peace deal is struck on 
moscows terms 
speaking at a news conference professor abdul kadir kariab said 
signing the settlement in the present shape will be a historic 
treason to the afghan people which he said was mourning 13 
million dead 
sources close to the unsponsored talks who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said negotiators seemed to remain 
cautiously optimistic that a peace package can be tied up by next 
week 
they said the slow pace with monday meetings only during the 
morning did not indicate a deadlock 
the talks moved speedily last week with agreement announced 
friday on the timetable and logistics of the proposed soviet troop 
withdrawal from afghanistan this had been according to un 
mediator diego cordovez the last major difference of substance

the state department has confirmed that the 
soviet union is not allowing lithuanianamerican povilas 
peciulaitis to emigrate despite a statement last december that he 
would be free to leave according to rep edward feighan 
feighan dohio urged secretary of state george p shultz to 
quickly intervene and monday requested a meeting with soviet 
ambassador yuri dubinin he also sent a letter to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev asking that the matter be resolved quickly 
they have the audacity to tell us now that it was a mistake 
feighan said of the soviets if the soviets think im going to 
stand by and meekly accept this broken promise they had better 
think again 
peciulaitis 64 was born in lithuania and exiled to siberia for 
22 years but his parents were naturalized american citizens

the justice departments nazihunting unit has 
identified 9800 people as former concentration camp guards and 
says it will have them placed on the immigration watch list of 
individuals to be barred from the united states 
the office of special investigations compiled the names with the 
assistance of a sophisticated new computer database 
names of suspected criminals and nazi persecutors are 
systematically checked against immigration records to determine if 
they are in the united states 
the names of individuals not found to be in this country are 
included in the watch list to prevent them from entering 
a provision of a federal law known as the holtzman amendment 
was invoked when austrian president kurt waldheim was placed on the 
watch list last year following a decision by attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
osi has listed thousands of such people in the past few years 
but the 9800 now to be placed on the watch list of the us 
immigration and naturalization service for serving as 
concentration and death camp guards is probably the greatest 
number to be added at one time said the offices chief neal

interested in a staple gun that joins broken 
bones how about a ceramic sushi knife that leaves no trace of that 
unpleasant metallic aftertaste or maybe a robot caddy for golfing 
these and other innovations are on display at this years 
national design and engineering show intended to give engineers a 
vision of products of the future said jim greif a show 
spokesman 
the theme of the maze of exhibits at the mccormick place 
exposition center is the impact of product design on global 
competitiveness greif said 
although our exports have gone up since the dollars decline 
they havent gone up nearly as much as people had predicted 
greif said most american companies are not geared for selling 
abroad 
take refrigerator exports for example 
the american refrigerator market was basically killed off 
because an 18cubicfoot fridge wont fit in a typical kitchen in 
developing countries said another show spokesman dave dasgupta 
if you send these bulky things abroad you dont have a market 
for it he said by contrast when the japanese began selling 
cars in the united states they totally redesigned the interiors to 
suit americans larger physiques and longer legs 
the fourday show which began monday and is sponsored by the 
american society of mechanical engineers features exhibits by 763 
companies from 40 states japan canada austria and britain 
among the more unusual products featured is the japanesemade 
ceramic knife 
developed by kyocera corp of kyoto the knife is used by 
restaurants in japan but has not been marketed to consumers in this 
country said joe lewis a district sales manager for kyoceras 
american subsidiary 
the 35 knife is made of zirconia a ceramic material that is 
tougher than ordinary ceramics lighter than steel sharp enough to 
slice flesh and cuts a smoother less jagged line than ordinary 
knives lewis said 
the staplizer surgical staple gun introduced about a year ago 
is being used by scores of hospitals in the united states and 
abroad said design engineer edward p skwor who developed it for 
the orthopedic products division of 3m in st paul minn 
with the press of a trigger the handheld gun punches 
officesized staples into a broken bone helping it heal in place 
skwor said the staples arent removed 
staples allow the surgeon to do his job quicker and easier 
skwor said when those patients are back on their feet and if 
their budgets arent quite depleted they might find use for the 
2350 robot golf caddy a remotecontrolled device resembling a 
grownup tricycle 
the golfer simply attaches a small electronic transmitter to his 
waistband and the caddy follows him around the course carrying 
golf clubs balls and even highballs while keeping a proper 3 feet 
to 4 feet behind said bill reilly chief electronic engineer at 
gettig engineering in spring mills pa

lawyers for a youth accused of bludgeoning 
a classmate to death for a thrill rested their case after 
psychiatrists gave conflicting testimony about whether the 
defendant had a chronic psychotic disorder 
closing arguments were expected to be delivered this afternoon 
rod matthews 15 of canton has admitted killing 14yearold 
shaun ouillette but defense attorneys contend matthews was unable 
to control himself because of a mental disorder aggravated by his 
use of a drug prescribed to hyperactive youths 
prosecutors say matthews who is on trial as an adult clubbed 
ouillette to death with a baseball bat for a thrill 
classmates have testified that matthews took them to view the 
body in a wooded area where it remained for three weeks after the 
november 1986 killing 
dr kenneth holbert director of the states gaebler childrens 
center in waltham testified that while matthews has had a 
longterm mental illness that may have contributed to his behavior 
he should have been able to control his actions the day he killed 
ouillette 
i dont believe he was suffering from a chronic psychotic 
disorder holbert said he could have used his cognitive 
strengths to behave in another manner 
but dr bernard yudowitz of belmonts mclean hospital said 
matthews was suffering from an atypical psychosis which in every 
manner impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the standards 
of law 
matthews first decided to kill someone after viewing the 
videotape faces of death which shows animal and human killings and 
tortures said yudowitz he said matthews use of the drug ritalin 
may have made it harder for him to control himself 
matthews did not kill for reasons of vengeance but to get rid 
of the urge to kill said yudowitz a former director of 
bridgewater state hospital 
yudowitz said he knows of hundreds of cases in which children 
and adults are misdiagnosed as hyperactive and given ritalin 
there is no way of knowing what the exact effect ritalin had 
on matthews said yudowitz there was a distinct possibility it 
contributed to a loss of impulse control he said 
assistant norfolk county district attorney peter casey 
questioned the methodical manner with which matthews approached the 
killing of ouillette and the coverup of the killing 
yudowitz said that the methodical nature of the act in no way 
contradicts the fact that rod matthews is an extremely sick 
individual its consistent with this boy having a disturbed mind 
former friends have said matthews told them he wanted to see 
what it was like to kill someone they said he named several 
potential victims before settling on ouillette 
the teenagers testified last week about viewing ouillettes 
body only hours after a prethanksgiving pep rally then bicycling 
with matthews to a shopping mall pizza parlor for a snack

the governing democratic justice party 
declared its new set of election laws passed early tuesday despite 
attempts by members of the opposition to disrupt the national 
assembly session 
the bill was passed in less than a minute after a plenary 
session was called at 210 am 
deputy speaker chang sungman declared it passed when members of 
the governing party on the floor said no objection 
opposition lawmakers had tried to stop passage by occupying the 
speakers platform since the previous night a pushingandshoving 
contest began when some governing party memebrs tried to remove 
them 
chang had to use a back door to reach the podium 
the governing party has 160 of the 276 seats in the national 
assembly more than the simple majority required to pass the bill 
assembly officials said they could not say immediately how many 
governing party lawmakers were present when the bill was declared 
passed but most were believed to be there 
opposition lawmakers protested the passage but the spokesman 
for the governing party said it was unavoidable because the new 
constitution requires legislative elections to be held by april 28 
the trouble was caused by a lastminute opposition demand to 
change some parts of the bill including the the total number of 
lawmakers poll watching in barracks and campaign methods 
a new system of electing one lawmaker in each constituency 
instead of two is at the heart of the proposed changes that would 
handicap the governing party in big cities and the opposition in 
rural areas where there are far more election districts 
the new bills would increase membership in the national assembly 
to 299 
under the proposals 224 members would be chosen by direct 
popular vote and 75 under a proportional system based on each 
partys total vote the opposition wants to increase the number of 
lawmakers to more than 330 
the new legislation also limits the number of campaign rallies 
in any district to three joint meetings including all candidates 
it bans any rallies by individual parties prohibits street 
campaigning with loudspeakers and would exclude appearances by 
national political leaders 
opposition leaders said they would fight to overturn the 
sections of the law that limit campaigning but it was unclear how 
they could succeed 
differences on election laws have caused friction between the 
two main opposition parties they hope to merge in time for the 
legislative election to avoid the defeat they suffered in 
decembers presidential ballot by running rival candidates 
they agreed on the new election formula last week but a dispute 
over future leadership created a new split 
kim youngsams reunification democratic party said rival kim 
daejung must take a back seat in a new party but kim daejungs 
party for peace and democracy described the demand as meddling in 
private matters

dr william masters and virginia johnson have 
created a stir in the medical community with their latest book but 
thats nothing new after more than 30 years of pioneering research 
into human sexuality 
criticism of the couples new book crisis heterosexual 
behavior in the age of aids focused monday on its claim that the 
epidemic is running rampant in the heterosexual community 
the authors acknowledged using a relatively small and 
unscientifically chosen sample of sexually active heterosexuals 
but said they had enough information to sound an alarm about a 
group that may not realize how much it is at risk 
their first landmark book human sexual responses is said 
to have radically changed the way sex is viewed 
research for that book began in 1957 with an unprecedented 
sevenyear study of sexual response research that included the 
observation of volunteers and prostitutes engaged in intercourse or 
masturbation 
many credit their research with helping spur the socalled 
sexual revolution and opening up human sexuality as a topic for 
mainstream newspapers and magazines 
in 1970 masters and johnsons book human sexual inadequacy 
was a best seller it carried the authors assertion that 79 
percent of their female patients treated for inability to reach a 
climax had responded successfully to therapy originated by masters 
and johnson 
the book brought great attention to the masters and johnson 
institute of st louis a nonprofit clinic where couples receive 
therapy for sexual dysfunction 
in the early 1980s two pyschologists from berkeley calif 
bernie zilbergeld and michael evans challenged the masters and 
johnson claims of treatment success rates of nearly 80 percent the 
critics said the couple had failed to disclose the criteria used 
for evaluating success 
other therapists said they were unable to duplicate the masters 
and johnson success record even when using the couples techniques 
evans and zilbergeld made their first assault in psychology 
today in august 1980 accusing masters and johnson of research so 
flawed by methodological errors and slipshod reporting that it 
fails to meet customary standards even their own for evaluation 
research 
zilbergeld claimed that in 1982 he and evans met masters at a 
professional conference and that masters spelled out his success 
criteria for treatment of sexual dysfunction in women the woman 
should reach climax at least once during the twoweek intensive 
therapy period and at least once again during a fiveyear followup 
period 
masters has since denied making any such statement he also has 
lashed out at critics and defended his research 
in a field plagued by real and troubling problems which 
deserve the best effort of the best minds it is indeed unfortunate 
that we must devote any energy to absurd allegations masters 
said as he defended his research before a scientific forum in 
washington dc a few years ago 
masters graduated from the university of rochester medical 
school and did his residency in 1943 at maternity hospital in st 
louis he then joined the faculty of the washington university 
medical school in st louis 
masters met johnson when the schools placement office sent her 
to interview for a job in the obstetrics and gynecology department 
they began working together jan 2 1957 and married jan 7 
1971 both had been married before 
johnson who once described herself as a perpetual student 
said she pursued an advanced degree in social anthropology until 
about age 50 when she gave up 
just when i got things going academically he would start 
something spectacular and he would suggest that i might be on hand 
for it

monday on overseas markets where traders sold dollars to buy 
british pounds because of higher interest rates in britain 
the us currency rose slightly during tokyo trading because of 
profittaking and covering of dollarshort positions by traders 
they added 
a lack of followup selling from corporate players including 
japanese exporters is prompting traders to cover short positions 
said masaharu takenaka a senior currency trader for the bank of 
tokyo 
the weaker dollar dragged down prices on the stock exchange 
where traders stayed on the sidelines waiting for a market 
adjustment following recent sharp gains 
the market is clearly very tired said ron napier a vice 
president at salomon brothers he said rising interest rates also 
have dampened buying sentiment in tokyo weve seen a very dull

a 12state study found that advanced math 
and science courses and family income were more important factors 
than ethnicity in how hispanic high school students scored on 
college entrance tests 
the study of 1928 hispanic and nonhispanic white students 
presented monday to the national association of secondary school 
principals also found that scores of both groups increased with 
the size of schools they attended 
george a chambers professor of educational administration at 
the university of iowa and researcher phyllis s peterson studied 
1987 scores on the american college test the predominant college 
admission test in 28 states 
the purpose of the study was to compare how hispanic students 
and caucasian students score when the two groups are similarly 
situated chambers said 
students in the study were from arizona california colorado 
florida illinois kansas louisiana nevada new mexico oklahoma 
texas and utah 
the students were divided equally among two groups identified as 
caucasian and hispanic which included two subdivisions of 
mexicanamericans and puerto ricans cubans and others 
the study created 964 pairs of one hispanic and one nonhispanic 
white student matched on the basis of 13 common attributes high 
school family income range mathematics courses algebra 1 
algebra 2 geometry trigonometry calculus science courses 
general science biology chemistry physics gender and number 
of siblings 
according to the study the us average composite act score is 
152 for mexicanamericans 166 for the puertoricancuban group 
and 196 for nonhispanic whites the act is scored on a scale of 
one to 36 and is taken annually by more than 1 million students 
when matched or similarly situated the nonhispanics had a 
mean score of 187 compared with 167 for the mexicanamerican 
group a difference of just two points instead of the national 
difference of 44 points 
the nonhispanics scored 198 and puerto ricancuban students 
scored 189 when similarly situated a difference in composite 
score points of just 09 rather than the three points in the us 
average 
in addition chambers said the statistical analysis found that 
course work is more important than the level of income in 
determining scores 
he said however that the higher the income level the greater 
the tendency for a student to take advanced courses that is 
probably because of factors such as the expectations of parents who 
have college educations he said 
its not income necessarily in and of itself that makes the 
difference rather its the things that result from income 
chambers said 
so we need to find a way to raise the expectations we must 
overcome this force of income 
the study also found that when schools were grouped into five 
categories according to the size of the graduating class ranging 
from less than 200 to 900 or more hispanic and nonhispanic scores 
went up with size possibly because the larger schools have an 
expanded curriculum each recorded an overall gain of two points 
while many believe big is bad if you look at the data here 
it suggests big is better chambers said 
the principals association which was meeting here this week 
represents 38000 educators in middle junior high and high schools 
nationwide

fuming and sputtering the senate is writing a 
new chapter in the long and tumultuous history of the legislative 
filibuster 
actually the chapter is written but the fuming and sputtering 
about it continue unabated 
the other side needs to vent itself from time to time and 
this is one of those occasions said sen alan simpson rwyo 
the senates acting minority leader as senate republicans engaged 
in four hours of complaint about it last week 
crybaby stuff exclaimed senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva who initiated the order to the senate 
sergeantatarms to compel the attendance of absent senators 
the facts 
on feb 23 after midnight as the senate was deep into an 
oldfashioned allnight republicanled filibuster against a 
congressional campaign financing bill sought by majority democrats 
an arrest warrant was issued for gop senators whose flight from the 
senate chamber prevented the quorum needed to do business 
such a warrant was issued on sen bob packwood rore who had 
locked himself in his senate office packwood was carried onto the 
senate floor feet first and the quorum was established 
keystone cops republican senators cried 
a low comedy about a legislature in a banana republic 
steamed new york republican sen alfonse damato 
i am afraid we are playing a giant game of gotcha to see 
who can get the other side said sen daniel evans rwash 
under this arrest warrant for senators does the 
sergeantatarms have the right to enter my home evans asked 
does he have the right to seize me from my bed for heavens 
sake in order to return me to the senate floor 
the rules permit us to delay things for endless periods of 
time and to stay here all night and to arrest each other and if 
all we do is to exhaust what is permitted under the rules then we 
create real havoc said sen john c danforth rmo 
why should a us senator be arrested for less cause than a 
common criminal asked sen arlen specter rpa 
hold on said sen george mitchell dmaine a former federal 
judge the warrant was issued only to compel packwoods attendance 
on the senate floor that is do that which the senator was 
elected to do 
there was nothing criminal about it mitchell said 
the rule in question is based on the provision in the 
constitution establishing a simple majority of the house and the 
senate as the number needed to establish a quorum to do business 
and authorizing a smaller number to compel the presence of absent 
members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may 
provide 
each house has so provided and when virtually all republican 
senators disappeared the sergeantatarms was authorized to compel 
their presence hence the packwood arrest 
led by specter several republican senators demanded the rules 
be changed to bar the arrest of senators between the hours of 11 
pm and 8 am among other things 
byrd said that would cement in stone the ability of senators 
to stop any action simply by hiding in their offices 
the senate arrest was not a game byrd said it was not a 
laughing matter 
imagine senators who are supposed to be grownup people 
adults elected by the people to serve here and most senators 
would have given their right arm to serve here imagine seeing 
them run down the hall run when they see the sergeantatarms 
they made a calculated decision to run and hide barricade their 
offices put chairs against the doors 
now they want to cry about it byrd said it was not the 
arrest that caused us to look bad it was the spectacle of senators 
running to avoid coming to the senate floor we are not elected 
to play games like children 
the complaints and the counter complaints rolled on and finally 
there was a final complaint 
the arrest warrants that were written but not served had been 
destroyed 
many republican members said they wanted copies as mementos 
never in my 63 years have i had an arrest warrant issued 
evans told the senate 
because it was unique i asked if i could have a copy so that i 
could put it in my scrapbook and have it available to show my 
children and my grandchildren he said 
now i find they are somehow not available

a woman who built an 80ton wooden ark from 
salvaged timber is dismantling part of the vessel in an effort to 
beat a court deadline ordering it off a churchs property 
but kea tawana who calls the ark her lifes sweat and 
blood says she needs more time to move the 86footlong craft 
which has been termed a work of art by the american museum of folk 
art but an eyesore by the city 
its consumed 20 years of my life short of a miracle the 
ark is doomed tawana said 
tawana had been working under a march 31 court deadline to move 
the ark from the parking lot of the humanity baptist church to 
newark bay threequarters of a mile away superior court judge 
harry a margolis recently extended the deadline until april 15 
but tawana who says she built the ark from oak hemlock and 
pine to live in not for religious reasons says she needs more 
time to dismantle part of it for the move and obtain coast guard 
approval of the ships seaworthiness 
bad weather this winter prevented work on the ship from 
continuing tawana said adding that she will ask margolis at a 
march 22 hearing for a 90day extension april 15 does not give 
me enough time to render the ship floatable 
tawana said she plans to sail the ark to the great lakes region 
and live there although she did not say where 
newark officials have long wanted the ark torn down the city 
went to court over the issue saying it was an eyesore and health 
hazard and violated zoning laws 
however margolis last spring prohibited the city from 
destroying it after the american museum of folk art in new york 
city wrote to mayor sharpe james and gov thomas h kean urging 
them to preserve the structure 
the ark is a very important and very rare example of urban 
folk art expression said didi barrett the museums director of 
publications 
the humanity baptist church had allowed tawana to live on the 
property as a caretaker in a ramshackle house next to the ark until 
last year when it ended the relationship saying that the court 
battle over the ark cost too much 
the city wants to drive me out and turn this over to 
developers for condominiums tawana said 
but audrey davidson assistant corporate counsel for newark 
said zoning laws are the issue 
i have no idea whether the city is trying to build something 
there all i know is that the structure there is illegal ms 
davidson said 
tawana said she will cut 4 feet off beams in the ark to reduce 
the vessels height to 17 feet from 21 feet so it will not get 
snagged on cables running over streets on the trip to newark bay

the governing party rammed an election 
law that limits campaigning through the legislature today over the 
objection of opposition lawmakers who seized the podium and started 
a scuffle 
leaders of the governing democratic justice party protected by 
guards ended hours of furious arguments and scuffling by suddenly 
calling for a vote and declaring the bill passed before the 
opposition could react 
the governing party which has a strong majority in the national 
assembly passed the bill by a voice vote in a few seconds 
opposition lawmakers rushed to the podium to try to drag down 
vice speaker chang sungman and halt the vote but were blocked by 
assembly guards 
outraged opposition representatives screamed insults at 
democratic justice party leaders after they were caught by surprise 
the new law revises the assemblys constituency system to one 
lawmaker per district instead of two and clears the way for 
elections expected to be held in late april the number of seats 
will increase from 276 to 299 
the new law also limits the number of campaign rallies in any 
district to three joint meetings including all candidates it bans 
any rallies by individual parties prohibits street campaigning 
with loudspeakers and excludes appearances by national political 
leaders 
opposition leaders said they would fight to overturn the 
sections of the law that limit campaigning but it was unclear how 
they could succeed 
opposition lawmakers occupied the podium for almost three hours 
to prevent passage of the bill after dragging the vice speaker from 
his chair and scuffling with government legislators 
the government broke the deadlock when chang surrounded by 
guards suddenly took to the podium called for a voice vote and 
passed the bill 
kim taeryong spokesman of the opposition reunification 
democratic party said the governments actions proved it did not 
support democracy 
the bill contains various malicious clauses designed to steal 
votes he said after the bill was passed 
the government which had favored retention of the existing two 
member system changed its position after the opposition repeatedly 
blocked attempts in the assembly to pass a new election law the 
law had to be passed to hold elections scheduled to be held by 
april 
opposition leaders said the bill would place excessive 
restrictions on campaigning 
the opposition also wanted open counting of absentee ballots 
charging that the government has used absentee ballots in the past 
to rig elections 
the dispute which lasted for almost two months reflected the 
oppositions refusal to work with the government and deep divisions 
between the two sides 
opposition leaders continue to insist that president roh taewoo 
and the governing party won presidential elections in december 
through massive fraud some top opposition leaders have refused to 
recognize rohs election 
roh won with less than 50 percent of the vote because two 
opposition leaders split the opposition vote 
the new law is expected to diminish the governments electoral 
chances in urban areas where it lacks sufficient strength to win 
majorities the governing party had counted on coming in second in 
urban areas in the past to gain seats 
but the governing party is also expected to gain in rural areas 
under the new system since it is strongest in the countryside roh 
has promised broad democratic reforms to end decades of 
authoritarian rule and has said that elections will be fair and 
democratic 
the bill increases the number of electoral districts from 184 to 
224 and provides for one lawmaker per district 
the existing system whereby the winning party gets twothirds 
of 92 bonus seats also was changed so that it gets half of 75 
bonus seats with the rest being divided among other parties on the 
basis of votes 
the bonus system is designed to avoid deadlock in the assembly 
by giving the main party a clear majority

the new york post has officially become the 
property of real estate developer peter kalikow who paid 376 
million for the tabloid that has been losing money and circulation 
for years 
it is my intention to stop the financial losses of the new 
york post kalikow said monday in a statement after the papers 
transferring ownership were signed the paper will be a winner 
financially and editorially 
kalikow acquired the post after the papers 10 unions agreed to 
a 22 million in concessions which included a lastminute 3 
million gift from thenowner rupert murdoch 
the rescue of the post is nothing less than an historic 
moment kalikow said 
there was not one person involved in negotiations that did not 
go the extra mile in an effort to keep this great new york 
institution from disappearing i want to thank all of our unions 
and employees for their heroic efforts 
union leaders were to sign formal papers today and planned to 
meet with kalikow on thursday to get to know each other said 
george mcdonald president of the allied printing trades council 
which represents eight of the unions 
were delighted really delighted glad its all over 
murdoch who sold the paper to comply with federal regulations 
barring ownership of two media outlets in one city claimed he was 
losing 100000 a day on the post and lost 150 million in the 12 
years he owned it 
kalikow has pledged 2 million to promote the newspaper 
i am committed to expanding its readership base through 
millions of dollars in promotion adding features to the paper 
greatly expanding its investigative reporting and strengthening its 
advertising revenues to make the paper profitable on a longterm 
basis 
under murdoch whom kalikow called one of the great 
contemporary publishers the tabloid had a reputation for 
sensational coverage with blaring headlines and plenty of gossip 
new publisher peter price said my role is to make it work 
i think peter kalikow has made an enormous financial 
commitment and its my challenge and opportunity to put the pieces 
together and make a real business out of the post and not just a 
good newspaper price said 
spokesman howard rubenstein declined to say what specific 
changes kalikow and price would make in the appearance and content 
of the post the nations oldest continuously published daily 
newspaper founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton 
price however noted that the big difference between what we 
are able to do versus what others before us have tried to do is 
that peter kalikow and i share a sense of the city 
we are both singleminded about the new york post we are both 
singleminded about making this paper a permanent fixture in the 
new york city scene

sixtyyearold ahmed knew nothing about the holiday or strike 
but he knew he needed his 50 cents in daily earnings 
the turmoil of the parliamentary elections last week in which 
13 people died in clashes passed by ahmed who still has four 
children at home but he and the more than 80 million other 
bangladeshis who live below the poverty line still are caught up in 
its results 
the election made no immediate headway in ending the stalemate 
between president hussain muhammad ershad and major opposition 
parties demanding his ouster 
ershad whose jatiya party won a predictable parliamentary 
majority refuses to resign the opposition vows to keep up its 
nearly fourmonth campaign of general strikes that is eroding the 
already weak economy 
economic growth was an expected 5 percent this year but the 
strikes and severe floods last summer have reduced the projection 
to 2 percent 
we are in very bad shape said as mahmud president of the 
dhaka chamber of commerce and industry the politicians they 
dont think of or try to understand the impact on the economy 
mahmud said the 25 days of general strikes called since november 
last year were deeply affecting the countrys new garment industry 
and could scare off foreign investment 
the country of 105 million people has an estimated 30 percent 
unemployment and underemployment more than 80 percent of the 
people live below the poverty line defined by the world health 
organization as not earning enough for a diet of 1800 calories 
daily about 80 percent also are illiterate 
while mahmud talked in terms of longrange economic 
consequences abdul ghafoor saw more immediate effects of the 
political turmoil it means trouble in feeding his family 
ghafoor 45 drives a bicycle rickshaw and has a wife and six 
children he averages about 165 in earnings daily and says he 
does not work on a strike day for fear of being attacked by workers 
for opposition parties 
we have no savings we suffer that day he said 
ghafoor said he saw little hope that the election which ershad 
called in a move to compromise with the opposition would lead to 
such a compromise 
how can i think that any of these people care about us he 
asked no leader has done anything for the poor 
politicians and diplomats who talked about the election results 
on the basis of anonymity had more sophisticated judgments on the 
likelihood of a compromise but they also expressed doubts one 
could be achieved 
ershad a former general who took power in a bloodless coup in 
1982 still has strong backing from the army meaning another coup 
soon seems unlikely in bangladesh a military takeover is always a 
possibility since every change in government in the countrys 17 
years of independence has been achieved by coup 
the opposition which claims ershads 1986 election as president 
resulted from vote rigging has failed to unseat the 58yearold 
ershad despite the violent general strikes that led to at least 25 
deaths 
stepping up the violence could prompt ershad to reimpose the 
martial law in effect from 1982 to 1986 or could anger the public 
by devastating the economy

westerners in lhasa today said security 
forces had withdrawn from around the tibetan capitals main temple 
where monks led a violent weekend protest that beijing said left 
hundreds of police injured 
in the fullest official account yet of the rioting against 
chinese rule the chinese news service today said more than 300 
police were injured in the rioting saturday and sunday in lhasa 
previous official reports had said that one policeman was killed 
and 28 injured in a single day of rioting 
the fighting occurred in lhasa at the jokhang tibets holiest 
temple 
one westerner in lhasa a tibetanspeaking traveler said 
tibetans told him five tibetans and three chinese police were 
killed in daylong violence saturday the last day of a major prayer 
festival 
another traveler who arrived today chengdu 750 miles east of 
lhasa said officials told him two people were killed a chinese 
policeman who was pushed off a roof and a tibetan both travelers 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the china news service said 30 police officers were hospitalized 
with serious injuries and numerous civilians were hurt in the 
violence the second nationalist riots in lhasa since october 
in an eyewitness report seen in hong kong the agency claimed 
the disturbances were plotted by unidentified tibetans who had bags 
of rocks placed on top of buildings around the central barkhor 
marketplace it said buddhist monks on saturday poisoned tea given 
to officials and journalists who had to be hospitalized the 
report did not elaborate on their condition 
during the rioting local government and communist party 
officials were forced to slide down ropes from a secondstory 
office in the jokhang to escape enraged monks said the account by 
reporter geng jun he said the officials slid to safety just before 
the monks broke down the office door 
the report said some rioters set up barricades in barkhor 
marketplace on sunday morning and indiscriminately threw stones 
that injured numerous city residents 
one monk stood up and started shouting for independence and he 
was arrested the western traveler in lhasa said by telephone 
the monks started throwing stones the crowd just ran 
he said authorities hustled him and other foreigners to their 
hotels but when he left his room a few hours later to get food he 
encountered a clash in the square in front of the johkang 
i found myself in the middle of a skirmish some tear gas went 
off near me twenty to 30 tibetans were throwing stones at chinese 
soliders and the chinese soldiers were throwing stones back 
the traveler said the chinese did not open fire in that 
sense the chinese were showing a lot of restraint 
there have been no official figures given on arrests but 
unconfirmed reports have said hundreds were rounded up 
westerners in lhasa said johkang remained closed today but 
police on monday stopped blocking entry to the barkhor market 
square they said uniformed police had been replaced by dozens of 
plainclothes officers who closely followed the few foreign tourists 
in town and would not allow them to take pictures 
william tang assistant foreign manager at the lhasa hotel said 
guests were being told they could go to the square but at their 
own risk 
the violence was the first in lhasa since oct 1 when 2000 
tibetans led by monks burned down a police station facing jokhang 
temple police opened fire and at least 14 people were killed in 
the battle 
the dalai lama tibets exiled spiritual leader china blames for 
instigating the riots issued a statement from his office in new 
delhi on monday saying the courage of the tibetan people in 
expressing once again their dissatisfaction against chinese rule 
in spite of the obvious risk involved clearly reveal their 
desperation 
the dalai lama who fled following a failed uprising in 1959 
also called on tibetans to restrain from violence 
china says tibet has been part of the nation for centuries and 
claims it is making amends for past polices that suppressed tibetan 
customs and religion and destroyed many of their temples 
antagonisms remain strong however between the tibetans and the 
hans chinas ethnic majority who hold most of the top government 
posts in lhasa 
the western traveler said tibetans told him police beat two 
monks to death inside the jokhang several tibetans later carried 
the monks bodies around the square he said triggering further 
clashes

television and movie producers scrambled to 
hire replacement scriptwriters and urged strikers to cross picket 
lines today in an effort to keep hollywood game shows and soap 
operas on the air 
but the scriptwriters vowed to wait out the struggle as nearly 
2000 of them marched five abreast in front of 20th century fox 
studios monday the first day of a walkout over demands for higher 
fees and more creative control 
hollywood has treated writers like beanfield workers for 
years said screenwriter and sciencefiction author harlan 
ellison it begins with the dream without the dream on paper 
there is nothing 
the writers guild of america rejected sundays final offer by 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers and a 
strike was ordered for 9000 members 
the wga strike is the fourth since a 17week walkout in 1973 
the longest in 1981 lasted three months 
nick counter the alliances president and chief negotiator 
predicted the walkout may be a long one its the same kind of 
feeling as we had in 1981 he said this could go on even 
longer than that 
issues include demands by writers for a higher percentage of 
foreign market distribution fees and more control over scripts and 
a producers demand to scale back syndication fees for onehour 
television shows producers say new shows made for independent 
stations have dried up the rerun syndication market 
for some pickets like james l brooks whose writing credits 
include the films broadcast news and terms of endearment 
and televisions the mary tyler moore show a key battle was 
for creative control 
if you take creative rights from enough different groups you 
end up without a creation you end up with something else you end 
up with an exercise in marketing brooks said 
counter said producers may begin hiring temporary replacements 
for striking writers until a settlement is reached 
our companies are encouraging whoever wants to come forward to 
write these scripts he said urging union and nonunion writers 
to cross picket lines 
counter said nonguild writers were being sought to avoid having 
soap operas and game shows go to reruns the union said talk shows 
also would be among the first to suffer from the walkout 
however spokespersons for cbs and nbc said soap operas such as 
days of our lives as the world turns and the young and 
the restless shouldnt be affected soon because of stockpiled 
scripts 
its business as usual were prepared cbs spokeswoman 
janet storm said 
nbcs late night with david letterman and saturday night 
live already were on scheduled breaks this week the tonight 
show with johnny carson on monday featured guest host jay leno 
who used material prepared before the strike 
the guilds contract expired feb 29 the median annual income 
for writers is 40000 but about half of the wgas members are 
unemployed at any given time

and thought thats it goodbye

the attack the army said the guerrillas infiltrated from egypt 
while israeli officials were negotiating with the three 
guerrillas to try to end the standoff we tried to create a calm 
atmosphere stella bechar 46 who was hospitalized with multiple 
shrapnel and gunshot wounds told the daily jerusalem post each 
one had a gun a kalashnikov ready to shoot 
some of the israelis aboard the bus spoke some arabic 
i asked one of the guerrillas if he wanted some milk because 
he said he was thirsty mrs bechar said we even tried to joke 
with each other and we told each other that there is a god and we 
would get out of this alive 
as negotiations continued said fellow hostage daisy sorek 
the terrorists were getting more and more impatient and 
threatened to kill a hostage every half hour if a red cross 
negotiator was not summoned 
at one point he one of the guerrillas got a megaphone and 
became very very agitated he said over and over in arabic 
every halfhour one mrs sorek said 
the leader of the gang then called one passenger victor ram 
and ordered him to stand at the front of the bus sorek told the

iran and iraq today fired more missiles 
at each others capitals and iran accused the united states and 
france of helping iraq refit sovietdesigned missiles to give them 
enough range to hit tehran 
the charge was made by iranian parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani 
before the latest round of the socalled war of the cities 
began feb 29 iraq had been unable to hit tehran with 
surfacetosurface missiles because the city is nearly 300 miles 
from the iraqi border 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported that an 
iraqi missile crashed into a residential neighborhood of tehran 
early today killing or wounding several civilians and damaging 
a church 
staterun baghdad radio reported that iraqi gunners fired the 
missile into tehran a city of 6 million people less than an hour 
after iran claimed it had lobbed a projectile into baghdad 
iraqs news agency confirmed the latest iranian missile strike 
on a residential area in baghdad saying civilians including 
women children and eldery people were killed no figures were 
given 
irna also said revolutionary guards today shot a missile at a 
military center at amarah an iraqi town close to the border 
and halfway between baghdad and the southern port city of basra 
iraqi statements made no mention of the amarah strike 
the reports were monitored in nicosia 
iraq said it fired three missiles into tehran on monday and 
iran reported its revolutionary guards blasted baghdad with four 
missiles and launched a fifth at the northern city of mosul for the 
first time 
iraq confirmed only two missiles crashed monday in baghdad a 
city of 5 million killing or wounding many civilians including 
women and children 
iraq says it has fired 42 projectiles into tehran since the 
missile duel began when iran sent two missiles crashing into 
baghdad in retaliation for an earlier iraqi air raid on the tehran 
oil refinery 
iraq also has fired three missiles at the holy city of qom seat 
of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis religious hierarchy 
the iranians have reported more than 30 missiles have hit 
tehran they said revolutionary guards fired 25 longrange missiles 
on iraq during that period 23 of them on baghdad the iraqis have 
only acknowledged 19 hits on the capital and one on mosul 
both sides reported air raids on each others cities and 
artillery bombardment of border towns on monday 
irna said 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 people 
wounded in mondays iraqi missile attacks on tehrans residential 
areas it reported one missile demolished a clinic a school and 
several houses 
iran has listed at least 122 civilians killed and more than 300 
wounded in the iraqi missile blitz with more than 100 killed and 
more than 500 wounded in air raids over the last week the iraqis 
have reported heavy civilian casualties but gave no exact figures 
rafsanjani khomeinis representative on the supreme defense 
council which directs war policy said iranian experts who examined 
several unexploded missiles confirmed the projectiles were soviet 
scudbs tehran radio reported 
it became clear that although the missile is made in russia 
most of the eastern bloc countries manufacture or assemble this 
missile today and iraq can obtain it from other sources he said 
in an interview on the radio 
iran last week accused moscow of supplying iraq with the 
missiles triggering several violent protests outside the soviet 
embassy in tehran and the consulategeneral in the central city of 
isfahan the soviet union who along with france is main arms 
supplier of iraq denied the charge 
iraq said the missile used named al hussein after a 7th 
century shiite moslem saint was of its own design and production 
however western military analysts believe the missiles were 
scudbs fitted with the help of north korean experts with strapon 
boosters to give the projectile enough range to reach tehran 
but rafsanjani said the missiles fired at tehran were scudbs 
that have been clumsily tampered with in order to increase 
their range the scud normally has a range of 190 miles 
of course not the iraqis themselves for the iraqis are 
incapable of even tampering with these missiles no doubt the 
major powers did this such powers as the americans and france 
he said

panamanian embassy workers and private security 
men used a land rover to smash into and seize the panamanian 
consulate whose top diplomat had remained loyal to deposed 
president eric arturo delvalle 
police said they believed the six assailants including two 
representatives of panamanian ambassador guillermo vega entered 
the building monday night after using the jeep to break through its 
reinforced plate glass door 
the consul eduardo arango had refused to give up his post 
despite being fired for still recognizing delvalle 
the british broadcasting corp said the consulate staff had also 
remained loyal to delvalle who was ousted feb 26 after trying to 
dismiss gen manuel antonio noriega panamas military leader and 
de facto ruler 
control of panamas embassy in washington is also in dispute 
the reagan administration has been trying to force noriega to 
step down since the general was indicted on federal drug 
trafficking charges in florida last month 
the land rover driven by one of the british security men 
mounted the sidewalk smashed through the door into the lobby of 
the consulate which is about a mile from the panamanian embassy 
shortly after this several people left the building including 
three women believed to be secretaries and a number of security 
staff one glasspaneled front door was damaged no one was 
injured police said in a statement 
arango was at his london home at the time and was told about it 
by one of the consulate staff 
one consular official who was forced out tourism commissioner 
rolando domingo 24 said we were just working in there and then 
suddenly we heard a crash he said the jeep came through the 
glass door and then a group of men entered the building carrying 
large hammers 
they threatened us with hammers and one tried to hit my face 
they took my passport and documents then they pushed me down the 
stairs and out of the building domingo said 
police sealed off the area around the consulate in tudor street 
in the city londons financial district 
police said they entered the consulate after negotiations with 
panamanian government representatives they did not identify and 
left the building in the control of the ambassador and his security 
staff 
arango in a bbc interview condemned the forced entry as a 
thuggish way of behaving and an unbelievable way of doing things in 
a civilized country 
he was quoted by the british domestic news agency press 
association as saying he was prevented from entering the consulate 
after the seizure and that one of the men involved told him they 
were working for vega and carrying out orders from panama 
the agency also quoted arango as saying he had received letters 
from panama saying he was dismissed but ignored them british 
government officials said they were told on friday that arango was 
being fired as consul 
the bbc said arango was in panama at the time of delvalles 
ouster and has said he helped smuggle delvalle from his residence 
to a hiding place in the central american country 
arango said he would protest to the british foreign office and 
said the british driver of the land rover ought to be prosecuted 
the security guards involved work for gb security a private 
company based at sutton in south london 
a spokesman at the british foreign office who in accordance 
with british practice declined to be named said it was too early 
to say what action if any foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
might take over the incident

poufs ruffles frills and furbelows are 
banished from the fashion scene say the cream of italys designers 
showing their fallwinter collections in milan 
coming on strong is a cool calm and collected look that is both 
elongated and elegant pants play a major role in preference to 
last seasons mini skirts 
the new haughty look is one which is right up gianfranco 
ferres alley he has always designed with a highstepping female 
in mind rather than a romantic heroine 
in his show monday the dramatic shirts that are his signature 
had important stiffly upstanding collars that jutted forward into 
crumbcatcher folds 
actress ali mcgraw who was a guest at the show said i love 
them 
slim pants in smooth wools or crushed velvet provided the 
perfect accompaniment to these important shirts 
ferres color choice in scarlet black and white was as 
forceful as his fashion statement he even dyed beaver fur scarlet 
for blouses and detachable cuff collars that trimmed coats and 
jackets 
but one red touch he could have done without was the scarlet 
eyeshadow daubed on the models eyelids 
big winter coats were cut slim and straight and almost brushed 
the ankles jackets that were neat and short and minus collars were 
wrapped up in matching wool stoles 
and he had lots of little foxes running down the runway in a 
variety of guises spiralling round sleeves forming skirts and 
curling round necks and hemlines 
evenings were largely based on black looking good on 
longlength smartly tailored redingotes that flared into fullness 
from a lowered waistline white lace kerchiefs another mcgraw 
favorite spilling from collars and cuffs gave a dandified look 
earlier on monday leather fashions specialist mario valentino 
was another pants fan but with a difference he cut them newly 
widelegged and floppy stemming from a high waistline in supple 
suede 
accompanying jackets were also loose and boxy he took the 
padding out of shoulders on a handsome coat in calf that flared out 
to its near floorlength hemline 
and he struck a blow for the return to the straight and narrow 
with his superslender suit comprising a trim little jacket and 
pencilslim calflength skirt in glossy leather aviators jackets 
and top coats in dark chocolatae brown were treated to fur linings 
with ferre and versace now both creating couture fashions in 
addition to their lines of deluxe readymade styles there is news 
that the fashion house of andre laug which showed in milan sunday 
has also reversed its decision to no longer make clothes for 
private clients 
this house famed for its superb sartorial skills suspended the 
custommade side of the business for a brief period but now intends 
to reinstate it 
couture provides a fashion house with allure and gives 
invaluable promotional power that can aid other activities 
belonging to the same establishment 
milan shows swing into their third day today highlights are to 
include the fabulous furs of the famed fendi family

the justice department has given permission 
to unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in the north carolina 
republican presidential primary according to state gop chairman 
jack hawke 
the lastminute ruling clears up confusion that arose last week 
when a department official said the state party had failed to 
obtain necessary clearance to open its primaries to independents 
the department said its decision applied only to todays 
presidential primary and that the state republican party would have 
to submit another request for the policy to receive permanent 
approval 
we have constantly tried to show that were a party with an 
open door and want people to join us and this is just another 
step hawke said at a news conference 
hawke declined to predict how many unaffiliated voters would 
take advantage of the opportunity or which of the four republican 
presidential hopefuls stood to benefit most from the new policy

that have gone to the caucuses and they werent given the time of 
day unless they were insiders

virtually all the nations civilian political forces not 
directly linked to the armed forces or to the noriega regime joined 
in the alliance 
in london monday night panamanian embassy workers and private 
security men used a land rover to smash into and seize the 
consulate whose top diplomat had remained loyal to delvalle 
police reported no injuries though some consulate workers said 
they were threatened with hammers and left the building in control 
of panamanian ambassador guillermo vega 
consul eduardo arango acknowledged he had been fired for 
remaining loyal to delvalle who the united states still considers 
panamas president 
in a declaration issued in panama monday the opposition 
alliance said our principal objective is the establishment of 
a government of national reconciliation that guarantees justice a 
state of law liberty reconstruction of democratic institutions 
fiscal order economic development conditions for authentic 
democracy and the celebration of free open and honest elections 
elections are scheduled for may 1989

changes necessary for establishment of a legitimate democracy

pressured thenpresident nicolas ardito barletta who was declared 
winner in the 1984 election to resign in september 1985 
the alliance said a national reconciliation government would 
include representatives of political parties and other forces 
dedicated to the reestablishment in panama of a democratic order

the murder trial of a jobless handyman 
accused of killing seven women in his apartment and leaving their 
bodies to rot moved quickly into testimony after the defendant 
waived his right to a jury trial 
the defense and prosecution also declined to give opening 
statements monday in the case of harrison marty graham 
graham 28 waived a trial by jury as a panel waited to be 
interviewed then pleaded innocent to seven counts each of murder 
involuntary manslaughter and abuse of a corpse 
he and his mother agreed that a judge would be more objective 
than a jury grahams attorney joel moldovsky said after the 
court session the move is also expected to shorten a trial that 
had been expected to last up to three months 
assistant district attorney roger king moved for admission of 
all testimony and documents from a monthlong pretrial suppression 
hearing including a confession graham made to police in which he 
admitted strangling the seven women during sex common pleas judge 
robert latrone granted the request 
during the pretrial hearing moldovsky contending his client is 
mentally incompetent sought unsuccessfully to suppress the 
confession 
moldovsky said the confession was made in violation of his 
clients constitutional rights and after graham allegedly was 
beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation latrone ruled 
last week the confession was voluntary and that graham was 
competent to stand trial 
the first witness called by the prosecution acting city medical 
examiner robert catherman testified that all seven deaths were 
homicides however the cause of death due to the condition of the 
bodies was undetermined he said 
graham turned himself in a week after police discovered rotting 
bodies in his bedroom and leg and foot bones on the roof of the 
house in a philadelphia neighborhood notorious for drug dealing 
in the confession graham told police the bodies began piling up 
in his bedroom and he began having problems with maggots he also 
told of difficulty sleeping during the day because of big black 
birds on the roof outside his apartment eating the womans body 
there 
i had to stay high all the time the confession said 
moldovsky has indicated that his defense will be insanity

tenyearold kristin segal wanted to solve 
a universal problem so she decided to make the glue on stamps 
taste better by rubbing a banana across the back 
robbie cadle 10 hates carrying out the garbage so much that he 
has set out a project for himself motorized garbage cans that he 
can drive out to the street and back 
seth swanson 11 wants to make sure he can locate his dog at 
night and he is designing a nighttime dog collar with a light on 
it 
these and other ideas were developed by the fifthgraders at 
dommerich elementary school as part of the invent america program 
which seeks to boost the level of creativity and innovation in this 
country 
it may not be possible to teach creativity but the program 
believes that it can certainly be nurtured in schools 
the privately funded us patent model foundation in washington 
began invent america a little more than a year ago as part of an 
effort to boost the share of inventions patented in this country by 
americans 
the proportion of patents issued by the us patent office to 
americans has dropped from 89 percent in 1966 to 53 percent in 
1987 the remainder go to foreignborn inventors who want to 
protect their creations in this country 
the invent america class is taught at dommerich one day a week 
to each of five classes of gifted students in different grades by 
gil rowe 
he came here from ocoee elementary school where he started the 
program and had great success ocoee won four of invent americas 
nine state awards last year the most of any school in the country 
weve just kind of forgotten to teach the children the old 
american ingenuity says rowe 44 
elevenyearold seth is certain that the creativity class works 
like when you grow up if you become a scientist youll be a 
little bit better at it than someone who never had this before 
he said 
besides opening up the innovative process rowe says the 
program enhances students selfesteem one ocoee secondgrader who 
was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented 
a device that earned him his classmates admiration 
suddenly he became a famous inventor he just became a totally 
different individual rowe said 
only two orange county schools took part in the program last 
year but two dozen are involved this year as are others around 
the state 
four million pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade 
participated nationwide in 1987 about 13 percent of all students 
in those grades the foundation reported 
other inventions have ranged from a selfcleaning bathtub to 
salt dyed red so that people can know how much they use

a judge froze the remainder of a half million 
dollars donated to save livertransplant patient ronnie desillers 
after officials complained that his mother squandered money on a 
luxury waterfront apartment clothes and jewelry 
immediate and irreparable injury will result to assets of the 
estate of ronald desillers jr if maria desillers is permitted to 
withdraw the funds deposited in the account dade circuit judge 
francis j christie wrote in his order monday 
when ronnie died at childrens hospital of pittsburgh last april 
29 at age 7 an account in his name had accumulated 509913 state 
officials said the account balance on feb 17 was 239288 said 
fred kerstein assistant dade county state attorney 
our concern was that the remaining assets would be wasted 
kerstein said we wanted to safeguard those assets and let the 
court determine how theyll be distributed 
as recently as jan 19 25000 was withdrawn from the fund 
said a court document filed by state attorney general bob 
butterworth and state attorney janet reno of miami 
the state accusation said bank records indicated ms desillers 
spent at least 47000 on jewelry clothing furniture housing 
expenses an automobile and auto expenses 
ronnie who died last year while awaiting a fourth transplant 
attracted donations from around the country including 1000 from 
president reagan after news reports that money raised by his 
classmates had been stolen 
ms desillers who created a foundation to assist other children 
in need of organ transplants after her sons death denied 
squandering any of the donations 
why do they not say that money went to charity ms 
desillers told the associated press on monday night why do they 
not say that some of that money was assigned to me personally 
how come they dont say how much of that money went to kids 
she said she would straighten out the status of the frozen money 
in probate court and use the funds to provide organ transplants for 
two children 
there are two children that have less than six months to live 
and thats what i want to do with the money she said 
ms desillers lawyer harry robbins said his client maintains 
she never asked the public to donate money and thus was not legally 
a charity she also has said she was entitled to the money as 
ronnies sole heir 
ms desillers finances came under question when it was learned 
she lived in a luxury apartment building on biscayne bay and was 
driving a 1985 bmw equipped with a telephone she contends the car 
was secondhand and bought with a loan that the car telephone was 
a gift and the apartment doubled as her office 
ms desillers is being sued by childrens hospital for failing 
to pay 261189 of ronnies 424302 bill she has charged the 
hospital with giving poor care to her son

syria the strongest critic of us 
middle east policy has found positive elements in american 
efforts to reactivate the stalled process but remains suspicious of 
the initiatives goals sources say 
syrias leaders are consulting with jordan and studying 
proposals handed last week to president hafez assad by secretary of 
state george p shultz 
foreign minister farouk alsharaa is expected to fly to amman 
this week to discuss the plan after weekend contacts between assad 
and king hussein said the knowledgeable syrian sources who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
but they question whether the united states is serious about 
finding a comprehensive settlement to the arabisraeli conflict or 
is simply trying to end palestinian rioting in israelioccupied 
lands through promises of peace 
like all arab governments damascus supports the palestinian 
rebellion in the west bank and gaza strip unprecedented in the 
40yearold conflict that threatens washingtons middle east ally 
with a prolonged civil war 
more than 80 palestinians have been killed in the violence that 
has plagued the occupied territories since dec 8 in what arabs 
hail as the intafada or uprising there have been no israel 
fatalities in the rioting 
syria moscows main arab ally and a key player in the middle 
east remains suspicious of attempts to isolate issues involved in 
the quest for a settlement into separate negotiations a strategy 
it believes favors israel 
syria believes it has a better chance of regaining the strategic 
golan heights captured by israel in 1967 through a comprehensive 
settlement unlike the other occupied territories israel annexed 
the heights in 1981 
charles snow a veteran middle east analyst wrote in the 
respected middle east economic survey there is one major problem 
which clearly has the potential to derail the entire process the 
golan heights 
syria has always been deeply suspicious that attempts to 
separate the issues in the arabisraeli conflict are merely 
camouflage for a partial settlement which will leave israel in 
possession of the golan 
the us plan would convene an international conference within a 
few weeks by may 1 israel and a joint delegation of jordanians 
and palestinians would discuss limited selfrule for the 15 
million palestinians in the west bank and gaza for an interim 
threeyear period later in the year a wider international 
conference would bring in other parties to debate the ultimate 
future of the occupied arab land captured by israel in the 1967 war 
a syrian source said the main question is how much pressure 
washington is prepared to exert on israel to accept a land for 
peace exchange 
the arabs including syria spearhead of arab radicalism have 
accepted this principle but israeli hardliners reject withdrawal 
from lands it seized in 1967 and are at odds with moderates over 
the way to go arabs fear the israeli impasse could block any 
progress 
some syrian officials question the sincerity of an initiative 
launched by the reagan administration which they say has done 
little to rein in israel 
since reagan was elected in 1980 israel attacked iraqs nuclear 
plant in 1981 annexed the golan heights later that year invaded 
lebanon in 1982 bombed the plos headquarters in tunisia in 1984 
and continued to build settlements in the occupied territories 
israel also has defied a series of un resolutions condemning 
its repeated air raids on palestinian bases in lebanon 
furthermore arab officials stress the reagan adminstration has 
made no effort to pressure israel to honor commitments under the 
camp david accords which called for palestinian selfrule 
the accords signed by egypt and israel in 1978 under the 
sponsorship of former president carter has been dormant since 
reagan took office 
syria like other arab governments denounced the accord as 
violating arab summit resolutions that banned seperate peace 
treaties with israel outside a comprehensive settlement 
but with us presidential elections only a few months away 
the syrians are wondering what guarantees shultz can offer that any 
accord reached under reagan would be honored by israel after the 
change of adminstration 
a commentary by staterun damascus radio said that although the 
exact details of the us proposal have not been made public arab 
leaders felt it was an american effort to monopolize the peace 
initiative outside the framework of the united nations and to 
keep out the soviet union 
but the commentary the first official reaction to shultzs 
plan welcomed washingtons renewed interest in resolving the 
conflict and its support for an international peace conference as a 
step in the right direction

more than 500 elementary school children and 
whale watchers stared in horror as a container ship hit a 35foot 
gray whale as it swam four miles off shore witnesses said 
the 30ton mother whale which was escorting its calf along with 
another cow and calf pair was hit saturday while migrating north 
toward the arctic 
the children were just devastated one little boy wanted to 
swim out and help the whale said nancy pavlich a first grade 
teacher at deer canyon elementary school in suburban alta loma 
robert yoshitomi a lawyer for nippon yusen kaisha nyk 
japanese owners of the container ship hakusan ii said company 
officials were looking into the case 
were still checking he said were sorry for any 
difficulty that was caused as far as we know it was 
unintentional 
pavlich said many of the children were still somber about the 
incident monday morning and some students are writing letters about 
the whales and sending them to the coast guard 
the whale slid along the side of the ship broke free from the 
ships current swam helplessly for a minute than made a final blow 
of air before sinking witnesses said 
kids were screaming and crying as they were watching this 
said bill samaras a marine biology teacher at carson high school 
who was aboard the childrens boat 
we had been following the whales for about 15 minutes when we 
noticed the container ship coming from the southwest it then very 
drastically turned and crossed our path 
i thought theyre going to hit the whales and we tried to 
contact the ship on the emergency radio but i guess they werent 
monitoring the line 
at this point we cant confirm its death but there is a good 
chance that it died we just cant say for sure said tom lewis 
biologist at the los angeles county museum of natural history and 
president of the american cetacean society 
the hakusan ii 209 feet long and with a dead weight of 20934 
tons arrived at the port of los angeles on saturday and left 
sunday evening headed to taiwan officials said 
samaras a research associate with the county museum said he 
was certain the ships navigators didnt see the swimming mammals 
to them it was like a road kill he said like killing a 
chipmunk with your car he said im sure it was nothing 
intentional they didnt know they hit it 
samaras said he plans to file a complaint with the coast guard 
about the ship which he said changed course and came about 150 
yards in front of the whale watching charters

the rapides parish sheriffs office 
trying to find local satanists has ordered the library here to 
turn over a list of people who have checked out books on the occult 
in the last year 
assistant district attorney dexter ryland said he has advised 
rapides parish library officials to withhold the information until 
his office can determine if the order is an invasion of privacy 
we are working on it we havent formulated our final legal 
opinion on it ryland said monday it struck me when it was 
called to my attention that it could possibly violate the privacy 
of individuals 
chief deputy tommy hollingsworth said his office is simply 
trying to get some intelligence on serious followers of satanic 
beliefs because a lot of times it is connected with narcotics 
lynn dunn who works in the sheriffs narcotics office said the 
names and addresses were subpoenaed to weed out the curious from 
the serious followers of satanism 
it is not an invasion of the readers privacy because no one 
is going to be contacted or anything like that she said 
hollingsworth said his office is not investigating any specific 
incidents involving devil worshippers the sheriffs office is 
simply updating files it has kept for the last 15 years he said 
library director stephen rogge said it is his policy not to 
release such information simply on a request but he could be 
forced to comply because of the court order 
rogge said he would consider the sheriffs request an invasion 
of privacy unless there is a good reason for it if the 
district attorneys office determines there are not sufficient 
grounds to turn over the list rogge said he wont do it 
rapides chief of detectives william earl hilton said there may 
be some satanic activity in the parish but so far it has not been 
linked to any crime

battered each others capitals with longrange missiles and struck 
other population centers with artillery and bombs 
hundreds of civilian casualties are believed to have resulted 
from the bombardments

massachusetts gov michael s dukakis cast his 
democratic primary vote today at his hometown precinct in 
brookline where he was greeted by neighbors who applauded his 
arrival 
its good to be in this precinct where a great deal of my 
political career and my life really has been shaped by a lot of 
great friends who are here said dukakis who was accompanied by 
his wife kitty and their daughter kara 
dukakis had closed his super tuesday campaign monday night 
worrying about the lastminute impact of negative campaign ads 
aired by tennessee sen albert gore in texas and north carolina 
they hurt theres no question about it dukakis said as his 
campaign plane headed for boston on monday night after a day of 
campaigning in the south by the time you find out what theyre 
doing its too late 
dukakis said of the latest gore ad its a piece of garbage 
the comments were a final note of concern following an otherwise 
upbeat weekend of campaigning that saw large crowds extensive 
media coverage and a few key endorsements 
dukakis planned to spend the day at his statehouse office and 
then fly to chicago to begin campaigning in the next battleground 
illinois which holds its primary a week from today 
in his final stop in the raleighdurham area monday night 
dukakis once again rejected the notion that he is the most liberal 
of the democratic candidates saying he preferred the label 
progressive 
among the positions that have helped pin the label liberal on 
dukakis are his opposition to aid to nicaraguan contra rebels his 
opposition to any cuts in social spending his opposition to a 
spacebased missile defense system and the midgetman missile and 
his support of closer relations with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
but dukakis insisted that he has also cut taxes in massachusetts 
even though some of those tax cuts occurred over his initial 
objections he said he has balanced nine consecutive budgets and 
has cut crime in massachusetts in his work with other governors 
he said the most consistently progressive are those from the 
southern states 
in addition to stops in miami plant city fla and 
raleighdurham dukakis squeezed 21 television interviews into his 
schedule monday 
still he said dont let them tell you this is a television 
campaign this is a grassroots campaign and if were successful 
it will be because of our organization 
the dukakis organization is recognized as the bestfunded and 
most extensive in texas florida and washington state among the 20 
super tuesday states holding presidential primaries and caucuses 
today in north carolina though campaign organizers predicted 
dukakis would finish third there behind jesse jackson and gore 
dukakis kicked off the day of campaigning in perhaps his most 
solid base of support in the south miami 
at a senior citizens rally dukakis picked up the coveted 
endorsement of 70yearold annie ackerman not a household name 
but someone with a reputation in miami for being able to get out 
the vote 
the woman who was a ward organizer for chicago mayor richard 
daley spurned other democratic suitors and endorsed the 
massachusetts governor at a morning rally attended by about 500 
senior citizens

the brother of an american being held hostage 
in lebanon said today he thinks the hostages should be an issue 
discussed by the us presidential candidates 
they have never mentioned a word said anthony cicippio 
whose brother joseph has been held for 18 months 
i think theyre treating it like a hot potato theyre just 
laying off of it he said on abctvs good morning america 
he also chided members of congress for what he said was a lack 
of concern for the hostages 
we sent 300 letters to the congressmen and senators over the 
last six months and through that time weve only received 13 
replies he said one of them whom he did not identify asked 
for a campaign contribution said cicippio of norristown pa 
i live on hope said peggy say who joined cicippio on the 
program her brother terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press was abducted march 16 1985 
he has been held longer than any of the nine americans in captivity 
mrs say said increased activity involving the search for lt 
col william higgins who was kidnapped three weeks ago gives her 
some hope but she said the hostage families should not have to 
wait for a time when we could attach ourselves to a larger issue 
i think the reagan administration is consistently saying 
this is too complicated and that quiet diplomacy is the answer 
none of these things are acceptable any more said mrs say of 
batavia ny 
she noted that a ceremony will be held in washington march 16 to 
mark the third anniversary of her brothers abduction the event 
sponsored by no greater love a humanitarian organization and the 
journalists committee to free terry anderson is to be duplicated 
in other areas across the country and is indicative of a growing 
grassroots movement to gain the hostages freedom she said 
its a human rights violation and i think americans are 
unwilling to be silent any more about it she said

an appearance by two members of the ku 
klux klan at a free speech forum turned into a massive 
demonstration at the university of kansas as protesters waved signs 
and shouted slogans 
an estimated 3000 people some shouting kkk not today and 
dont go in protested outside monday night as about 2000 
people gathered inside hoch auditorium 
no serious violence was reported but several windows were 
broken as protesters tried to push their way into the auditorium 
police wearing riot gear guarded the entrances to the building 
breaking up one shouting match and ejecting another person 
the forum was delayed for about 20 minutes when eight black 
ministers from lawrence and kansas city stood up and began singing 
spirituals the audience joined in and gave the ministers two 
standing ovations before the forum began 
the ministers continued singing throughout most of the evening 
before marching out a side door in protest 
one of the klan members thom robb of harrison ark accused 
the ministers of stifling free speech 
these people are so filled with hatred and bigotry they refuse 
to let you hear us said robb national chaplain of the knights 
of the ku klux klan he was accompanied by j allen moran exalted 
cyclops of the missouri knights of the ku klux klan 
allan hanson a professor of anthropology participating in the 
forum told the students to listen to the klan members and make up 
their own minds 
if you find the ideas here are ugly or twisted use your own 
judgment and freedom of expression to tell other people that 
hanson said 
another participant journalism professor ted frederickson said 
he wanted to stand up for free speech even though the klan had 
denied that right to people working for civil rights in the south 
those people were met with bombs and guns and fists and 
violence he said but i believe in free expression even for 
the klan 
michael foubert a graduate student and head of the group that 
sponsored the forum said he invited the kkk members to the campus 
as a way of examining whether a university should support free 
speech for all viewpoints 
foubert director of slightly older americans for freedom 
organized the forum after faculty members last month canceled a 
planned visit to campus by two klan members the two had been 
scheduled to speak to a journalism class for an exercise on 
reporting on extremist groups and participate in a student radio 
talk show 
black ministers in the lawrence area and the black student union 
had opposed the visit 
david ambler ku vice chancellor for student affairs said the 
university did not interfere with the forum because it was 
sponsored by a student organization 
students have a right to explore ideas were obligated to 
protect that right ambler said i hope a lot of learning goes 
on tonight 
mia crawford a black student from kansas city kan said she 
wasnt concerned that the klan would recruit any students 
im against the kkk but they do have a right to speak she 
said i think a lot of people are here just out of curiosity

the federal aviation administration worried 
about a rash of commuter airline accidents that claimed 56 lives 
over a recent fivemonth period today announced a yearlong 
inspection of the commuter industry 
faa administrator allan mcartor said the inspection will cover 
173 commuter airlines agency inspectors are planning to focus on 
about 20 percent of those carriers 
mcartor said faa officials already are reviewing major problem 
areas in the industry which last year carried 30 million 
passengers 
and plan within 60 days to begin inspections 
teams of faa inspectors will focus on such areas as airline 
management training programs record keeping and aircraft 
condition 
mcartor said the commuter airlines safety record in recent 
months has sharply reversed from the trends seen in recent years 
the faa cited seven commuter accidents from november through 
february in which 56 people were killed 
the worst accident was that of a ryan air commuter nov 13 near 
homer alaska in which 18 people died 
commuter airlines have played an increasingly important role in 
the nations aviation system because they often are used as feeder 
airlines for the major jet carriers at large airports around the 
country last year the commuters carried nearly 30 million 
passengers according to the regional airline association and that 
number is expected to continue to climb 
we want a return to the 1986 environment when commuters had 
the safest year in their history mcartor told a news conference 
in 1986 commuter airlines had just two fatal accidents in which 
four people were killed 
faa officials said they expect the initial inspection phase of 
the commuters to be completed by the end of september the agency 
then will prepare a final report on the findings which would be 
used by inspectors responsible for the individual airlines in 
having corrective action taken

flamingos and lust in the dust died at age 42 on the verge 
of acceptance as a legitimate character actor his manager said 
divine whose real name was harris glenn milstead was a 
garishly made up loud and foulmouthed character who was 
introduced in 1972s pink flamingos as the filthiest person 
alive milstead made the same campy character suitable for a 
wider audience in the current movie hairspray 
he was finally getting respect within the industry said

milstead said in a 1985 interview he grew up fat and was taunted 
by classmates in the baltimore suburb of lutherville milstead told 
an interviewer he had a fantasy life revolving around female movie 
stars and dreams of becoming a celebrity 
milstead was made a celebrity at least among fans of

in hairspray milstead played dual roles in mens clothing 
he was a television station operator determined to keep black and 
white youngsters from appearing together on a dance show as 
divine he starred as the stage mother of a chubby teenage dance 
show contestant 
the character is a real person milstead once said of 
divine sometimes shes just too bold but she has socially 
redeeming qualities no matter what she does shes her own person 
and a lot of people like that the camp element is something out of 
the ordinary this big man playing a sexy woman 
besides film roles milstead also used the divine persona in a 
nightclub act 
milstead is survived by his mother and father frances and

militant roman catholics rioted 
through the night and into the early morning over the killing of 
three unarmed irish guerrillas in gibraltar the irish government 
said it was gravely perturbed at the shootings 
youths in belfast pelted police with gasoline bombs and set 
ablaze several dozen automobiles in rioting that lasted into early 
today police said no injuries were reported 
it was one of the worst nights of violence in the britishruled 
province since last summer and was touched off by the shooting of 
two men and a woman sunday in britains fortress colony on spains 
southern coast 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said monday that a 
dreadful terrorist act has been averted by the slayings 
the three people killed were actively involved in the planning 
and attempted execution of that act he told the house of commons 
in london 
police in gibraltar said the three were believed to be involved 
in an irish republican army plan to detonate a car bomb at the 
governors residence during a ceremonial changing of the guard 
today 
fifty members of the royal anglian regiment just transferred 
from duty in northern ireland took part in the ceremony which 
occurred without incident 
security was heavy as gibraltar police and british troops with 
dogs patrolled the fringes of a crowd of about 300 tourists and 
residents who watched the colorful ceremony in front of the 
convent official residence of governor sir peter terry 
the ira which is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the british 
from northern ireland acknowledged that the three guerrillas were 
on a mission but accused the british government of needlessly 
killing them 
in dublin prime minister charles haugheys government said it 
recognized the need for security forces to take all reasonable 
measures to combat terrorism 
the government is however gravely perturbed that three 
unarmed irish people should have been shot dead when it appears 
from reports that they could have been arrested by the security 
forces the government said 
ireland is already embroiled in a series of disputes with 
britain over security forces in northern ireland including 
britains unwillingness to prosecute police officers who allegedly 
carried out a shoottokill policy in the province 
howe said the soldiers opened fire after the guerrillas parked a 
renault5 with spanish license plates near the governors residence 
and headed on foot for the spanish border 800 yards away 
howe said the three guerrillas made movements which led 
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger 
police searched gibraltar and adjacent spanish territory on 
monday for another car believed connected with the three the 
theory is the renault5 was reserving a space for a car bomb 
howe said spanish police tipped off the british after a fourth 
ira guerrilla they were watching crossed into gibraltar apparently 
to carry out reconnaissance for an act of terrorism 
the london newspaper the daily mail said spanish police believe 
the fourth suspect may be evelyn glenholmes who has been linked 
with several ira attacks in past years it quoted them as saying a 
women of her description was seen visiting the other three at an 
apartment in malaga two hours drive from gibraltar 
howe said a car for which the three slain guerrillas had keys 
was found parked on the spanish side of the gate separating this 
225squaremile limestone rock from the spanish mainland he said 
it contained keys to a third car three false passports and 
equipment including an alarm clock insulating tape and wire that 
could be used to detonate a bomb 
howe did not identify the british unit involved but there was 
speculation they were from the elite special air services regiment 
whose movements are secret witnesses said they wore jeans 
the outlawed ira in a statement from belfast identified the 
dead as mairead farrell 31 who had served 10 years jail for 
blowing up a hotel sean savage 24 and daniel mccann 30 both of 
whom have been arrested on explosive charges 
all three were from catholic west belfast where the rioting 
broke out after howes statement 
in belfast police fired plastic bullets to disperse gangs of 
youths who hurled gasoline bombs and set fire to 30 vehicles 
including buses vans and trucks gunmen launched at least two 
sniper attacks on police and troops police said 
the mainly catholic ira seeks to drive the british from northern 
ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province with the 
overwhelmingly catholic irish republic under socialist rule

iowa bush went on to a solid win in the new hampshire primary 
eight days later 
after a day of campaigning in arkansas missouri and oklahoma 
bush flew to his adopted hometown to vote in the texas primary and 
await the results 
but his top campaign aides and leading southern strategists said 
they wouldnt be surprised if the vice president captured some 600 
of the roughly 700 delegates at stake 
such a scenario said campaign manager lee atwater could 
present republican presidential rival bob dole with a mustwin 
scenario in next weeks illinois primary 
i dont know what dole does if he doesnt win illinois 
atwater said a dole campaign source agreed that the kansas senator 
has to win illinois and said the campaign is prepared to spend 
500000 on advertising there 
bush seemed tired but upbeat as he toured an american airlines 
maintenance facility at tulsas airport 
the person that clearly wins super tuesday is going to be the 
nominee of the party and i think the next president he said 
its critical 
but bush brushed aside talk of a sweep you always wish for 
that but i certainly would never predict that its too much for 
anyone to expect 
atwater said he expected bush to win 12 or 13 of the 17 gop 
events and deputy campaign manager rich bond said the campaign is 
prepared to spend whatever it takes to win illinois 
bush returned to houston almost five months from the day he 
declared his presidential candidacy here saying i mean to run 
hard and i mean to win 
bush is a native of massachusetts and was raised in connecticut 
but he moved here with his wife barbara in 1948 to learn the oil 
business he became a successful oilman before venturing into 
politics as a county republican chairman 
im guardedly optimistic about bushs chances in texas 
state campaign political kevin moomaw said bob doles campaign 
in texas is nonexistent the competition in this state has been 
pat robertson 
moomaw said not even the forecast of heavy rains through much of 
texas would put a damper on bushs prospects 
we are warning everybody to go out and vote he said 
there is a potential for a turnout of 750000 
ken wright bushs florida campaign director said were 
looking good id like to see us come out with 70 of the 82 
delegates i think were going to do very very well 
bush got a lift with his lopsided victory in south carolinas 
primary on saturday he had stumbled out of the starting gate 
finishing behind dole and robertson in iowa but bush bounced back 
to win by a comfortable margin in new hampshire and has done well 
since although he did not compete in minnesota and withdrew from 
south dakota a week before losing that contest to dole

united states pending trial on charges involving the death of a 
10yearold diabetic boy

are among seven people being investigated in the dec 20 death of 
aaron norman an autopsy determined the boy died from untreated

revive the boy using cardiopulmonary resuscitation according to 
sheriffs deputies 
the boy was disciplined by spanking on the advice of church 
leaders the day before he died authorities say a pathologist 
determined the spanking did not contribute to the boys death but 
said bruises were found on his buttocks and legs 
kleber has said that neither he nor the normans knew the boy was 
seriously ill and that they would have taken him to a doctor if 
they had known 
the normans have been members of the spokane fellowship since it 
started in in 1981 but the branch announced last weekend it had 
disbanded

an opposition spokesman said riot police 
clashed today with hundreds of student protesters in krakow while 
at warsaw university thousands of students demonstrated peacefully 
to demand greater academic freedom 
about 70 to 100 people were detained in krakow but police began 
releasing them by early afternoon opposition activist zygmunt 
lenyk said he said at least three people were severely beaten by 
police 
the demonstrations coincided with the anniversary of march 8 
1968 student protests at warsaw university against censorship and 
political repression which were brutally broken up by police and 
communist party worker activists 
this years protests reflected a renewed campaign by student 
activists urging communist authorities to legalize the independent 
students union known as nzs which was outlawed following the 
december 1981 martial law crackdown on the independent labor 
federation solidarity 
at krakows jagiellonian university about 700 students tried to 
march to the main square in the citys old town following a noon 
campus rally organized by the nzs but found the street cordoned 
off by police lenyk said 
lenyk quoting eyewitness accounts said police attacked the 
crowd with clubs but some demonstrators pushed their way through 
police lines to reach the square where they were detained 
he said most of the students returned to campus and tried twice 
more to march to the square about 500 yards away but each time 
were attacked by police 
a government spokesman asked about the reported clash and 
violence said he had no information and promised to look into the 
matter 
at warsaw university police did not intervene as more than 
2000 students peacefully demonstrated without leaving campus 
students and university workers carrying dozens of banners 
demanding legalization of the nzs and solidarity free trade union 
marched to a campus carrying a plaque commemorating the 1968 
protests 
the plaque was put up in march 1981 when both solidarity and the 
nzs functioned legally 
university authorities allowed the rally but the campus main 
gates were locked and security guards kept nonuniversity personnel 
from entering 
after students and faculty members laid wreaths under the 
plaque campus nzs leaders stood on top of a wall to take turns 
speaking to the crowd through a bullhorn

a judge had refused to allow the release of 
fbi surveillance records tracking the political activities of late 
beatle john lennon because their disclosure could compromise 
national security 
the request for release of lennons fbi dossier was made by 
university of california irvine professor jon wiener under the 
freedom of information act wiener said he will appeal the ruling 
by us district judge robert takasugi 
the decision came in response to a 1983 lawsuit filed by wiener 
when the fbi released only part of lennons file which contains 
documents about the musicians antiwar activities in the 1970s 
they claimed some of these documents would damage national 
security wiener said to me it sounds like a ridiculous thing 
to say about 18yearold documents about the political activities 
of a dead rock star 
lennon was murdered outside his new york city apartment in 1980 
the ruling came last week after a closeddoors meeting between 
takasugi and government attorneys

contra leader adolfo calero said today 
that the rebels would not attend ceasefire negotiations the 
sandinista government had scheduled to begin wednesday in nicaragua 
calero said in a telephone interview from miami that government 
officials talked to the rebel leaders on monday at the last 
minute to tell them that they were ready for a meeting 
apparently what the sandinista government wants is a 
unilateral show he said we are not willing to attend a 
unilateral meeting set up by the sandinistas 
three days of talks were to be held at the frontier post of 
sapoa about 90 miles from the capital of managua along the 
southern border with costa rica 
calero said the rebels may agree to hold talks at a later date 
in sapoa 
he complained the government had not responded to a statement 
the rebels issued last week calling for cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo to continue participating in the talks as a witness and for 
the talks to center on wider issues than just arrangements for a 
ceasefire between the warring sides 
president daniel ortega proposed the talks last week he also 
said obando y bravo head of the roman catholic church in 
nicaragua would no longer serve as a mediator as he had in 
previous discussions 
ortega said the government delegation to the talks would be 
headed by his brother humberto ortega the defense minister and 
one of nine members on the ruling national directorate 
the contras named calero to head their delegation but insisted 
that the cardinal be a witness at the meeting 
late monday the government said obando y bravo and joao baena 
soares secretary general of the organization of american states 
had agreed to serve as witnesses 
the government maintains the talks should focus on the laying 
down of arms as outlined in the regional peace plan signed last 
august by the presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala 
costa rica and honduras 
the rebels want the discussions to be expanded to include a 
proposal put forth last month in guatemala city by the cardinal 
obando y bravos agenda called for the government to grant total 
amnesty to political prisoners review a mandatory military draft 
law allow full press freedom and renew a dialogue with its 
internal opposition in return for the concessions the contras 
were to accept a 30day ceasefire 
the usbacked rebels have been fighting against the sandinista 
government since november 1981

the hermit of chestnut hill who lived in 
makeshift huts on government land for nearly two decades and 
resisted wellpublicized efforts to relocate him died the way he 
would have wanted says a friend 
he died free so to speak said clyde raymond he had his 
own drummer and stuck with it 
bill britt 52 had been dead for several months when he was 
found monday by two of his three childen ingrid boughner of 
belmont and britton steven boughner of medford boston police 
spokesman scott gillis 
his body dressed in multiple layers of clothing was almost 
skeletal because of decomposition and animals gillis said 
dr stanton kessler of the suffolk county medical examiners 
office said today that autopsy results showed britt died of 
hypothermia he said identification of the body was 
presumptive because rats had eaten away most of britts face 
and other exposed areas 
kessler said britts feet were found dug into the ground as if 
to gain some warmth 
born britton william boughner in wealthy chestnut hill britt 
had lived on nearby land controlled by the metropolitan district 
commission since 1969 his hut was about 30 feet inside the fence 
surrounding evergreen cemetery in the area of a large reservoir on 
the bostonbrookline border 
in his case he felt that this was where he wanted to live 
this was his estate said raymond 
in 1985 officials started trying to move britt who was legally 
blind and lived on money from collecting cans and bottles for the 
deposits when he refused welfare and several attempts to relocate 
him to public or subsidized housing the news media dubbed him 
the hermit on chestnut hill 
in may britts plastic and wood wigwam was destroyed in a fire 
he was in new york city at the time appearing on the late night 
with david letterman television show because of the publicity his 
case attracted 
state appeals court judge edith fine issued a stay preventing 
authorities from removing britt from the property but when the 
appeals court order expired in july officials removed his rebuilt 
wigwam and his belongings 
britt rebuilt it again despite deteriorating health an 
opthalmologist testified at a housing court hearing a year ago that 
britt had ulcers and he needed a corneal transplant also britt 
was nearly toothless 
last year he said he was writing a hermits cookbook but 
the manuscript and other papers relating to his legal battles were 
lost in the may fire

a justice department official today proposed 
raising congressional salaries to as much as 175000 in exchange 
for dropping the double standard that exempts congress from 
federal ethics laws 
i personally am attracted by the idea of raising the salary of 
all members of congress to a level around somewhere between 
150000 and 175000 a year assistant attorney general william 
weld said in a speech attacking public corruption 
this would enable you to do some other things like prohibit 
honoraria added weld who is in charge of the departments 
criminal division it would be very very expensive and 
worth every penny 
members of the executive branch and independent agencies are 
prohibited from supplementing salaries with fees and honoraria for 
jobrelated activities violators are subject to up to a year in 
prison 
congressional salaries are now 89500 a year which senators 
may supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed 40 percent 
of their salaries the percentage for house members is 30 percent 
weld said the payment of 2000 fees to members of congress who 
visited a business establishment over which their committee had 
jurisdiction would be a laydown criminal case if performed by 
somebody in the executive branch 
you have the double standard of criminal acts by one branch 
of government being legal in another and that really is neither 
logical nor is it consonant with the notion of fair play weld 
said in remarks at the national press club 
he said raising congressional salaries and applying the ban on 
outside payments would end any risk that these fees or honoraria 
would be influencing a legislators sense of how to spend his time 
much less his vote higher salaries might attract talented people 
who otherwise would be unable to afford being in congress 
in response to questions he rejected the suggestion that his 
comments were an attempt to overshadow the fact that a number of 
reagan administration officials are under criminal investigation or 
have been convicted of crimes 
my remarks today are the same as remarks ive been giving 
since 1978 said weld a former us attorney in boston and a 
former candidate for state attorney general in massachusetts 
welds boss attorney general edwin meese iii is under 
investigation in the wedtech scandal and in connection with a 1 
billion proposed iraqi pipeline project that may have involved 
planned payoffs to the israeli labor party 
weld also criticized congress for excluding itself from coverage 
of conflictofinterest laws which former white house political 
director lyn nofziger was convicted last month of violating on 
behalf of scandalplagued wedtech corp and two other clients 
the assistant attorney general noted the lack of restrictions on 
lobbying by former congressmen 
the day after a congressman leaves office he is free to lobby 
his former colleagues on behalf of himself or his friends or 
clients while continuing to enjoy full access to the house and 
senate floors said weld as recent events have made abundantly 
clear such behavior by a former member of the executive branch 
would land one in jail 
nofziger under the 1978 ethics in government act was found 
guilty of lobbying his former agency within one year after he left 
the government on matters in which the agency had been 
substantially involved 
the matters pertained to a federal contract for wedtech the 
continued production of a10 antitank aircraft and civilian manning 
of navy ships 
nofziger faces sentencing later this month

aids experts have sharply criticized a book by 
the sex experts dr william masters and virginia johnson that 
claims to find wide spread of aids among heterosexuals 
they have not done even the most rudimentary things to 
establish any representativeness of their results says dr june 
osborn a virologist pediatrician and dean of the school of public 
health at the university of michigan 
in the book released monday and titled crisis heterosexual 
behavior in the age of aids masters and johnson reported finding 
a 5 percent aids infection rate in men who said they had at least 
six sexual partners a year for five years and a 7 percent 
infection rate in similarly active women 
by comparison federal figures released in february that cover 
the period from 1985 to sept 30 show that 5890 of 396 million 
military recruits tested positive a rate of 15 cases of aids 
infection for every 1000 people tested 
based on their study of 800 people masters and johnson 
concluded the aids virus has certainly established a beachhead 
in the ranks of heterosexuals and the odds are that the rate 
of spread among heterosexuals will now begin to escalate at a 
frightening pace 
osborn contended that no such conclusion can be reached because 
the 800 including some people recruited with signup sheets on 
bulletin boards were not chosen to be representative of the us 
population 
lori behrman spokeswoman for the manhattanbased gay mens 
health crisis today called the findings unscientific and expressed 
concern that they would harm antidiscrimination efforts 
they have squandered their credibity to exploit a public 
health issue said behrman they have succeeded in alarming the 
public and have undone the good work that public officials have 
done around the country you dont raise false alarms around an 
issue so potentially explosive as aids 
late monday on abctvs nightline masters defended the 
unscientific sample as a preliminary step raising an alarm 
about the possibility there are heterosexuals outside the known 
risk groups who are in danger from the aids epidemic 
what we havent realized is that there is another group of 
those heterosexuals who have a very multiplicityofpartners type 
of sex life and that is all that the experiments demonstrated 
masters said 
masters denied that at a morning news conference the authors had 
backed off the books claim that aids was running rampant among 
heterosexuals 
we think that it is spreading very rapidly in the heterosexual 
population we used the word rampant advisedly because we think 
that we are facing a situation where there is tremendous danger 
dr peter fischinger aids coordinator for the public health 
service disagreed earlier monday saying we dont see an 
explosion into the heterosexual community 
he noted that nationwide screening of blood donors has found 
that only about one in 40000 shows evidence of infection with the 
aids virus but he added this does not mean we can be complacent 
about it 
mathilde krim chairwoman of the american foundation for aids 
research said masters and johnson may have expertise in 
sexuality but they have no credentials to justify their 
recommendations concerning aids public health policy 
recommendations that will surely alarm the public 
masters and johnson and their coauthor dr robert kolodny a 
director of the masters amp johnson institute in st louis also 
resurrected the nearly universally discarded notion that aids can 
be spread by casual contact 
it does a disservice to the public to suggest once again that 
you can get this from kissing said dr stephen joseph new york 
citys public health commissioner the authors also called for 
widespread mandatory testing for aids a recommendation that has 
been opposed by most public health authorities 
i dont see anything in their own data that would lead one to 
make the sweeping statements about casual transmission and 
mandatory testing that i think theyve made said joseph 
at their news conference masters johnson and kolodny appeared 
to disavow some of the claims they made in the book kolodny 
acknowledged writing that kissing could spread aids but said under 
harsh questioning from reporters that it was only a very small 
theoretical possibility 
kolodny said today on abcs good morning america that the 
authors had carefully worded their statements to say for 
instance of the restaurant situation as a practical matter 
theres no risk 
but should we be as scientists dishonest with the public and 
say theres no risk at all none when the history of this epidemic 
has been that every year new revelations come forth he added 
joseph on cbs this morning said that he feared a backlash 
against alarmist and unsupported numbers 
there is a real threat from heterosexual transmission its a 
major part of the epidemic but blowing it out of proportion as 
masters and johnson have done i think will hurt the credibility of 
the issue in the end 
with aids its not who you are its what you do anyone who 
engages in highrisk behavior any heterosexual person who is a 
partner of someone who is in a primary risk group a bisexual man 
or a man who uses iv drugs is at risk joseph said 
asked at mondays news conference to back up the books 
statement that the aids virus is now running rampant in the 
heterosexual community masters said i simply believe this 
johnson said im not sure we chose the word rampant 
ourselves 
osborn criticized the authors for being secretive about their 
findings she said masters and johnson attended an aids workshop at 
the kinsey institute in bloomington ind in december and they 
didnt give any clue that three months later this would come out 
it does to me shake my confidence in their scientific 
purpose she said

two former executives of a firm subcontracted 
to work on the b1 bomber pleaded guilty to charges involving a 
fraudulent checkcashing scheme and illegal overbilling for time 
spent working on the military jet 
robert f butler former owner of butler industries and purkey 
co inc and steven wooten former general manager of butler 
industries entered their pleas monday before us district judge 
stephen v wilson 
the pleas were part of a deal in which the defendants 
acknowledged the governments case against them but claimed they 
never intended to violate the law said butlers attorney gerson 
s horn the arrangement allows them to present their defense in 
any civil litigation arising from the case 
it would have taken a tremendous amount of money to fight this 
case horn said the government threatened to indict more 
unless the plea bargain was accepted 
one of the three federal grand jury indictments accused both 
butler and wooten of overbilling rockwell inc the aerospace 
contractor on the us air forces b1 bomber for time spent 
changing orders on parts for the bomber 
rockwell was billed for 495 hours of work on the subcontract 
445 more than were actually involved said assistant us attorney 
j stephen czuleger the billing amounted to 200000 in erroneous 
charges government officials said 
horn said however that several company employees could present 
testimony to show that the amount of time devoted to the change 
orders was not overestimated 
the other indictment charged butler 54 and wooten 30 with 
cashing company checks valued at more than 144000 made out to 
fictitious payees over a twoyear period the checks were then 
illegally deducted on corporate tax returns as a cost of goods 
sold czuleger said 
butler was indicted in another bogus checkcashing scam of more 
than 259000 involving purkey co inc 
horn said the two men claim they were writing the phony checks 
to obtain cash for real business expenses the company was 
habitually overdrawn and would otherwise have been unable to get 
the money he said 
butler who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy presenting 
false claims to the united states subscribing to a false corporate 
income tax return and assisting in the preparation of a false tax 
return faces a maximum two years in prison and 240000 in fines 
he will be sentenced june 20 
wooten who pleaded guilty to similar charges in two of the 
indictments faces one year and fines of 130000 he will be 
sentenced april 25

president roh taewoos ruling party 
rammed its version of a new election law through the national 
assembly on tuesday with an impromptu voice vote clearing the way 
for crucial legislative elections 
after the law was passed during an unruly assembly session that 
drew shouts of outrage from opposition lawmakers officials of the 
ruling democratic justice party said national assembly elections 
would be held about april 20 
the two sides squabbled over the legislation for hours when vice 
national assembly speaker chang sungman protected by guards went 
to the podium called for a voice vote and quickly declared the 
bill passed 
opposition lawmakers tried to block the move but were caught off 
guard some rushed the podium but were stopped by guards a brief 
scuffle broke out between ruling and opposition lawmakers but 
nobody was hurt 
it is regrettable that the assembly could not proceed 
smoothly although we made concessions up until the last minute 
said democratic justice party spokesman you kyunghyun 
you said his party had to pass the bill before the current 
assembly session ended tuesday in order to hold the general 
elections by april 28 the legal deadline he said at least 35 days 
are needed to prepare 
but kim taeryong spokesman for tminister wu xueqian said the united 
states and china 
have a very cordial relationship between and we want to 
continue it 
as the two leaders posed for pictures in the oval office a 
reporter asked reagan if he would urge china to stop selling 
silkworm missiles to iran were going to be talking about a 
great many things reagan replied 
when the reporter asked if their talks would involve the 
silkworms reagan replied you know the rules apparently 
suggesting that reporters should not ask questions 
wu met monday with secretary of state george p shultz and with 
defense secretary frank c carlucci 
during toasts following a state department luncheon on monday 
shultz and wu hailed the progress in bilateal relations and made 
almost no reference to issues dividing them 
chief among those issues is chinas reported sales of military 
weaponry to iran in defiance of us efforts at the united nations 
to win support for a worldwide arms embargo against iran 
the administration has been seeking assurances from china that 
it will not veto an embargo resolution 
last october the united states retaliated against china for 
selling silkworm antiship missiles to iran by suspending the 
process under which china had been given increasing access to us 
products with advanced technology 
since then china has said it has stopped selling silkworms to 
iran 
shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent antichinese 
rioting in tibet state department spokesman charles redman said 
between three and nine people are believed to have been killed and 
he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in tibet

students at gallaudet university boycotted 
classes today to protest the naming of a hearing person as 
president of the nations only university for the deaf some 
classes were canceled others were sparsely attended 
the boycott was called after the students who had closed the 
school monday by blocking entrances to the campus were told by 
police that they would be arrested if they refused to open the 
gates 
were going to boycott until we get what we want a deaf 
president said tim rarus a student protest leader 
several faculty members supported the students including the 
chairman of the schools mathematics department herbert mapes who 
stayed away from his scheduled classes 
im behind the students 100 percent he told a reporter 
about 250 of the students instructors and administrators 
boycotting normal school activities crowded into a campus 
auditorium to reiterate their demand that a deaf president be named 
but the woman whose appointment as gallaudets president 
triggered the demonstrations said today she had no intention of 
rejecting the offer 
im committed to taking the job and im committed to the 
university elizabeth ann zinser said on cbs this morning 
asked about the continuing protests she said 
i believe we can overcome that conflict but i understand and 
can appreciate the sentiments of some of the students and friends 
of the university at this time learning that their seventh 
president is not deaf 
students had blocked entrances to the university monday but 
changed tactics late monday after police told them their cars would 
be ticketed and towed and any protesters interfering would be 
arrested according to rarus 
the university was officially open today but administration 
officials said no policy had been set on whether students would be 
penalized for boycotting classes 
class attendance policies are determined on an individual 
basis said provost catherine ingold it will be up to each 
teacher to decide whether to do anything 
zinser an administrator at the university of north carolina at 
greensboro was selected over two deaf finalists after her 
appointment as president of the nations only liberal arts college 
for the deaf hundreds of chanting students marched through 
downtown washington with stops at the white house and the capitol 
to protest the decision 
monday students swarmed at the gates of the campus before dawn 
and refused to let professors and administrators in forcing 
officials to cancel classes for the day in the afternoon about 
1800 of the schools 2200 students again protested at the capitol 
trustees including board chairwoman jane bassett spilman met 
with a group of students faculty and staff for three hours monday 
but emerged from the meeting sticking by their original decision to 
hire zinser 
students had demanded the replacement of zinser with a deaf 
leader spilmans resignation and moves to make deaf persons a 
majority on the schools 20member board of trustees the board now 
has only four deaf members 
spilman told a gathering of about 2000 students that the 
boards decision had followed a careful reasoned search 
process 
a lawful proper and final decision was made spilman said 
she left a short while later without taking questions from 
reporters 
zinser who does not speak sign language but has promised to 
learn said in a telephone interview from greensboro that she 
understands the students desire for a deaf president but that she 
believes they will eventually come to accept her she also said she 
will maintain some distance from the school until emotions 
subside 
covell said students are concentrating their protests on capitol 
hill because gallaudet created by an act of congress in 1864 
receives most of its operating budget from the federal government 
in fiscal 1988 gallaudet is receiving 62 million from congress 
were trying to put some pressure on congress to get them to 
put some pressure on our board said covell 
she doesnt even sign what does that tell you said student 
dean prentice 21 of garden city kan we need a deaf person as 
a role model

weeping armenians gathered in a snowy cemetery in 
moscow on tuesday to exchange tales of brutal beatings and deaths 
in a southern city torn by ethnic mob violence 
their accounts which often elicited cries of anger from the 300 
listeners could not be verified independently but were typical of 
stories that have been circulating in armenian communities since 
the feb 28 rioting in the city of sumgait in the republic of 
azerbaijan 
the unrest in sumgait was triggered by protests in the republic 
of armenia demanding that a region given to neighboring azerbaijan 
in 1923 be shifted to armenian control the population of the 
nagornokarabakh district is more than threequarters armenian 
tass the official soviet news agency has said that 31 people 
were killed in sumgait which has an armenian minority soviet 
officials have refused to elaborate on what happened and 
moscowbased journalists have been barred from traveling to the 
caucasus region 
there have been many reports by armenian activists of high death 
tolls and brutality against armenians by azeris members of the 
dominant ethnic group in azerbaijan the azeris are predominantly 
shiite moslem while the armenians are predominantly christian 
the tearful crowd gathered in front of a brick church in the 
armenian section of moscows vagankovskoye cemetery plainclothes 
police watched but did not try to break up the meeting which 
lasted two hours 
one distraught man said he saw a pregnant woman and her unborn 
baby slain and mutilated in sumgait at the local communist party 
headquarters he said he saw people who were covered with knife 
wounds and who had their ears cut off 
the grayhaired man left without giving his name 
the meeting began with a moment of silence for women slain in 
sumgait a priest clad in black asked members of the crowd who had 
witnessed antiarmenian violence to come forward to speak 
a resident of a village near sumgait said bands of azeris had 
roved through his settlement looking under beds for armenian 
children and raping armenian women another armenian said young 
children had been thrown from windows 
ambartsum galestyan deputy chairman of the committee that 
organized last months protests in yerevan armenias capital said 
33 people had been killed in the sumgait rioting 
they included two azeris galestyan said he said the azeris had 
been killed by military units brought in to restore order and that 
eight soldiers had been killed he said 100 to 150 people were 
seriously injured 
galestyan said 4 and 5yearold children had been thrown out of 
fifthfloor windows by mobs in sumgait an industrial city of more 
than 160000 people the yerevan resident did not say how he had 
learned of the attacks on the children or whether they had been 
killed and it was not clear whether he had been in sumgait 
a villager who lives near sumgait said four people in his 
settlement were slain the villager who did not give his name 
said he did not know where his family or sister were i fear for 
their safety he told the meeting 
some speakers were angry at soviet staterun press and 
television which blamed extremists for the dispute over 
nagornokarabakh and never clearly linked the violence in sumgait 
to antagonisms between armenians and azeris 
how can the soviet media today be silent under conditions of 
openness and restructuring asked robert aryanpetyan a 
specialist in history who lives in moscow shame on the central

a navy effort to upgrade future los 
angelesclass attack submarines has generated delays at production 
shipyards and contract overruns totaling 13 billion the service 
said tuesday 
the estimated 13 billion overrun covers 23 of the attack subs 
scheduled for delivery into the 1990s and amounts to roughly a 59 
percent increase over the negotiated target price for each 
submarine the navy said 
the navys target price for each of the attack submarines 
currently is between 750 million and 760 million of the 23 
submarines covered by the latest overrun estimate 11 are being 
built by general dynamics corp and 12 by newport news shipbuilding 
amp drydock co 
under the production contracts covering the vessels the overrun 
will be split 5050 with each of two shipyards building the subs 
meaning the navy will have to pay out roughly 650 million beyond 
the target price of the 23 submarines 
the navy said it already had the funds on hand to pay the 
overrun however because it had anticipated there might be some 
delays associated with improving the los angelesclass of subs 
the navy has retained funds to cover all improvements and 
there are no plans to seek additional funds from congress to cover 
these improvements the service added 
the delivery delays vary by shipyard but range from seven 
months to 18 months the navy said 
the los angeles class also known as the 688 class is the 
navys primary attack sub the nuclearpowered vessel is designed 
to hunt and destroy soviet submarines and is built at general 
dynamics electric boat division in groton conn and at the 
newport news shipyard in newport news va 
the navy is now in the midst of research and development work on 
a new attack submarine designated the ssn21 seawolf but doesnt 
anticipate that vessel materializing before 1994 at the earliest 
in the interim the navy set out to improve the 688class 
submarine with such things as a stronger hull to allow arctic 
operations better electronic and sensor systems a series of 
noisereduction modifications and installation of launching boxes 
for tomahawk cruise missiles 
the service said tuesday some of the improvements had required 
extensive modification of the original design leading to delays 
that were not totally unexpected 
in this case the navy and contractors have at least agreed up 
front on how cost overruns will be handled and thus should avoid 
the type of legal wrangling that erupted after cost overruns 
skyrocketed on the same submarine in the 1970s said assistant navy 
secretary everett pyatt 
im not going through that again pyatt added 
four newport news boats are now expected to be delivered from 14 
months to 18 months late while seven general dynamics submarines 
will be delivered from seven months to nine months late 
we want the deliveries on as timely a basis as possible but 
we have to acknowledge the fact that the modifications which we 
asked for were a contributing factor dan howard the pentagons 
chief spokesman said tuesday

bush sounded confident of a solid delegate boost toward the 
republican nomination dole had already returned to the midwest 
flying to illinois which holds its primary next tuesday 
the person that clearly wins super tuesday is going to be the 
nominee of the party and i think the next president bush told 
reporters in tulsa on monday 
dole also was in oklahoma and while conceding bush was likely to 
carry most super tuesday states said we dont want to lose the 
white house by nominating the wrong person 
an abc news poll of voters in super tuesday states said bush was 
leading in 16 of the 17 states holding republican contests dole 
was ahead only in missouri 
abc news said it interviewed a total of 8659 voters across the 
region between march 3 and 6 for the survey but cautioned that its 
samples in the nonsouthern states were too small to produce 
specific numbers for the candidates it said the margin of error 
for the southern results was 3 percentage points either way 
the survey indicated that not only that bush was leading 
throughout the south but that his strongest leads were in the two 
biggest states texas with 111 delegates and florida with 82 
among the democrats dukakis had a lock on his home state of 
massachusetts and rhode island and was leading in florida maryland 
and by a narrow margin in texas 
jackson was the leader in deep south states such as alabama 
georgia mississippi and louisiana as well as arkansas north 
carolina and virginia where blacks comprise up to 30 percent of the 
democratic electorate 
hands that once picked cotton tomorrow morning will pick a 
president jackson told an exuberant crowd at a rally in 
birmingham ala on monday night 
gore banking on his southern heritage and longest time spent 
capaigning the region was leading in kentucky oklahoma and 
tennessee according to the survey 
gephardt counting on winning support with a populist appeal 
was said to be leading only in his home state 
a new poll published today in the atlanta journalconstitution 
also gave bush a wide lead in the south finding him favored by 56 
percent of republicans surveyed in 12 states in the region on the 
democratic side jackson led with 29 percent support followed by 
dukakis and gore with 20 percent each 
for robertson the southern primaries amounted to his last best 
chance to demonstrate that he could mount a serious challenge to 
the establishment candidates despite a strong following among 
evangelical christians the former television preacher has yet to 
win a gop primary and was a disappointing third in south carolina 
on saturday a state he once boasted he would win ecisively 
bush has me four to one robertson said monday in charlotte 
nc im like david up against goliath but we will do very well 
in the south 
rep jack kemp of new york was given no chance of carrying a 
super tuesday state and planned to meet with advisers on wednesday 
and was presumed to be ready to drop out of the race 
on the democratic side sen paul simon of illinois made no 
effort in the super tuesday states and planned to resume his 
candidacy in his home state 
gary hart trudged on attracting little notice and even less 
support 
holding republican and democratic primaries were alabama 
arkansas florida georgia kentucky louisiana maryland 
massachusetts mississippi missouri north carolina oklahoma 
rhode island tennessee texas and virginia in addition democrats 
in american samoa hawaii idaho and nevada were holding caucuses 
as were both parties in washington 
democrats in minnesota constrained by national party rules from 
allocating delegates from their caucuses held two weeks ago were 
doing so tonight 
dukakis was the big winner in minnesota but jackson and simon 
also were expected to pick up delegates 
the states holding republican primaries were selecting 712 
delegates more than twothirds of the 1139 needed for a 
convention majority 
on the democratic side the prize was 1307 delegates a total 
of 2082 were needed for the nomination 
the latest associated press delegate count gave bush 126 dole 
65 kemp 35 and robertson 8 for the democrats the count was 
dukakis 69 gephardt 50 gore 21 jackson 27 simon 35 hart 0 and 
uncommitted 258 
during a campaign flight in missouri bush told reporters he 
wouldnt predict a sweep its too much for anyone to expect

a federal judge today refused to issue a 
restraining order that would have allowed civilian workers at a 
navy shipyard to participate in washingtons presidential precinct 
caucuses tonight 
the navy earlier had said that the federal hatch act prevented 
11600 workers at the puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton from 
speaking out on which candidates they preferred 
us district judge jack tanners brief order said the state of 
washington which had asked for the restraining order failed to 
show irreparable injury would result if the navys position were 
allowed to stand and failed to establish the balance of hardships 
tip in their favor 
tanners ruling came in a hastily filed state suit which 
contended that prohibiting federal workers from speaking at the 
party caucuses unconstitutionally violated their right to free 
speech 
the suit filed monday asked tanner to clarify the intent of 
the hatch act by interpreting conflicting sections of the 
regulations said david bryant a spokesman for the washington 
secretary of states office 
secretary of state ralph munro was miffed at the ruling and said 
the state may pursue the case for future years 
im disappointed he didnt provide federal workers more 
protection he said i cant believe in the long run that this 
is constitutional 
he said the states abortive attempt at gaining an injunction 
did succeed in clarifying that federal workers may attend their 
caucuses and participate in most respects 
it sends a clear signal they can go to the caucuses and do 
everything but speak out on the canidates munro said its 
absurd a guy can say what america needs is a senator from kansas 
who was wounded and was a war hero but he cant say what 
america needs is bob dole 
a bill to revise the hatch act and allow workers to participate 
in partisan political activities on their own time overwhelmingly 
passed the us house last year it is pending in the senate 
officials at the bremerton shipyard had told workers they could 
attend the political caucuses scheduled in 12000 washington 
neighborhoods but could not discuss candidates 
the caucuses are the first step in the monthslong process 
leading up to a selection of delegates from washington to the 
national presidential nominating conventions this summer at stake 
ultimately are 73 democratic national convention delegates and 41 
republican delegates 
the hatch act states that federal employees may not use their 
official authority or influence to interfere with an election 
obviously addressing the caucus is part of the activity 
said james sommerhauser representing professional and technical 
engineers local 12 in bremerton but most federal employees are 
so intimidated by the hatch act theyre afraid to participate 
sommerhauser said his union represents 1800 federal workers at 
the yard and elsewhere in the county

fundamentalist moslem students attacked a 
group of scouts with knives stones and bicycle chains then opened 
fire on security forces as they came to the scouts aid 
authorities said tuesday 
two policemen and two extremists were wounded slightly said a 
police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said officers arrested about 50 students after the monday 
night incident and another 20 on tuesday many had been arrested 
after a demonstration late last year 
the fundamentalists apparently attacked the male and female 
scouts because of their belief that the sexes should not mix 
police said the fundamentalist students were found with two 
empty pistols iron rods knives and daggers about 25 shell 
casings from rounds used against security forces were found at the 
stadium on the assiut university campus where the violence occurred 
on tuesday police clamped tight security on the downtown 
courthouse where the suspects were housed on campus about 500 
fundamentalists tried to demonstrate for the release of their 
classmates but were stopped by university guards security 
officials said 
street demonstrations are banned in egypt under an emergency law 
enacted after moslem extremists assassinated president anwar sadat 
in october 1981 
for several years the university campus has been a hotbed of 
moslem fundamentalist agitation in assiut a southern nile town 235 
miles south of cairo 
monday nights trouble began during a meeting and parade of the 
rovers the equivalent of the explorers in the american boy scout 
program 
university officials said militants attacked the parade 
university guards were unable to contain the fight and called 
for help from outside security police normally banned from the 
campus 
four people were hurt in the melee that followed but the rovers 
escaped unhurt by climbing out stadium windows and clambering down 
fire escapes security officials said 
in a telephone call to the associated press in cairo a man 
claiming to speak for assiuts fundamentalists blamed security 
police for the trouble he said his group demonstrated because the 
university administration had organized a dancing and singing 
party and security police broke up the demonstration with tear 
gas and batons 
security officials said the suspects were charged with firearms 
and other weapons offenses and destroying musical instruments 
the fundamentalists appear to have been angered because they 
believe the sexes should be forbidden from mixing in parties 
picnics or other social events

sen albert gore jrs southern strategy faced a doordie test 
on super tuesday democratic rivals michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson were favored overall in the battle for 1307 party 
delegates and richard gephardt fought for survival 
jackson a black man born and educated in the south relied on 
his wide support among that regions large black population and 
figured to be among the delegate leaders in the super tuesday 
voting 
gov dukakis of massachusetts was virtually conceded the support 
of his home state and he sought to win on both sides of dixie with 
strong bids in texas and florida 
gore of tennessee and gephardt of missouri were heavily favored 
to win their home states they battled among themselves for what 
was left of the white vote theirs was a struggle for survival 
with each reduced to a strategy aimed at emerging as the white 
alternative to dukakis when the campaign moves elsewhere 
two other candidates were on the ballot but werent factors 
sen paul simon of illinois and gary hart the former senator from 
colorado 
twenty states and american samoa were holding democratic 
contests in what was the closest thing to a national primary ever 
held 
most were in the south where every state save south carolina 
had a primary south carolina democrats select delegates saturday 
outside the south there were primaries in massachusetts rhode 
island washington state idaho and nevada 
at stake were 1307 delegates more than half the number needed 
to win the nomination a candidate had to receive at least 15 
percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to win 
delegates 
jackson is from the only southern state not voting south 
carolina but he had a strong appeal to blacks who make up a 
quarter of the democratic vote in the south and as much as half 
in alabama and mississippi 
with so many white candidates fragmenting the vote jackson 
hoped to score well in other southern states too 
after wins in new hampshire maine and vermont dukakis hoped to 
demonstrate an appeal to democrats outside new england and he 
concentrated heavily on texas and florida he had wide appeal among 
jewish voters in south florida and hispanics in texas 
gore followed a southern strategy that ignored the earliest 
contests even while insisting he was a national candidate but he 
faced a severe battle even to emerge as his own regions candidate 
gephardt entered the southern campaign with little money to 
mount the heavy television campaign that succeeded for him in the 
earlier states he and gore sought the moderate and conservative 
vote 
simon running as the clear liberal was reeling and broke from 
thirdplace finishes in iowa and new hampshire he sat out the 
super tuesday campaign and awaited the next stop his home state of 
illinois where he planned a lowbudget campaign to get back in the 
race 
hart a year ago the oddson favorite acknowledged before super 
tuesday that he didnt expect to be the nominee but was pressing 
his candidacy in an effort to steer the campaign debate 
hart had reentered the race in december but couldnt regain the 
support he had before dropping out seven months earlier amid 
disclosures about his relationship with model donna rice

chinas foreign minister told president reagan 
today his government is very concerned about the iraniraq war and 
supports an arms embargo against the tehran regime a white house 
spokesman said 
president spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
also accepts chinas declaration that it no longer is selling 
silkworm missiles to iran although it remains a supplier of 
conventional arms 
reagan met for nearly 40 minutes in the oval office with wu 
xueqian who was making his first visit to the united states in 
four years posing for photographers reagan said we have a very 
cordial relationship between our two countries and we want to 
continue it 
briefing reporters on the meeting fitzwater said wu offered 
support for a un ceasefire resolution in the iraniraq war and 
also endorsed an arms embargo to back it up if the overwhelming 
majority of the un security council believed it should be 
adopted 
fitzwater said the administration did not believe that wu was 
trying to qualify or limit his endorsement 
it was our reaction the presidents reaction that this was a 
very positive sign a very strong expression of support and one 
frankly one we hope the soviet union would emulate fitzwater 
said 
in the talks reagan did not bring up the subject of the 
silkworm missiles although it was discussed in wus earlier 
meetings with secretary of state george p shultz fitzwater said 
the united states protested to china last fall about its sale of 
silkworms to iran to the best of our information they have not 
delivered any missiles since then fitzwater said 
while noting that china still remains a major supplier of 
conventional arms he said we think the fact that we have not 
detected any new missile shipments and their general attitude 
toward the iraniraq war and the un resolution that those are 
very hopeful signs 
wu met monday with shultz and with defense secretary frank c 
carlucci 
during toasts following a state department luncheon on monday 
shultz and wu hailed the progress in bilateal relations and made 
almost no reference to issues dividing them 
chief among those issues is chinas reported sales of military 
weaponry to iran in defiance of us efforts at the united nations 
to win support for a worldwide arms embargo against iran 
the administration has been seeking assurances from china that 
it will not veto an embargo resolution 
last october the united states retaliated against china for 
selling silkworm antiship missiles to iran by suspending the 
process under which china had been given increasing access to us 
products with advanced technology 
since then china has said it has stopped selling silkworms to 
iran 
shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent antichinese 
rioting in tibet state department spokesman charles redman said 
between three and nine people are believed to have been killed and 
he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in tibet

arizonas ranking lawman said today he 
decided to cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat 
but didnt tell evan mecham because the governor was so angry about 
the probe he was not to be reasoned with 
department of public safety director ralph milstead in his 
second day of testimony at mechams impeachment trial continued to 
insist that mecham had obstructed justice by ordering milstead not 
to cooperate 
during his five hours of testimony monday milstead had 
portrayed mecham as a frightened angry leader who told him i 
dont want you to help the attorney general hang me dont tell him 
anything 
the firstterm republican governor is accused of trying to 
thwart an investigation into whether an associate lee watkins 
threatened last nov 12 to send former top mecham aide donna 
carlson on a long boat ride if she testified before a grand 
jury investigating mechams campaign finances watkins has denied 
threatening ms carlson 
during continued crossexamination today by defense attorney 
fred craft milstead testified that mecham was fully informed about 
the alleged threat and the involvement of the attorney generals 
office when he told mecham the attorney general wanted information 
from dps officers about the matter 
milstead said today he did not tell mecham during their 
telephone conversation that he intended to cooperate with the 
attorney general despite the governors order not to 
i was in shock from his anger that was directed toward the 
attorney general milstead said he was not to be reasoned 
with 
milstead testified monday that he considered the alleged threat 
serious because watkins had a criminal record watkins resigned as 
state prison construction chief after a past assault conviction was 
disclosed 
milstead 49 said he phoned mecham on nov 15 to alert him to 
the possible death threat i think my words to the governor were 
i dont want you to be blindsided said milstead 
milstead said when mecham told him not to cooperate with the 
attorney general i was in shock over what he was saying taken 
aback speechless 
craft asked milstead why he had not included his own part of the 
conversation in a report he wrote on his talk with mecham 
because im not committing a crime said milstead im not 
obstructing justice 
when did you conclude that the governors words constituted a 
crime asked craft 
as im hearing them and reflecting on them said milstead 
adding it took him about two seconds after hanging up the phone 
craft asked if milstead was surprised that his staff didnt tell 
him the governor had assigned cabinet member max hawkins thenhead 
of the department of administration to investigate the death 
threat allegation 
no it didnt surprise me said milstead max hawkins is 
not a law enforcement officer hes not competent to investigate 
it lee watkins works for him and max hawkins wouldnt be taken 
seriously anywhere on earth that i know of 
the senators decided monday to forego hearing from watkins 
because it meant granting him immunity from prosecution watkins 
invoked fifth amendment protection against self incrimination 
senators also expressed impatience with crafts long 
interrogation which minority leader alan stephens a democrat 
called wearing and repetitious 
if thats what they do in a court of law said stephens 
im glad im not a lawyer 
mecham 63 the first us governor to be impeached in six 
decades is not attending his trial and did not comment on 
milsteads testimony in january he testified before a house 
impeachment committee that he may have told milstead not to 
cooperate with the attorney generals investigation but that he was 
not fully informed about the seriousness of the situation 
mecham also is charged with concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
and misusing 80000 in a state funds by loaning it to his car 
dealership 
he faces a a may 17 recall election and a march 22 criminal 
trial on the campaign loan disclosure allegation a prosecutor in 
that case however sought monday to have it delayed until april 21 
on the ground that pretrial defense maneuvers have left the 
prosecution too little time to prepare 
defense lawyers monday filed a series of motions including one 
asking for a dismissal of the charges 
judge michael ryan of maricopa county superior court said he 
would rule wednesday or thursday on the prosecution request but did 
not indicate when he would rule on the defense motions

pat robertsons fervent band of supporters waged 
political warfare against republican regulars in presidential 
caucuses tuesday while massachusetts gov michael dukakis was 
favored over his democratic rivals 
none of the states 41 gop delegates were directly at stake in 
the caucus voting but the former television evangelist hoped to 
embarrass vice president george bush and kansas sen bob dole 
robertson was given a good shot at winning the state where 
evangelicals have controlled the party for most of a decade 
ramming through antiabortion ultraconservative platforms at 
carefully orchestrated conventions 
were stomping the daylights out of them robertsons state 
organizer bruce hawkins said with a delighted chuckle a few days 
ago 
bush and dole forces waging conventional campaigns admitted to 
high anxiety over the robertson factor but held out hope the party 
regulars would get worried enough to go to their neighborhood 
caucuses 
the caucus voting was basically a straw poll since delegates 
elected to go on to districtlevel caucuses are not bound to any 
candidate 
on the democratic side with 65 delegates at stake dukakis 
benefited from endorsements by gov booth gardner sen brock 
adams seattle mayor charles royer and other party leaders 
jesse jackson and illinois sen paul simon were fighting it out 
for second and thirdplace finishes and a sizable number of 
caucusgoers were expected to vote for uncommitted delegates said 
state democratic chairwoman karen marchioro

george bush bid to take command of the republican presidential 
race in southerndominated super tuesday elections that offered a 
third of all nominating delegates michael dukakis hoped to show 
nationwide appeal and emerge as the frontrunner in a bruising 
democratic race 
jesse jackson drawing upon his black political base in dixie 
looked to win several states and hundreds of democratic delegates 
sen albert gore jr tested his southern strategy in a battle with 
rep richard gephardt to emerge as the moderate contender in the 
industrial states to come 
preelection surveys indicated bush could hope for a sweep of 
the gop contests with sen bob dole contesting in just a handful 
of states pat robertson and jack kemp seemed out of the running 
almost everywhere 
the campaign was notable for its accusatory tv commercials the 
number of convention delegates at stake 712 in 17 republican 
contests and 1307 in 21 democratic primaries and caucuses made 
super tuesday the busiest day of this or any other presidential 
nomination campaign 
as the day dawned bush and dukakis were the leaders in the hunt 
for national convention delegates democratic delegates from 
minnesotas feb 23 caucuses were being allocated with most to 
dukakis followed by jackson 
beforehand dukakis had 70 delegates gephardt 50 simon 36 
jackson 28 and gore 22 it takes 2082 delegates to win the 
democratic nomination 
among the republicans it was bush with 126 dole with 65 kemp 
with 35 and robertson with 8 it takes 1139 delegates to win the 
gop nomination 
democratic surveys suggested that dukakis and jackson would each 
carry at least a handful of states dukakis had his home state of 
massachusetts in his pocket but gore countered with his tennessee 
and gephardt with missouri 
dukakis having won several new england contests hoped to 
demonstrate a broader appeal than any of his rivals with victories 
in texas florida washington maryland rhode island and hawaii 
jackson was strong all across dixie and gores hopes seemed to rest 
on the strength of secondplace finishes 
dukakis targeted his campaign at ethnic voters liberals and 
union workers in pockets across the south aiming his appeal as 
well at the huge elderly population in florida 
dukakis hoped to use his superior finances and organization to 
pick up dozens of delegates in states where he didnt expect to win 
outright his rivals made the same effort on a smaller scale 
knowing they could earn at least one delegate in any congressional 
district where they received 15 percent of the vote 
jackson who has run well in some states without a large number 
of black voters was drawing on his core constituency for the first 
time this year and hoped to win in georgia virginia mississippi 
louisiana and alabama as well as one or two other states 
sen paul simon of illinois bypassed the super tuesday elections 
to concentrate on the primary next week in his home state gary 
hart the longago frontrunner was the invisible man politically 
the republican picture was entirely different bush whose 
campaign was in jeopardy before new hampshire voted three weeks 
ago was comfortably ahead in preelection polls in nearly every 
super tuesday state he aimed to pile up enough delegates to make 
his nomination seem inevitable while dole hoped to snare enough to 
carry him credibly to next weeks primary fight in illinois 
robertson the former television evangelist bid for second 
place in a few states and a win in the washington caucuses kemp 
who had dreamed of emerging as a conservative alternative in the 
race faced a 17state shutout and seemed likely to withdraw later 
in the week 
gore was banking everything on a strong showing in his native 
region he began with his base in tennessee and hoped to pick up a 
few hundred delegates even if he finished behind jackson across 
dixie 
gephardt who won the kickoff iowa caucuses exactly one month 
ago and followed it up in south dakota counted on a home state win 
in missouri

a radical sikh priest freed from jail 
just three days ago was elected tuesday as chief priest for the 
golden temple a post that makes him spokesman and spiritual leader 
for 25 million sikhs 
the council responsible for sikh shrines unanimously picked 
jasbir singh rode to be the new head of the akal takht or eternal 
throne the seat of sikh authority united news of india reported 
the sprawling golden temple complex in amritsar is sikhisms 
holiest shrine the council the shiromani gurudwara prabandhak 
committee met in chandigarh the capital of punjab state about 150 
miles north of new delhi 
rode 34 replaces darshan singh a moderate who resigned last 
year 
rode was released from jail saturday he has been in custody 
since 1985 on federal charges of sedition but was never brought to 
trial 
his release and that of other sikh priests and militants is 
believed linked to a government move to include militants in the 
political process in punjab which has been wracked by a sikh 
separatist insurrection since 1982 
on sunday the government dissolved the punjab state 
legislature the legislature had been suspended since may 1987 
after an escalation of separatist violence since then punjab has 
been ruled by the federal government 
new elections will have to be held in the state possibly 
drawing participation by the militants 
sikhs form just 2 percent of indias 800 million people but are 
in a majority in punjab 
rode is the nephew of sikh militant leader jarnail singh 
bhindranwale who was killed in an army attack on the golden temple 
in 1984 
ten people were killed in punjab on tuesday and monday in 
violence blamed on sikh militants police said this year more 
than 400 people have been killed in punjab in attacks blamed on 
sikh extremists most of the victims have been hindus or moderate 
sikhs

both races were marked by accusatory campaign commercials on a 
scope that was unprecedented for a presidential campaign 
dukakis aired a commercial featuring an acrobat doing 
somersaults as he tried to depict gephardt as a man who flipflops 
on the issues dole ran commercials saying bush had approved 
armsforhostages swaps during the irancontra affair 
thus ended what amounted to a southern regional primary 
campaign an idea hatched by democratic officials who wanted to 
give a moderatetoconservative contender a boost toward the 
partys 1988 nomination 
the idea was to help nominate a democrat who could run strongly 
across the south in the general election campaign in the fall and 
bolster the prospects of democratic candidates in local elections 
but whatever the theory the result was a struggle carried out 
largely through costly television commercials with no particular 
southern cast the candidates trying to campaign in an impossible 
number of areas simultaneously often were reduced to staging 
appearances at airports so they could leave as quickly as possible 
for the next stop 
but the commercials were eyecatching particularly on the 
democratic side voters who didnt see the ads would read about 
them in the paper or see clips on the television news 
gephardt attacked dukakis for raising taxes while governor of 
massachusetts and mocked dukakis for once suggesting that farmers 
diversify their crops by growing belgian endive he also aired a 
spot seeking to portray dukakis campaign as guilty of a string of 
dirty tricks 
dukakis returned fire with ads featuring an acrobat doing 
somersaults while the announcer attacked gephardt as flipflopping 
on critical issues 
gore retooled his message in midcampaign with a populist appeal 
designed to siphon off some of gephardts support his final flurry 
of ads attacked gephardt and dukakis in one commercial he even 
added a mild jab at jackson 
as much as anything super tuesday was a test of gores southern 
strategy for gaining the nomination alone among the contenders he 
ignored the iowa caucuses and spent months collecting endorsements 
and campaigning in his native region in hopes of jumpstarting his 
campaign at home after others had left the field however among 
the original democratic candidates only bruce babbitt was gone by 
super tuesday 
the democratic idea for a regional primary suited the bush 
forces fine the vice presidents aides quickly spread the word 
that they had erected a southern fire wall that would contain 
any damage resulting from defeats in earlier contests and when 
bush finished a poor third in the feb 8 iowa caucuses it looked 
like the theory would get a test 
but then came bushs victory in new hampshires primary 
followed by his convincing triumph in the south carolina primary on 
saturday 
and instead of merely hoping to hold his own the vice president 
spent the last two days campaigning and advertising heavily in 
doles strongest state in missouri in hopes of pulling off a sweep 
dole suffered through a difficult period as his campaign manager 
fired two senior aides in an internal struggle for control 
even as the polls opened on super tuesday the contenders were 
looking ahead to the next round in the nominating wars 
dole had begun airing television commercials in illinois a 
contest his aides said he had to win to sustain his candidacy

the average college administrator got a 33 
percent pay increase this year down from 53 percent a year ago 
the college and university personnel association said tuesday 
the 33 percent increase for 198788 was less than the 37 
percent increase in consumer prices during the same period and the 
first time since 198283 that the college salaries trailed the rise 
in the consumer price index 
the association derived the figures from its 11th annual survey 
of how much colleges pay their presidents deans and other 
administrators 
college tuitions have been rising faster than consumer prices 
for most of the 1980s and campuses have come under increasing 
pressure from secretary of education william j bennett and other 
critics to hold down costs

a senior tibetan communist party official tuesday 
condemned the savage actions of his tibetan countrymen who 
sparked two days of antichinese riots in the capital of lhasa last 
week 
sabotage of the monkled rioters went completely against 
the peoples wish for a normal democratic life tibets party 
deputy secretary raidi was quoted as saying by the official xinhua 
news agency 
xinhua also claimed in a report from lhasa that no policemen 
carried arms while on duty saturday western sources have said that 
five tibetans and three policemen were killed in the rioting while 
chinese officials say the only death was that of a policeman 
another chinese official report said the riots which started 
saturday stretched into sunday previous reports said there was no 
unrest sunday 
that report by the china news agency also said tibetan monks 
tried to poison the tea of chinese officials and journalists 
attending ceremonies to mark the end of a major buddhist festival 
xinhua said 309 policemen were injured 29 seriously by 
tibetans attacking with stones clubs and iron bars the china news 
service monitored in hong kong put the number of hospitalized 
police officers at more than 30 
there have been unconfirmed reports that some rioters were shot 
and western travelers in lhasa contacted by telephone have 
reported seeing large contingents of armed police 
travelers said police on tuesday withdrew their blockade from 
around the jokhang temple lhasas main temple and the scene of the 
violent protest against chinese rule 
william tang assistant foreign manager at the lhasa hotel said 
guests were told they could go to the temples market square but 
at their own risk 
most tibetans detest and oppose the savage actions of the 
handful of splittists raidi a tibetan told xinhua 
splittists is a termed coined by the chinese to describe those 
who seek independence for regions in china 
the weekend violence followed a similar outbreak of 
proindependence unrest in early october during which at least 14 
people died 
chinese troops entered tibet in 1950 after beating nationalist 
chinese forces in a civil war nine years later tibets spiritual 
and temporal leader the dalai lama fled into exile after an 
abortive uprising 
many tibetans continue to be bitter about chinas suppression of 
local customs and religion and its destruction of temples 
china news service accused the monks of being the ringleaders 
saturday the final day of a major 10day festival known as the 
great prayer festival 
the report said monks saturday attacked the vans of chinese tv 
crews photographing the 500yearold prayer festival and dropped a 
22pound boulder from a rooftop 
seven cars from tibets local tv station and a camera were 
smashed the report said two cars were turned over and another set 
afire as the rampaging monks shouted smash anything that is 
communist 
a western traveler said tibetans told him police beat two monks 
to death inside the jokhang temple 
several tibetans later carried the monks bodies around the 
square he said triggering further clashes 
the dalai lama in a statement from his office in new delhi 
monday said the violence clearly revealed the desperation of 
the tibetan people he called on tibetans to restrain from 
violence in spite of repressive measures that the chinese may 
take

negotiators on tuesday reported progress in their 
work on the fine print of an emerging afghan settlement in talks to 
end nine years of fighting 
un mediator diego cordovez told reporters that negotiations 
were focusing on sensitive technicalities of the four documents 
that are to make up the peace package and govern the withdrawal of 
an estimated 115000 soviet troops backing kabuls communist 
government 
asked if there was substantive progress he said yes but did 
not elaborate even if the two sides wanted to sign the accords 
now they cannot do so before the agreements are ready he said 
cordovezs optimistic comments came as an afghan resistance 
group quit the seven member antisoviet alliance because it said 
the interim government in afghanistan could be dominated by moslem 
extremists 
the abrupt departure of the afghan national liberation front 
reduces to two the number of moderate parties in the alliance 
pakistan is going to bring in a fundamentalist government it 
is not good for afghanistan it will destroy afghanistan said 
the fronts leader sibghatullah mojaddedi 
it was not clear how mojaddedis move might affect negotiations 
cordovez and other sources close to the talks made it clear that 
nothing spectacular was likely to emerge in the next few days from 
the indirect negotiations between pakistan and afghanistan 
you should go sightseeing for three days he counseled 
journalists 
still there was considerable behindthescenes activity 
cordovez and delegates reportedly kept close touch with deputy 
us secretary of state robert peck and another visitor ambassador 
nicolai kozyrev described as a soviet specialist on afghan affairs 
pakistans chief representative acting foreign minister zain 
noorani was eager to dispel any notions of a standstill 
things are moving forward he said dont you see that i 
am coming here every day 
a diplomatic source who insisted on anonymity said prospects for 
a settlement continued to look good in the current round which 
started march 2 the source said that no substantive discussions 
had taken place on the question of an interim government pakistan 
wants the formation of a broadbased transitional kabul government 
to move on a second track parallel to the implementation of 
troop withdrawal 
it argues that only a generally acceptable government can ensure 
the safe return of more than five million refugees and prevent more 
bloodshed in the country already mourning more than one million 
dead 
the kabul delegation has publicly rejected pakistans request as 
an attempt to introduce an extraneous issue that could undermine 
the talks but pakistan is reported to be still hoping for a 
compromise perhaps by agreeing to sign the settlement with the 
present leadership which it does not recognize in return for 
assurances that an interim government will be formed soon afterward 
pakistani president muhammad zia ulhaq in dubai for 
inauguration of the emirates golf club said tuesday an interim 
government was a necessary ingredient in any settlement 
we do not want to go over just pages of an agreement out of 
the geneva process we want to take a comprehensive settlement and 
for that settlement an interim government is one of the most 
essential instruments zia said

an afghan resistance group on tuesday 
quit an antisoviet alliance because of fears that the interim 
government in afghanistan will be dominated by moslem extremists 
sibghatullah mojaddedi leader of the moderate afghan national 
liberation front also resigned as party chief 
the fronts abrupt departure reduces to two the number of 
moderate parties in the alliance 
hamed karzai the partys information director said mojaddedis 
move was to protest plans for a future afghan government worked out 
by the alliances moslem extremist members 
for us its is finished karzai said of the alliance 
at a news conference mojaddedi said the most important 
decision about afghanistan had been made by seven people the 
leaders of the sevenparty alliance 
nobody has looked to the 15 million people of afghanistan 
he said adding that the three million shiite moslems had 
particularly been ignored 
mojaddedi said the proposal for an interim government announced 
late last month was too hardline 
pakistan is going to bring in a fundamentalist government it 
is not good for afghanistan it will destroy afghanistan 
mojaddedi said 
he said the best alternative was to convene a grand national 
council whose membership of about 1000 would include commanders 
scholars tribal and religious leaders refugees and afghans living 
abroad 
the council he said would decide the future government 
moslem extremists in the alliance apparently oppose that plan 
the alliance under pressure from pakistan announced in late 
february plans to form a future afghan government headed by an 
allguerrilla executive council and 28 ministers possibly 
including noncommunist officials from the communist government in 
kabul 
while pakistan cautiously endorsed the plan rumors soon 
circulated in peshawar that the alliance leaders were split over 
which parties should wield the most power 
pakistan which is negotating with the kabul government over a 
withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan has insisted that the 
formation of a broadbased interim afghan government is crucial for 
the safe return of about 5 million afghan refugees from pakistan 
and iran 
meanwhile the remaining six guerrilla leaders called an 
emergency meeting to discuss the development none of them would 
comment on mojaddedis move 
although mojaddedi personally has considerable political 
influence his party comprised of traditional pathan tribal 
militias with few outside sources of military or financial support 
is not strong 
the split comes at a sensitive time for pakistan which speaks 
for the guerrillas at unsponsored peace talks in geneva

sen paul simon silent in the south lies in 
wait for democratic rivals jesse jackson and michael dukakis as the 
presidential campaign turns north to illinois where sen bob dole 
is readying a republican last stand against george bush 
jackson hopes to reap delegates and votes in chicago where he 
lives while simon seeks strength from state democratic leaders who 
encouraged him to keep afloat his fading campaign effort 
the homestate candidates face a strong challenge from dukakis 
whose wellheeled and wellorganized staff has scoured the state 
since last fall and has slates in all districts dukakis will 
likely hammer away at economic themes in a state struggling with 
plant closings and job losses 
rep richard gephardt is not expected to mount a major campaign 
in the state he sees no hope of success given simon and jacksons 
builtin strengths and dukakis substantial effort 
i think with muddled results from super tuesday and a strong 
favorite son in paul simon were going to look at the state beyond 
that and thats michigan said spokesman mark johnson 
sen albert gore jr of nearneighbor tennessee plans to spend 
part of the week in illinois as does former sen gary hart of 
colorado 
on the republican side sen dole a kansan who has done well in 
the midwest and calls illinois friendly territory has another 
shot at farm votes 
however vice president bush is backed by gov james thompson 
93 of 102 county leaders and other influential state leaders 
there are no areas we consider ourselves weak in said ed 
murnane deputy campaign director 
dole also has a strong state operation with coordinators in all 
counties and wellknown delegate candidates said campaign director 
mark schroeder doles organization began shifting forces to 
illinois even before super tuesday 
rep jack kemp of new york and former television evangelist pat 
robertson were not expected to be major factors 
illinois is a diverse state with numerous ethnic groups 
industrial centers farms big cities small towns professionals 
and bluecollar workers 
illinois is a microcosm of the nation said samuel gove a 
political scientist and director emeritus at the university of 
illinois institute of government a candidate who can do well 
here can do well nationally 
more than 59 million residents are registered to vote in 
tuesdays primary the lowest number for any statewide election 
since 1982 the race is divided into a nonbinding presidential 
preference dubbed the beauty contest and the selection of 
delegates pledged to a candidate or uncommitted 
because of heavy emphasis on earlier races the candidates have 
devoted little time to illinois where 113 democratic and 82 gop 
delegates will be chosen tuesday the remaining 85 will be selected 
at party meetings 
during the next six days however candidates will crisscross 
illinois and burn up the airwaves with their messages dukakis 
aides for example have said they expect to spend about 500000 
on tv advertising 
simon however a firstterm senator who has served as 
congressman state lawmaker and lieutenant governor doesnt plan 
any tv advertising here 
he shouldnt have to hes run here his whole life said 
jerry sinclair simons illinois political director were short 
of dollars 
both simon and jackson have made strong showings in recent state 
polls 
simon who is supported by many party leaders has denied 
speculation he stayed in the race so illinois delegates committed 
to him can attend the national convention 
the plan is to concentrate on illinois and then the midwest 
industrial states to keep accumulating delegates sinclair said 
the way it looks now no one is going to get this thing on the 
first ballot if it becomes more and more fragmented why 
should paul drop out 
but jack van der slik political studies professor at sangamon 
state university in springfield said his votes are going to be 
lower than before he bowed out of super tuesday hes going to look 
weak thats going to be the coup de grace 
jackson though expects to do better than his 1984 showing of 
21 percent of illinois vote said spokesman frank watkins 
watkins said jackson has delegate slates in 21 of 22 
congressional districts compared with four in 1984 he said 
jackson will fare well in chicago where 56 percent of the voters 
are black or hispanic and will expand his white base as he has in 
vermont and minnesota 
van der slik however said i think jesse is much more 
vulnerable in this state people have made up their minds about 
him he was much more of a fresh face in a lot of those other 
situations

city supervisors have agreed to ban the 
sale of realistic toy guns following the recent fatal shooting of a 
retarded boy who drew a toy pistol on police officers 
the measure was proposed by supervisor wendy nelder daughter of 
a former police chief who said some toy stores already have 
removed toy weapons from their shelves 
nobody wants to be responsible for a little kids death or a 
police officers death or anybody elses she said in an 
interview 
on feb 17 two police officers killed silivelio tony 
grohse 13 when he pointed a toy gun which the officers thought 
was real at them during a confrontation 
the district attorneys office cleared the officers of 
wrongdoing saying they had a wellfounded fear for their lives 
in another incident on dec 21 1986 a police officer shot a 
15yearold burglary suspect to death after the youth held up a toy 
gun 
toy guns already are banned in los angeles and neighboring 
burbank and santa monica 
nelders plan won unanimous tentative approval late monday 
night final adoption usually is a rubberstamping procedure taking 
place within 30 days 
under the plan possession of a toy gun would still be legal 
otherwise she notes it would be possible for a police officer to 
arrest people in one house for having toy guns but impossible to 
arrest a neighbor with real weapons that were otherwise legal 
it also will be legal to sell toy guns that were obviously toys 
but nelder said theyd have to be about four feet long and made 
of pink plastic because thats about all nowadays that makes 
something a toy gun 
many toymakers already are changing designs as the result of 
pressure from retailers like toys r us which has urged 
manufacturers to come up with ways to keep toy guns from being 
mistaken for authentic guns said douglas thomsom president of the 
new yorkbased trade group toys manufacturers of america

two british weeklies have accused prince andrews 
wife the former sarah ferguson of brash and vulgar behavior 
during the couples recent visit to california 
londons sunday times said that after seeing the duke and 
duchess of york americans will likely retreat to their more 
refined dinner parties there to cap each other with anecdotes 
about the awful vulgarities of the british 
the observer a liberal weekly in a profile of the 28yearold 
duchess said something appears to have gone awry with the royal 
fairy story 
the newspapers were particularly critical of the duchess quip 
ill see you later to a man who yelled out i love you 
breaking a fake bottle over her husbands head and what they saw as 
generally failed attempts at humor 
the sunday times in an article by sketch writer craig brown 
criticized british daily newspapers for using headlines such as 
hollywood bows to a touch of british class and royal 
oneliners woo us hosts 
of a blacktie dinner at which the duchess wore a redandblack 
gown brown wrote 
while the stars of hollywood dressed in discreet black and 
stayed in the shadows down the stairs walloped someone who looked 
as if shed just won third prize for her carmen miranda 
impersonation in an end of pier show at some forgotten resort 
the observer asked has the duchess of york gone too far

a continental airlines airliner that 
crashed and left 28 people dead waited 24 minutes in a snowstorm 
between deicing and takeoff while other aircraft were taking off 
only 15 minutes after deicing officials said today 
robert benzon heading a national transportation safety board 
investigation team said possible ice buildup on continental flight 
1713 would be among the items of interest to be considered as 
four days of hearings into the november crash began 
the dc9 powered by two pratt amp whitney jt8d7 engines had 
just lifted off when it rolled over and broke into three pieces as 
it slid down a snowcovered runway twentyeight people were killed 
and 54 others were injured 
other possible crash causes being considered included the 
inexperience of the pilots and a wingtip vortex from a plane 
landing on an adjacent runway benzon said in an opening statement 
flight attendant kelly englehart testified today that she had 
been so worried about the weather and the copilots inexperience 
that she asked the pilot who would be landing the plane in the 
snowstorm when the flight returned to denver 
it as snowing outside and the weather was pretty bad it was 
the second officers second trip and i just wanted to know said 
englehart adding that capt frank zvonek told her he would land 
the plane 
benzon noted that said that zvonek 43 who had 198 hours on a 
dc9 with only the previous 33 hours as captain and first officver 
lee bruecher 26 never had flown together before both were killed 
benzon said the ntsb investigation showed the temperature was 28 
degrees fahrenheit and the wind was blowing at 10 knots gusting to 
17 knots when the plane was being prepared for takeoff 
the tower personnel the control tower could not see the 
deicing pad or the end of the runway because of low visibility 
he said 
he said 24 minutes elapsed between the time the plane was 
deiced and the time the plane took off 
other aircraft on the ramp during this time frame were 
spending approximately 15 minutes between deicing and takeoff 
he said 
the reasons for flight 1713s 24minute delay and the possible 
effects of snow or ice buildup on the wings and tail surfaces of 
the airplane during this delay are items of interest during this 
hearing benzon said 
englehart the first of 29 scheduled witnesses then testified 
that she closed her eyes and prepared to die as the plane slid down 
a snowcovered runway at denvers airport last nov 15 
she the dc9 had just lifted off the runway at stapleton 
international airport when it rocked first to the left and then 
sharply to the right finally turning over and coming to a stop 
a sixweekold baby in my section started screaming and 
everybody was so glad to hear that baby cry they knew the baby was 
all right she said 
about 30 minutes of recorded cockpit conversation showed that 
the crew used the appropriate checklist before taking off said 
benzon 
the wreckage also showed the landing gear was down and locked 
and the flaps were at an appropriate takeoff setting upon impact 
he said 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said monday that engine failure 
will not be discussed because there has been no evidence that the 
engines failed 
the chairman of the board of inquiry is ntsb board member joseph 
t nall assisted by three other ntsb staff members a final 
report is still many months down the road said lopatkiewicz 
the federal aviation administration meanwhile announced plans 
monday for whiteglove inspections of continental airlines 
possibly as early as this summer 
the continental inspection is part of a continuing effort by the 
faa to take a regularly scheduled fullscale look at the 
operations of big domestic airlines said faa spokesman fred farrar

the world health organizations chief aids 
investigator said tuesday that sex experts william masters and 
virginia johnson were irresponsible for suggesting aids can be 
transmitted by casual social contact 
dr jonathan mann the american director of whos global program 
on aids challenged the noted sex researchers to produce scientific 
evidence or admit they were indulging in idle speculation 
if its just theorizing then i think they have done us all a 
grave disservice mann told reporters at the first international 
conference on the global impact of aids 
about 1100 specialists from 20 countries attended the start of 
the threeday meeting at londons barbican center 
in a new book masters and johnson claim us health officials 
have understated the extent of aids among heterosexuals to avoid 
public panic they also say that aids might be transmitted by 
casual contact such as from a toilet seat or a waiters bleeding 
finger 
they wrote in their book the aids virus is now running 
rampant in the heterosexual community when that assertion came 
under fire at a news conference in new york on monday masters 
said i simply believe this johnson asked the same question 
said im not sure we chose the word rampant ourselves 
mann suggested the authors assertion that aids might be more 
prevalent among heterosexuals than health officials believe was a 
matter for debate and might be useful if it strengthened awareness 
that the disease can be transmitted both heterosexually and 
homosexually 
but if theyre talking about putting their prestige behind the 
idea that you can catch this from a toilet seat i think thats 
irresponsible unless there are data 
mann said he strongly objected to the authors implication 
without data without information that the virus spreads in 
other ways than we know it spreads 
mann and most other experts believe aids spreads mainly by 
sexual contact through the sharing of needles and from pregnant 
mothers to their babies 
the who official suggested that masters and johnson were trying 
to promote their book with headlinegrabbing findings saying 
publicity about this will undoubtedly sell more books 
he also expressed doubt about the authors scientific 
qualifications regarding aids 
they know a lot about sex i dont know how much they know 
about aids said mann who added that he had not read the book 
and was responding to news reports about its content 
asked again about the masters and johnson study at a later news 
conference mann said it would be very unfortunate if their 
credibility in sex was used by people to give credence to their 
theorizing rather than to the facts that have been collected about 
aids in the last seven years from all over the world 
during the aids conference dr gary noble deputy director of 
the centers for disease control in atlanta and head of the federal 
agencys aids program also refuted the masters and johnson study 
without mentioning it by name 
he said separate us studies confirmed that aids is not spread 
through casual social contact one study showed that infected 
people did not pass aids to members of their family except through 
sexual contact another study showed that insects cannot transmit 
the virus 
noble said that the incidence of aids among heterosexuals in the 
united states had increased from 11 percent of all cases in 1982 
to 23 percent in 1986 he said health officials expected that 
proportion to increase to 4 to 5 percent by 1991 
in his conference speech mann said aids sufferers face the 
danger of discrimination and proposed an international system for 
monitoring human rights violations in combating the disease 
he did not explain how the system would work but said we need 
to know when and how discrimination occurs 
we know that in aids isolation and exclusion create danger 
and that inclusion creates safety he said 
mann said the world health organization had recorded 81433 aids 
cases from a total of 133 countries as of march 1 
as of feb 29 the centers for disease control in atlanta had 
received reports of 54723 americans with aids 30715 of whom had 
died 
the genevabased un agency is cosponsoring the conference 
with the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the bodys natural 
immune system making its victims vulnerable to a variety of 
infections and cancers it is invariably fatal and there is no 
known vaccine or cure

the new network is envisioned as an alternative to cbs nbc and 
abc that will eventually offer firstrun programming major

value as far as the entire art world is concerned

the reagan administration said today it 
intends to keep holding the threat of sanctions over panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega but said no decisions have been made on 
possible actions 
the threats still out there were still considering it the 
situation is changing rapidly and were still monitoring it but we 
dont want to act precipitously white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters 
he made the comments to clarify statements hed made earlier 
indicating the administration might be withholding a decision on 
possible economic and trade sanctions 
earlier in the day the house foreign affairs committee voted 
unanimously to endorse reagans course of action against the 
military regime and to urge him to consider further economic 
sanctions 
the administration has called for noriegas removal since he was 
indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in florida last month 
the sanctions are being considered as a means of bringing 
pressure against noriegas military regime and to promote a return 
to civilian rule under president eric arturo delvalle 
let me back you away from the inevitability of these kinds of 
decisions the spokesman had said initially adding its been 
our feeling from the very beginning that change should come from 
within in panama and we should watch it carefully and if that is 
the process that is preferable to our taking actions 
but fitzwater later returned to the briefing room to say we 
want to keep the threat of sanctions still out there 
he said the options were still before the administration but 
that no decisions had yet been made he said such decisions 
depended upon a very complicated set of criteria 
he cited the impact the sanctions might have on the status of 
the noriega government us interests in terms of the canal the 
panamanian military and us investment in that country 
fitzwater also offered support for statements issued by delvalle 
and opposition parties that have called for the establishment of a 
government of national reconciliation 
we welcome those statements the spokesman said he also 
issued a statement saying the us government supports the goal of 
restoring democratic government and civilian constitutional 
order once this goal has been achieved we will work cooperatively 
with the government of panama toward the recovery of panamas 
financial and economic health 
the house foreign affairs committee resolution which will be 
voted on by the house later this week also reaffirmed 
congressional support for the full implementation of the panama 
canal treaties which require the united states to hand the canal 
over to panama at the end of the century 
rep stephen j solarz dny noted that panamas military 
ruler gen manuel antonio noriega has said that the criticism 
from the united states aimed at his alleged involvement in drug 
trafficking and other acts of corruption is actually a smoke screen 
noriega is contending the real reason is to create the 
groundwork for an ultimate american decision to renege on the 
commitment to turn over the panama canal in the year 2000 solarz 
said 
this resolution shows that we fully intend to live up to our 
commitments under the panama canal treaties solarz said 
the senate foreign relations committee already has adopted a 
resolution calling for a total trade embargo against panama but 
several members of the house panel said they thought that approach 
was premature 
several members said their resolution is more in tune with 
reagan administration measured strategy and is essentially an 
endorsement of a targeted approach designed to put pressure on 
noriega while not harming the panamanian people as a whole

cheating on federal income taxes has declined 
by as much as 20 percent mainly because of tax law changes and 
tougher federal policing internal revenue service commissioner 
lawrence b gibbs said tuesday 
gibbs told a house appropriations subcommittee an irs study 
indicates the muchpublicized tax gap the difference between 
taxes owed and taxes paid has dropped to between 80 billion and 
90 billion in 1987 the agencys last report on the annual gap 
estimated it would rise to more than 100 billion in 1987 
gibbs attributed the decline to campaigns by congress and the 
irs to force stricter compliance through tougher penalties and the 
computermatching of tax returns with income reports and to the 
numerous changes brought about by the 1986 tax law revision 
the commissioner announced also that the irs has temporarily 
suspended efforts to collect back taxes from students who were paid 
stipends for teaching or research work at their universities 
weve put the word out to irs offices to hold up on any of 
the students cases that are pending until the agency adopts a 
consistent policy on how such income should be treated gibbs said 
he said cases affecting students who receive stipends developed 
from a computer matching of employer reports with students tax 
returns not from any irs initiative to go after the graduate 
students 
in dispute are stipends paid in 1984 1985 and 1986 the 1986 
tax revision declared all such stipends to be taxable income 
irs officials said they had no estimate how many students are 
involved in the controversy although the washington post on 
tuesday quoted unofficial estimates of up to 17000 cases 
apparently there are some inconsistencies in the way the 
examination of students returns are being conducted irs 
spokesman steve pyrek said there is a wide variety of stipends 
paid by colleges and universities he noted and some irs field 
offices are following court decisions on the issue while others 
abide by a 1975 ruling by the agency itself 
in looking at the cases case law is a lot harsher toward 
students than our rules gibbs told the subcommittee 
the students troubles began when their colleges sent the irs 
copies of w2 wage statements indicating they were paid taxable 
wages when the students filed their tax returns the computer 
indicated those wages were not reported as income 
gibbs said the irs hopes to announce within a month new 
guidelines on treatment of such stipends from the three earlier tax 
years 
also within a short time the commissioner said he hopes to be 
able to report on the new estimate of the tax gap he declined to 
provide any details of the new findings but told the subcommittee 
the amount of the tax gap has diminished since the last time we 
did a study 
the last irs study of the tax gap was published in 1983 and was 
based on 1981 information it estimated that individuals and 
corporations dodged 815 billion in taxes on legal income that 
year by understating income and overstating deductions 
the agency estimated that another 9 billion in taxes was lost 
on three types of illegal income drugs prostitution and gambling 
the new report will not even attempt to estimate the tax loss from 
illegal income that is never reporte 
since the last taxgap study was published irs researchers have 
reported evidence that taxpayers may be cheating less in may 1986 
the agency released a report indicating that a 20year trend of 
declining compliance with the tax laws might have been reversed 
that study estimated that voluntary compliance rose to 918 
percent in 1982 from 910 percent in 1979 compliance had declined 
steadily from 943 percent in 1965

the vatican newspaper on tuesday criticized attempts 
by the families and friends of the accused to discredit a 
30yearold woman raped by three men 
the woman walking to her car early sunday was beaten and raped 
repeatedly by three men near the piazza navona in central rome a 
police patrol came on the scene of the attack and arrested the men 
digging into the private life of the victim the three good 
boys as they were defined by family and friends are trying to 
appear to be the victims wrapping the only true victim of the 
incident in a halo of allusions of accusations that are not even 
well veiled the vatican newspaper osservatore romano said in an 
editorial 
it criticized the parents of the defendants saying they 
expressed wonder that a woman should walk around alone at that 
hour rather than being upset and expressing pain for the crime 
committed by their sons 
even if the assaulted woman was the last of the outcast if 
she was addicted to drugs or alcohol as some have suggested the 
responsibility of the aggressors not only would not diminish it 
would increase 
the editorial came tuesday as italy celebrated womens day with 
feminist speeches and calls for stronger measures to combat rape 
christian democratic senator rosa russo jervolino minister for 
special affairs and the only woman in the cabinet also criticized 
the defendants and their families 
the behavior of the three men and their families shows a 
distorted mentality which has completely lost sight of the value of 
personal freedom she said we have a great job to do of 
cultural restructuring

the comptroller of the currency has dismissed 
proposed civil penalties against a former michigan bank chairman 
accused of misusing bank funds 
the ruling monday by comptroller robert l clarke overturned an 
administrative law judges recommendation that stanford stoddard 
former chairman of michigan national corp be fined 146000 for 
allegedly misusing 167385 in bank resources for private purposes 
including wedding receptions maintenance of home and vacation 
properties and renovation of mormon churches 
although mr stoddard flagrantly misused bank funds the 
banks expenditures do not constitute extensions of credit 
clarke said in his ruling accordingly the civil money penalty 
shall not be assessed 
stoddard 57 was removed as chairman of the bank holding 
company in 1984 after the comptroller began investigating his 
activities 
the son of the banks founder stoddard had run the company 
since 1972 
stoddards attorney richard roberts said our position 
has always been that he did not misuse funds that the funds were 
expended properly for him either as charitable contributions 
in the instance of the church properties reimbursement or proper 
expenditure on his behalf for entertainment and other permissible 
expenditures by a corporation on behalf of its chief executive 
officer 
the comptrollers ruling said stoddard used bank funds for four 
purposes renovation of buildings that were or were to become 
mormon churches improvements to his residence vacation home and 
florida condominium payment of bills for a wedding reception for 
his children and friends and extensive personal secretarial and 
errand services 
the money was spent on salaries for bank employees assigned to 
work on the projects payment of bills for supplies use of bank 
supplies and direct payments to contractors the comptrollers 
ruling said 
roberts said stoddard had paid the bank about 280000 as 
reimbursement 
in a separate statement clarke said his decision was not 
intended to condone mr stoddards blatant misapplication of bank 
funds 
congress may wish to consider amending the appropriate 
statutes to make it possible to asssess civil money penalties in 
similar circumstances in the future clarke said

higher stamp prices wont take effect until 
next month postal officials said tuesday after postponing a final 
decision on the effective date of the new rates 
the board of governors of the us postal service will hold a 
special meeting march 22 to discuss putting the new rates into 
effect 
although no definite decision on an effective date for rates 
has been scheduled the board has set april 3 as the target date to 
give mailers advance notice to plan for the new rates the agency 
said in a statement issued following its meeting tuesday 
under the law the agency has to give 10 days notice once it 
votes to impose new rates so a vote on march 22 could get the new 
prices in force by april 3 which is also easter this year 
the new prices recommended by the independent postal rate 
commission last friday following 10 months of deliberation call 
for a sweeping series of increases averaging more than 17 percent 
included would be a 25cent firstclass rate 
at tuesdays meeting new postmaster general anthony frank said 
he would like to restore some of the recently cut postal services 
when higher stamp prices take effect but he was concerned about 
the costs involved 
post office window openings and sorting hours were cut in 
january in an effort to comply with congressional spending limits 
the higher postage rates are not connected to those cuts having 
been proposed nearly a year ago to help compensate for the agencys 
overall budgetary problems 
but frank admitted explaining to the public the reasons for 
reduced services at the same time rates are rising is a very 
difficult message to get out 
frank said expanded window hours at some offices are being 
considered at least to help out during the changeover from one set 
of rates to another 
in addition he said many offices will stay open until midnight 
april 15 to accept lastminute tax forms 
the postal service meanwhile announced that it is offering 
telephone sales of stamps nationwide during the transition to the 
new rates 
callers will be able to use visa and mastercard credit cards to 
order the new undenominated e stamps with the stamps to be 
mailed out once the final decision is made on the new rate 
customers who want to order the nondenominated stamps can do 
so 24 hours a day by calling 1800stamp24 the minimum order 
will be 1250 plus a 2 service charge 
sales of stamps by telephone have been tested in eight cities 
since last fall with total sales now of more than 2 million 
in addition to the new e stamps which can be used only for 
letters within the united states some post offices still have 
supplies of 25cent stamps featuring a portrait of writer jack 
london 
in addition consumers with supplies of 22cent stamps will be 
able to purchase stamps to make up the difference between those and 
the new rates 
a new 3cent stamp showing a conestoga wagon was released feb 
29 and some supplies of the 3cent stamp showing dr paul dudley 
white may also be available post offices also should have 2cent 
stamps featuring mary lyon and 1cent stamps with the likeness of 
margaret mitchell

the soviet union accused of footdragging by 
reagan administration officials has presented drafts of two key 
provisions of a treaty to sharply reduce us and soviet strategic 
nuclear weapons 
one of the documents submitted to american negotiators in geneva 
deals with ways to guard against cheating and the other with 
procedures for eliminating the weapons 
a us official speaking tuesday only on condition of 
anonymity said there were big areas of disagreement with the 
american positions in some respects and accord in others 
he said the soviet drafts which were submitted monday were 
being translated from russian and a full appraisal by the us 
side was not complete 
the aim is to have the treaty ready for president reagan and 
soviet general secretary mikhail s gorbachev to sign at their next 
superpower summit meeting it will be held in moscow in late may or 
early june 
the treaty would reduce the total arsenals of us and soviet 
longrange bombers missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent 
to 50 percent 
charles e redman the state department spokesman said its 
encouraging we have the drafts on the table but redman said 
the real proof of the pudding will be whether the soviet 
proposals can be meshed with us drafts 
still to come from moscow is a memorandum of understanding 
outlining the numbers and locations of soviet strategic weapons 
the us memorandum was offered last week 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze decided feb 22 in moscow to give the 
negotiators a month to agree on the three treaty protocols the 
idea is to have them ready for review by shultz and shevardnadze 
when they meet in washington on march 2224 
last friday a us official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said american negotiator s read hanmer had complained 
very forcefully that moscow had failed to submit its 
verification and other proposals 
at the same time phyllis oakley the state departments deputy 
spokeswoman publicly criticized the soviets for not presenting 
their drafts she said the complex issues required time for 
thorough study 
the negotiators face a number of obstacles in trying to get the 
treaty ready ways to verify compliance with a cutback agreement is 
only one problem 
another is the us strategic defense initiative which the 
soviets want to restrict president reagan has vowed not to give 
ground however in the us search for a spacebased shield 
against soviet ballistic missiles 
another roadblock is the extreme difficulty in monitoring mobile 
missiles and some of the other weapons that may be covered by the 
treaty

five italian sisters showed their latest 
furry creations at fallwinter shows tuesday alongside the real 
skins and they dared the audience to guess which was which 
women who still yearn to wear the big cats can now choose the 
fendi sisters version consisting of ocelot markings printed on 
synthetic fur fabric coats with the added bonus of cuffs in real 
sable 
karl lagerfeld who designs the fendi collection is never short 
on witty ideas and when he wasnt making fabric look like fur he 
was reversing the process to make furs imitate fabrics his long 
winter coats in shaved weasel worked to look like corduroy velvet 
were a case in point 
there were plenty of other surprises such as the big muffs in 
chinchilla or sable which at a flick of the models wrists became 
complete fur coats 
but although lagerfeld had his fun with the fakes he also 
indulged in the real thing showing styles in sumptuous mink 
sable ermine and mongolian lamb so lavish that that they could 
retail for as much as 100000 
favored shapes included highwaisted ovalskirted coats that 
harked back to the fashions in vogue in the early 1920s shoulders 
were soft and natural with padding sent into retirement 
there were spectacular capes such as the circular version in 
blackdyed mole threaded intricately into lace and shapely coats 
in black ermine worked to look like shiny and mattestriped silk 
velvet 
a princessline coat fitted and flared came in woven gray wool 
and had an extra layer of warmth in its luxury lining of sumptuous 
chinchilla

damages the jury had awarded 500000 in compensatory damages and 
10 million in punitive damages

a justice department official said tuesday he 
favors raising congressional pay to as much as 175000 in exchange 
for ending a double standard exempting senators and 
representatives from federal ethics laws 
assistant attorney general william weld said it is neither 
logical nor consonant with the notion of fair play to make it 
a crime for executive branch officials to accept fees or honoraria 
for jobrelated activities while allowing members of congress to 
do so 
in a national press club speech attacking public corruption 
weld said he favors raising the salary of all members of congress 
to a level around somewhere between 150000 and 175000 a year 
this would enable you to do some other things like prohibit 
honoraria 
it would very very expensive and worth every penny 
said weld head of the departments criminal division 
currently congressional salaries are 89500 a year which 
senators may supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed 
40 percent of their salaries the percentage for house members is 
30 percent 
at worst the payment and acceptance of fees and honoraria 
can degenerate into a case of veiled extortion or a case of 
veiled gratuity weld said 
weld also said congress should apply to itself the federal 
conflictofinterest laws under which former white house political 
director lyn nofziger was convicted of illegal lobbying congress 
has exempted itself from those laws 
weld noted that while a member of congress is free to lobby his 
former colleagues the day after he leaves office as recent 
events have made abundantly clear such behavior by a former member 
of the executive branch would land one in jail 
nofziger was found guilty of lobbying former white house 
associates within one year after he left the government on matters 
in which the agency had been substantially involved a federal 
contract for wedtech corp the continued production of a10 
antitank aircraft and civilian manning of navy ships nofziger 
faces sentencing later this month 
weld rejected the suggestion that he was raising the 
congressional ethics issue in an election year to overshadow the 
fact that a number of reagan administration officials are under 
criminal investigation or have been convicted of crimes 
welds boss attorney general edwin meese iii is under criminal 
investigation by an independent counsel 
my remarks today are the same as remarks ive been giving 
since 1978 so its no recently cookedup farrago weld 
said im speaking about legislation when i talk about double 
standard not anybodys performance im not saying one branch has 
a monopoly on sleaze 
weld also expressed support for the 1978 ethics in government 
act under which independent counsels and the office of government 
ethics police federal ethics laws in the executive branch the 
investigation of meese was launched last may 11 under that law 
i like the ethics in government act i think its a good 
statute and i think it deserves to be enforced weld said 
a former us attorney in boston weld said that when he came to 
washington in 1986 he mistakenly thought a dozen congressmen might 
have broken the law when they accepted 2000 fees in a visit to a 
commercial enterprise over which their committee had jurisdiction 
a deputy informed him that only members of the wicked and 
nefarious executive branch and independent agencies are prohibited 
from supplementing their salaries he recalled that very same 
action would be a lay down criminal case if performed by 
somebody in the executive branch 
the congressmen justified taking the fees by saying they 
expected to be compensated for their time 
compensation is the word used in the criminal statute which 
shows you how deep that double standard runs said weld 
rep barney frank dmass agreed with welds suggestions 
saying his house subcommittee will address the congressional 
exemptions with proposed legislation 
frank is chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on 
administrative law and governmental relations 
honoraria and fees give both the appearance and in some cases 
the reality of improper influence frank said regarding 
conflicts of interest frank said that when a onetime 
colleague leaves congress and next month is asking for a favor 
personal feeling gets into it thats not legitimate

a us official said tuesday he would view as 
unfriendly any votes against a proposed united nations inquiry 
into alleged human rights violations in cuba 
vernon walters the top us representative to the united 
nations made the statement at a luncheon for international 
officials and business leaders as he stepped up pressure on allies 
to back the ussponsored proposal 
walters also told the 43member un human rights commission on 
tuesday that it should examine the alleged human rights violations 
in cuba or risk becoming accomplices of oppression 
he said a more harshly worded version of the proposal failed to 
pass last year by one vote for political reasons the united states 
has complained of political bias at the commission which often has 
condemned human rights violations in israelioccupied territories 
south africa and chile 
walters said torture and secret executions continue in cuba and 
that freedom exists only to the extent that cuban leader fidel 
castro decides it can 
the resolution which will come before the commission this week 
urges the cuban government to permit the international red cross to 
investigate prison conditions it also asks the un

prime minister margaret thatcher said tuesday that 
britains current military exercise to reinforce the falkland 
islands against possible attack by argentina was no one elses 
business 
flatly rejecting protests by argentina and other latin american 
countries mrs thatcher told the house of commons that britain had 
a right and also a duty to see that reinforcement proposals could 
in fact be carried out 
it is no one elses business except the defense of peoples 
rights in the falkland islands said mrs thatcher 
about 900 troops will travel 8000 miles next week to the 
falkland islands from brize norton air base north of london as 
part of the exercise called fire focus 
the exercise began this week with mythical intelligence 
reports warning that argentina was preparing again to invade the 
south atlantic archipelago which it has long claimed the 1800 
britishdescended islanders fiercely reject argentine rule 
fire focus is the first major maneuver announced by britain 
since it recaptured the islands from invading argentine troops in a 
74day war in 1982 
britain has said it gave notice last month to argentina of the 
intended exercise and has since announced that fire focus will 
involve fewer than 1000 men 
britain maintains a garrison reportedly of about 2000 men on 
the islands and says it must practice sending in reinforcements in 
order to avoid keeping more troops there permanently 
briefing reporters at brize norton on tuesday foreign office 
assistant under secretary robin fearn said fire focus threatens 
no one it is entirely defensive 
far from being a cause for concern it is an integral part of 
our policy of reducing tension he added 
he said the initial postwar garrison had been halved in recent 
years after the completion of a new runway at the falklands 
capital port stanley which can take widebodied jets

a 350000 shortfall is casting a shadow on the 
largestever sovietus cultural exchange a threeweek festival 
viewed by the state department as an important symbol of improved 
relations with moscow fundraisers said tuesday 
with three days to go before its scheduled opening making 
music together is heavily in the red because of unexpected costs 
said harold hestes president of the greater boston chamber of 
commerce 
hestes declined to detail what drove costs above the estimated 
budget of 24 million but said revised figures put the price tag 
for the 80event festival at about 33 million 
festival operating co which is managing the american part of 
the exchange last month seriously considered the idea of declaring 
bankruptcy and canceling the event said lawyer gabor garai 
instead company directors agreed to try and raise additional 
funds in light of the national and international importance of 
the event said garai whose firm hale and dorr is providing 
free legal counsel to organizers 
billed by us organizers as the largest cultural exchange ever 
with the soviet union the festival which runs though april 2 
will feature 285 soviet musicians dancers composers and other 
artists performing in the boston area 
it will continue in moscow in the fall of 1989 where the 
festival will concentrate on contemporary american music 
organizers originally had hoped to cover most costs through 
ticket sales a state contribution of 450000 and private sector 
pledges of 350000 
the state has promised to provide more grants and loans 
amounting to 400000 and businessess and charitable organizations 
have pledged an additional 150000 hestes said 
of the outstanding 350000 hestes said were doing our best 
to raise it but the cash flow situation is extremely tight 
it would be my hope that that the festival goes on no matter 
what as it would be tragedy for the state and the nations if it 
would fail he said 
hestes said he contacted the state department about possible 
cancellation recently and the clear inference was that it 
would be bad for our relations with the soviet union 
secretary of state george p shultz expressed his personal 
support and that of president ronald reagan last year in a letter 
to sarah caldwell a key organizer of the exchange and artistic 
director of the opera company of boston 
i want you to know that both the president and i personally 
support these exchanges he wrote to ms caldwell these 
exchanges will continue to be an important element in the 
ussoviet relationship 
ms caldwell provided a copy of the sept 8 letter to the 
associated press 
in washington greg guroff of the governmentrun us 
information agency said he believes the soviet union has made a 
tremendous commitment to this festival 
guroff head of the agencys office of ussoviet exchanges and 
a former cultural attache to the us embassy in moscow said the 
soviets would interpret cancellation as a rebuff 
because of guaranteed state funding of such events in the soviet 
union the american concept of fundraising for most soviets 
is not only incomprehensible but its not their problem 
said guroff we have had two or three performing arts exchanges 
that have fallen through from lack of funding the fallout was 
quite considerable in the soviets minds

jed christensen director of the office of 
surface mining for the past three years is leaving his job march 
20 the interior department announced tuesday 
christensen who served as the governments chief regulator of 
strip mining longer than anyone else will become assistant chief 
administrative officer of fresno county calif 
his boss will be dan fitzpatrick with whom he worked previously 
when chistensen was a budget officer for clark county nev he 
called me just after taking office and asked if i would be 
interested i will be getting back to my roots 
he said he was not in the least pushed out 
christensen also has worked in local government in provo utah 
phoenix ariz and santa anna calif 
he came to the interior department in 1981 and was appointed 
acting director of the office of surface mining in april 1985 
winning nomination as director in december 1985 and confirmation in 
may 1986 
robert h gentile an aide to steven griles assistant secretary 
for land and minerals management has been appointed deputy to 
chistensen for operations the department said 
christensen said it was up to the secretary to decide on a 
successor but other officials speaking on condition they not be 
identified said they expected gentile to be named acting director 
perhaps for the remainder of the reagan administration 
the office formed by congress in 1977 after a decade of bitter 
debate was subjected to a wrenching reorganization by 
thensecretary james watt in 1981 when christensen took over some 
violation records were still stored in shoeboxes 
christensen said most of the 150 million in penalties 
represented by those boxes would be written off by the end of this 
fiscal year with about 15 percent of the amount finally collected 
and the records now kept on a computer 
his tenure also has seen installation of another computer system 
to match applicants for mining permits in the states against the 
list of outstanding violations and the abolition by congress of 
the exemption from most regulation for mines under two acres that 
exemption had enabled some big companies in virginia and kentucky 
to break their operations into a string of pearls mines of 
less than two acres operated by subcontractors 
im amazed at the things weve accomplished he said 
listing among other things better relations with the states and 
forthcoming proposals for criminal penalties for mining without a 
permit and for incentives for miners to take coal from and reclaim 
abandoned mines 
thomas galloway a washington lawyer who has represented 
environmental groups in several lawsuits against the agency said 
christensens departure was not a major move since he was 
not involved in major issues over the past year we have been 
dealing with the assistant secretarys office 
galloway said he believed the office was probably in the worst 
shape its been since 1977 in terms of competence and 
effectiveness which he said was not entirely the reagan 
administrations fault 
i believe abuse is continuing unchecked in parts of 
kentucky west virginia virginia and tennessee largely at the 
hands of miners operating on a shoestring galloway said 
rep mike synar dokla who as chairman of the environment 
subcommittee of the house government operations committee has 
produced several reports critical of the office said a change in 
directors will be meaningless just like all the others have 
been

offduty police gathered signatures at polling 
places tuesday in a drive to abolish a citizens review board but 
said they abandoned their efforts at one site after being 
confronted by a city council member 
in at least one of the polling places we had to leave because 
mayor pro tem diane ragsdale and some of her cohorts started to 
create problems so we just decided to leave because it was not 
worth it said dallas police association president monica smith 
ms ragsdale started an argument trying to convince people 
not to sign the petitions and rather than getting it to escalate 
we pulled out said ms smith 
ms ragsdale a vocal critic of the police said there was no 
confrontation 
this gentleman wanted to know from me what to do he wanted to 
know about the issue because you know many of them actually 
some of our citizens seniors really dont know she said 
they do not realize what they are doing she said they 
attempted to circumvent their policy makers 
but one dpa spokesman larry mcgowan said ms ragsdale grabbed 
one man trying to sign a petition 
ms smith said signatures were being collected citywide by about 
1400 offduty officers 200 to 300 firefighters and their 
families the campaign to abolish the dallas citizens police review 
board has drawn opposition from a coalition of black business 
community church and elected leaders 
the dpa wants the city to hire more officers and abolish the 
board which hears complaints against police the board was formed 
in january and has met twice 
twenty thousand signatures are needed to force a city charter 
amendment election 
the texas secretary of state had poll monitors at voting places 
also observing the police effort 
three dallas officers have been shot and killed this year 
including john chase who was shot by a deranged transient as a 
busstop crowd watched the homeless man ignore the officers pleas 
to spare his life 
four men have also been killed by officers this year including 
the transient who killed chase 
opponents of the citizens review board which has limited 
subpoena powers say it duplicates existing panels or agencies 
including the police internal affairs department and the dallas 
county grand jury and calls into question the departments ability 
to police itself

its oneway free trade rep peter defazio dore said

again 
both defazio and rep ron wyden dore said the treaty will 
allow canadian plywood manufacturers unrestricted access to 
american markets but only 10 percent of the canadian market at 
best will be opened to us producers 
i think a provision like this provides red meat to the 
protectionists said wyden adding that congress should draft 
strong language covering plywood trade when it consider 
implementing language for the treaty later this year 
oregon is the top plywood producing state in the nation and 
washington state ranks no 4 other states in the top five include

an arms dealer charged with plotting to sell 
weapons to argentina iraq poland and the soviet union was asked 
by us intelligence officials to use his contacts in poland to 
arrange the purchase of two soviet super tanks his attorney 
said tuesday 
solomon schwartz 52 of monsey was sought out by the cia in 
1982 and later had contact with the defense intelligence agency 
concerning the possible purchase of the soviet t72 tanks which 
the us government wanted to study for intelligence purposes said 
attorney lawrence dubin 
schwartz negotiated with three polish generals for the tanks but 
the sale never materialized dubin said in his opening statement at 
the trial of schwartz and three codefendants who are also arms 
dealers 
the defendants are accused of plotting four illegal weapons 
deals including smuggling military equipment to the argentinian 
government during the falkland islands war and an unsuccessful 
attempt to ship guns to iraq 
they were willing to sell to anyone no matter whose hands the 
weapons fell into if the price was right said assistant us 
attorney larry krantz 
the argentinian deal the only one that went through included 
the shipment of 1300 night vision goggles and resulted in a profit 
of 1 million for the defendants krantz said 
the prosecutor charged that schwartz would use the soviet tank 
deal to cover up one of the illegal arms deals a shipment of 
500 automatic rifles and ammunition destined for poland but seized 
by us customs agents at john f kennedy airport in february 1984 
dubin said the weapons were to be shipped to poland but then 
would be immediately reshipped to mexico using a legal export 
license by an independent trading company 
he said the arms shipment to poland was needed to establish a 
course of routine business in poland to facilitate any possible 
future dealings involving the soviet tanks 
schwartz the owner of texas armament advisors inc will 
testify during the trial about the tank deal dubin said 
the other illegal arms shipments alleged in the indictment 
involved 110 boxes of handguns shotguns and ammunition destined 
for iraq but seized by belgian authorities and 400 night vision 
devices to the soviet union in a sting operation orchestrated by 
us customs all took place between 1982 and 1984 
although these weapons are routinely bought and sold in the 
us the export of these weapons are highly regulated by the 
government krantz said the defendants were caught redhanded 
participating in a series of illegal arms transactions 
the other defendants are h leonard berg 52 of the bronx 
owner of hlb security electronics ltd of manhattan grim 
depanicis 44 of mount dora fla a vice president of hlb leon 
lisbona 63 of queens an hlb employee 
berg lisbona and schwartz are charged with racketeering 
racketeering conspiracy wire fraud and violating arms export laws 
and are accused of participating in all four illegal deals 
depanicis is not charged with any of the racketeering counts and 
is named only in the argentinian and soviet union deals 
krantz said the trial was expected to last several weeks and 
would include secretly recorded conversations

thousands of japaneseamericans detained in 
prison camps during world war ii suffered a catastrophic 
deprivation of civil rights an attorney told a federal appeals 
court tuesday 
but the arguments by the attorney representing 120000 
japaneseamericans in a 24 billion classaction suit and by the 
justice department lawyer fighting the suit were far removed from 
the gruesome details of what appeals court judge helen nies 
described as a disgrace we all know and lived through 
instead the hearing before the us circuit court of appeals 
for the federal circuit focused mainly on whether the statute of 
limitations had expired in the case 
this is the second time a federal appeals court has heard the 
case in 1986 the us circuit court of appeals for the district 
of columbia ruled that the government must defend itself at trial 
against the suit which seeks compensation for property losses 
suffered by those interned 
in doing so it overturned a 1984 decision by district court 
judge louis oberdorfer who had ruled that a sixyear statute of 
limitations on suits against the government had expired 
but the supreme court ruled last june that the issue of whether 
the lawsuit was filed within the legal deadline should have been 
decided by a different court the us circuit court of appeals 
for the federal circuit 
the only time the supreme court has ruled on the internment 
itself authorized by president franklin d roosevelt in the wake 
of the 1941 japanese attack on pearl harbor was in 1944 when it 
found it was a constitutionally acceptable military necessity 
government documents discovered later indicate no such military 
necessity existed 
this case involves the catastrophic deprivation of civil 
rights said benjamin zelenko attorney for william hohri of 
chicago the lead plaintiff in the classaction suit 
hohri a san francisco native who lived in southern california 
when the war began said tuesday he was interned at manzanar camp 
east of the sierra nevada shortly after his 15th birthday he left 
for the midwest 2 years later and never returned to california 
zelenko argued that the statute of limitations did not come into 
play until the early 1980s because of deliberate concealment and 
misrepresentation by the government of critical information 
regarding its claim of military necessity 
the concealment didnt end until the 1980s zelenko said when a 
congressionally appointed commission found that there was no 
military necessity for the internment the policy was driven by 
race prejudice war hysteria and lack of political leadership he 
told the threejudge panel of giles rich phillip baldwin and nies 
jay bybee representing the government told the court there 
is no dispute that there were great wrongs done to 
japaneseamericans but even when mistakes are made people must 
file timely claims for redress 
the plaintiffs have known the basis of their claims since the 
1940s said bybee who contended that they didnt file their suit 
at that time because they believed the government would have been 
successful in claiming military necessity for its actions

the death of bill britt whose body was found in 
his woods shelter alone and partially devoured by animals 
symbolized the fate of societys homeless and eccentric people a 
housing court official said tuesday 
autopsy results tuesday showed that britt 52 died of 
hypothermia and was dead two weeks before he was discovered monday 
by two of his three children in his makeshift wigwam in brookline 
according to the suffolk county medical examiners report 
homeless people people like britt who say they want to be 
alone should be protected in this weather said stanton kessler 
a senior pathologist in the medical examiners office he had no 
food in him he had no sleeping bag this type of thing should be 
prevented 
kessler said britt was clothed and wrapped in blankets when he 
died identification was presumptive he said because rodents 
had eaten most of his face hands and fingers his feet were intact 
because they had been dug into the ground and covered with dirt 
for warmth kessler said 
britt died in the woods near the chestnut hill reservoir near 
the affluent community of the same name where he was born and grew 
up he had lived in the woods since 1969 and did not attract much 
attention until 1985 when officials began trying to move him into 
public or subsidized housing 
britts continual resistance to being moved brought him national 
attention and his nickname the hermit of chestnut hill at one 
point actor mickey rooney planned to buy the rights to his story 
last may he appeared on late night with david letterman 
chief housing court justice e george daher tried to arrange 
housing and medical aid for britt despite his repeated lack of 
cooperation 
he represents in a microcosm what happens to the homeless the 
unfortunates the eccentrics in this cold society daher said 
tuesday no one seemed to care about him he should have been 
monitored someone should have checked in on him rather than have 
him die a lonely tragic death like this 
there are more than 3400 homeless people in the boston area 
according to the city emergency shelter commission director anne 
maguire she said about 150 of them are outside much of the time 
but britt was unique she said adding most people want 
shelter 
others also agreed britt did not fit the typical definition of 
the homeless or mentally ill 
a onetime insurance agent who also worked in procter amp gambles 
marketing division in new york city 30 years ago britt had been 
married with a family many speculated that a reportedly messy 
divorce in 1969 fueled his change in lifestyle 
both public officials and friends said he was a paradox a loner 
who loved to chat with boston college students who went to class 
just yards from his shelter an eccentric who said he wanted to be 
left alone but who regularly pitched stories about himself to the 
media 
the britt children recently were in fairly regular contact with 
him ingrid boughner 28 his daughter who learned last year that 
her father was the wellknown hermit said she visited him several 
times over the last few weeks leaving him sandwiches and notes 
that were never touched britts body was found dead by her and her 
brother britton boughner 
mary callahan 27 met britt as a reporter on a local weekly 
newspaper she was one of the first to write about him 
it seems so sad to me said callahan now on the editorial 
staff of boston colleges inhouse newspaper he was a singular 
person a very interesting man he looked very old but he was so 
articulate he talked about writing poetry about writing books 
its strange that he decided to live there 
bill blacker a box clerk at the chestnut hill post office said 
britt came in almost daily to check the mail box he paid 11 for 
every six months 
he talked like such an educated man said blacker i sure 
wouldnt have wanted to live that way but at least he did what he 
chose to do i just think something drastic must have happened to 
him to make him want to live like that

supreme court justice antonin scalia told a 
house subcommittee tuesday that trimming the high courts 164 
budget request could cut not fat not muscle but bone 
scalia submitting a budget request for the fiscal year that 
begins next october warned that the court cannot withstand an 
appropriations reduction similar to one imposed for its current 
budget 
we come close to becoming the proverbial turnip from which 
no more blood can be squeezed scalia said 
the court last year requested 16 million for its current 
fiscal year 1988 budget but only 152 million was appropriated 
this has put a very serious strain on the operations of the 
court during the current fiscal year scalia said 
the fiscal year 1989 request includes 
100000 for increased library shelving capacity 
40000 to upgrade into legal research databases the word 
processors the justices and their law clerks use 
50000 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the federal law 
that created the federal court system 
the supreme courts budget is handled separately from the 
billiondollar budget of the federal court system but most of the 
subcommittees questions focused on problems facing the federal 
judiciary generally 
rep joseph d early dmass asked several questions about 
what he apparently views as dwindling judicial efficiency 
noting that there are a lot more laws out there scalia 
said you simply cannot lay too much additional responsibility 
upon this institution the federal courts without fundamentally 
changing it 
responding to a similar question by rep jim kolbe rariz 
scalia said the caseload problem facing federal courts originates 
right here in congress and i dont see an answer to it

the un food and agriculture organization 
criticized the united states tuesday for its questions about how 
the agency handles its money and hires employees 
fred j eckert us ambassador to the agency sent a letter to 
fao directorgeneral edouard saouma seeking details of agency 
spending hiring practices and saoumas compensation package 
these are serious and important questions eckert said 
tuesday 
agency spokesman richard lydiker said the directorgeneral 
regrets that requests for information have been presented as 
aspersions on the management and reputation of the fao as requests 
for information they are legitimate but as aspersions they are 
groundless 
throughout his entire term of office the directorgeneral has 
scrupulously observed the agencys rules and regulations and this 
will be demonstrated in his reply to the permanent representative 
of the united states lydiker said reading from a statement 
he also noted that the united states has not paid its 
contribution to the agency lydiker said earlier this year that the 
united states owes 68 million from its 198687 assessment which 
amounts to a quarter of the agencys budget 
saouma a lebanese was elected to a third sixyear term in 
november defeating an african challenger supported by the united 
states and other major donor nations 
the united states and other nations have called for reforms at 
the organization which coordinates agricultural projects in 
developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the 
united nations 
last november a 198889 fao budget of 492 million was approved 
over objections from the united states britain australia and 
canada 
in the course of our review we have become increasingly 
concerned about reports portraying fao in an extremely unfavorable 
light the questions that we shall be putting to you are for the 
purpose of getting at the truth of these matters eckert said in 
his letter dated march 3 
the letter also asked for an explanation about travel expenses 
for delegates to a recent agency conference the agencys purchase 
of cars and details of entertainment allowances 
it asked how many former ambassadors were on the agencys 
payroll and whether relatives of current or former ambassadors work 
for the agency

nations major production areas a government report said tuesday 
the joint agricultural weather facility said wheat during the 
week of feb 29 through march 6 was not quite in such good shape in 
the northern great plains delta and rocky mountain states however 
snow cover was virtually nonexistent in the central and 
northern great plain and rocky mountain states but mild 
temperatures kept damage at a minimum the report said snow 
preceding freezing temperatures prevented severe winter damage to 
small grain including wheat in eastern kansas northern oklahoma 
illinois missouri indiana and ohio 
crop development by early march ranged from greening in colorado 
to jointing of plants in mississippi and oklahoma and heading in 
arizona the report said

congress was urged by a trio of witnesses 
tuesday to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on haiti to 
spur a return to democratic rule 
but the latin american director of the center for strategic and 
international studies a washingtonbased conservative think tank 
called on the united states to restore aid to haiti 
the witness georges fauriol said the new government of haitian 
president leslie manigat deserves encouragement and resources 
rather than further sanctions and further hardship for the haitian 
people 
barring gross misjudgment and behavior on the part of the new 
government the united states at a minimum should reinstate the 
aid package cut off last november fauriol said 
but other witnesses disagreed 
rep george w crockett jr dmich chairman of the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs said 
washington needs to make clear that the united states government 
will use every diplomatic political and economic means at our 
disposal to help accomplish a free and fair election in haiti 
a haitian journalist raymond a joseph urged manigat to call 
new elections and order the investigation of politically inspired 
killings 
michael s hooper executive director of the national coalition 
for haitian refugees said the reagan administration would end the 
hope for free and fair elections in haiti if it moves to embrace 
the manigat government which was installed after haitis military 
forces broke up earlier presidential elections 
the united states should immediately institute and recommend a 
complete international arms embargo and an end to all assistance 
that frees up domestic resources allowing the government to sustain 
the growing army hooper said 
patrick bellegardesmith an author specializing in haiti and 
its problems called on the united states to continue the aid 
cutoff to oppose all loans to haiti by international lending 
institutions to withdraw haitis privileges under the caribbean 
basin initiative and to insist haiti restore democratic government 
and end the use of the country as a haven for narcotics trafficking

the congressional appropriations committees 
have denied a request by the energy department to shift 8 million 
to pay for evaluation of possible sites for the 44 billion 
supercollider atom smasher the department said tuesday 
we are looking at our options department spokesman jeff 
sherwood said 
the department is seeking 363 million in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 to begin construction of the collider a 
53milesaround tunnel that would smash beams of protons into each 
other 
last year it requested 25 million for design and 10 million 
for early construction work that was not tied to a site but 
congress approved only the 25 million 
sherwood said the department had not sought site evaluation 
funds until it knew how many sites it would have to deal with 
twentyfive states submitted proposals for 35 sites a list that 
was narrowed to seven finalists in december 
until recently the department had planned to write an 
environmental impact statement only for its final choice expected 
to be made tentatively in july but last month secretary john 
herrington told congress that choice would be delayed until 
november and the department said it would assess environmental 
impacts for all seven sites 
there is substantial congressional opposition to the heavy 
spending required for the project sen bennett johnston dla 
chairman of the energy and natural resources committee and also of 
the energy and water development subcommittee of the appropriations 
committee warned herrington that the department might not get all 
the money it was seeking in the new fiscal year 
the 8 million would have been shifted from general 
administrative funds of the department for the current fiscal year 
sherwood said the department could take evaluation funds from 
the 25 million at the cost of slowing down design of the magnets 
that guide the proton beams or could delay the evaluations 
perhaps at the cost of pushing the site selection decision into the 
next administration 
we would very much like to keep to our planned schedule he 
said

rising production costs and a weakening dollar 
overseas are forcing the washington opera to raise ticket prices 
and reduce the number of performances next season officials said 
tuesday the best orchestra seats will sell for 60 up from 4950 
this year 
despite the first major boost in ticket prices since 1981 
general director martin feinstein said the opera still must raise 
300000 privately to stage a new production of giacomo puccinis 
tosca for its season opener in the kennedy center opera house 
on nov 5 
tenor placido domingo will star in that production which will 
be directed by gian carlo menotti and conducted by rafael fruhbeck 
de burgos 
other season highlights will include peter tchaikovskys pique 
dame the queen of spades conducted by mstislav rostropovich 
and directed by his wife galina vishnevskaya and stephen paulus 
the postman always rings twice a 1982 musical adaptation of 
james m cains depressionera novel 
the cheapest seats in washington will sell for 20 in the 
kennedy centers eisenhower theater where smaller operas are 
staged and standing room remains 10 students and senior citizens 
can still buy halfprice tickets 
feinstein blamed the increase on mounting production costs and a 
50 percent decline in the value of the dollar abroad in the past 
three years which makes it more expensive to hire domingo and 
other foreign singers 
the budget squeeze also forced feinstein to reduce the number of 
performances from 66 to 48 next season and to present seven instead 
of the current eight operas

president reagan was asked tuesday to meet 
with the nations civil rights leaders who are trying to prevent a 
veto of legislation to restore full antidiscrimination protection 
to women minorities the handicapped and the elderly 
the request came in a letter from the chairman and executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights who said 
that reagan has rarely met with civil rights leaders during his 
seven years in office 
now is the time for reconciliation not for confrontation 
said chairman benjamin l hooks and executive director ralph g 
neas who asked for a meeting as soon as possible 
the leadership conference includes all the major civil rights 
groups there was no immediate white house response 
reagan has threatened to veto the civil rights restoration act 
which passed the house 31598 and the senate 7514 margins large 
enough to override a rejection by the president 
the civil rights leaders said the legislation would restore full 
federal civil rights protections in public and private 
institutions and state and local governments receiving federal 
money those protections were limited by a 1984 supreme court 
decision involving grove city college in pennsylvania 
reagan however said the bill would actually expand federal 
jurisdiction beyond pregrove city limits 
hooks head of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people and neas wrote reagan contrary to what some 
have said the restoration act is not an expansion of federal 
power 
and they added a presidential veto of a bill to end federal 
funding of discrimination would leave a terrible and lasting stain 
on your presidency

at the pikes landing bar the regulars 
have a curious way of telling spring is near they wait for the 
first truck or car to break through the ice of the chena river 
gary halmstad earned that dubious distinction monday his 1979 
van broke through 8 inches of ice as he started across an ice 
bridge used as a winter shortcut by many residents 
i hate being this kind of harbinger of spring he said 
the ice cracked between the front and back tires and he 
summoned a small wrecker to pull him off instead the tow truck 
pulled the front tires off a supporting shelf of ice and the front 
of the van plunged into about 5 feet of water he planned to call a 
larger wrecker to pull the van out the rest of the way 
im glad it wasnt in the middle he said i suppose i 
should giggle all i have to do is pay money for a tow truck and 
drain the engine

several california lawmakers are 
trying not to be spineless as they defend their decision to make 
the banana slug the official state mollusk 
the state governmental orginization committee on tuesday endured 
slimy jabs about the slug including comparisons to its garlicky 
cousin escargot before sliding the bill out of committee on a 
122 vote 
the legislation authored by democratic assemblyman byron sher 
now inches onto the assembly floor 
sher introduced the bill at the urging of the dynamite blue bird 
troop of redwood city six members of the inveterate invertebrate 
supporters testified before the committee and brought along six 
banana slugs 
the state has several official mascots such as the california 
gray whale as the marine mammal and the california dogfaced 
butterful as the state insect but it has no mollusk which is a 
large phylum of invertebrate animals that includes octopi abalone 
mussels snails and slugs 
blue bird susanna farley said the banana slug should be the 
state mollusk because theyre native to the west coast and live 
in redwood forests which is the state tree and also they eat 
poison oak and thats very helpful 
can we make escargot out of them inquired assemblyman 
curtis tucker 
i have no inherent objection to the state mollusk being such a 
useful slimy oozy thing said assemblyman nolan frizzelle 
assemblyman trice harvey tried unsuccessfully to make the state 
mollusk the abalone saying they taste better and are not yucky 
yellow creatures that hide out in the mountains

iran and iraq fired missiles at each 
others cities tuesday and the iraqis said their warplanes raided 
an iranian oil tanker it was the first reported attack on persian 
gulf shipping in weeks 
iran claimed either the united states or france had helped iraq 
modify sovietbuilt missiles so they could reach tehran for the 
first time since the war began in september 1980 
the united states greeted with skepticism a surprise call by the 
soviet union for the un security council to condemn the war of 
the cities 
iraq said it fired two surfacetosurface rockets at isfahan in 
central iran in the first missile attack on that city in the 
ninedayold missile duel it said three missiles were fired into 
tehran and one at the holy city of qom 
tehran radio said 12 civilians were killed when the missiles 
struck residential areas in the three cities damaging houses 
shops and a medical center 
iraq has reported hitting tehran with 43 missiles since feb 29 
and iran says it has fired 23 into baghdad 
iran said it fired a missile tuesday into amarah an iraqi town 
halfway between baghdad and the southern port of basra and two at 
mosul an important northern oil center iraq reported casualties 
but did not specify how many 
iran has said 134 people have been killed and more than 300 
wounded in the latest round of the war of the cities iraq says 
there have been many civilian casualties but has not mentioned 
figures 
a dispatch from the official iraqi news agency said warplanes 
raided a very large naval target off iran the phrase usually 
means an iranian supertanker 
maritime sources said they had no information about the raid 
which would be the first confirmed attack on a commercial ship in 
the gulf since feb 12 more than 400 have been hit in the 7 years 
of war 
hashemi rafsanjani speaker of irans parliament said the 
missiles being fired by iraq are sovietmade scudbs which 
previously have been used against iranian border cities 
in order to increase the range of the missiles they have been 
clumsily tampered with he said there is no doubt that the 
major powers did this such as america or france 
rafsanjani said iranian military experts had examined several 
unexploded missiles and concluded that although such missiles 
were originally made in russia most of the eastern bloc countries 
manufacture or assemble this missile today and iraq can obtain it 
from other sources 
western military experts have said the missiles are scudbs 
fitted with strapon boosters enabling them to reach tehran and 
qom which are nearly 300 miles from the border 
the missile normally carries a 1000pound warhead and has a 
range of 190 miles western experts say iran also uses scudbs 
supplied by its arab allies syria and libya but it does not need 
boosters because baghdad is only 80 miles from the frontier 
at the united nations in new york soviet ambassador alexander 
m belonogov told reporters monday the security council must act to 
prevent further escalation of the military conflict but evaded 
a question about whether the kremlin would approve an arms embargo 
us ambassador herbert okun said a soviet resolution on the 
war of the cities should not undercut or erode council 
resolution 598 of july 20 which demanded an immediate ceasefire

government major from decatur ill im not going to let my deaf 
rights get hurt ive been waiting too long this is our time 
psychology professor neil reynolds who chairs the schools

from faculty members for a deaf president said reynolds that 
is definitely a change 
both the faculty senate and the larger group of instructors will 
meet wednesday to discuss the ongoing controversy said reynolds 
about 30 percent of gallaudets professors are deaf while

burstein president of the schools alumni association said at an

university agrees to make deaf persons a majority on the schools 
20member board of trustees the board now has just four deaf 
members 
spilman said tuesday that the board will stand by its decision 
to hire zinser vice chancellor of academic affairs at greensboro 
it was not the intention of the board of trustees to create 
turmoil on campus spilman said in a telephone interview it 
was a vote cast in the best interests of the university and 
elisabeth ann zinser was selected for one and only one reason she 
was the most qualified person

three federal appellate judges tuesday upheld 
a lower courts finding that there was no evidence general motors 
corp knowingly sold 11 million 1980 xcars with alleged brake 
defects 
the panel of the us circuit court of appeals in washington 
affirmed us district judge thomas penfield jacksons 1987 
rejection of government claims that the cars had an inherent defect 
that caused rear brakes to lock up prematurely and spin out of 
control under certain circumstances 
jackson had ruled against the national highway traffic safety 
administration which had sought to fine gm 4 million and order a 
complete recall of the 11 million 1980 models of chevrolet 
citation pontiac phoenix buick skylark and oldsmobile omega 
the suit was filed in 1983 after the agency received more than 
4000 complaints from drivers that the cars spun out of control 
after the brakes had locked without conceding there was a defect 
gm had previously agreed to two recalls which the government said 
were inadequate to deal with the problem 
in its ruling tuesday the appeals court rejected the 
governments argument that jackson had improperly rejected the 
testimony of drivers who said they believed the skidding was caused 
by defective brakes 
we agree with the district court that the drivers were in no 
position to know if the rearwheel lockup was in fact premature 
in view of the particular breaking application and driving 
parameters involved in each incident the panel said in an 
opinion by circuit judge kenneth starr 
drivers cannot assess with reasonable accuracy the external 
variables that may contribute to a skid no matter how rich their 
experience or concentrated their attention may be the court said 
gm in a statement released in detroit said todays decision 
more than justifies our determination to stay the course and defend 
the 1980 xcar through long and costly and highlypublicized 
litigation 
the appeals court has given added assurance to the owners of 
1980 and later models of the xcar that they may drive those cars 
with confidence it said 
the government did not have any immediate reaction to tuesdays 
ruling 
in his opinion last april jackson concluded that there is 
simply no engineering evidence of any peculiar property of the 
xcar generally that renders them in any way exceptional insofar as 
having a predisposition to yaw turn 
the appeals court panel also rejected the governments argument 
that jackson improperly considered gm test data that was taken 
after the case was filed 
the government contended the test data was based on an 
insufficient sample of xcars and peer cars that had similar 
brakes this data demonstrated that xcars were no more likely to 
skid than similar vehicles it also showed that skidding of xcars 
was not caused by a brake malfunction 
it would have been odd for the district court to have 
dismissed all this data as irrelevant in assessing the 
probabilities that the vehicle rather than other factors was 
responsible for the mishaps starr wrote in an opinion that was 
joined by judges harry t edwards and douglas h ginsburg 
starr noted that over 300 xcars including 71 that had been 
the subject of consumer complaints and 528 peer cars were run 
through the testing gauntlet those impressive numbers stand in 
rebuke to the governments claim that an insufficient sample was 
used

secretary of state george shultz told a senior 
israeli envoy tuesday that he would reject any attempt by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to postpone a response to his mideast peace 
plan an israeli source said 
shultz met for an hour with israels former ambassador to 
washington moshe arens a close shamir confidante said the 
source who spoke on condition he not be identified by name the 
state department confirmed the meeting took place but declined to 
comment further 
arens asked for the meeting following a letter sent last week by 
30 senators to shultz urging that shamir cede israelioccupied 
lands in return for peace with the arabs 
the letter by some of israels staunchest supporters on capitol 
hill caused consternation in jerusalem which is unused to such 
censure from congress shamir is expected to face heavy pressure 
from congress when he comes here for a fourday visit next week 
shultz told arens that he sees no good reason why shamir 
cannot come here with an answer to the us proposal which calls 
for negotiations on a threeyear period of palestinian selfrule to 
be followed by talks on a permanent solution for the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip said the source 
shamir on sunday blocked a cabinet debate on the proposal which 
shultz presented during a shuttle diplomacy swing through the 
region last week but said he would bring the subject up for a 
decision after he returns from washington shultz asked both israel 
and jordan for an answer within 10 days 
israeli news reports say shamir will make shultz a 
counterproposal which will include selfrule for the 15 million 
palestinians under israeli control but will not address the 
question of the future of the territories 
shamir and his rightwing likud bloc are opposed to a 
landforpeace formula 
the white house on monday welcomed the senators call for shamir 
to give up arab lands but the state department has not responded 
publicly shultz is expected to answer the senators possibly later 
this week 
shultz told arens that israel cant afford to delay 
especially in view of the growing congressional and public pressure 
for negotiations to resolve the israelipalestinian violence which 
has resulted in the killing of some 80 arabs by israeli troops over 
the past three months 
meanwhile sen chic hecht of nevada and several of his fellow 
republicans were working on a letter or statement in response to 
last weeks letter to shultz hecht as well as sens jesse helms 
of north carolina and arlen specter of pennsylvania are opposed to 
what they view as internal interference in israeli politics

an organization formed to advise president 
reagan on jewish matters lashed out tuesday at 30 senators who 
wrote a letter supporting the administrations position that it is 
time for israel to exchange land for peace 
the group known as the national jewish coalition said the 
senators operated in haste and were inserting themselves into 
the internal politics of israel 
the group issued its statement after a meeting in the oval 
office with reagan however richard fox the chairman of the 
organization said the president did not discuss the peace process 
or the violence in the israelioccupied territories 
he said the meeting with reagan lasted only 12 or 13 minutes and 
the presidents comments were really more of a ceremonial 
statement there was no forum for discussion of the issue 
the coalition formed after the 1984 election comprises jewish 
republicans 
on monday the white house had said it welcomed the senators 
statement in which they criticized israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and his likud party suggesting they may be blocking efforts 
to reach a peace settlement in the middle east 
asked about that letter fox said our belief is that those 
distinguished senators all of whom are friends of israel 
operated in haste 
he complained that they based their criticism on a report in the 
new york times rather than direct statements from the prime 
minister the letter had said the senators were dismayed to read 
in the newspaper that shamir had opposed giving up any territory 
saying this expression of territory for peace is not accepted by 
me 
fox said the senators are dealing in an area which is very 
sensitive at this time and essentially inserting themselves into 
the internal politics of israel 
there is obviously a debate going on between the two political 
parties in israel as to what their position should be and i think 
the best thing that we who are concerned and interested can do is 
to hopefully let the israelis develop their own position 
he also said the organization was supportive of the middle east 
peace approach taken by secretary of state george p shultz but 
said much of details remain to be defined

attorneys for lyndon larouche six followers and 
five larouche political groups battled the government tuesday for 
access to classified fbi information concerning larouche and key 
players in the irancontra scandal 
several of the defense lawyers sought to dismiss the case after 
being denied immediate access to the information but us district 
judge robert e keeton deferred ruling on the requests until after 
questions over access to the fbi files are resolved 
defense attorneys at hearings outside the presence of the jury 
have presented evidence in recent weeks of fbi infiltration of 
larouche organizations 
they also have gained access to a onepage memo from retired air 
force maj gen richard secord to marine lt col oliver north the 
former national security council aide in which secord reports 
our man here claims lewis has collected info against larouche 
lewis was not further identified 
the memo found in norths safe after he was fired because of 
his role in the irancontra affair was surrendered to larouche 
defense lawyers after the special prosecutor investigating the 
scandal acknowledged its existence 
secord reached tuesday in washington said he could not recall 
the memo and said he never had crossed paths with larouche secord 
was one of norths principal operatives in his network of private 
aid to the contras 
defense lawyers have said they will prove the reagan 
administration plotted to ruin larouche because he refused to 
support reagans programs to aid nicaraguas contra rebels they 
also argue that the government has improperly withheld evidence 
that could prove their case which could be grounds for dismissal 
of the charges 
they contend that north directed the fbi to gather information 
against larouche and infiltrate his organizations as part of a 
larger fbi surveillance of groups opposed to the administrations 
central american policies 
larouche the aides and organizations all are charged with 
conspiring to cover up alleged credit card fraud by larouche 
supporters during his 1984 presidential campaign four of the 
organizations are charged with fraud larouche is seeking the 1988 
democratic presidential nomination his fourth run for the white 
house he faces up to five years in prison if convicted 
prosecutors throughout the trial and pretrial hearings denied 
defense contentions that the government inflitrated larouches 
organzations and concocted a credit card fraud and coverup scheme 
to destroy larouche and his following 
after learning of the may 1986 secordnorth memo defense lawyer 
michael reilly requested any information the government had about 
larouche and lewis that might be favorable to defense claims 
the prosecutor in the case assistant us attorney john 
markham surrendered documents from fbi files to reilly but the 
fbi later told markham that he was not supposed to release the 
material 
other defense attorneys now want copies of the documents but 
the fbi opposed the request on grounds the records are classified 
reilly who represents just one of the five larouche organizations 
that are defendants has said he cannot give the documents to his 
fellow defense lawyers because of federal rules on classified 
information 
markham as the government attorney in the case normally would 
argue the fbis position but he refused to do so tuesday saying 
there was a conflict of interest between the fbis stance and his 
role as prosecutor of the case he did not elaborate but said the 
conflict would be resolved before the wednesday hearing on access 
to the records 
keeton also told markham he wants an explanation as to why 
defense lawyers through freedom of information act requests have 
learned of the existence of thousands of other fbi documents 
mentioning larouche that were not turned over to defense lawyers 
before the trial 
ive got to have some explanation from the government about 
how the documents are discoverable through foia requests and not by 
the prosecution the judge said 
after the questions over access to the records are resolved 
defense lawyers have said they will renew their motions for 
dismissal of the case or a mistrial on grounds their opening 
statements and crossexamination strategies would have been 
different if they had reviewed the documents prior to trial

the governing christian 
democratic party on tuesday withdrew the candidacy for the national 
legislature of a member under investigation for alleged misuse of 
us aid funds 
rodolfo castillo claramount vice president of the party 
appeared before the central elections council to remove luis mejia 
miranda as a candidate for the national assembly in elections march 
20 
mejia is going to have support in order to clear up his 
personal situation but we dont want the application of justice to 
be blurred if he is elected and possesses legislative immunity 
castillo told reporters 
assembly members have a degree of immunity from prosecution 
under salvadoran law 
castillo called on the public prosecutors office to conduct a 
thorough investigation of the allegations against mejia which were 
reported sunday by the new york times 
the newspaper said mejia is being investigated for allegedly 
misusing up to 2 million of us aid 
it quoted unidentified salvadoran and us officials as saying 
it could be the largest case of theft of american aid money during 
the administration of president jose napoleon duarte who was 
elected for a fiveyear term in may 1984 
mejia on monday denied the allegations and said can you 
imagine that if i had 2 million i would still be in this 
country 
the new york times also said duartes son alejandro who is 
running for mayor of san salvador was trying to protect mejia 
alejandro duarte on monday denied having ties to mejia 
according to the new york times the money allegedly stolen was 
part of a 10 million program to assist warravaged areas and help 
win the support of salvadorans in the war against leftist rebels 
it said mejia resigned three months ago as director of the 
national commission for the restoration of areas but president 
duarte agreed to allow him to become a party candidate for the 
national assembly on the recommendation of alejandro duarte

the judge presiding over gov evan 
mechams impeachment trial told mechams lawyer tuesday that he had 
showed that the states top lawman had a motive to testify 
against the governor and ordered him to move on to other topics 
arizona supreme court justice frank x gordon who earlier 
fielded objections to questions focusing on the witness sex life 
said he would allow no further testimony on the personal life or 
motives of department of public safety director ralph milstead a 
key witness against mecham on an obstruction of justice charge 
you have made your point gordon told attorney fred craft as 
he concluded a twoday crossexamination of milstead 
you have established that director milstead had a motive for 
testifying against the governor said gordon that he had a 
highpaying job with more than a modicum of influence and with a 
number of perks 
he said it was clear that mecham had planned to fire milstead 
and presumably col milstead wants to keep his job 
but he said further evidence on the subject would be cumulative 
and timeconsuming 
he noted that the senate impeachment court could overrule his 
decision but senators who protested the slow pace of testimony 
was costing taxpayers 20000 a day went along with gordon 
his ruling derailed an announced defense plan to call a parade 
or witnesses to challenge milsteads crediblity 
this witness is the accuser of the governor attorney 
jerris leonard told the senate shortly before gordons 
announcement what we are doing is asking questions to lay the 
foundation for future witnesses to impeach his credibility 
prosecutor paul eckstein told reporters outside the hearing room 
that the judges ruling will bar the defense from calling to the 
stand a woman who the defense claims was milsteads paramour 
crafts questioning drew repeated protests from the prosecutors 
that he was using innuendo to delve into the sex life of milstead 
the subject was ruled offlimits by gordon earlier 
the 63yearold governor who has not attended any sessions of 
the impeachment trial since it began last week is accused of 
ordering milstead not to help the attorney general investigate an 
alleged death threat to a grand jury witness by a mecham aide 
the governor has acknowledged he may have given such 
instructions to milstead but says he was not fully informed about 
the situation and milstead has said he cooperated with the 
attorney generals office 
craft was interrupted several times by objections from house 
prosector william french as craft tried to delve into the 
relationship between milstead and a onetime dps informant 
christina juell johnston 
milstead said they had a professional relationship adding i 
counted her as a friend 
but he denied he escorted her on dates in his state vehicle or 
paid for her meals out of state funds 
craft previously had asked did you ever travel to mrs 
christina juell johnstons home in your state vehicle 
i believe i did yes said milstead 
did you ever stay overnight at mrs christina juell johnstons 
home with your state vehicle asked craft no i did not 
said milstead 
as craft continued to pose questions about the relationship 
asking if milstead paid for her meals at restaurants french arose 
and addressed gordon 
mr presiding officer this is crossexamination by innuendo 
its improper said french 
gordon noted that he had ruled out questions about milsteads 
alleged sexual affair as irrelevant milstead who is now divorced 
was married at the time of the alleged affair while mrs johnston 
was single 
but craft insisted he was merely seeking information about 
possible misuse by milstead of a state vehicle or possible improper 
listing of meals on his expense account and gordon permitted the 
questions to continue 
in other questioning tuesday craft suggested that milstead 
purposely kept mecham in the dark about the investigation of the 
alleged death threat 
but milstead insisted the relevant information was in his 
hands 
milstead acknowledged he never told mecham he was planning to 
disobey the governors orders and take the case to the attorney 
general 
i was in shock from his anger his insistence we not 
cooperate milstead said he was not to be reasoned with 
when his words were dont give them any help whatsoever i 
said ok and that was the end of the conversation 
asked whether mecham might have assumed that milstead was 
agreeing to obey his order to keep quiet milstead said he could 
have construed it that way yes 
in addition to obstructing the attorney generals investigation 
mecham is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan and misusing 80000 in a state fund by loaning it to 
his car dealership 
mecham the first us governor to face an impeachment trial in 
six decades also faces a criminal trial march 22 on felony charges 
of concealing the campaign loan and a recall election may 17

divine the bizarre female impersonator who 
starred in such films as pink flamingos and hairspray was 
remembered tuesday by john waters director of the two movies as 
a kind and gentle man 
divine is as irreplaceable to me as a member of my own 
family waters said reading haltingly from a statment at a 
baltimore hotel ill miss him incredibly 
not only did i respect him as the best actor ive ever worked 
with i knew him personally as a kind and gentle man waters said 
the 42yearold actor whose real name was harris glenn 
milstead was found dead in his bed monday at the hollywood regency 
plaza hotel waters said he was told divine was found under the 
covers with a smile on his face 
a preliminary coroners autopsy failed to pinpoint a cause of 
death and a microscopic examination of tissue samples was ordered 
preliminary tests showed no signs of trauma or any other factor 
that would have contributed to the actors death los angeles 
county coroners spokesman steve stewart said tuesday 
publicist john west of pmk said the actor apparently died of 
asphyxiation during the night he was in town to appear in an 
episode of married with children a fox television network 
series 
divine normally slept upright propped up because of his weight 
said peter haas a publicist for hairspray 
divine had a longterm weight problem but was found at a medical 
checkup friday to be otherwise in excellent health his manager 
bernard jay said tuesday 
he was not on drugs at all and he never drank alcohol jay 
said i suppose it all comes down to his weight he was 
constantly trying to diet but as soon as hed take the pounds off 
theyd come right back on again 
waters was one of the actors few friends in school in 
lutherville a baltimore suburb where milstead said he grew up fat 
and taunted by classmates 
waters obsession with trashy movies nearly matched milsteads 
fantasies of celebrity and waters began casting his friend in 
bizarre roles 
the most famous would be the cult film classics pink 
flamingos lust in the dust polyester and female 
trouble 
he had been pleased over his role in hairspray as edna 
turnblad the fat mother of a fat teenage girl 
hed call me in the middle of the night to read me some 
newspaper interview and say isnt it wonderful they called me 
divine the 300pound actor not divine the 300pound 
transvestite jay said 
as divine he wore garish makeup and was loud and foulmouthed 
shes her own person and a lot of people like that he once 
said the camp element is something out of the ordinary this big 
man playing a sexy woman 
milstead played a nontransvestite role that of a sydney 
greenstreettype character in the 1985 film trouble in mind 
besides film roles milstead used the divine persona in a 
nightclub act 
waters said that the last time he had spoken to divine was two 
days ago and that he had last seen him at the premiere of 
hairspray in new york city 
in their last conversations waters said he was just so 
happy he said can you believe we came this far

arabs stabbed a man 
accused of aiding israel and dumped the corpse at his mothers 
door and israeli gunfire killed another palestinian on tuesday 
hospitals and witnesses reported 
hundreds of arab women held demonstrations in the occupied 
territories following a call for protests from the palestine 
liberation organization 
hospital officials in nablus said three arab protesters were 
wounded by israeli gunfire but the army said a jewish settler shot 
one of them after the settlers car was stoned in the balata 
refugee camp 
residents of mazraa sharqiya said a settler shot khader mohammed 
hamideh a 42yearold businessman with seven children outside his 
home the army confirmed hamidehs death but said it was 
investigating the circumstances 
according to un figures at least 83 palestinians have been 
killed by israelis since arab riots began dec 8 in the west bank 
and gaza strip which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war 
prime minister yitzhak shamir indicated tuesday on israel 
television that he intends to debate us peace proposals and to 
present his own plan when he visits washington next week 
the us plan calls for talks on a threeyear period of 
palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories to be followed in 
december by negotiations on the permanent status of these 
territories 
shamir said this is only a proposal and we can certainly 
present our own proposals and make our comments 
asked if he expects pressure in washington the hardline prime 
minister replied i dont expect any pressures and if there would 
be such they would not help 
shamir opposes the us plan because it calls for an 
international role in talks and because of its accelerated 
timetable 
the daily hadashot said that shamirs plan calls for talks 
between us and soviet representatives only the superpowers would 
have a symbolic role and talks on a permanent solution would start 
three years after palestinian autonomy is implemented 
in another development tuesday the military command said four 
army officers were sentenced to 35 days in jail each for not being 
armed when three guerrillas commandeered their car before hijacking 
a bus monday 
the officers were on their way to an army sporting event in 
track suits and fled when the guerrillas opened fire the army said 
three israeli hostages and the guerrillas were killed during the 
hijacking and later storming of the bus the plo claimed 
responsibility 
more than 5000 mourners attended the funerals of the slain 
israelis tuesday at beersheba in southern israel 
in jericho residents of the aqbat jaber refugee camp said 
palestinians killed an arab policeman suspected of collaborating 
wrapped the body in a palestinian flag and dropped it at his 
mothers door 
the army confirmed the body of nabil juma farah 30 was found 
in the refugee camp monday night 
it was the second killing of a suspected collaborator reported 
since violence began 
police minister chaim barlev said he would encourage other arab 
policemen not to quit by raising their pay and trying to discover 
who killed farah 
in mazraa sharqiya 15 miles northeast of jerusalem villagers 
said three israelis believed to be settlers stopped at a roadblock 
built of stones and trash bins and one shot hamideh who owned a 
cafe and butcher shop 
two of them got out and started to remove the stones one 
of them got out and started to shoot one witness said speaking 
anonymously fear of reprisals 
he said the settler fired at a home about 150 yards away then 
shot at hamidehs home next door where the victim was standing 
later tuesday about 600 villagers chanting slogans and waving a 
plo flag carried hamidehs coffin through the village and buried 
him

associated press writer 
washington ap a week of talks between us and japanese 
officials over participation by us firms in billions of dollars 
worth of japanese building projects ended in failure tuesday 
and a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
president reagan under the law could retaliate against japan for 
what are considered unfair trade practices 
that is one of the options the official said adding that 
the reagan administration will decide probably by the end of next 
week what its next step will be 
the official said the us side had exhausted its capacity to 
resolve the issues and was not ready to go on talking given the 
differences between the two sides 
he said the japanese who had offered measures to allow us 
construction firms to gain experience in japan on seven projects 
wanted discussions to continue 
the us delegation was led by j michael farren deputy 
undersecretary of commerce for international trade the japanese 
group was headed by peter sato director general of economic 
affairs in the japanese foreign ministry 
farren has criticized previous japanese proposals as offering 
american companies only limited experience not enough to enable 
them to take part in normal japanese bidding on public projects 
the us official as an example cited the extension of the 
tokyo international airport at haneda where he said the only 
opportunity offered to americans would be in compacting earth and 
laying concrete and in building a monorail 
the americans would not be competitive in the laborintensive 
construction he added he said that under the japanese proposals 
they would not be allowed to participate in the design or 
engineering nor in the building of a 900 million airport terminal 
the official said the us delegation also wanted the 
arrangements on participation by us construction firms written 
into a formal agreement while the japanese did not want to be 
bound and sought only a joint statement that unspecified 
arrangements were satisfactory

a supreme court panel on 
tuesday rejected a challenge to censorship powers that allow a 
cabinet minister to close newspapers for publishing material he 
considered objectionable 
earlier police detained nine journalists during an 
antiapartheid demonstration by about 100 black women outside the 
chamber of mines building 
police arrived about 10 minutes after the peaceful protest 
began the crowd dispersed and police began seizing journalists 
including crew members of cbs and londonbased world television 
news 
world television soundman prince msuthu said police punched him 
police spokesman col frans malherbe said the nine were were 
taken to police headquarters but were released without charge 
malherbe said emergency rules that have been in effect for 
nearly two years prohibit members of the media from being at the 
scene of unrest 
the protesters members of the federation of transvaal women 
called on mining companies to oppose new government restrictions on 
antiapartheid organizations the womens federation is an 
affiliate of the united democratic front one of 18 organizations 
covered by the ban issued feb 24 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate services 
the censorship ruling by the rand supreme court could lead to 
the closing of the weekly new nation a newspaper published for 
black readers by the south african catholic bishops conference 
during the hearing home affairs minister stoffel botha said he 
had been ready to shut down the new nation in january he said the 
paper published material that he felt promoted outlawed 
organizations fanned revolt and incited hostility toward security 
forces 
under a decree issued in august by president pw botha the 
home affairs minister can install censors at newspapers or shut 
down the publications 
in its challenge the new nation said the decree was 
unenforceable because editors could not anticipate what the 
minister might consider objectionable 
gabu tugwana acting new nation editor said in a telephone 
interview the paper we are putting out for tomorrow could be the 
one before the last issue he said the publishers intended to 
appeal the decision 
new nation editor zwelakhe sisulu has been in detention without 
charge for more than a year 
under the emergency decrees the home minister is not required 
to give detailed reasons for his objections to published material 
the head of the threejudge panel said in the ruling the 
president was legally correct to give the minister such power

pat robertsons poor showing in the super 
tuesday voting in the south shows that the traditional value 
community has been totally fractured the chairman of christian 
voice said tuesday night 
frankly im surprised that he did not do better said 
robert grant who leads the largest conservative evangelical lobby 
in the country 
in early returns robertson did not come in better than third in 
any state behind vice president george bush and sen bob dole of 
kansas he bested another conservative rep jack kemp of new york 
however 
grant said the opinionmakers on the far right of the republican 
party must now try to come to some consensus on who they will back 
only as this community hangs together does it have any real 
impact grant said the traditional value community has been 
totally fractured with kemp taking a piece robertson taking the 
charismatics to a degree and a large part going to dole and bush 
he said the vice presidents showing in the south is an 
indication that he may be a viable candidate for the bible 
belttype vote but he is going to have to work for it 
however said grant the image or perception conveyed by the 
bush campaign has been to savage and to turn away conservative 
christian activities this has not necessarily been the sentiment 
of the vice president but it has been the impression conveyed 
within his campaign and among many established republican types 
if bush wishes to woo that vote he has a good shot at it

a teenager who admitted plotting the fatal 
beating of a classmate in 1986 has not suffered from severe 
psychosis or hallucinations despite a history of behavioral 
problems medical experts said tuesday 
the norfolk superior court jury is expected to hear closing 
arguments then begin deliberations wednesday the seventh day of 
the trial 
rod matthews 15 of canton is being tried as an adult for 
murder in the nov 20 1986 slaying of 14yearold shaun 
ouillette also of canton who allegedly was lured to a wooded area 
by matthews and beaten with a baseball bat 
matthews who pleaded innocent by reason of insanity said he 
had plotted the slaying for a month to experience what killing 
someone was like according to testimony from two classmates to 
whom matthews showed the body 
dr michael annunziata a courtappointed psychiatrist told a 
norfolk superior court jury that matthews suffered from a conduct 
disorder but that he had not experienced classic symptoms of 
psychosis such as hallucinations 
matthews said annunziata had substantial capacity to conform 
his conduct to the requirement of law 
annuziata on tuesday said the methodical planning of the killing 
did not indicate psychotic tendencies but suggested matthews was 
playing by different rules 
earlier dr marcel kinsbourne director of behavioral neurology 
at the eunice shriver center in waltham testified that standard 
doses of ritalin a drug matthews had been taking should not 
trigger violent behavior 
ritalin a stimulant primarily used to control hyperactivity in 
children has been a key aspect of the case 
the defense had contended that matthews was a mentally ill youth 
from a troubled home and that his problems were exacerbated by the 
use of ritalin 
dr bernard yudowitz of belmonts mclean hospital said on monday 
that ritalin may have made it harder for matthews to control his 
behavior

on tuesday the anniversary of 1968 student protests 
in the southern city of krakow earlier tuesday riot police 
clashed repeatedly with student demonstrators and briefly detained 
70100 people an opposition spokesman said 
twenty years ago march 8 1968 police and communist party 
activists brutally attacked warsaw university students who were 
protesting censorship and political repression 
this years protests reflected a renewed campaign by student 
activists for legalization of the independent students union or 
nzs it was outlawed after the independent labor federation 
solidarity was suppressed with the declaratrion of martial law in 
december 1981 
about 500 students chanting register nzs and 
solidarity and carrying banners began marching after an 
evening mass attended by about 2000 people at st annes a roman 
catholic church near warsaw university 
riot police blocked the street 100 yards from the church 
keeping demonstrators away from a monument to adam mickiewicz the 
19th century polish national poet 
an nzs leader asked police to allow people to lay flowers at the 
monument after demonstrators refused an offer to let a 
threeperson delegation approach the monument police charged the 
crowd flailing with clubs students fled 
hundreds of people lining the sidewalk chanted gestapo 
gestapo police pushed several students and at least one 
middleaged woman into vans but how many people were detained 
could not be determined 
at krakows jagiellonian university about 700 students tried to 
march to the main square in the citys old town and were blocked by 
riot police said zygmunt lenyk a krakow opposition activist 
quoting accounts from witnesses he said police attacked the 
crowd with clubs but about 50 demonstrators pushed through police 
lines to the square where they were detained 
lenyk said most of the students returned to campus and tried 
twice more to march to the square about 500 yards away but police 
attacked each time 
students erected a street barricade with park benches and 
garbage cans but police vehicles drove through it he reported 
about 70 to 100 people were detained but police began releasing 
them by early afternoon he said lenyk reported at least three 
people severely beaten by police 
in 1968 police and party activists went onto the warsaw 
university campus to beat and arrest protesters many of whom were 
expelled and a purge of reformoriented intellectuals and jews 
followed last week the communist party said the purge was 
excessive

king hussein has invited yasser arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization to amman to 
discuss the latest us proposals on middle east peace a 
government official said tuesday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
invitation comes within a framework of a united arab stand 
reached at the arab summit in amman last year 
secretary of state george p shultz explained the proposals on 
trips to the region before and after last weeks nato summit in 
brussels 
in tunis the central committee of arafats fatah guerrilla 
group said tuesday the shultz plan was nothing but a desperate 
attempt aimed at reviving the 1982 reagan initiative and imposing 
it on the region 
cbs news in a report from paris said cbs news has learned 
that the american ambassador to the united nations vernon walters 
met secretly with a topranking plo leader in tunisia last weekend 
this according to senior plo officials who say the meeting took 
place at a private home at a seaside resort near tunis 
plo sources say it probably had to do with how palestinians 
can participate in any future peace talks the report said and 
added walters denied he had met with the plo in a statement read 
by a spokesman walters said he had no authorization to meet with 
them and had not done so cbs news said 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
reports that walters met with plo representatives were absolutely 
untrue 
the us proposals include limited selfrule for the 15 million 
palestinians living in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip and an international peace conference that could include the 
five permanent members of the un security council israel 
jordan syria and palestinians but not the plo 
hussein and arafat decided in 1985 to take a joint approach to 
peace with israel but hussein called it off in february 1986 
accusing arafat of not keeping his promises 
on monday jordans minister of information welcomed the us 
peace effort and said the shultz proposals were being studied 
thouroughly with arab states 
we welcome the american moves and we believe that the 
american reengagement in the peace process is positive hani 
khasawneh told reporters

a class action suit filed on behalf of five 
illegal aliens tuesday challenges provisions of the governments 
amnesty program that would bar hundreds of aliens from obtaining 
legal residency 
the suit filed in us district court seeks to block us 
immigration and naturalization service rules concerning aliens who 
do not meet some of the requirements for legalization but whose 
illegal status was known to the government 
ins rules under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 
provide amnesty to aliens who lived illegally in the united states 
before jan 1 1982 as well as to agricultural workers who can 
prove they lived in this country for at least 90 days in the year 
ended may 1 1986 
a problem has arisen over individuals who arrived legally with 
a visa but who remained in the country illegally after the jan 
1 1982 cutoff date according to debbi sanders of the washington 
lawyers committee for civil rights one of the attorneys for the 
plantiffs 
in cases like these the statute grants amnesty to those whose 
illegal status was known to the government 
volunteer agencies helping illegal aliens have sought to use 
social security and internal revenue service forms to prove that 
aliens in this category were known 
the ins however maintained that known to the government 
meant known to the ins sanders said noting that this difference 
of interpretation disqualified hundreds of illegals 
intrepretation of those four words is the basis for the suit 
filed by the lawyers committee the new york american civil 
liberties union the hispanic national bar association and a 
washington law firm 
it if filed on behalf of five unidentified aliens and four 
volunteer agencies ayunda inc the ethopian community center the 
latin american youth center and the mexican american legal defense 
and educational fund 
i think the government has taken too narrow of view of what 
the statute calls for said doris meissener acting immigration 
commissioner 198182 it is quite clear that the government is 
much more than ins 
ins spokesman duke austin said basically known to the 
government means known to us and known that there was an 
illegal status

troops took over plants of the state 
petroleum company tuesday and arrested labor leaders in response to 
a strike that threatens to paralyze transportation and the 
industrial sector 
the government began rationing gasoline and motorists waited 
hours in line many buses and taxis in major cities stayed off the 
streets for lack of gasoline tranport unions said 
police in santa cruz and la paz rounded up leaders of the 
petroleum workers union the government declared the strike illegal 
and said there would be more arrests if the walkout continues 
the conservative government decided to take over petroleum 
plants and gasoline distributorships after the petroleum workers 
union rejected a 30 percent wage increase conditioned on their not 
striking for a year 
the santa cruz refinery 350 miles east of la paz was 
surrounded by army units after workers turned off the plants 
machinery following the breakdown of negotiations with the 
government 
the plant produces 70 percent of the gasoline and natural gas 
used domestically it also is responsible for much of the natural 
gas exported to argentina the countrys principal source of export 
earnings 
saul soliz leader of the petroleum workers union said the 
governments linking of a wage increase to a promise of no strikes 
is a maneuver to divide the labor movement against the interests 
of workers 
the union accused the government of planning to finance the 30 
percent wage increase with the firing of 1500 workers minister of 
energy fernando illanes denied the charge the governmentowned 
petroleum company employs 7000 workers 
the ministry of information said the military intervened to 
prevent the destruction of equipment and guarantee a supply of fuel 
many factories in la paz and other cities said they had enough 
fuel for only two more days and were cutting back on production 
the government will not negotiate under pressure more so 
since 11 out of 21 unions agreed to the wage increase said 
illanes

vice president george bush marched across the south on tuesday 
overwhelming sen bob dole as he headed for a nearsweep in super 
tuesday voting dole braced to absorb the shock and the campaigns 
of the two remaining republican presidential contenders were dealt 
shattering blows 
tuesdays voting seemed likely to bury the struggling campaigns 
of rep jack kemp and pat robertson who had claimed the south as 
his base of support 
bush won decisive victories throughout the region capturing 
more than 50 percent of the vote in many states including 
delegaterich florida 
he also scored big wins in tennessee kentucky georgia 
alabama virginia mississippi north carolina and massachusetts 
dole had pinned his southern hopes on north carolina the home 
state of his wife elizabeth 
abc and nbc also projected the vice president as winning texas 
and maryland 
dole had hoped to pull out a win in north carolina the home 
state of his wife elizabeth 
however early returns showed the senate minority leader to be 
ahead in only one state missouri which borders his home state of 
kansas 
at stake tuesday were 712 delegates to the republican national 
convention virginia was alone among the 17 gop contests holding a 
beauty contest that awards no delegates 
bushs national campaign chairman lee atwater predicted that 
bush would pick up more than 600 of those delegates a gain that 
would give him a nearunassailable lead toward winning the gop 
presidential nomination 
i would certainly hate to be in sen doles shoes after 
tonight and especially if he loses in illinois atwater said 
battered in tuesdays voting dole turned his sights to next weeks 
illinois primary in hopes of staging a comeback in midwestern and 
western states 
dole said earlier in springfield ill if we take a little 
bath today i am going to start my road to recovery in illinois 
just like i did 40 years ago 
dole was referring to his recovery in an illinois hospital from 
wounds suffered during world war ii 
kemp and robertson were far outdistanced by bush and dole kemp 
trailed robertson in most southern states and was expected to drop 
out by weeks end for robertson the voting throughout the south 
was a replay of his third place finish in saturdays south carolina 
primary when he could muster no more than about 20 percent of the 
vote 
robertson seemed less likely to abandon his dogged pursuit of 
the presidency at this time but the former television evangelist 
conceded in advance that it would take some miracle for him to 
beat bush 
bush voted in houston and then told reporters if we exceed 
our expectations or live up to them i think well be in good 
shape 
top campaign aides had said earlier that they thought bush stood 
a good chance of winning at least 12 or 13 states 
polls showed the vice president ahead in 16 of the 17 contests 
including those in delegaterich texas and florida his chief 
rival dole was ahead only in missouri 
its going to be a little tougher as we go along but ive 
been in tough fights before dole acknowledged at a morning news 
conference in kansas city mo 
he then traveled to illinois and immediately challenged bush to 
a series of debates oneonone without moderator in that 
state which holds its primary next tuesday 
bushs chief spokesman pete teeley scoffed at the idea when 
asked about it in texas 
if bob dole was so serious about debating he would have shown 
up for the feb 19 dallas morning news debate teeley said 
we have a strategy which has been highly successful and we plan 
to pursue it and that doesnt include having oneonone debates 
with bob dole 
dole campaign strategists had conceded in advance that super 
tuesday would likely belong to the vice president 
in fact the question appeared to be not whether bush would 
emerge the victor but by what kind of margin and whether the 
drubbing would be fatal to dole who finished first in the iowa 
caucuses but lost strength in the ensuing contests 
the dole campaign had sought to keep bush from picking up more 
than 500 delegates tuesday 
dole though was looking ahead to illinois where he promised 
to issue a challenge or two to bush 
the senate majority leader a 1984 presidential contender and 
gop vice presidential candidate in 1976 was reportedly spending 
500000 on television advertising in the state 
a defeat there could all but end doles presidential efforts and 
a strong showing for the kanasan was by no means assured bush is 
backed by illinois gov james thompson and 93 of the states 102 
republican county chairmen 
kemp dead last in the south carolina primary last weekend had 
not been expected to see that flagging effort revived in tuesdays 
voting aides said the new york lawmaker and former profootball 
star would reassess his race later in the week he was expected to 
pull out 
robertsons chances as a serious contender seemed likely to be 
all but ended if his losses in super tuesday states were as 
decisive as his thirdplace finish in south carolina where he won 
only 19 percent of the vote 
robertsons candidacy came to life with his strong secondplace 
finish the iowa caucuses on feb 8 but in the primaries that 
followed his strength ebbed 
even so he told a north carolinia campaign audience as recently 
as monday we will do very well in the south

super tuesday belonged to george bush an 
avalanche of southern votes propelling him into an all but 
insurmountable lead in the race for the republican presidential 
nomination 
one month to the day that the vice president was humiliated in 
the iowa precinct caucuses his candidacy devastated by a 
thirdplace finish behind bob dole and pat robertson bush was in 
command of the gop race 
his campaign manager lee atwater predicted bush would pick up 
about 600 of the 712 gop delegates at stake on super tuesday 
what happened 
on feb 9 few could resist writing bush political obituaries 
dole flew to new hampshire with a claim to momentum that seemed 
likely to carry him to a second straight victory 
i think the vice presidents campaign is over said pete du 
pont 
the hemorrhaging of george bush has begun said al haig 
those assessments proved premature 
it was du pont whose campaign was soon over haig who didnt 
even make it to new hampshire primary day 
attempts to explain how the race turned around so quickly are 
likely to center on whether bush recovered or dole blew it 
for five days dole looked like a winner in new hampshire then 
came the straddle ads bush campaign commercials that portrayed 
the kansas senator as waffling on taxes the single most sensitive 
political issue in new hampshire 
the ads ran all weekend before the primary and there was no 
response from the dole campaign 
too late dole realized what had happened his surge in the 
polls leveled out suddenly as voters began making up their minds 
just before the primary bush began to gain 
when the returns came in the vice president had won by 9 points 
and an angry dole appeared on television and snapped that bush 
should stop lying about my record 
but there was more to bushs comeback than effective commercials 
the vice president also changed his campaign style he eschewed 
the cautious speeches the attempts to be vice presidential that 
had marked his iowa campaign he drove a forklift at a lumber yard 
and an 18wheeler at a truck stop 
this is the real me he proclaimed to more than a few 
snickers 
whoever it was he went over better with new hampshire voters 
than he had with their iowa counterparts 
but possibly the most important factor in the bush comeback was 
ronald reagan the man bush had served as a totally loyal vice 
president for seven years 
in iowa identification with reagan the president blamed for a 
devastated farm economy was not an asset voters wanted to send a 
message to the white house and they chose dole as their messenger 
but in new hampshire with an economy that had boomed since 
reagan took office the president was enormously popular the same 
was true in the south 
the calender had shifted to bushs advantage 
might it now shift back to give dole a boost the next big 
contest is the illinois primary a midwest state the region where 
the kansas senator has trounced bush in three contests iowa 
south dakota and minnesota 
while campaigning tuesday in springfield ill dole said if 
we take a little bath today i am going to start my road to 
recovery in illinois just like i did 40 years ago it was a 
chicago physician who guided doles recovery from world war ii 
wounds

two survivors of the nov 15 continental 
airlines crash at denvers airport told investigators tuesday that 
they thought they saw ice and snow on the wings as the dc9 took 
off in a swirling snowstorm but a pilot on another plane said the 
continental jet looked clear 
moments after takeoff the jet flipped over hit the runway and 
broke into three pieces killing 28 people and injuring the other 
54 people aboard some victims were trapped in the wreckage for 
more than six hours 
wes zimmerman a continental pilot on a neighboring plane that 
day and crash survivors dr fred helpenstell 56 of nampa idaho 
and gregory wadsworth 22 an airman stationed in idaho were among 
29 witnesses scheduled to testify at the national transportation 
safety board hearing which opened tuesday 
deicing and the pilots experience flying dc9s were the chief 
issues raised during early testimony although government officials 
have said their inquiry is not focusing on a single possible cause 
zimmerman whose continental 727300 aircraft was on the 35l 
runway at the same time as the continental jetliner said he saw no 
ice or snow buildup on flight 1713 
i felt good about how my deicing was holding up he said 
explaining that he looked at nearby aircraft to gauge the condition 
of his own plane but he acknowledged that his plane did not sit 
for as long between deicing and takeoff as the illfated plane had 
sat 
robert benzon the ntsb investigator in charge of the inquiry 
said during his opening statement that officials want to know why 
24 minutes elapsed between the time flight 1713 was deiced and the 
time it took off other planes on the runway were taking off 15 
minutes after being deiced he said 
the reasons for flight 1713s 24minute delay and the possible 
effects of snow or ice buildup on the wings and tail surfaces of 
the airplane during this delay are items of interest during this 
hearing benzon said 
in addition the pairing of the two flight officers aboard 
flight 1713 would be discussed during the hearing he said 
capt frank zvonek 43 who had 198 hours on a dc9 with only 
the previous 33 hours as captain first officer lee bruecher 26 
had 36 hours piloting dc9s and was flying the plane at the time of 
the crash both men were killed 
the pairing of two pilots with such experience in an aircraft 
type will be discussed during this hearing benzon said 
helpenstell who suffered broken ribs and a broken finger in the 
crash told the board that during takeoff from stapleton 
international airport he noticed that a wing looked wet 
i wondered at one point is that ice helpenstell 
recalled but i decided it was just wet 
wadsworth who is stationed at mountain home air force base in 
idaho said he had a clear view of the left wing 
it had started to snow a lot harder and it made me real 
nervous it was like the snow was starting to pile up on the 
wings he said i was very concerned but i said it under my 
breath i figured they do it taking off in snowstorms every day 
and i was hopeful they would be able to do it this time but 
unfortunately that was not what happened it was bad place 
continental officials criticized wadsworths testimony during 
the hearing noting that he had lost a certification as an air 
force mechanic wadsworth said he had been temporarily removed from 
mechanic duty because he had suffered flashbacks of the accident 
while he was on duty he now works in a tool room 
zimmerman who had flown a dc9 from june 1985 to february 1987 
testified that before shortly before the stapleton crash light to 
moderate snow was falling not enough to affect safety 
he said snow accumulation on his aircraft was very light it 
was a cold snow not a wet snow it didnt build up on the flat 
surface of the wing 
he testified that continental does not require pilots to have 
planes deiced but leaves it to the pilots discretion he 
estimated the time between the deicing of his plane and takeoff at 
17 to 18 minutes 
under questioning by federal investigators zimmerman said that 
if he had had to wait five minutes longer for takeoff he would 
have reevaluated whether his plane needed deicing 
flight attendant kelly englehart 35 testified she was 
concerned when she learned that bruecher would be flying the plane 
she and helpenstell also gave conflicting versions of the direction 
in which the aircraft rocked before it crashed 
helpenstell said the plane rocked first to the right side on 
which he was seated and then came back suddenly to the left 
englehart said the dc9 rocked first to the left side and then 
sharply to the right 
we felt the wing must have hit then there were three large 
pops and a large explosion i saw a large orange fireball at the 
front of the cabin moving down i shut my eyes and waited for it to 
be over i waited for it to get me she said

gibraltar by british commandos officials said 
it was packed with powerful explosives made in czechoslovakia 
and rigged with a timing device set at 1120 am but the timer 
had not been connected the spanish officials said the white ford 
fiesta was in a parking lot at marbella about 50 miles up the 
coast from this british colony 
british officials in london said the irish republican army 
members who were unarmed when commandos killed them sunday had 
planned to detonate a car bomb tuesday during the 20minute 
changing of the guard ceremony at the governors residence the 
ceremony began at 11 am 
the royal anglian regiment now guards the convent as the 
residence is called the regiment was just transferred from 
northern ireland where guerrillas of the mainly roman catholic ira 
have been fighting since 1969 to oust the british and unite the 
province with the predominantly catholic irish republic 
protestants outnumber catholics about 32 in the province 
soldiers patrolled convent square on tuesday and the ceremony 
went on as scheduled

ireland 
in catholic west belfast protesters outraged at the killings 
battled police and british troops throughout the day tuesday at

device was found in a hedge near the killeen customs post between

backers of a constitutional amendment to make 
english the states official language gathered about 260000 new 
signatures tuesday easily topping the number required to get on 
the november ballot a spokeswoman said 
we are feeling very good said patricia fulton spokeswoman 
for the florida english campaign 
taking advantage of primary election day volunteers stationed 
near polling places throughout the state collected about 60000 
signatures of registered voters and workers from a california 
company collected nearly 200000 ms fulton said 
the new signatures added to the 236000 already in hand should 
put the movement at well beyond the 342939 needed for a 
referendum about 125500 of the signatures already have been 
verified 
the signatures were obtained despite the efforts of the league 
of united latin american citizens which took out advertisements in 
hispanic newspapers around the state warning voters about the 
proposed amendment and urging them to register so that they could 
vote against it in the general election 
were accused of being racist or xenophobics because people 
think we are antiimmigrants said dr mark laporta chairman on 
the florida english campaign 
nothing could be farther from the truth my father was an 
immigrant laporta said he insisted the measure was designed to 
spur immigrants to learn the language and the ways of the united 
states 
lulac and other hispanic groups oppose the florida and us 
english campaigns because they believed they have racist elements 
if enough signatures are verified the proposed referendum would 
be submitted to the state supreme court for review of its wording 
the referendum would ask voters to designate english as the 
official language but would leave it up the state legislature to 
decide what if any government practices would be changed 
proponent of the referendum for example would like to see the 
government increase funds for englishlanguage education

a south african diplomat cited for 
simple assault after his car struck a protester and a police 
officer said tuesday that he was sorry about the incident 
south african vice consul duke kent brown said during an 
interview with radio station wjoywqcr that he did not expect the 
group of antiapartheid protesters to block his exit from a parking 
lot near the radio station monday 
its unfortunate that whole situation arose he said 
brown was charged with simple assault released on his own 
recognizance and ordered to appear in court in april in connection 
with the incident 
the state department said brown had consular rather than 
diplomatic immunity meaning he was not automatically exempt from 
prosecution but he can claim immunity in court as an affirmative 
defense on the grounds that the alleged acts were performed in 
the exercise of his consular function 
about 30 members of the vermont committee on southern africa had 
gathered outside the station to protest browns participation in a 
morning talk show according to wjoywqcr news director jim condon 
brown said he had expected the protest to continue but that i 
would ignore them as i would leave 
some of the protesters were on the hood of the car when it 
accelerated condon said 
brown said he did not see the police officer todd shepard who 
suffered bruises on his leg i was very surprised to hear that a 
policeman had been injured and i did apologize to him when i saw 
him brown said 
brown said he was glad to hear that protester laurie larson of 
richmond was not badly injured larson suffered minor bruises

joe redington stole the lead of the 
1150mile iditarod trail sled dog race on tuesday as he and herbie 
nayokpuk sailed past other mushers who had packed down a smooth 
fast trail for them 
redington a wasilla resident who is a founder of the 
16yearold race and nayokpuk of shishmaref took their mandatory 
24hour layovers on sunday the race leaders passed them by only 
to get bogged down in freshly fallen snow as they crossed the 
alaska range 
the leading mushers then took their mandatory layovers at rohn 
271 miles from the races start in anchorage they watched 
helplessly as redington and nayokpuk and less than two hours 
later joe garnie of teller powered past them 
i kind of have this feeling in the back of my mind that were 
going to see two eskimos garnie and nayokpuk blazing across 
this state said jerry austin one of the mushers taking a 
layover at rohn 
joe runyan of nenana was the first musher to leave rohn at 
1030 pm monday but he has not declared his 24hour layover and 
so is behind redington who left rohn at 720 am tuesday 
nayokpuk left rohn two minutes behind redington garnie left at 9 
am 
still at rohn in the order in which they arrived were jan 
masek of anchorage lavon barve of wasilla defending champion 
susan butcher of manley jacques philip of thomery france austin 
of st michael tim moerlein of kasilof and in 11th place 
twotime iditarod champion rick swenson 
from rohn the teams descend from the heights of the alaska 
range into the timbered interior of the state for the longest 
stretch between checkpoints in the race mushers must contend with 
a bleak and treacherous area known as farewell burn before reaching 
the next checkpoint 93 miles away at nikolai 
the race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed 
diphtheria serum to nome during an outbreak of the disease the top 
20 mushers will split a purse of 150000 the winner will get 
30000

tuesday while vice president george bush held off a late surge by 
kansas sen bob dole in the republican race

nc 
polls published over the weekend showed dole who trailed by as 
much as 15 percentage points two weeks ago had pulled even with 
bush a survey by the charlotte observer showed both with 38 
percent

support of the leaders of the national congressional club sen

terry sanford former gov jim hunt and dozens of state legislators 
and local officeholders gore was in fourth place in a poll

rod matthews killed his attorney says 
because a prescription drug he took for school stoked the fires of 
madness in his adolescent mind 
in an ironic twist matthews victim 14yearold shaun 
ouillette also took the drug ritalin for years using it his 
mother says to cool the frantic behavior that plagued his 
childhood 
it calmed him down enough so we could help him said jeanne 
quinn the victims mother i was so proud that he could learn to 
manage his life 
matthews 15 is being tried as an adult on murder charges in 
the nov 20 1986 slaying of ouillette he has pleaded innocent by 
reason of insanity 
the defense has not disputed testimony that matthews planned the 
killing for a month lured his victim to a secluded woods then 
stalked him from behind hitting him repeatedly with a baseball bat 
his friends have testified he told them of his plans then 
showed them the body on two separate occasions one quoted matthews 
as saying he killed ouillette because he wanted to know what it 
was like to kill somebody 
police testified how matthews calmly lied to them about 
ouillette for the three weeks the boys body lay in the snowy woods 
the case is expected to go to the jury wednesday 
in testimony last week matthews mother janice said her sons 
behavior had become a problem in the third grade and that he was 
placed on ritalin after a brief visit to his pediatrican 
she cried as she told of the doctors decision to prescribe the 
drug a stimulant long used to calm hyperactive children and those 
with attention problems 
the boys doctor theodore goodman testified that he relied 
only on what mrs matthews told him there was no testing and no 
followup on the drugs effects 
on monday psychiatrist bernard yudowitz testified that if a 
child with mental illness is misdiagnosed and given ritalin 
impulsivity and abnormal behavior increase and their ability to 
act appropriately in a given setting decreases 
in my experience if the child has an underlying mental 
problem ritalin may not help and it may hurt he said 
last week norman bernstein a harvardbased child psychologist 
said matthews had within him a world of angry fearful 
destructive thoughts 
matthews attorney john philip white said ritalin contributed 
to the boys homicidal intent 
in this case is the insidious element of mental illness with 
the overlying thread of ritalin white told the jury 
but on tuesday marcel kinsbourne chief of behavioral neurology 
at the eunice shriver center in waltham said the drug could not be 
considered a factor in the killing 
norfolk county assistant district attorney peter casey asked 
kinsbourne if the drug would have an enhancing effect on 
matthews planning execution and coverup of the slaying 
absolutely none whatever he said 
mrs quinn who listened from her front row seat agreed 
i dont believe it killed my son she said i suppose if i 
were his parent i would be looking for any way to explain what 
happened but ritalin doesnt answer it for me 
mrs quinn said her son took ritalin from age 7 through 11 to 
help calm his hyperactivity the boy also received therapy she 
said 
in the end she said it worked the boy was weaned from the 
drug and shaun even told his mother he wanted to become a youth 
counselor 
a lot of the kids he saw in group therapy were messed up 
kids she said he wanted to help and now its all gone what a 
waste

democrats offering 77 delegates to their convention in atlanta in 
july 
one of the states bestknown democrats former president jimmy 
carter withheld his endorsement but another sen sam nunn 
disclosed that he cast an absentee ballot for gore because his 
views come closest to my own views as to the steps our nation 
must take to meet our challenges at home and abroad 
gop officials conceded bushs association with reagan and his 
organization gave him the edge but robertson displayed 
organizational strength in some precinct meetings last month 
jackson pulled off a surprise in 1984 winning southeastern 
georgias 1st congressional district which includes savannah 
jacksons strong showing then was credited to a low democratic 
turnout combined with success in getting his supporters to the 
polls 
dukakis made several other visits to the state including stops 
in atlanta on the day he announced his candidacy and the day after 
his victory in the new hampshire primary 
on sunday dukakis stopped in for a halfhour visit with the 
former president who has met with all the other candidates at 
various times 
i think theres a great deal of compatibility between my basic 
attitude towards government and that of governor dukakis carter 
said afterwards 
to encourage participation in the primary state officials 
included a referendum on broadening the eligibility for exemptions 
for the elderly from some property and school taxes

the week before mikhail gorbachev arrived in 
the united states for the december arms summit president reagan 
granted a rare interview to the four major networks anchors 
thats right four peter jennings of abc dan rather of cbs 
tom brokaw of nbc and bernard shaw washington anchor for cnn 
although he had already interviewed reagan in october shaw 
agreed that the primetime news special in which he questioned 
reagan along with the three other anchors was a highprofile symbol 
of cnns hardearned respectability 
that conversation the week before the summit was a turning 
point i suppose you would have to say said shaw in an interview 
at his anchor desk at the cnn bureau i went back and asked 
white house chief of staff howard baker about that and he said 
we regard you as the fourth network and thats why we included 
you in the interview 
the reagan interview turned a lot of unsought attention on the 
lowkey shaw a former correspondent for abc cbs and westinghouse 
broadcasting who recalls idolizing edward r murrow as a child in 
chicago and at 13 declaring i want to be a cbs news 
correspondent 
after stints with westinghouse and cbs then covering latin 
america for abc shaw joined cnn in 1980 he wanted to be an 
anchor and there was no room at the inn at abc a lot of other 
talented people standing in line plus he was encouraged to join 
the thenfledgling 24hour news network by friends daniel schorr 
and george watson the washington bureau chief 
the next year john hinckley shot president reagan outside a 
washington hotel where reagan had just delivered a speech 
shaw had finished his news update summarizing the speech and 
switched back to cnn headquarters in atlanta when a staffer told 
him someone had fired shots at the presidents motorcade 
i screamed to the control room to tell atlanta to come back to 
us right away shaw said shaw filled viewers in with the sketchy 
information he had then switched back to atlanta but reese 
schoenfield then president of cnn ordered atlanta to go back to 
washington and stay there 
and they did and there we were said shaw he was on the 
air for 10 hours 
i was pretty conscious that day of my demeanor tone of voice 
and facial expressions he said because that camera magnifies 
everything and i was determined to be as lowkey as possible as 
factual as possible and as dispassionate as possible a story like 
that requires no heat 
lowkey is the operative word in describing shaws style he 
considers the celebrity aspects of his job corruptive and 
prefers to spend his free time with his wife linda and their two 
children besides doing better in his job at cnn shaw 47 
says his only ambition is to write books fiction and nonfiction 
hes a perfectionist who constantly worries about improving his 
performance and the networks he said that when he left the air 
after the iowa and new hampshire primaries he lay awake for hours 
replaying in my head what we did what we did right what we did 
wrong what i could have done better 
he does his homework every time and worries over it like its 
his first time and calls afterwards to be critiqued on it said 
cnn executive vice president ed turner i dont know anybody as 
good as he is in my 30 years in the business at his specialty 
which was a job once done brilliantly by walter cronkite before 
him by robert trout people who can sit with a breaking story for 
hours on end and never lose the various threads that you have to 
keep hold of 
if its grueling to be on the air for hours on end its also 
fulfilling 
while his colleagues at the other networks struggle to get even 
an hour or two of primetime coverage for the primaries shaw who 
anchors cnns political coverage gets the whole night 
there was a magical moment or hour between 9 and 10 oclock 
in manchester nh he recalled and it seemed like every 
candidate was coming down to the ballroom to make statements and 
it just looked like a visual ballet where we went from kemp to 
gephardt to bush to dole or what have you and i looked up on the 
monitors and we were the only ones on the air and i felt good

super tuesday might have resolved a few 
political questions but it has left the same old economic problems 
to be dealt with or dodged 
biggest of these is the persistence of federal budget deficits 
in defiance of the candidates who one and all declare it 
unconscionable that uncle sam should spend more than he receives 
everyone knows what has to be done to balance the budget but 
thats easy the difficulty is in the accomplishment and it is in 
that area says the tax foundation that the candidates have proved 
artful dodgers 
declaring its astonishment at the wishful thinking that serves 
candidates in lieu of realistic tax and spending proposals the 
foundations shadow committee on the federal budget expresses 
despair 
it suggests that the wishful escapist thinking being 
expressed by the candidates might be setting the stage for even 
more deficits to come perhaps even into the 21st century 
to avoid the deficit issue the group says is to avoid not just 
the issue of the budget itself but of many challenges included in 
it such as defense space exploration education research the 
role of government and dozens more 
avoid the issue of the budget and you avoid the issues that one 
would expect to be discussed in a presidential election year 
what especially irritates the committee is that candidates have 
been churning out optimistic deficit projections that even a slight 
underperformance by the economy might subvert in other words 
committing the same old crime 
with the structural deficit hovering around the 150 billion 
mark it will not take much of a shortfall in economic performance 
to push the deficit to new record levels it says 
it is such evasion that created the deficits in the first place 
and it was the continuation of such thinking more so than poor 
economic performance that perpetuated them 
by avoiding the issues americans became accustomed to the 
notion that somehow it was possible to have their cake and eat 
it too or as president lyndon johnson put it the nation could 
simultaneously have guns and butter 
the latest evasion of the deficit issue was given almost 
official approval with the creation of an economic commission to 
recommend taxes and spending cuts designed to reduce the deficit 
but its report wont come out until fall 
once again the harsh reality was pushed off into the future 
allowing the candidates to discourse on more optimistic 
possibilities but says the foundation thats dreaming 
to begin with the committees march report states there is 
little room for further cuts in defense spending paring of grants 
to states and localities and reductions in the operating budgets of 
federal agencies 
it points out that mandated payments for individuals together 
with interest charges now comprise more than 60 percent of total 
outlays and those payments and interest charges are likely to 
increase in years ahead 
these huge payments are also for existing needs but there is a 
future to consider too and the future always an unknown is 
likely to present more possibilities for spending and therefore 
more financial challenges 
in the past and it appears in the present too those 
challenges have not been met and now they are being evaded by the 
very folks who want you to believe that it is they who should lead 
the nation into the future

poland has many crushing problems 
burgeoning foreign debt political dissension inadequate social 
services but the one that rankles poles the most is the telephone 
system 
there arent enough telephones to go around but people who do 
have them find that if the phones themselves work the system 
doesnt 
one man said he dialed his office in warsaw three times in 
succession and each time reached a different number 
at a community newspaper a reporter picked up the offices only 
phone and got a dial tone 
you are looking at a miracle he said holding up the 
receiver it works 
a westerner living in warsaw said her phone stopped working when 
workmen started digging in her neighborhood she was told she would 
have to wait a month to have service restored 
but the main thing is trying to get a telephone in the first 
place 
more than 2 million applications for telephones are pending in 
poland and the list is growing faster than phones are being made 
and installed the average waiting period is 13 years but some 
have been waiting 20 years or more 
like other areas of our economy the situation is not 
satisfactory at the moment said roman gebka director of the 
telecommunications service for the state telephone and telegraph 
company 
the basic problems now are a lack of equipment a lack of 
cables and a lack of work force 
poland has just 26 million telephone subscribers in its 
population of 375 million about 7 subscribers for each 100 
people subtract phones in offices and other public places and 
that comes to just 18 million private phone customers 
altogether poland has 11 actual telephone sets for every 100 
people the united states has 79 sweden 85 and great britain and 
west germany 51 each 
in the countryside the problem is particularly acute for 148 
million poles in rural areas there are just 285000 telephone 
subscriptions and about 7000 villages have no phones at all 
but even people lucky enough to get phones have problems 
broken connections buzzing or rattling noises on the line 
mysterious misdirection of phone calls 
not having a telephones is a fact of life in ursynow a 
sprawling planned community of apartment blocks on the outskirts of 
warsaw for its 135000 people it has 4000 private telephones and 
102 pay phones that often dont work the commmunity eagerly awaits 
a central switching station that will allow 10000 more phones 
many poles do their telephoning while on the job using the 
company phones they also can try one of the nations 85000 pay 
phones some of which work 
hotel operators restaurateurs and even private householders are 
usually willing to let others use their phones for free or 
sometimes for a small fee 
the cost of the lack of phones for polands economy is very high 
and the prospects for any improvement soon are dim gebka said in 
an interview in his office at the state telephone company in 
warsaw he cited a soviet study that said one ruble invested in 
telephones led to three rubles in increased income 
gebka said the ideal would be 20 million telephones in poland by 
the year 2000 or one for each of each of the 16 million to 17 
million families expected by then and the remainder for government 
and business 
but he added that short of a miracle poland would not come near 
that goal using all its currently available resources poland can 
manage to install only about 150000 phones a year 
polish industry is as it is he said it produces as much 
as we are able to in this country everything that the industry 
produces is being installed there are no reserves 
to step up production of telephone equipment and cable he said 
poland must build new factories 
factories take five or six years to build and putting in 
additional telephone exchange stations takes about three more 
years so it will take nearly a decade before poland can begin to 
speed up installations gebka said 
he also blamed part of the equipment shortage on the usled 
trade embargo that bans hightechnology sales to the east bloc 
polands international calling capabilities are particularly 
hampered by the embargo he said 
the warsaw telephone exchange which can handle up to 20000 
subscribers is a long twostory building about the size of an 
average elementary school in the united states if poland had 
equipment using western microprocessors the whole operation could 
fit into a single room said janusz cienecki the engineer in 
charge of the center 
besides lacking the most sophisticated equipment he said the 
staterun telephone system has difficulty attracting qualified 
technicians because the starting pay is just 26000 zlotys 69 a 
month 
a government report in february said more than 60 percent of the 
urban telephone systems are outdated and need modernization 
communications minister antoni rajkiewicz has set a goal of 
adding 12 million new telephones in poland by 2010 but says it all 
hinges on increasing production capabilities of telephone equipment 
in the meantime most poles just wait

what shim minsop is doing now 
conceivably could have landed him in jail not so long ago hes 
drawing cartoons that poke gentle fun at south korean political 
leaders 
and people are getting a laugh out of them without worrying 
that something could happen to them as well 
shims cartoons seem tame by most standards politicians and 
political parties are parodied as rival baseball teams and the 
jibes are never too strong nevertheless shim says it is a 
remarkable change 
in the past it was a taboo to caricature the big political 
names in this country he said 
ridiculing the president or making jokes about him for example 
were seen as antistate acts 
shim and other cartoonists have been able to take advantage of 
recent political liberalization in south korea to start injecting a 
little laughter and ridicule into politics 
the cartoonists contend that political caricature is healthy and 
korean politics can benefit from it 
cartoons and caricatures will bring the political leaders 
closer to the people shim maintained 
political cartoons have proliferated in newspapers and magazines 
and command large enthusiastic audiences eager for a regular flow 
of material ranging from traditional editorial cartoons to long 
stories literacy is very high in south korea but people prize 
cartoons for their humor 
newspaper cartoons so far are lowkey and ironic some recent 
ones showed caricatures of the main political parties chasing each 
other in an unending circle to symbolize ineffectiveness another 
showed top leaders as squabbling babies 
a favorite of cartoonists is to have bemused koreans staring at 
politicians battling for power and asking what is happening to the 
country 
it is refreshing to see the taboos broken about the myths 
surrounding the political bigwigs said han kyesu a political 
analyst who has followed the growth of political cartooning 
many cartoonists say they have always seen their work as a way 
of calling for reform and liberalization 
korean cartoonists have been struggling for political change 
for a long time shim said 
cartoons are a valuable teaching tool that can vividly explain 
the meaning of an issue as well as amuse readers shim added 
the political cartoonist can present the issues in a more 
amusing but understandable manner to the public 
the newly installed president roh taewoo who pledged freedom 
of speech and expression after years of authoritarian rule 
personally encouraged cartoonists to take up political subjects by 
saying he did not mind being caricatured 
shim and other cartoonists say their work is still very gentle 
and restrained for fear of angering authorities and losing what 
freedom they have but they say they expect to make their humor 
more biting as time goes on and liberalization expands 
cartoonists are also restrained by fear of offending a 
politicians supporters shim said koreas factional politics 
stress loyalty and supporters tend to resent any joke at their 
leaders expense he said 
the reaction can be terrible from the supporters shim said 
people should learn to accept both positive and negative 
antigovernment students and dissident groups which have long 
used cartoons in their political literature also are making 
greater use of caricatures but usually not in a humorous way 
the cartoons distributed at antigovernment rallies and meetings 
are biting and bitter government and mainline opposition 
politicians are depicted as vicious tyrants suppressing the people 
with tear gas and clubs some are more subtle depicting the 
divided opposition leaders as crying infants quarreling over a toy 
they are not jokes said one dissident they show the 
people the reality of the government and why there is no democracy 
in south korea 
antigovernment cartoons are distributed in pamphlets on college 
campuses or posted on trees and sidewalks at antigovernment 
rallies 
the united states represented by a fiendishlooking uncle sam 
or a swaggering and bullying american soldier is a fixture in the 
underground cartoons dissidents claim the countrys successive 
authoritarian governments have survived because of us backing 
one recent cartoon showed a toughlooking statue of liberty with 
a boxing glove on her upraised hand 
shim and other cartoonists reject their underground competition 
and the radical politics behind it they say change must be 
moderate 
its too early to expose politicians to a more revealing 
fashion shim said

thirtytwo years ago roger vadim made the 
littleknown brigitte bardot an international star with a movie 
called and god created woman in 1988 the french director 
hopes to do the same with rebeccca demornay 
not that the californiaborn europeaneducated actress is 
unknown she made a sensational film debut as the hooker who helped 
tom cruise conduct his risky business roles in testament 
runaway train the trip to bountiful and other films have 
also been well reviewed 
and god created woman provides her best role yet and if you 
want to stay on her good side dont suggest a comparison to how 
bardot played the role of a teenage girl who was fatally attracted 
to men 
theres really no relation between the two pictures she 
insists they have the same title and the same director but 
really the title was used to get the film financed and really has 
no relation to the story or the characters 
its more a variation on the same theme than a remake said 
vadim what happened to a young girl at st tropez in the south 
of france in 1956 cant really happen today in santa fe nm 
vadim who masterminded the careers of bardot catherine deneuve 
and jane fonda and married bardot and fonda was limited in his 
choice of a star for and god created woman because the 
producers vestron didnt want to go with an unknown 
comparing her role to bardots was like comparing apples and 
oranges demornay said she outlined her own version of the 
character she played robin is very mischievous also naive and 
therefore funny a lot of the time what attracted me to her was her 
strong streak of independent feminism it might be disguised in her 
antics but she really is a womans woman 
about vadim he is great to work with very perceptive very 
sensitive to me as a woman and as an actress and the protagonist 
in this film it seemed very easy for him to identify with a woman 
which is not easy for male directors hes very laidback and 
created an aura of relaxation on the set 
the first and god created woman raised a furor among 
censors the title was changed in italy because the authorities 
didnt want god associated with such a film vadim recalled 
he still wonders what all the fuss was about there was no 
nudity bardot was naked only once and was covered by a sheet i 
think the censors were infuriated because she played a woman who 
had no guilt about her sexuality 
the 1988 version goes further with nudity and sex though vadim 
insists he strove for a romantic feeling to the bedroom scenes and 
eroticism presents no problem for demornay 
ive done two women so far whose sexuality was part of the 
character she said robin in and god created woman was one 
of them the other risky business its delightful to me if i 
can trust the sensibilities of the director which i did and if 
the scenes further the plot and illustrate facets of the 
character 
are such scenes nervousmaking on the set 
not to me she said its as natural as anything else i 
dont see this wall ill do anything as an actress but i wont 
express sexuality why not 
the blond beauty was born in santa rosa calif 25 years ago 
but spent her childhood abroad her parents divorced and her father 
is tv personality wally george 
my stepfather died and this made my mother restless she 
said she started to travel with both me and my brother she was 
a very freespirited bohemiantype woman who thought a good 
education could be had by traveling and learning about new 
countries and cultures 
so i lived in england for five years in the austrian alps for 
seven years and in a lot of other countries in between for smaller 
amounts of time 
returning to california in 1981 the actress enrolled at the lee 
strasberg theater institute found an agent and won the risky 
business role over 800 applicants 
surprisingly the film didnt get her typed i was lucky most 
people seemed to view me as an actress playing the part of a call 
girl i wasnt offered a lot of prostitute roles i was able to 
play a young mother in testament with jane alexander then the 
trip to bountiful with geraldine page then a scruffy tomboyish 
train mechanic in runaway train so ive had good opportunities 
whats next shes brushing up on her shakespeare

a flutist with rubber lips metal fingertips and 
not much else by way of physique is the latest graduate of the 
mcandroids laboratory in south london 
being a robot and brandnew it doesnt have a name yet but its 
first public recitals will be given in september when it goes on 
display at taiwans new national museum of natural science 
the flutist was born in the same cluttered workshop as tin twin 
the guest keyboard player who thrilled teenage fans of the 
thompson twins a british pop group on its 1986 world tour 
like tin twin the flutist is a robotized musician developed 
by mcandroids ltd a special effects and 3d animation team 
composed of two sculptors a mechanical engineer and a computer 
artist 
mcandroids art and technology creations have been on display 
since 1984 in museums traveling exhibitions and on tv shows across 
western europe 
the flutist is going to taichung in taiwan along with a 
collection of musical instruments that visitors will be able to 
play without touching set inside glass cases the flute organ 
tubular bells 16string chinese zither and drum kit are activated 
by pressing buttons 
its very much a handson discover for yourself exhibit 
said sculptor richard glassborow on one level its 
entertainment on another level its seriously stimulating 
the push buttons give spontaneous but precise control of the 
robotics that work the instruments they can pluck out individual 
notes or create pulsating effects such as vibrato tremolo or echo 
musical phrases such as a bass line can be instantly recorded 
and the playback accompanied by improvisation the instruments also 
can be commanded to play a simple preprogrammed tune 
it was a choice to make it simple said glassborow if you 
make it very rich they the public just stand and look at it we 
wanted to make it very friendly 
the flutes robotics are the most impressive employing the head 
and pneumatically controlled fingers of a humanoid robot or 
android a valve controls the air that is pumped through the 
delicately positioned rubber mouthpiece into the lip plate 
the instruments took three months to build and were sold to the 
designers of the museums soundproof cacophony section for 
nearly 87000 
they demonstrate an individuals musical inventiveness and allow 
those without any musical skills to play music according to 
glassborow 
tin twin is a more readily recognizable android with long arms 
that flit across the keyboard in simulating such smash hits of the 
thompson twins as doctor doctor and sister of mercy 
from a distance the flashing lights in its eyes and outh give 
the impression that it is singing along in the chorus 
mcandroids is made up of the 39yearold glassborow alan dun a 
37yearold sculptor engineer john barron 34 and trevor piper a 
32yearold artist the company has found a niche in a fastgrowing 
european market for special effects 
in 1986 its three robotic french heads composed of 
oddshaped pieces of steel and glass fiber on top of tall poles 
turned real heads at a robot sculpture display in the georges 
pompidou center in paris 
vaguely resembling outerspace creatures they turn to watch 
passersby stop and stare back or babble among themselves in 
jolly jingles a museum in glasgow scotland is negotiating for 
display rights 
another favorite is a set of nine jackinthebox irish 
caricatures including a priest a bar wag and a politician who 
pop up at the push of a button to give speeches on the environment 
it was bought for an exhibition center in northern irelands 
sperrin mountains 
the company plans to build an android orchestra a robotized 
skeleton riding a bicycle and a mechanical plant that will respond 
to temperature light and human activity such as people quarreling 
anyone catching sight of the plant would say i know what 
its thinking said glassborow this kind of work is a kind of 
mirror to human behavior

at the age of 19 reggae artist ziggy marley has 
seen enough of the world to know he wants to change it 
i am not blind marley says even in jamaica injustice 
happened it happened all over the world it means something all 
over the world 
on the melody makers new album conscious party marley 
sings of oppression bigotry and hope for a better world 
for anyone who follows reggae music marleys political 
consciousness should come as no surprise the late bob marley 
ziggys father was reggaes most celebrated artist and famous for 
such protest songs as get up stand up and i shot the 
sheriff 
but while acknowledging the legacy of his father ziggy marley 
is determined to establish his own identity i want to be 
fulfilled myself rather than try to follow exactly in my fathers 
footsteps 
marley was born on october 17 1968 in trenchtown an 
impoverished section of kingston in jamaica when he was 11 he 
formed the melody makers along with his brother stevie and 
sisters cedella and sharon 
the melody makers first song children playing in the 
streets was written by their father in 1985 they released 
their first album play the game right which received a grammy 
nomination for best reggae record in 1986 they released the album 
hey world 
were brothers and sisters marley said doing music was 
part of being a family 
hey world contained such overtly political songs as the 
antiapartheid 666 and on the new album he continues to 
confront injustice with songs such as tomorrow people the 
first single to be released 
tomorrow people think of your past he sings attacking 
those who think only of the future and their indifference to 
humanity 
the original idea was from robots like the movie robocop 
people becoming androids marley said scientists are making 
dangerous things 
although conscious party is only marleys third album he is 
already attracting the attention of some of the music industrys 
most highly acclaimed artists talking heads members chris frantz 
and tina weymouth produced the record and rolling stones guitarist 
keith richards plays on the song lee and molly 
lee and molly is a story about racial bigotry lee is a 
white man who dates molly a black woman and is beaten up by his 
father because of the relationship the song is based on an actual 
couple who went to high school in kingston with cedella marley 
he lees father thought going out with molly set a bad 
example cedella recalled 
ziggy marley identifies strongly with the people of africa on 
tumbling down he uses the symbols of the eagle the bear and 
the lion to warn against the consequences of superpower oppression 
of the third world 
the eagle is the united states and their allies the bear is 
the soviet union because of what theyve done in ethiopia and 
afghanistan marley said the lion is africa bad things are 
done against my people consequences will come down on you 
marley also sings about africa on the ballad dream of home 
home is africa marley said we know thats where we 
originated from we have to get rid of south african president 
pw botha through ourselves our music we fight apartheid 
new love is the albums only love song although its more 
about the spiritual quality of love rather than a particular person 
my love is always new it shouldnt get boring marley said 
love can hurt you like lee and molly but new love is like the 
sun rising like the morning dew 
marley is a rastafarian and religion plays an important role in 
his life and music on a who a sey he attacks those who do not 
share his belief in a higher being

probably the best development affecting the 
nations beleaguered public schools is also among the least 
noticed the growing alliance between educators and the business 
world 
at a time when schools have been barraged by critics in the 
reagan administration and elsewhere along comes burger king 
honeywell metropolitan life and others in the corporate community 
who not only are arguing public educations case but are putting 
considerable money where their mouths are 
a new book american business and the public school case 
studies of corporate involvement in public education teachers 
college press 2495 offers a valuable scholarly dissection of 
this budding relationship between these formerly estranged 
bedfellows and it explodes several myths in the process 
the 278page book was edited by marsha levine an official of 
the american federation of teachers and roberta trachtman 
affiliated with the city university of new york their book argues 
that selfinterest is too simple an explanation for the recent 
upsurge in corporate interest in better schools 
business doesnt get involved in education just because it 
needs skilled workers argues owen b brad butler retired 
chairman of procter amp gamble who wrote a foreward to the book 
most big companies are multinational butler said during a 
recent visit to new york they can find the workers they need 
somewhere the primary interest they have in better schools is that 
the united states is their home base and business cant remain 
healthy unless the united states remains peaceful prosperous and 
democratic 
the book completes a trilogy of studies commissioned by the 
committee for economic development a research organization 
dominated by top business executives which butler chairs the two 
earlier reports investing in our children published in 1985 
and children in need published last september were each 
frontpage blockbusters 
those previous reports which called for such innovations as 
massive new governmental investments in programs to help the 
neediest students forced all who had typecast business executives 
as socially callous archconservatives to reconsider 
the latest book while not as headlinemaking will likely be 
the most enduring of the three and like its predecessors this 
report challenges some widely held notions about the nature of 
businesscorporate partnerships 
it offers for the first time useful detailed case histories of 
businessschool partnerships that work written by insiders a key 
ingredient seems to be a new willingness on the part of business to 
enter such relationships as partners rather than superiors 
metropolitan lifes chairman john creedon is presented as 
having profound respect for education and educators the 
companys involvement in school reform has become renowned through 
among other things an annual survey of teacher attitudes it has 
conducted for the past several years 
whats in it for met life three things according to the book 
its view that it has obligations to the nation as a corporate 
citizen its desire to ensure future employees have needed job 
skills and a belief that wellinformed citizens are better 
insurance risks 
honeywell the minneapolisbased computer firm first became 
interested in education in the 1970s and decided that it had to 
help local school districts develop better curricula 
in seattle for example honeywell employees invited citizens in 
snohomish county wash to figure out ways to prepare students 
for a high technology future in a low technology environment the 
result is a schoolbusiness partnership dubbed link 
burger king meanwhile has developed an awesome array of 
educational programs since 1983 from fastfood management courses 
to scholarship programs and even a curriculum on crime prevention 
the company also honors 100 principals and teachers each year the 
budget for such programs has grown from 15 million in 1983 to 
39 million in 1986 some 3000 workers in 900 restaurants have 
benefitted from the programs 
the longterm benefit we are seeking is a consistent unified 
public perception of burger king as a good corporate citizen 
writes burger kings barbara gothard people come to burger king 
because of quality service and value but they are also influenced 
by their perception of how good is the company backing the 
product 
seven or eight years ago it was difficult to imagine that 
this would occur that business and education would become so 
interested in each other said c michael timpane president of 
columbia teachers college now business isnt just looking at 
narrow job skills they realize two things that people change 
jobs and jobs themselves change 
when educators looked at that they thought that this was very 
congenial business was asking us to do what we wanted to do all 
along only better for anyone interested in understanding one 
of the most heartening developments of the 1980s this book is an 
excellent place to start

couple and the courtship of eddies father 
harrison the exbeatle recruited him for the historic 1971 
concert and movie concert for bangla desh he was part of the 
famous mad dogs and englishmen concert tour in 1970 that 
propelled joe cocker to star status 
the public may not have heard of jim horn but in recording 
circles in the united states and europe hes a versatile 
instrumentalist 
ive been around awhile and ive been able to do some 
things he says modestly about his 25year music career and a 
resume bulging with achievements

piccolo and recorder over the years hes played a multitude of 
other instruments while being associated with many of the top names 
in show business 
he can be heard playing his horn on harrisons latest hit lp 
cloud nine 
his harrisons singing sounded better than ever horn said 
in an interview before a recording session with country star hank 
williams jr and when he plays you know its him that slide 
guitar 
horn worked with another former beatle paul mccartney a year 
ago when mccartney helped produce an album by guitar legend duane 
eddy 
he mccartney worked with the musicians well he recalled 
everyone knew what to do he was real jovial and funny cracking 
jokes he was fun to work with 
presley too was a free spirit when horn played in the movies 
girls girls girls and roustabout 
he liked to sit around and play horn said hed jam he 
was into karate and hed break wood when the producer and director 
werent around they didnt like him doing that 
sinatra for whom horn played flute on the hit strangers in 
the night was businesslike and a quick worker 
hed rehearse once and then do one take horn recalled he 
made it relaxed he was a real pro 
it was horns piccolo playing on the beach boys hit good 
vibrations 
people like their hawaiian shirts and visualize themselves on 
the sand with a beer in their hand he said the beach boys 
make fun music and they didnt let it die 
horn who lists his age as as old as the beatles was born 
in compton calif and spent most of his life in los angeles

and wanted to be able to do solos i thought they were a whole lot 
of fun 
he said he correctly developed his talent and always worked to 
get better 
i practiced a lot as a kid i learned the proper way to play 
then listened to albums especially the sax solos and played along 
with them it gave me insight i concentrated on my ear 
even today hes constantly updating his style and listening to 
music for trends 
i hear songs on the radio and then i may change my style a 
little horn said but i have the same conviction some 
musicians are lazy they wont buy new equipment you have to 
change with the times its easier to relate to music that way i 
listen to pop and rock on the radio a lot and switch back and 
forth 
he owns seven saxes four flutes and five recorders his most 
expensive instrument is a 4000 baritone sax 
despite his success some instruments have given him trouble he 
played the oboe and english horn for records by the carpenters but 
later gave them up 
they were too demanding he said you had to make your own 
double reeds it was too time consuming 
and he cant master the harmonica which even school kids can 
play with little training 
im trying he admitted i cant get the hang of it im

born to be bad rounder george thorogood and the 
destroyers 
 
albums are really superfluous for george thorogood and the 
destroyers this is a bar band and a very good one whose music is 
best heard in a sweaty bar instead of a living room 
but commerce calls thorogood must fulfill a record contract 
and born to be bad is the latest product 
if born to be bad sounds a little familiar it should it 
comes six years after bad to the bone whats next born to 
be bone or born in the badlands how about just plain 
bad maybe thats too familiar 
there arent many things that distinguish born to be bad 
from any other george thorogood album since his 1977 debut the 
bands sound has become fuller over the years with the addition of 
a saxophone player and a rhythm guitarist but the content is 
largely the same 
born to be bad has the obligatory chuck berry tune you 
cant catch me the traditional sinister guy song title track 
the dance floor stomper shake your money maker paens to the 
fairer sex i really like girls and some blues to highlight 
thorogoods mean guitar 
familiarity doesnt have to breed contempt the production is 
crisp and the playing inspired so most of side 1 genuinely cooks 
side 2 flags considerably because of the repetition and one slow 
blues song too many 
do yourself a favor save the money you may be inclined to spend 
on born to be bad until the destroyers happen to come to town 
you shouldnt have to wait too long although they may not 
duplicate their 1981 feat of playing in 50 states in 50 days buy a 
ticket to the concert grab a dance partner and have fun

if my heart had windows mca patty loveless 
 
patty loveless new album consists of 10 songs and the writing 
credit is different on each but loveless singing and the 
production of emory gordy jr and tony brown make the album into a 
cohesive set thats as country as grits 
if my heart had windows includes a honkytonk waltz the 
title cut by dallas frazier country swing hank williams i 
cant get you off of my mind and plenty of ballads 
loveless fullthroated alto really hits its stride on side 2 
climaxing on john and johanna halls fly away which lives up 
to its name with a soaring chorus reminiscent of the halls defunct 
pop group orleans 
the arrangements built around the solid rhythm section of 
leland sklar and eddie bayers include such nice touches as a steel 
and fiddle playing in unison on the break of i cant get you off 
of my mind the material occasionally sags but most of the album 
contains strong and honest performances

stand and deliver is a kind of thinking mans rocky 
melodramatic full of streetlevel emotion with a knockout of an 
ending that may even convince you that good can occasionally 
triumph against implausible odds 
but whats so special about this movie is that the knockout is 
scored not with fists but with the power of young minds 
it is an inner city classroom drama based on true events at 
garfield high school in the east los angeles barrio a failing 
school so tough it faced losing its accreditation in 1982 
into this mess strides jaime escalante edward james olmos a 
computer specialist who has dropped out of the business world to be 
a teacher his first surprise is that the school has no computers 
he is assigned to a math class 
olmos whose previous credits include zoot suit and an emmy 
awardwinning role as lt castillo on the tv series miami vice 
is quietly charismatic as a teacher capable of sparring with and 
inspiring a class of tough hispanic youngsters the sort of kids 
current fashion holds should be ranted at with bullhorns or 
expelled 
lou diamond phillips appealing though a bit goodygoody as the 
late rock sensation richie valens in la bamba gives a more 
complex performance this time around as a wonderfully understated 
angel a street gang member finally won over by his dedicated 
teacher 
thanks largely to the crisp direction of ramon menendez who 
also cowrote the screenplay with producer tom musca it is 
refreshing to see streetwise underprivileged children presented as 
something other than onedimensional unreachable monsters 
escalante wins over angel and the others with tough humor and 
personal contact when they taunt him he aims his retorts back 
with devastating accuracy 
tough guys dont do math they fry chicken for a living he 
tells one macho student 
and he relates lessons to his students ethnic heritage it 
was your ancestors the mayans who first contemplated the concept 
zero you have math in your blood 
then he gets a crazy idea hes going to teach these kids 
calculus if they can pass the advanced placement calculus test 
that would be an almost guaranteed ticket to college and 
scholarships 
what follows is an alltooauthentic portrayal of how a single 
dedicated teacher is alone in believing that his students can make 
it he must face down skeptical parents fellow teachers even 
investigators from the educational testing service in princeton 
nj 
in the end the students do succeed but only after a bitter and 
racist battle with test officials who simply cant accept that 
barrio kids could perform so well the school rises from disgrace 
to national prominence 
the dedicatedteacherconquerstoughkids plot is not new to 
hollywood glenn ford faced down student sidney poitier in the 
blackboard jungle in 1955 and poitier reversed roles as the 
dedicated teacher in to sir with love in 1967 
stand and deliver far exceeds those films in authenticity

new reports indicate consumers have increased their borrowing 
pace and have regained nearly all the confidence they lost as a 
result of the october stock market crash 
two other reports on the employment outlook came to seemingly 
conflicting conclusions with the conference board reporting 
indications of lessening demand for workers and manpower inc a 
temporary employment concern projecting strong hiring this spring 
in the consumer credit report the federal reserve said 
americans took out 542 billion more in installment debt than they 
paid off in january the biggest monthly increase in four months 
and the second strong month in a row 
the fed said consumer credit grew at a seasonally adjusted rate 
of 106 percent in january compared to a 79 percent annual rate in 
december and a 59 percent rate for all of 1987 
consumer credit is regarded as a reflection of trends in 
consumer spending which accounts for about twothirds of us 
economic growth 
consumers apparently are willing to borrow because unemployment 
was down it hit a nineyear low of 57 percent in february and 
consumer confidence is rebounding according to david cross an 
economist with the futures group a washington consulting firm 
the conference board in issuing its monthly consumer confidence 
index said consumers have been heartened by continuing strength in 
the economy 
but the private business research organization said consumers 
also may be feeling more optimistic because their paychecks are 
larger because of tax cuts that took effect jan 1 
the consumer confidence index was 1139 points in february up 
from januarys 1099 points and 1008 in november after the crash 
the index which uses a 1985 base of 100 stood at 1151 in 
october before the oct 19 stock collapse 
the conference boards help wanted index painted a somewhat 
pessimistic picture of the employment outlook the index which 
reflects the amount of help wanted ads in 51 major newspapers 
across the nation declined to 153 in january from 155 in december 
the index which uses a 1967 base of 100 reflects changes in 
demand for labor and general business conditions 
kenneth goldstein a conference board economist said the drop 
in the index signaled a slowdown in hiring plans by employers

companies will bolster hiring this spring

crude oil futures have retreated in response to 
renewed fears of opec price discounting 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for april 
delivery of west texas intermediate crude oil settled at 1537 per

1559 
among refined products the april contract for wholesale no 2 
heating oil slid 013 cent to 4341 cents wholesale unleaded 
gasoline fell 057 cent to 4394 cents a gallon 
i think the catalyst behind todays decline is additional 
rumors about opec individual nations offering discounts to 
customers said william byers an oil analyst with bear stearns 
amp co 
byers said the rumors of price discounting by members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries partly grew out of 
reports that a delegation from the united arab emirates was 
visiting tokyo this week 
the rumors are really all over the map he said 
reports that opec might push for more production controls helped

a new supreme court ruling regarding when 
companies must disclose merger discussions could lead to fewer 
mergers and hinder corporate competitiveness according to some 
legal experts 
in the same ruling handed down monday the court affirmed for 
the first time a key legal theory strengthening shareholder ability 
to sue a company for fraud approval of the socalled 
fraudonthemarket theory could spawn a wave of new lawsuits by 
disgruntled shareholders lawyers speculated 
the ruling stemmed from a case that attracted enormous attention 
because it raised questions about a companys legal 
responsibilities regarding disclosure of information that could 
affect its stock price including preliminary merger negotiations 
with another company 
the case was considered especially significant because of the 
wave of mergers that have reshaped corporate america over the past 
several years the ability of a companys management to negotiate 
quickly and discreetly before disclosing a merger proposal has 
played a key role in that trend 
from a companys point of view the supreme courts ruling 
certainly is going to make life more difficult said john f 
olson a prominent washington securities lawyer at the firm of 
gibson dunn amp crutcher it will make companies a lot more 
cautious about what they say publicly youre going to see a lot 
more no comments 
advocates of disclosing merger talks including the securities 
and exchange commission argue that such information is vital to 
the efficiency and integrity of the financial markets as reflected 
by a companys stock price 
opponents including many corporate executives argue that 
premature disclosure of merger talks can artificially inflate stock 
prices cause a deal to collapse and alert potentially hostile 
acquirers to a hitherto unknown buyout opportunity 
the supreme courts ruling concerned basic inc a 
clevelandbased concern that merged with another company in 1978 
after its executives denied for months that merger talks were under 
way 
some shareholders who had sold their stock prior to the merger 
sued the company for fraud contending its denials of talks had 
deflated the price if they had known about the talks the 
shareholders argued they wouldnt have sold 
basic executives contended they werent obligated to disclose 
the merger talks until they had reached a fundamental agreement 
the supreme court rejected both sides arguments and ordered a 
separate test for when a company must disclose merger talks that 
test measures the probability of whether a merger will occur and 
must be considered on a casebycase basis the court said 
attorneys said it was difficult to predict the ultimate 
consequences of the courts ruling but agreed it could pose serious 
new problems particularly in defining the probability of a merger 
its vague in the sense it makes life very difficult said 
william golub an attorney for the new york firm of rosenman amp 
colin which represented basic 
at what point does someone decide a merger is probable the 
consequence is you either have to say everything or else you can 
say no comment he said 
if the chief executives of two companies talk about a merger 
on the golf course that doesnt necessarily mean its probable 
but if the issue has to be resolved 10 years later by a jury it 
may decide yes that golfcourse meeting was the point of 
probability golub said 
carl liggio a new york securities lawyer who filed a legal 
brief on behalf of the defendants said the high courts ruling 
could hurt companies and their shareholders 
the problem is that when you put businesses in a fishbowl as 
you do with hindsight standards of materiality and disclosure it 
makes them less competitive liggio said its more difficult 
for them to conduct business 
of possibly more significance some attorneys said was the 
courts endorsement of the fraudonthemarket theory which holds 
that stockholders rely on the the presumed honesty of the market to 
set a fair price 
under this theory stockholders can sue a company for damages by 
proving they bought or sold during a time in which the company gave 
false information or withheld news from the market that would have 
affected its stock price 
although lower courts generally have accepted the theory since 
its inception in the mid1970s this was the first time the high 
court sanctioned its validity 
this is more significant in terms of exposure to litigation 
golub said it just means this type of lawsuit will continue to 
grow

among others appearing before the group was texacos president 
james w kinnear who said takeover talk stirred by the activities 
of icahn and others was hampering the companys efforts to 
restructure itself and prepare for its emergence from chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection 
kinnear said texaco is continuing its efforts to sell 
unprofitable assets and negotiate partnership agreements on other 
properties in addition the company is seeking shortterm loans to 
help pay creditors when it emerges from bankruptcy protection 
which it expects to do in april 
we have found that as we go to these negotiations and go to 
get bank loans the very presence of corporate raiders makes it 
very difficult to get the job done kinnear said the banks are 
terrified the coventure partners are concerned 
icahn said the real problem was that texacos management was 
not sufficiently accountable to its shareholders 
he said he would vote for the reorganization plan because 
thats what the shareholders want but he reiterated his 
dissatisfaction with what he called texacos takeitorleaveit 
plan which shareholders must accept or see the company blown up 
the white plains nybased company filed for bankruptcy court 
protection last april to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous 
bond while appealing a 103 billion judgment held against it by 
pennzoil co 
a houston jury awarded the judgment to pennzoil in 1985 after 
finding texaco interfered with pennzoils 1984 attempt to acquire 
part of getty oil co which texaco later acquired itself 
texacos shareholders have until march 21 to vote on a 
reorganization plan that would bring the company out of bankruptcy 
protection and pay a 3 billion outofcourt settlement with 
pennzoil 
earlier this year icahn failed to win permission from 
bankruptcy court judge howard schwartzberg on a separate plan that 
was basically the same but would have stripped away texacos 
takeover defenses 
icahn later said he would run a slate of five candidates 
including himself when the seats come up for a vote at the next 
texaco annual meeting expected to take place in may 
he has gained the support of another noted takeover strategist 
t boone pickens also has accumulated texaco shares 
icahn said monday he wanted the board seats so he could push his 
efforts to persuade other board members sell the company 
voluntarily 
if you want to see friendly bids youll see plenty if 
hostile i have no idea but if bids start at 55 and if they 
couldnt get that if it couldnt be done in a friendly basis 
ill agree i was wrong and ill withdraw my slate he said 
wilbur ross an adviser to texacos shareholders bankruptcy 
committee who also appeared at the meeting predicted the 
reorganization plan would be approved overwhelmingly 
the mail weve gotten from small investors has been running 
nine or 10 to one in favor he said i dont know of any 
institutions not in favor and the institutions own 40to50 
percent of the stock

potential buyers from italy canada and the 
united states are setting their sights on several corporate 
targets apparently undaunted by merger agreements that the 
managements of those targets have reached with other suitors 
the moves by general electric co italys pirelli societe 
generale sa and canadas campeau corp are somewhat reminiscent of 
texaco incs illfated purchase of getty oil co in 1984 
texaco has been in federal bankruptcy court since last april 
where it sought refuge rather than post a potentially ruinous bond 
of more than 10 billion to appeal a texas courts ruling that it 
illegally had interfered in an agreement by pennzoil co to buy 
part of getty 
in the past you fought tooth and nail up to when the company 
accepted a bid and once a company accepted a bid it was on to the 
next game said daniel schwartz managing director of ulmer 
brothers inc a merchant banking firm that specializes in mergers 
and acquisitions 
but clearly that doesnt seem to be the rule anymore he 
said 
ge and pirelli announced their offers monday while campeau took 
action last week 
the new bidders feel they are on solid legal ground they all 
are appealing directly to shareholders of the target companies 
instead of asking the companies directors to back out of any 
agreements 
texaco got in trouble because getty was privatelyowned so for 
texaco to take it over it had to get the getty directors to back 
out of their deal with pennzoil texaco argues that gettys deal 
with pennzoil was not legally binding but has reached a tentative 
3 billion outofcourt settlement of the dispute 
the new offers include these deals 
pirelli offered 186 billion for firestone tire amp rubber co 
on monday even though firestone agreed last month to combine its 
core tiremaking operations with those of japans bridgestone corp 
in a joint venture pirelli said its offer was contingent on 
firestone calling off its deal with bridgestone 
general electric making what it called its first unsolicited 
takeover bid offered 423 million monday for roper corp even 
though the augusta gabased appliance maker has agreed to be 
acquired by whirlpool corp for 3525 million 
campeau corp the canadian retailing giant is pressing its 
monthslong pursuit of cincinnatibased federated department stores 
inc despite federateds definitive agreement last week to be 
acquired by rh macy amp co for 61 billion campeau has an 
outstanding 618 billion offer 
because of texacos experience lawyers and their clients are 
much more careful to not put themselves in a position where someone 
could claim interference with someone elses agreement said 
klaus eppler a partner in the law firm of proskauer rose goetz amp 
mendelsohn 
by going straight to the shareholders the bidders cannot be 
accused of asking the directors to renege on previous agreements 
eppler said 
the three offers signify that deals actually are not complete 
until a buyers tender offer expires and the acquiring company can 
actually buy the shares 
im somewhat at a loss as to why all of a sudden this type of 
behavior is now acceptable schwartz said 
it used to be when you had a done deal you didnt have people 
coming in with tender offers but youve got three of them right 
here he said 
but although the flurry of such deals may be unusual buyers and 
sellers typically make arrangements for such eventualities for 
example macys agreement to buy federated requires federated to 
pay up 45 million in socalled breakup fees to macy in the 
event their deal falls through under certain circumstances 
such provisions typically are aimed at discouraging other 
bidders from making a play for a company that has agreed to be 
bought out by someone else

a planned managementled buyout of montgomery 
ward amp co will close mobil corps illfated venture into 
retailing while giving the venerable retailer a chance to reap all 
the benefits of its recent successes 
montgomery ward said monday that an investor group led by 
president and chief executive bernard brennan would acquire the 
company from mobil in a 38 billion leveraged buyout 
the group which also includes general electric capital corp 
will pay more than 15 billion in cash for the 115yearold 
chicagobased company and assume 23 billion of its debt 
this is a historic day for montgomery ward brennan told a 
news conference weve gone through an awful lot over the years 
in 1987 we earned 130 million after taxes in 1980 we had 162 
million loss after taxes 
faced with a financial drain from the retailer during the early 
1980s mobil which acquired montgomery ward in 1976 for about 1 
billion has wanted to sell the chain for some time brennan 
credited with turning the retailer around in recent years had been 
negotiating for months to acquire the company 
its a business that we dont know too well said mobil 
chairman allen e murray he also said new yorkbased mobil the 
nations secondlargest oil company believed it would be best to 
concentrate on its core businesses 
murray said in a telephone interview monday that mobil began 
receiving inquiries about montgomery ward last summer but declined 
to identify the other parties interested in buying the retailer 
mobil stock rose 112 to 4475 in new york stock exchange 
trading on monday 
brennan said ge capital a unit of general electric co will 
take over wards creditcard operation 
in a leveraged buyout investors borrow heavily to buy out a 
company and then pay off the debt with the target companys cash 
flow or the sale of its assets 
but brennan said the company has no plans to sell other assets 
or to lay off any employees under the buyout plan which takes 
effect in 60 days 
we see no need at this time to reduce employment for example 
in chicago weve added 300 jobs in the last six months brennan 
said 
this is not a leveraged buyout that says lets shrink the 
company 
during its comeback effort montgomery ward laid off 17000 
employees closed its jefferson ward discount stores and other 
unprofitable branches and shut down the catalog division that 
dated back to the companys early days 
it moved into specialty retailing opening appliance and 
electronics stores and is converting its department stores to 
emphasize specialty formats including electronics home furnishings 
and recreational items 
last month montgomery ward announced it was realigning its 
fieldoffice management to create new specialty retailing positions 
our customers are middle america we dont want to be too 
avant garde and we dont want to be downscale said brennan a 
former executive of chicagobased sears roebuck and co 
consumers have the advantage that we have people running the 
business that owns the business brennan said independence 
gives us much more flexibility 
mobil has not indicated what it would do with the money from the 
sale energy analyst bruce lazier of the investment firm prescott 
ball amp turben said he believed corporate capital investment will 
receive the largest share 
my guess is that that will reduce their shortterm debt and 
that gives them an extra 2 billion of funds available number one 
for reinvestment in capital expenditures if the opportunities arise 
and number two gives them flexibility to increase dividends and 
share repurchase plans lazier said in a telephone interview

gillette co is urging its shareholders to reject 
an attempt by a new yorkbased investment partnership to oust four 
company directors at next months annual meeting 
colman mockler jr gillettes chairman and chief operating 
officer said in a statement mailed monday to shareholders that 
coniston partners intended to sell or dismantle gillette if the 
hostile takeover succeeds 
the principals of coniston group have no experience in 
directing or running a worldwide manufacturing or consumer goods 
company as an ongoing enterprise stated mockler the board of 
directors believes that the objective of coniston group is to force 
the immediate sale or dismemberment of gillette 
coniston controls 676 million gillette shares or about 58 
percent of the companys shares outstanding and has indicated it 
wanted the company to boost its stock price either by restructuring 
or negotiating a merger with another party 
mockler contended the companys major restructuring in 1986 the 
result of repeated takeover attempts by revlon group inc had 
helped enhance shareholder values mockler said gillettes earnings 
per share rose a record 41 percent in 1987 
coniston through two subsidiaries is seeking to solicit a 
majority of shareholders to elect four nominees to the gillette 
board at the april 21 meeting in boston one of the seats up for 
election is mocklers 
gillette shares rose 12 cents to close at 4075 monday on new 
york stock exchange trading 
gus oliver a principal of coniston partners said letters 
explaining the groups proposal should be mailed to shareholders 
later this week 
monday was the final day for shareholders to qualify to vote at 
the annual meeting 
gillette underwent a major restructuring after rebuffing a third 
hostile takeover bid by revlon which agreed not to seek to gain 
control of gillette under a 10year pact signed in november 1986 
following the accord gillette laid off about 2400 workers and 
sold off a several sudsidiaries and discontinued unprofitable 
divisions including a line of highquality writing instruments and 
28 percent interest in eye world stores 
gillette spokesman david fausch said further cutbacks in some 
international operations such as cosmetics and beauty aids are 
planned as part of the restructuring 
coniston last year was instrumental in forcing a major 
restructuring of allegis corp the parent of united airlines 
separately on monday gillette said it had received notification 
that new york real estate developer donald trump had received 
federal trade commission clearance to increase his holdings of the 
companys stock 
trump now may purchase up to 249 percent of gillettes stock 
trump owns about 400000 shares which was less than threetenths 
of 1 percent of gillettes 115 million common shares outstanding 
a gillette statement monday said the company has not received 
any communications from trump

a financial restructuring of shoneys 
inc means 730 million for stockholders who will receive onetime 
dividends of 20 in cash and stock for each of their shoneys 
shares officials said 
this is not giving up this is a fresh start according to 
mitchell boyd vice chairman and chief executive officer of the 
nashvillebased restaurant chain 
financing of the recapitalization will be through cash and about 
600 million in bank borrowings through a syndicate headed by the 
canadian imperial bank of commerce boyd said sunday 
shareholders will receive 16 per share in cash and a 
subordinated debenture with a face value of 4 for each share of 
shoneys stock they own and will retain ownership of the stock 
shareholders will not receive dividends but will receive 
interest of 48 cents on each note compared to the 18 cents per 
share dividends received last year 
company chairman ray danner who started the 1400restaurant 
chain in 1959 stands to receive about 110 million in cash for his 
69 million shares retired senior chairman alex schoenbaum 
founder of the concept owns about 32 million shares and would 
receive about 51 million 
the two own 28 percent of the outstanding stock of shoneys 
which had revenue last year of 694 million 
shareholder approval is not required for the plan but the board 
of directors decided sunday to submit the proposal to shareholders 
because of its massive scope 
the recapitalization plan is designed to shift the companys 
emphasis from growth through physical expansion to growth through 
improved profit margins at existing locations boyd said 
the plan will also allow the founders to cash out while leaving 
them as major owners of the stock for the next few years and 
provide incentives to the second generation of top management boyd 
said 
the plan permits executives to immediately cash in all 
outstanding stock options and would set aside an additional 1 
million shares for management stock options over the next several 
years allowing management to own up to 17 percent of the company

president miguel de la madrid urged producers 
and businesses to hold down prices this month saying it will be 
decisive for the success of his antiinflation program 
our goal is not only to reduce inflation in march but to 
continue dominating this harmful phenomenon the rest of the year 
the president said monday in a speech broadcast nationwide over 
radio and television 
de la madrid said his program called the economic solidarity 
pact had brought down inflation allowed for a budget surplus and 
reduced government use of public credit bringing down interest 
rates 
inflation for february is expected to be about 8 percent or 
about half the 155 percent registered in january he said 
consumer prices rose 87 percent in the first half of february and 
inflation was a record 1592 percent in 1987 
today i can affirm with satisfaction that the basic 
commitments of the pact are being fulfilled by workers 
businessmen and the government he said 
he said the government had increased its income while cutting 
spending through reinforced austerity measures 
the budget surplus not counting debt service payments meant 
the government used less public credit and lightened pressure on 
interest rates he said 
the minimal variation in the value of the peso currency against 
the dollar from december 15 to february 21 also helped reduce 
inflation he said 
the peso stood monday at 2330 to the dollar on the free market 
compared with 2286 a month ago the rate is used for tourism and 
most border transactions a second rate the controlled rate used 
for 75 percent of all transactions closed at 2241 to the dollar 
compared with 2205 a month ago 
with the start of the second phase of the plan march 1 treasury 
secretary gustavo petricioli announced that both rates which had 
been sliding against the dollar would remain unchanged this month 
prices of government pricecontrolled items which include 
gasoline electricity and basic foods were frozen for the month 
and a wage increase for the month held to 3 percent below what had 
been expected 
the minimum wage rose march 1 to 8000 pesos a day or about 
350 
budget secretary pedro aspe told a meeting of state financial 
officials on sunday that the stabilization of the economy now was 
within reach 
letting up on the inflation fight he said would mean a 
reversal of the gains achieved so far 
aspe told the state financial officials that the governments 
program did not constitute a shock plan the name given to 
drastic measures taken by brazil and argentina to rid their 
economies of hyperinflation 
mexicos plan he said does not include a generalized control 
of prices and salaries such as other countries have imposed

a federal judge will decide after reviewing a 
psychiatrists report whether an arbitrageur accused of plotting to 
kill convicted stock speculator ivan f boesky should be turned 
over to a psychiatric facility in new jersey 
us district judge whitman knapp extended an order monday 
placing john a mulheren in manhattans metropolitan correctional 
center a federal detention facility until wednesday when knapp 
is to examine the report of the psychiatrist dr naomi goldstein 
detention hearings were being held to determine if mulheren 
should be released on bail held by federal authorities or turned 
over to a psychiatric facility recommended by his attorneys 
late saturday us district judge pierre leval ordered mulheren 
to remain at the mcc after federal magistrate kathleen a roberts 
ordered earlier in the day that mulheren be released to the carrier 
foundation in new jersey 
the government had argued that the new jersey facility was not 
secure enough to hold mulheren senior partner at jamie securities 
co 
mulheren 38 of rumson nj was detained feb 18 on a federal 
criminal complaint that he threatened to kill boesky a central 
figure in the governments investigation of insider trading on wall 
street and michael davidoff boeskys former head trader 
according to police reports mulheren was carrying weapons and 
ammunition while making threats against the men who might be 
witnesses against mulheren 
we feel he has to be in a secure facility theres a real 
possibility mr mulheren will get out and do it again the 
assistant us attorney handling the case robert gage told the 
court 
mulherens lawyers argue that he is a manicdepressive who had 
failed on the day of his arrest to take lithium a drug prescribed 
to control extreme mood swings and impulses 
at the hearing they presented testimony from the arresting 
police officers who had grown up with mulheren and other testimony 
that indicated mulheren was a model citizen and not a threat to 
society 
defense attorneys also said they were concerned about mulherens 
health and wanted him where he could receive better care 
knapp initially appeared to be against having mulheren examined 
by a psychiatrist but he later changed his mind and ruled that 
mulheren should be examined by goldstein a manhattan psychiatrist 
with whom knapp is familiar and whom the government had suggested 
goldstein will be allowed to review mulherens records and 
interview his attorneys and wife however knapp stipulated that 
information from the psychiatrist would not be used in a court 
unless the trial judge so ordered information from the wife was 
not to be used in court at all 
at the 2 pm hearing wednesday knapp will review the initial 
impressions of goldstein about mulherens behavior potential and 
decide whether to send the case back to roberts or send the 
defendant to the new jersey facility

a federal judge says hell order new delegate 
elections at 68 united auto workers local unions in the southwest 
following reports of irregulatites in the campaign and election 
us district judge richard suhrheinrich said monday new 
elections will be ordered in the contested 1986 race between 
incumbent uaw region 5 director kenneth worley and his top 
assistant jerry tucker 
tucker was fired after he announced in may 1986 that he was 
entering the race against worley tucker lost by twotenths of a 
vote but nearly 27 votes in the contest were challenged 
the us department of labor investigated the election and filed 
three lawsuits against the uaw charging that some illegal 
delegates voted in the august election that tucker was fired 
illegally and that worley illegally used union money for an 
individual campaign 
worley spent 13000 in union money to buy jackets for delegates 
to the uaws constitutional convention in august 1986 where they 
voted for regional directors and other union officers the jackets 
bore the regions number and worleys name 
members in other regions bought their own jackets as did 
tuckers region 5 supporters said tuckers attorney joseph 
yablonski 
the labor department investigation also found that worley sent 
out campaign fliers typed on a uaw typewriter on uaw stationary in 
a uaw office which also is illegal for an individuals campaign 
said labor department attorney janet graney 
the uaw declined comment until it receives the order 
the order requiring new delegate elections in the eightstate 
region would end at least part of a 21month legal battle by 
tucker and the labor department 
region 5 includes uaw locals in missouri kansas oklahoma 
arkansas texas louisiana colorado and new mexico after new 
delegates are elected for each local they will vote at a 
miniconvention for a regional director

general electric cos unsolicited bid to 
acquire appliancemaker roper corp which already has agreed to a 
merger with rival whirlpool corp is seen as a competitive move 
in a consolidating industry 
ge on monday offered to pay 45 a share or 423 million for 
ropers 94 million common shares outstanding 
the unsolicited offer the first ever by ge topped the 
whirlpool offer of 3750 a share or 3525 million agreed to 
last month by roper 
analysts applauded the move by ge the wellknown appliance 
maker which also has major interests in finance broadcasting and 
other manufacturing which was seen as a thrust against a 
competitor in the major appliance field 
it makes sense and the numbers look real good said nicholas 
heymann a vice president of drexel burnham lambert inc in new 
york in terms of what theyre getting theyre trying to make a 
statement with the price 
ropers stock soared 11 to 4837 a share in composite new 
york stock exchange trading monday indicating that speculators 
expected a higher offer to emerge ge fell 75 cents a share to 
4337 and whirlpool dropped 62 cents a share to 2875 
roper which is based in augusta ga makes gas and electric 
ranges including some of the ranges marketed by ge 
heymann said ge had carved out a niche in the gas range market 
within the past three years and was no 3 in that business with 15 
percent of the market 
this year they are revamping the range line and i think they 
would like to be vertically integrated in the gas line heymann 
said if they expand they could vertically integrate and could 
move up to 20 or 25 percent of the market 
it appears the ball is back in whirlpools court heymann 
said 
roper based in augusta ga said today it would meet with ge 
representatives and give the company information it had requested 
roper said it would inform its shareholders of the boards position 
on the ge offer on or before march 18 
whirlpool expects to received the detailed ge offer today said 
donna mclean a spokeswoman for benton harbor michbased 
whirlpool 
right now were right where we were we have not said were 
going to up the ante at all mclean said 
in a statement monday david whitwam whirlpools chairman 
president and chief executive officer said the company was still 
committed to acquiring roper as a major step in its growth strategy 
russ leavitt a senior analyst for salomon brothers inc in new 
york said the merger attempt gives ge a potentially strengthened 
position in the cooking business 
it also gives them an entree to sears which is a major 
appliance retailer where ge has not been involved leavitt said 
referring to sears roebuck amp co roper is a sears supplier of 
cooking products and in the past ge has sold very little to sears 
it could help them get into that market 
ge said it made the offer after learning from a securities and 
exchange commission filing that roper agreed to the whirlpool 
merger under threat of a unilateral takeover 
ge said that in discussions with roper management last year 
roper officials said they wanted the company to remain independent 
we concluded that because we approached roper on a friendly 
basis and because roper had been forced into play by the whirlpool 
offer we should make an offer said jack batty a spokesman for 
ge we would describe our offer as competitive 
batty also noted the industry consolidation stemming from 
stepped up competition other major appliance mergers in recent 
years included maytag corps acquisition of magic chef co and the 
acquisition of white consolidated industries by swedens electrolux 
ab 
we feel that it would significantly strengthen ges appliance 
business in an increasingly competitive global market batty 
said we became impressed with the quality of their products 
we think it would enhance our competitive position

hundreds of scientists plan to gather wednesday 
to help design a 456 million machine that will generate the most 
intense xray beams in the world the laboratorys director says 
the scientists who are coming from some of the nations major 
industries and universities will gather at argonne national 
laboratory near suburban lemont 
alan schriesheim argonnes director said president reagan 
allotted 126 million in his proposed fiscal 1989 budget to the 
research development and construction at argonne of the machine 
called a synchroton 
congress has not yet passed the funding for the project but 
schriesheim said he is optimistic lawmakers will approve the 
funding because of the synchrotons extraordinary variety of 
applications in pure science and industry 
the machine would produce the most intense and powerful xray 
beams ever generated and will be used to help scientists explain 
the interior of matter schriesheim said in a telephone interview 
monday night 
industry has taken a keen interest in the development of the 
machine named the 7gev advanced photon source 
the machine has already attracted more industrial 
participation in the planning and design stages than any basic 
research machine ever built in the country said david baurac an 
argonne spokesman 
some of the 7gev advanced photon sources applications would be 
in the petroleum biomedical semiconductor computer and airplane 
industries schriesheim said 
future applications might include the creation of a plastic 
stronger than steel faster computer chips and improved diagnosis 
of heart disease he said 
international business machines corp of armonk ny american 
telephone amp telegraph co of new york boeing co of seattle and 
exxon corp of new york are among the businesses expected to attend 
the twoday meeting to help design the machine to meet their needs 
schriesheim said 
three hundred scientists are expected to attend the meeting 
baurac said 
argonne hopes to begin constructing the machine in late 1988 or 
early 1989 the machine will take about seven years to build and 
its construction would generate 1500 jobs baurac said 
once built 300 scientists and technical staff members would run 
the machine and about 1000 scientists from industry universities 
and other laboratories would use it each year baurac said 
the synchroton works by taking positrons and accelerating them 
almost to the speed of light the synchroton then uses 
sophisticated arrays of magnets to wiggle the beam violently to 
generate the brightest beams of xrays in the world baurac 
said 
positrons are like electrons with positive charges baurac 
said

firestone tire amp rubber co managements 
rejection of a merger with pirelli in favor of a venture with 
bridgestone corp set the stage for the italian tiremakers 186 
billion tender offer for firestone pirellis chief says 
pirelli societe generale sa the worlds fifthlargest tire 
maker began negotiating at firestones request over a merger of 
their tire operations in october 1986 pirelli chief executive 
gianbattista digiorgia said monday 
the talks broke up with no agreement last march but resumed 
early last month digiorgia said in a telephone interview from new 
york 
we had a talk with them in the beginning of february making a 
proposal that seemed to us to have been accepted digiorgia said 
a couple days later they announced the preliminary agreement with 
bridgestone 
pirelli said its offer monday of 58 cash a share for 
firestones 32 million common shares outstanding was contingent on 
firestones dropping the tentative agreement reached with 
bridgestone on feb 16 
that agreement calling for the japanese tire manufacturer to 
buy 75 percent of firestones tiremaking business for 15 
billion left pirelli no choice but to make an offer directly 
to firestones shareholders the italian company said in a 
statement 
pirellis offer also was conditioned on pirellis acquiring at 
least twothirds of firestones shares in the tender offer and on 
the removal of firestones antitakeover defenses pirelli said 
if pirelli acquires control of firestone it will sell certain 
segments of the company to french tire manufacturer michelin 
john j nevin chairman of chicagobased firestone stated late 
monday that the companys board was reviewing the offer and asking 
shareholders to await its recommendation before deciding whether to 
tender their stock to pirelli 
the board will complete its review by march 18 nevin said 
firestone stock shot up 1350 a share to 6312 in composite 
new york stock exchange trading monday topping pirellis 
58ashare offer in reflection of speculation that a higher offer 
might emerge 
pirelli had been regarded as a possible suitor for firestone 
and just before firestone announced its bridgestone agreement 
speculation was rampant that a bid was about to be made 
lawyers for pirelli on monday went to us district court in 
cleveland to try to stop firestone from enforcing the ohio takeover 
act and from using its poison pill antitakeover measures a 
poison pill is a move by a takeover target company to make its 
stock less attractive to a potential acquirer 
judge alice batchelder denied pirellis request for a temporary 
restraining order and set a hearing for next monday to review the 
constitutionality of the ohio takeover laws 
acquisition of firestone the worlds fourthlargest tiremaker 
substantially would increase pirellis current 15 percent share of 
the us tire market the worlds largest it also would give the 
italian company its first us manufacturing facilities 
it is known in our strategy that we need production facilities 
in the states digiorgia said 
we are present in eight countries so far he said it can 
be good for us to have a major presence in the states in order to 
improve our overall presence in the marketplace 
analysts said acquiring firestones us tire business would be 
the easiest way for a foreign manufacturer to establish a solid 
foothold in the us market and remain a contender in the fiercely 
competitive global industry 
firestone is the only game in town for a tire company located 
outside the united states that wants to get in in a big way said 
donald descenza of nomura securities international inc in new york 
firestones got the plants the distribution system and the 
relationships with general motors ford and chrysler he said 
firestone has about 21 percent of the lucrative us 
originalequipment market for passenger cars said ed noga editor 
of rubber amp plastics news an akron ohiobased trade journal 
goodyear holds 34 percent of that market uniroyal 20 percent 
general 13 percent and michelin 11 percent noga said 
firestone ranked fourth among tiremakers worldwide in 1986 sales 
of tires alone behind goodyear michelin and bridgestone noga 
said 
pirelli based in milan was fifth with 1987 sales of 365 
billion 
under the plan to spin off parts of firestone to michelin the 
french group would pay about 650 million for firestones brazilian 
holdings and its master care inc auto service business pirelli 
stated 
michelin also would have an option to buy 50 percent of 
firestones synthetic rubber and diversified product holdings in 
the united states for about 150 million 
on feb 16 bridgestone and firestone said they intended to form 
a new akronbased business called firestone tire co that would own 
firestones worldwide tiremaking operation 
bridgestone would own 75 percent of the joint venture

gulf amp western inc the entertainment 
publishing and financial services giant said its firstquarter 
profit slipped 89 percent compared with strong results a year 
earlier 
martin s davis chairman and chief executive said tuesday the 
results were in line with the companys expectations and that he 
expected improvement for all of fiscal 1988 
the company said its profit fell to 631 million or 105 a 
share in its first fiscal quarter ended jan 31 compared with 
earnings of 693 million or 111 a share a year earlier 
revenue for the first quarter rose 83 percent to 118 billion 
from 109 billion a year earlier 
operating income from motion pictures for the quarter was down 
from record results for the christmas holiday quarter a year 
earlier when the company had the movies star trek iv the voyage 
home the golden child and crocodile dundee in us 
theaters and top gun in foreign release 
this year the company had the movies eddie murphy raw and 
fatal attraction in us theaters and beverly hills cop ii 
and the untouchables in international release 
television operations reported higher operating income gulf amp 
western produces television programs such as cheers operates 
the madison square garden cable tv network and owns 50 percent of 
the usa cable network 
consumer publishing results were strong but the costs of 
product development depressed results from educational publishing 
and professional information services 
consumer and commercial finance operations improved as a result 
of increased finance charge revenue and gains from insurance 
operations as well as gains in credit card receivables and real 
estate lending 
davis said one reason for his optimism about prospects for 
earnings growth later this fiscal year is the planned release of 
the films crocodile dundee ii and coming to america with 
eddie murphy and revenue from syndication of the television shows 
cheers webster and family ties 
the company also announced it had boosted its quarterly dividend 
to 35 cents a share from 30 cents a share payable april 1 to

tuesday on the chicago board of trade with wheat and corn futures 
ending lower while soybeans advanced

crop in good to fair condition was also seen as bearish for wheat 
prices 
and the usda announced late monday it would continue through

prices for future delivery of cocoa rose tuesday as a new 
pricesupport scheme emerged from an international meeting in 
london but analysts said the plan was unlikely to halt the slide 
in prices 
on other markets cattle futures advanced sharply while the pork 
complex was mixed grains and soybeans were mixed precious metals 
retreated energy futures were mostly higher and stockindex 
futures advanced 
the international cocoa organizations failure to reach 
agreement on a new pricesupport plan after five days of meetings 
triggered the automatic implementation of a scheme allowing the 
icco to withhold up to 120000 metric tons from the market 
but the organization lacks sufficient funding to finance the 
plan and its members representing consumer and producer nations 
were sharply divided on what intervention price should trigger the 
withholding mechanism analysts said 
its very questionable whether the withholding program will 
have any impact on the market said kim badenhop an analyst with 
merrill lynch capital markets inc 
the spot price for cocoa has fallen more than 400 a metric ton 
since july due primarily to abundant supplies and rising production 
the icco intervened with a bufferstock buying program that 
began in january but the organization exhausted the programs 
250000metricton allocation within two months 
the first news of the new pricesupport plan sparked a rally on 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange where the contract for 
march delivery settled 17 higher at 1600 a metric ton 
but badenhop said trading enthusiasm flagged on later reports 
explaining the problems with the plan 
cattle futures posted impressive gains for the second 
consecutive session on the chicago mercantile exchange in reaction 
to higher cash prices for cattle carcasses and boxed beef 
analysts said 
the cattle market had been depressed due to a lentenseason drop 
in consumer demand for meat but a wave of packing plant closings 
last week has reduced beef supplies to the point where wholesale 
prices have begun to rise said william j arndt an analyst in 
chicago for dean witter reynolds inc 
some concern remains that the drop in slaughters will lead to a 
backlog of slaughterready animals but right now were trading 
the cash and the cash is strong arndt said 
hog futures followed cattle higher while frozen pork belly 
futures retreated on an exchange report showing an unexpectedly 
steep increase in supplies he said 
live cattle settled 20 cent to 137 cents higher with april at 
7292 cents a pound feeder cattle were 55 cent to 85 cent higher 
with march at 81 cents a pound hogs were 08 cent to 42 cent 
higher with april at 4372 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
75 cent lower to 25 cent higher with march at 5395 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the chicago board of 
trade with wheat and corn finishing lower while soybeans advanced 
the substantial losses in wheat were due to heavy speculative 
selling linked to a lack of major new export business analysts 
said 
an agriculture department report showing the us winter wheat 
crop in good to fair condition also was seen as bearish for wheat 
prices 
and the usda announced late monday it would continue through

thriving

on said joseph barthel technical trading strategist at the 
butcher amp singer inc investment firm

some predicted the dow jones industrials would soon surpass the 
2100 barrier but many professional strategists were reluctant to 
declare that the underlying postcrash nervousness has evaporated

mark peabody didnt crack a smile as the 
vice chairman of ford motor co surrounded by cameras and 
microphones leaned across the assembly line to hand him a check in 
an envelope 
i was kind of nervous all those tv cameras he said after 
harold poling chatted with him and gave him the check peabodys 
share of fords industryrecord 46 billion in 1987 profits 
on tuesday ford distributed 653 million in profitsharing 
checks averaging more than 3700 to 156479 hourly and salaried 
workers a record in profitsharing for any us corporation 
most checks were distributed earlier in the day but peabody and 
his pals on the main transmission assembly line at fords livonia 
transmission plant agreed to wait until poling could distribute 
their checks in a ceremony recorded for posterity 
its not only the politicians who can call this super 
tuesday poling told a crowd of cheering workers adding that the 
plants 4500 employees received 176 million or an average of 
4450 each 
the livonia transmission workers checks were higher than the 
company average because the workers have high seniority and the 
work force at the plant has remained stable for the past few years 
said peter pestillo vice president for employee and external 
affairs 
workers on peabodys line assemble transmissions for 
frontwheeldrive cars such as the popular taurussable and the new 
lincoln continental most of them peabody included said they are 
lucky to be there at all 
most were on layoff from other plants and had enough seniority 
to be called to work at livonia when ford added the line three 
years ago 
more than 160250 ford workers in the united states received 
previous record profitsharing checks averaging 2100 for 1986 
when ford earned 329 billion 
ford workers took home an average 2100 in profitsharing for 
1985 2000 for 1984 and 400 for 1983 when the company 
distributed the first checks 
in the past five years ford said it has given out more than 
16 billion to its workers 
general motors corp workers received no share of gms 356 
billion in 1987 profits at the same time that the corporation said 
it would distribute 1846 million in stock bonuses to executives 
gm workers also received no 1986 profitsharing although 
executives received millions of dollars in cash and stock bonuses 
angering gm workers heading into national contract negotiations 
gm the nations largest automaker switched to the ford 
profitsharing formula for 1988 but the company said that formula 
still would have generated no profitsharing had it been used for 
1987

western unit voted unanimously tuesday not to allow guild members 
to write for the academy awards show scheduled for next month 
the producers of the academy awards had asked that the guild 
allow the writers to continue working on the show 
the board of directors of the writers guild of america west 
voted unanimously this evening to deny the request for waiver from 
the academy of motion picture arts and science for the academy 
awards ceremonies said guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden 
what that means is that writers guild writers will not be 
writing the academy awards ceremonies ms rhoden added 
the strike by 9000 members of the writers guild of america 
against the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
began monday a week after their contract expired 
bob werden spokesman for the academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences had said earlier tuesday that the academy had asked for 
the waiver in past strikes entertainment unions have usually 
granted waivers for the oscars 
without the waiver well struggle on somehow he had said 
scriptwriter mel shavelson former wga president and another 
union member jack rose were hired by the academy to write the 
program which is scheduled to be televised worldwide by abctv on 
april 11 
if there is no waiver i wont do the show shavelson said 
tuesday adding the writing was far from complete most of the 
work is done when the cast shows up at rehearsal its rewriting 
really 
if there is no waiver you will find out how good actors are 
at adlibbing he said in general writers provide most material 
for the hosts and presenters at the ceremony the winners thanks 
are their own 
meanwhile a federal mediator brought together negotiators for 
9000 striking scriptwriters and entertainment producers tuesday to 
outline differences in a walkout the union says could cripple

was conducted said alliance spokesman herb steinberg sticking 
points were writers demands for increased fees and creative rights
