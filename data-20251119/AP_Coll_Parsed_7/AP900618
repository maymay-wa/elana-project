amnesty international on monday charged 
brazilian police routinely torture and kill criminal suspects with 
the complacency of government authorities 
according to the londonbased human rights organization a 
growing number of victims of torture and illtreatment are 
children aged 18 and under 
the charges were in a 17page report titled torture and 
extrajudicial execution in urban brazil that was released during 
a news conference at the sao paulo branch of the brazilian bar 
association 
political prisoners were routinely tortured during the military 
regimes that ruled this country from 196485 abuses diminished but 
did not end with the return of civilian rule according to amnesty 
torture continues to be endemic in brazil and can happen at 
any time and anywhere in police stations and vehicles in prisons 
and in secret the report said 
while this country of 150 million residents has no more 
political prisoners criminal suspects are still subject to torture 
and illtreatment amnesty said 
there is evidence that the police have responded to increasing 
social violence by taking the law into their own hands torturing 
and killing ordinary criminal suspects and prisoners torture is an 
everyday occurrence in brazil and extrajudicial execution is 
common the report said 
rights violations are not official policy it said but to 
tolerate these abuses is to condone them the alarming incidence of 
unlawful killing torture and cruel and inhuman treatement of 
citizens in official custody indicates the authorities are not 
taking effective steps to eradicate these practices 
at the news conference bacre waly ndiaye vicechairman of the 
organizations international executive committee said policemen 
knowing their crimes will go unpunished because of the 
prevailing climate of impunity form death squads whose victims are 
those least able to defend themselves the poor and children 
death squads kill at least one child a day ndiaye said 
the report said the lack of public confidence in the ability of 
police to deal with the growing crime rate stimulates the growth of 
death squads and vigilante groups known as justiceiros 
portuguese for justicemakers 
justiceiros active in the industrial suburbs of sao paulo are 
paid by local businessmen to eliminate suspected petty criminals 
the report said 
the respected folha de sao paulo newspaper reported in june that 
justiceiros had killed about 40 people in 45 days 
ndiaye said officials admit torture is one of the main 
techniques used to solve crimes and that confessions obtained 
through torture were often used as evidence 
it is time for the brazilian government to take action against 
the growing number of human rights violations and respect the 
countrys constitution by doing nothing it is not only condoning 
but encouraging these abuses ndiaye said 
brazils 1988 constitution states that no one shall be 
subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment it 
stipulates that the crime of torture is not subject to bail 
amnesty pardon or statute of limitations 
amnestys report also denounced the systematic torture of 
inmates in many of brazils overcrowded prisons 
in april 1989 nearly 91000 prisoners were jammed into prisons 
built to hold less than 44000 it said 
the report was the result of four years of research and was 
based on a series of factfinding visits and meetings with 
authorities local rights organizations lawyers torture victims 
and their relatives

a local prosecutor monday declared 
obscene the sexually explict as nasty as they wanna be album by 
rap group 2 live crew and banned its sale in pickens and 
greenville counties 
the album also has been declared obscene by a federal judge in 
florida and san antonio texas store owners pulled it from 
shelves last week after they were threatened with arrest in 
sacramento calif the district attorney monday refused to 
prosecute merchants selling the album 
stores will be sent letters about the ruling and must clear the 
album off their shelves by june 26 or risk arrest said prosecutor 
joseph j watson 
the whole purpose of the lyrics is to appeal to the prurient 
interest of sex they are patently offensive and they are utterly 
without any serious artistic or literary value said watson 
summing up the state laws threepart test of obscenity its 
filth 
sale of the album is now banned in communities that comprise 
onefifth of the states residents on thursday the album was 
declared obscene and its sale prohibited in richland county 
anyone found guilty of selling obscene material to a minor faces 
a maximum of five years in prison and a 5000 fine the penalty 
for selling to an adult is up to three years in prison and a 3000 
fine 
to get a conviction a prosecutor would have to convince a jury 
the album is obscene 
debbie bennett spokeswoman for 2 live crews label luke 
records wondered whether watson would now look at other material 
being sold 
i hope this means theyre also taking out all the xrated 
movies and all the other albums on major labels that have all the 
same language as 2 live crew ms bennett said in a telephone 
interview from miami 
i hope theyre not limiting it to a relatively obscure black 
group and an even more obscure black label 
she said more than 17 million copies of the album have been 
sold 
sacramento district attorney steve white monday rejected 
requests to prosecute merchants who sell the album saying it was 
extraordinarily crude and offensive but did not violate state 
obscenity law

interest describe sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and 
taken as a whole lack serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value as judged against a contemporary statewide 
standard white said in a statement 
meanwhile in tennessee acuffrose music inc sued 2 live crew 
in federal court saying the group wasnt authorized to record a 
song derived from the roy orbison hit oh pretty woman 
acuffrose seeks unspecified damages and forfeiture of all 
copies of the groups as clean as they wanna be album the less 
explicit version of the one at the center of the obscenity 
controversy because it contains a rap version of the orbison hit

a threatened scientific boycott over us 
travel restrictions on foreigners infected with the aids virus has 
failed but the policy will remain a major issue at this weeks 
international aids meeting 
the french and swiss governments the european parliament and 
other groups had urged scientists to boycott because of us 
immigration policy 
but officials say registration for the sixth international 
conference on aids which opens wednesday will come close to the 
original estimate of 12000 
among those registered are luc montagnier and other members of 
frances pasteur institute one of the worlds leading aids 
research centers 
only 50 research papers were withdrawn from the 2500 studies 
originally submitted conference spokesman dana van gorder said 
no one wants to see the law interfere with the work of this 
conference van gorder said people are coming here to improve 
the work they are doing in response to aids they felt this is the 
highest responsibility 
so do some two dozen aids activist groups which announced plans 
to attend the fiveday meeting to protest the immigration policy 
and publicize their claims of government inaction and drug company 
profits on aids medications 
not joining the boycott was a painful decision for us said 
tom cunningham a member of the new york chapter of the aids 
coalition to unleash power better known as act up but we do 
need the opportunity to challenge aids researchers and the 
pharmaceutical companies 
the controversy is over a 1987 senate amendment ordering the 
public health service to place infection by hiv the virus that 
causes aids on the list of contagious diseases that may bar 
foreigners from entering the united states 
the list also includes leprosy tuberculosis and five sexually 
transmitted diseases 
the restriction has been condemned by scores of aids groups 
including the national commission on aids as an infringement on 
human rights the commissions chairman dr june osborn said the 
policy fosters the impression that aids and hiv infection can be 
easily transmitted 
a number of groups involved in aids education programs and care 
of aids patients are boycotting the conference 
the list includes almost 100 nongovernmental organizations 
including the international planned parenthood foundation and the 
league of red cross and red crescent societies a genevabased 
federation of red cross organizations from 149 countries 
the world health organization also criticized the immigration 
policy and for a time contemplated backing out as cosponsor of 
the conference 
dr bruce dick health department director at the league of red 
cross and red crescent said many of the boycotting groups could 
lend valuable groundlevel experience to scientists at the 
conference 
the most negative thing about us not participating is the 
missed opportunity to use a big conference like this to form 
partnerships he said 
dick said the society had 40 people from 30 countries at last 
years conference in montreal and originally had planned to send 
more representatives to san francisco 
the bush administration twice has tried to blunt the outcry 
last year the immigration and naturalization service adopted a 
waiver policy that would allow those infected with hiv to stay in 
the united states up to 30 days for business purposes conferences 
medical treatment and family visits 
the waiver also offered foreign visitors greater 
confidentiality eliminating permanent identifying marks on their 
passports 
in april the ins said it would issue new 10day visas for those 
coming to this country for professional or scientific conferences 
those applying for the visas are not required to state if they are 
infected with hiv 
the new visa plan cooled some of the protest but many remain 
opposed to any singling out of aids or hivinfected people 
the administration has made some efforts but we still find 
the policy objectionable said sue lucas coordinator of the 
united kingdom aids consortium for the third world a group of 40 
british organizations with aids programs in developing countries 
we are particularly concerned that this type of discrimination 
in the united states would have an impact on discrimination in 
other countries she said 
the controversy has brought calls for the administration to 
remove aids and hiv infection from the list 
legislative leaders point to a government accounting office 
opinion that the secretary of health and human services can remove 
the restriction but administration officials maintain a directive 
from congress cannot be eliminated that way 
rep j roy rowland dga introduced legislation in april that 
would give the department of health and human services authority 
over deciding which diseases are on the list 
it is my opinion the administration would like a way out of 
this said rowland the present rule reflects adversely on the 
united states which has been a leader in scientific and medical 
research for many years 
the united states always has placed health and social limits on 
those entering the country in the late 18th century a prohibition 
existed on prostitutes and beggars 
today 33 separate categories limit travel to this country such 
as medical conditions mental disease political ideology bigamy 
and homosexuality 
during the wave of immigration through new yorks ellis island 
people were forced to run up and down stairs to see if they winded 
easily a sign of tuberculosis ins spokesman duke austin said 
the present law which dates back to 1952 first barred those 
with tuberculosis and leprosy by 1987 the list included five 
sexually transmitted diseases gonorrhea infectious syphilis 
chancroid granuloma inguinale and lymphogranuloma venereum 
aids was added to the list by the public health service in june 
of that year hiv infection was placed on the list by congressional 
mandate in august 
thirtythree other countries place entrance restrictions on 
foreigners with aids or hiv infection usually on those seeking 
extended stays iraq demands aids tests for anyone staying more 
than five days those seeking permanent residence or a stay longer 
than 12 months in australia also must be tested bahrain tests 
certain foreign workers such as hotel staff and hairdressers 
those seeking permanent entry to the united states must have a 
full physical examination but visitors are not tested for disease 
basically it is an honor system said austin there is no 
way to tell unless an inspector ascertains through the discovery of 
drugs or certain physical characteristics that the inspection 
should be pressed further 
opponents of us policy say the issue is one of setting a 
standard for the rest of the world they hope a final resolution 
can be reached before 1992 when another international aids 
conference is scheduled for boston 
to many countries the united states is a leader in terms of 
its policies said dick of the league of red cross and red 
crescent it is essential that we have nondiscriminatory 
policies because it is through nondiscrimination that we are going 
to control this disease

dean rusk and nikita khrushchev two leaders 
of the cold war now have something else in common sons who are 
offering assessments of their fathers roles in both war and peace 
richard rusk in what he calls my attempt to know my aging 
father interviewed the former secretary of state for long hours 
with a tape recorder rolling 
sergei khrushchev describing himself at one point as a 
witness to my fathers meditations chronicled the last seven 
years in the life of the soviet leader who was driven from power in 
1964 
as i saw it by dean rusk as told to richard rusk will be 
published june 25 by ww norton amp company 
khrushchev on khrushchev an inside account of the man and his 
era by sergei khrushchev is scheduled for june 28 publication by 
little brown and company 
nikita khrushchev was a coal miners son who rose through the 
ranks of the soviet bureaucracy holding power for 11 years as 
communist party chief and six years as premier before being 
deposed he died in 1971 
rusk 81 lives in athens ga he was secretary of state from 
1961 to 1969 and was as his son says an architect of a war that 
killed 58000 americans and nearly a million vietnamese 
he was with president kennedy at the summit in vienna in june 
1961 when in his words khrushchev set out to intimidate this 
new young president of the united states 
sergei khrushchevs view is different the main thing i recall 
happening at vienna was that the two men got acquainted father 
returned to moscow after the summit with a very high opinion of 
kennedy 
rusk encountered khrushchev again after going to moscow in july 
1963 to initial a limited atomic test ban treaty at the soviet 
premiers villa on the black sea they batted a badminton bird back 
and forth with no net and no lines on the floor 
after his downfall khrushchev was all but forgotten in the 
soviet union pictured his son recalls as a dimwitted hooligan 
cast upon the throne by fate only recently has the 
rehabilitation of his image begun 
rusk although he held office longer than any secretary of state 
since cordell hull and retired to an honored professorial chair in 
his native georgia had his detractors too 
historian arthur m schlesinger a kennedy white house aide 
found him the perfect numbertwo man a baffling leader 
who had authority but not command as richard rusk sees it 
schlesinger was suggesting that rusk wasnt smart enough for the 
job 
staying on in the johnson administration after kennedys death 
the state department veteran became increasingly a target for 
opponents of the vietnamese war 
the young richard rusk a student at cornell found himself 
caught between love for my father and the growing horror of 
vietnam unwilling to volunteer and unwilling to embarrass his 
father by joining the antiwar movement 
in a taperecorded session two decades later he pressed rusk on 
the point and found him unprepared for admitting that 
thousands of american lives and hundreds of thousands of 
vietnamese might have been lost in vain 
for the elder rusk there were no doubts because of this 
nations commitments i had a duty to perform to try to prevent 
north vietnam from overrunning south vietnam by force that was my 
job and i tried to do it 
the taciturn rusk and the voluble khrushchev both at first 
resisted the idea of writing their memoirs 
all we wanted to do was to get him involved in some kind of 
project writes sergei khrushchev father didnt respond to our 
first suggestions sometimes he laughed them off 
when he did agree to tape record his memoirs soviet authorities 
of the time resisted publication but the material was published 
widely abroad as sergei khrushchevs own book neared publication 
he was seeking to have a russian edition of his fathers memoirs 
published so as to restore his good name 
rusk vowed when he took office in 1961 that he would never write 
his memoirs saying he would leave it to the historians 
in a preface to richard rusks book however he tells how his 
son came home to georgia after many years in alaska years spent 
i now realize attempting to understand and make peace with the 
events of his youth and of my public service 
he could not do this could not reforge the broken chain 
without me dean rusk writes 
reforging the chain richard rusk interviewed family critics 
and friends as well as his father 
at every stage of dean rusks life youth public servant 
retired statesman were signs of mortality he writes but 
mainly i found affirmation of the goodness in my dad

attacks by sunni moslem zealots on banks 
breweries and night clubs underline the growing influence of 
islamic fundamentalists in one of the most secular arab states 
in may an islamic court convicted journalist ibrahim abu naab 
59 of apostasy or abandoning islam and ruled that he be divorced 
from his wife and separated from his children 
abdullah shamayleh prosecutorgeneral of the islamic court 
urged it during abu naabs trial to permit the shedding of his 
blood 
that would not appear necessary since anyone who kills an 
apostate is immune from prosecution under islamic law 
jordans civil law does not grant immunity however and the 
civil appeals court probably will overrule the islamic tribunals 
verdict 
the crime abu naab committed was attending a meeting in 
britain of the breakaway qadiani sect which is outlawed in many 
moslem states and allegedly converting from the mainstream sunni 
sect 
his case reflects the increasing strength of fundamentalists 
who became the largest legislative bloc after the november 
parliamentary elections jordans first in 22 years the moslem 
brotherhood won 22 of the 80 seats and islamic independents got 12 
they have pledged to work for strict application of sharia the 
islamic religious law but have said they will work within the 
constitution and not challenge king hussein 
arab leaders worry about increasing fundamentalism among the 
worlds 1 billion moslems recent moves toward greater democracy in 
some arab states are largely an outgrowth of that concern 
khalil abdulrahman khalifa a 28yearold engineer said the 
islamic tide is growing these days because the people have lost 
trust in their governments which have not moved so far to solve 
the central arab issue the palestinian problem 
we want liberation and we want to have an effective role in 
the world we want the arabs to be respected not ignored the 
islamic parties attract us because they match our outlook 
jordans fundamentalists are not having it all their own way a 
government ban on male hairdressers working in womens beauty 
salons imposed in may because of islamic pressure was canceled in 
two weeks after strong public protest 
the fundamentalists sought to enforce a koranic law that a woman 
cannot be touched by a man who is not her husband or a relative 
even though the fundamentalists ultimately lost many jordanians 
are disturbed about the government of prime minister mudar badran 
bowing to the pressure in the first place 
when the prohibition was imposed the englishlanguage jordan 
times declared it is clear that such a ban will lead to other 
decisions that will limit the freedom of the individual 
it said the sole purpose was to cater to the whims of some 
religious or conservative groups which do not represent the 
majority of the population 
during street protests in may after an israeli civilian killed 
palestinian workers in israel fundamentalists attacked businesses 
considered unislamic 
mobs raided banks the dutchowned amstel brewery and night 
clubs that serve liquor causing damage worth millions of dollars 
charging interest and drinking alcohol are forbidden by the koran 
the moslem holy book 
several amman night clubs were attacked in february and march 
state television has been affected scenes of actors kissing or 
even holding hands are deleted because the fundamentalists 
consider them lewd 
newspaper or poster advertisements showing scantily clad women 
have disappeared 
attendance at prayers on friday the moslem sabbath has grown 
considerably 
the area covered by prayer rugs on the sidewalks around ammans 
husseini mosque in the teeming bazaar district has been extended to 
accomodate more people 
fundamentalist strength is on the rise in the israelioccupied 
territories across the jordan river challenging the palestine 
liberation organization a movement called hamas or zeal has 
played a major role in the 30monthold palestinian uprising and 
made major gains in municipal elections in israels arab towns 
in egypt moslem militants have attacked christian churches and 
in clashes with police this year 34 people have been killed and 
more than 70 wounded fundamentalism is spreading in tunisia 
in turkey moslem but secular fundamentalist violence is 
increasing and several outspoken champions of secularism have been 
assassinated 
earlier this year the turkish government was forced to lift a 
rule against women university students wearing islamicstyle 
headscarves on campus

presidentelect ion iliescus decision 
to use miners to impose mob rule in bucharest last week raises a 
crucial question is he the democrat he says he is or a dictator 
in the making 
the 60yearold former communist due to be inaugurated this 
week dented his image at home and abroad with his tough tactics 
and raised doubts about his political abilities 
iliescu seems increasingly to take a hard line covered with only 
a veneer of liberalism 
the signals of his government are contradictory as illustrated 
by mondays action in the two chambers of parliament dominated by 
iliescus national salvation front 
the chamber of deputies voted overwhelmingly to give the 
forces of law and order authority to clear anticommunist 
demonstrators from a central square 
at virtually the same time the senate voted to appoint an 
allparty commission to investigate last weeks violence which 
began wednesday when police brutally ended a 53day protest at the 
same square 
iliescu condemned instigators of antigovernment violence that 
broke out after the crackdown opponents in government denounced 
the violence too but they are determined that any inquiry will 
also focus on violence by miners summoned by iliescu to quiet the 
protesters 
the miners were given food and transport and were somehow able 
as outoftowners to hunt down opposition leaders in remote parts 
of bucharest 
it will be a test of iliescus commitment to democracy whether 
the many questions raised by last weeks events are answered 
clearly 
since taking power after the revolution that swept communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu from power in december iliescus front 
has done little to dismantle the communist institutions it 
inherited to clarify its goals or explain its political mistakes 
it seems scarcely logical for instance that iliescu should 
alienate the west by summoning the miners when he desperately needs 
western aid to rebuild romania 
yet iliescu not only summoned but thanked the miners drawing on 
stock phrases learned in decades of communist party service he 
alienated the west further by suggesting the rightwing revolt had 
outside support 
the unanswered questions about iliescus policies since december 
are ample fodder for various theories 
does the use of the miners rather than soldiers or police to 
restore order mean iliescu does not command army or police loyalty 
was he facing an organized revolt or was unrest provoked by the 
front in order to crack down on opposition 
diplomats and knowledgeable romanians believe that at least some 
of the army which traditionally has played an important role in 
politics is not with iliescu 
the army is in love with its image said a western diplomat 
arguing the military wanted no part in breaking up the 
antigovernment demonstration or dealing with the aftermath 
defense minister victor stanculescu was at a warsaw pact meeting 
thursday when an influential group pressing for more democracy in 
the army was ordered dissolved a purge may follow 
on friday iliescu said he was moving control of the police to 
the defense ministry and thinking about establishing a national 
guard 
if the guard proved an efficient impartial antiriot squad it 
could help police who clearly have little idea how to control 
crowds without shooting 
but dinu patriciu a leader of the opposition liberal party and 
stefan doinas a leading intellectual said the guard could become 
a tool for oppression 
iliescu says miners have already volunteered to join 
romanians speak of growing signs of surveillance similar to the 
securitate the nowdisbanded secret police force under ceausescu 
doinas suspects exsecuritate men and others who lost out in the 
revolution are stirring unrest to prove that there will be no 
quiet in our country as long as they are not returned to their 
positions 
iliescu according to this view is either unable or unwilling 
to control the exceausescu forces 
for the opposition another test of iliescus commitment to 
democracy will be the reappearance of the liberal daily romania 
libera and three other publications the miners shut down 
iliescu came to power with virtually universal support from 
romanians relieved to be rid of ceausescu 
to most romanians iliescu has remained the guardian of the 
revolution and thus he won last months elections by a landslide 
but last weeks arrests and attacks on intellectuals increased 
fears about romanias fate under him 
a people which does not respect and protect its intellectuals 
a people ready to condemn its writers artists and thinkers risks 
living without chance of survival said ministry of culture 
spokesman maria borza 
for decades the communist regime took the intellectuals for 
dangerous opposition lets not make the same mistake

the new rightwing government is refocusing 
israeli policy to emphasize talks with arab states rather than a 
dialogue limited to palestinians 
officials complain however that prime minister yitzhak shamir 
is getting little support for his peace efforts from israels major 
ally the united states shamirs government is especially peeved 
about last weeks show of impatience by secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
speaking to a house committee baker urged israel to resume 
stalled talks and recited the white house telephone number adding 
sacrastically when youre serious about this call us 
shamir responded to baker with his own measure of sarcasm and 
impatience monday calling on the united states to stop dithering 
and abandon its dialogue with the plo because of the attempted 
terrorist attack may 30 on israel 
speaking to students in a tel aviv suburb shamir mocked the 
us efforts to wrest a denunciation of the attempted raid from plo 
chief yasser arafat saying they want to ask arafat to continue 
to lie to them arafat has denied involvement in the attempted 
raid but has not condemned it 
im suprised by the patience shown by our friends and allies 
the americans in discussions with those murderers shamir said 
the united states has promoted dialogue with the palestinians as 
a starting point for the middle east peace effort israeli 
officials believe circumstances have changed 
yossi olmert director of the government press office said the 
war of words in the middle east was heating up to the point where 
it was necessary to emphasize an overall solution not one limited 
to the palestinian problem 
we have to adjust to what is happening the volume of threats 
are such that you have to pay attention he said 
yossi benaharon shamirs top policy adviser conceded that 
shifting gears would likely bring accusations shamir is stalling 
and looking for ways to avoid talking to the palestinians 
its a risk we have to take no matter what we do we are 
immediately accused of buying time and shying away from process 
its worth it to us to absorb such criticism provided we feel we 
are on the right track he said 
israeli officials maintain that an israeli initiative of may 
1989 called for ending the state of war with arab states and for 
palestinian elections but they said it was reshaped by baker to 
focus exclusively on the palestinians 
benaharon said israel had problems with bakers plan which 
proposed palestinianisraeli dialogue in cairo 
first he said israel could not accept a behindthescenes role 
for the plo that would inevitably grow into a concrete 
participation he said the cairo talks should be limited to 
technical discussions of elections and not major political issues 
such as the future of the occupied west bank 
another problem we had was there was a neglect of the arab 
states participation and posture in peace process and we have 
entreated the united states to get the arabs into the process 
benaharon said he told the associated press that diplomatic 
contacts had begun to arrange an indepth review of middle east 
policy with the united states 
benaharon said israels new government had sent a number of 
signals that it was ready to deal with the arabs but most had been 
ignored 
he said israel had agreed to a un envoys visit to look at 
conditions of palestinians in occupied areas and had begun 
reopening palestinian universities closed at the onset of the 
palestinian uprising 30 months ago 
also shamir gave an interview to the egyptian weekly mayo in 
which he called on syrian president hafez assad to come to israel 
and talk peace without conditions foreign ministry officials 
promptly hinted the golan heights which israel captured from syria 
in 1967 would be on the table 
this appeal was not made as part of a special initiative we 
are appealing to all arab leaders with a proposal to come to 
negotiations with us about peaceful relations between us and 
them shamir said at the tel aviv suburb of petah tikva 
benaharon said that as part of arabisraeli peacemaking arab 
states could state a willingness to lift an economic boycott 
against israel acknowledge israels existence and rescind the 
un resolution that equates zionism with racism

freed american slaves who founded this 
west african nation brought with them the gracious antebellum 
architecture and plantation mentality of their former masters 
in the land they declared a republic in 1847 and named for 
liberty they adopted tailcoats and top hats despite the sweltering 
heat they also enriched themselves by stealing the land and labor 
of native liberians and sometimes selling them into slavery 
the vengeance bred by the early years of brutal repression is 
resurfacing in monrovia 
many of the southernstyle mansions with their balconies 
verandas gables and wooden shutters are boarded up their owners 
have been trying to flee the country since june 9 when soldiers 
killed three americoliberians the name given to the descendants 
of the countrys elitist founders 
liberia has been torn for 5 months by an insurgency and the 
americoliberians about 5 percent of the nations 25 million 
people fear further reprisals because they are accused of 
supporting the rebels leader charles taylor 
taylor half americo and half native liberian is trying to oust 
president samuel doe more than 1000 people mostly civilians 
have been killed in the struggle 
on saturday both sides called for a ceasefire pending further 
negotiations the statement was issued after five days of talks in 
neighboring sierra leone 
despite the call for a truce fear among the americoliberians 
remains 
some of the tightknit group of just 300 families deny their 
people even exist now because there has been so much intermarriage 
with what they used to call aborigines 
in the old days the boss man americoliberian would steal 
his workers wives to enrich the gene pool 
later they adopted native wards for the same purpose 
most americoliberians have opposed doe since he seized power in 
a bloody 1980 coup that ended their 133year monopoly on power and 
money 
the adventurous men and women who came to the west african coast 
said they wanted to give the continent their western knowledge the 
flow of american blacks to liberia continued into this century 
although the majority had arrived before the american civil war 
ended in 1865 
their showcase democracy initially was feted by successive 
american and other western governments the praise ended in 1931 
when a league of nations report said young boys were being hunted 
like animals and sold into slavery others were forced to work for 
no pay and tortured if they did not the report said 
today the country people or native peasants of liberia 
still live in hovels in monrovia and in huts in the undeveloped 
countryside with no running water or electricity the poverty is 
similar to that endured by the sharecroppers who eked out a living 
in americas south 
doe a master sergeant when he took power moved from a 
brokendown barracks with a leaking roof into the 6 million marble 
executive mansion that israelis built for president william 
tolbert whom the coup plotters slaughtered and disemboweled 
but doe perpetuated the corruption of the leaders he overthrew 
keeping the power and state money among his own krahn people who 
make up about 5 percent of the population 
however americoliberians continue to dominate the economy 
because of the wealth they had accumulated before 1980 
americoliberians still for the most part make up the educated 
class of liberia and the present exodus will hurt this countrys 
economy no end in the long run said clifford flemister a banker 
whose father brought him to this country at the age of 11 
if i had not come to liberia id probably be a gangster in 
chicago or a fat master sergeant in the army flemister 49 said 
in an interview adding he made his first million more than a 
decade ago 
like many americoliberians he has strong ties with the united 
states although he said he feels more at home in sweden where he 
went to college 
flemister was born in chattanooga tenn and owns a house in 
columbus ohio where his liberian wife has lived since the 1980 
coup and where his two children go to school 
liberias ties to the united states are omnipresent 
the lone star flag with red and blue stripes is a copy of 
the stars and stripes 
policemen wear handmedown uniforms from the united states 
some still with new york police department labels 
supermarkets sell planters corn chips and philadelphia cream 
cheese 
hey man whats up is the americanstyle greeting on the 
streets thickened by the liberian accents of natives whose tonal 
dialects make the expression difficult to understand 
its a matter of class culture and education that raises us 
above the superstition and cannibalism of some of the country 
folk said an americoliberian woman she spoke on condition of 
anonymity because such views are widely held but political 
dynamite right now

a shadowy group of young military 
officers using antiamerican rhetoric claims to lead an 
underground movement to overthrow president corazon aquino and the 
social system she represents 
the young officers union or you appeared last year as yet 
another clique in the factionalized armed forces of the philippines 
the extent of yous membership within the 15000member officer 
corps or even whether the organization exists at all beyond press 
releases is the subject of considerable speculation among 
government officials the press and foreign diplomats 
defense secretary fidel ramos dismisses you as a public 
relations creation of the betterknown reform the armed forces 
movement whose image has been tarnished because of links to 
discredited politicians 
but some officials apparently take the group seriously the 
military has offered a total of 77000 in rewards for the arrest 
of seven renegade officers identified as you leaders 
some military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
estimate that up to half the lieutenants and captains in field 
units are either members or supporters of you 
those estimates if true raise the specter of continued 
political instability in the philippines even after mrs aquino 
leaves office in 1992 
yous origins are as obscure as the organization itself sources 
said it emerged as a separate faction after renegade lt col 
gregorio gringo honasan failed in an attempt to overthrow mrs 
aquino in august 1987 
some officers claim you also played a major role in last 
decembers bloody coup attempt along with honasans reform the 
armed forces movement 
sources said the younger officers broke with honasan because 
they felt he and other movement leaders were indecisive and too 
closely allied to opposition politicians 
military sources both inside and outside you said the new 
organization was also born of frustration among junior officers 
with fighting the 21year war against communist rebels 
a colonel speaking on condition of anonymity said combat 
experience has persuaded many young officers that the real enemy is 
not the communist new peoples army but poverty social 
oppression corruption and the governments failure to deliver 
basic services 
these idealist guys who are out in the field see the 
difficulties in fighting the communist insurgents with very little 
help from the government and corruption in their military 
leaders said a general who also insisted on anonymity 
the colonel said charter members of you included intelligence 
officers who became sympathetic with some goals of the communists 
because of their exposure to rebel propaganda and deplorable 
conditions in the countryside 
like the communists you uses nationalistic antiamerican 
rhetoric it calls for sweeping social economic and political 
change and an end to american interference in this former us 
colony 
you leaders include capt washington javier capt rafael 
cardeno and lt diosdado valeroso all former members of the 
philippine constabularys special anticommunist intelligence 
command all are now underground 
according to sources you also has adopted the organizational 
structure of the outlawed communist party of the philippines 
one you member who uses the alias 1st lt ruben sanggalang 
said the leadership is divided into nine cells of about six members 
each 
each cell is led by a political officer who conducts 
teachins and is responsible for a specific task such as 
propaganda or communications he said 
as in the communist underground members of one cell usually 
know only one member of any other cell this enables cells to 
maintain contact without fear that a single arrest could compromise 
an entire group he said 
sources say you sponsors marxiststyle political discussions 
among combat units and is trying to establish support groups 
among civilians to broaden its base 
you statements are replete with the same references to 
american imperialism and the aquino puppet regime as those 
of the communists 
a considerable number of young military officers have come to 
realize that their supreme loyalty is to uphold the dignity 
freedom and social justice that the filipino people rightfully 
deserve you said in a recent statement 
we vow cory will not finish her term as an illegitimate 
president the statement added for as long as the majority of 
our beloved countrymen have to suffer the indignity of living in a 
prostituted sovereignty and sham democracy we vow to continue the 
struggle that we hope and pray will finally free our beloved 
countrymen from the clutches of the imperialist us government 
much of the antiamericanism appears linked to us intervention 
in the december coup attempt when us f4 phantom jets flew air 
cover for government forces 
we are warning them americans that the next time they 
meddle they will find themselves trapped in another vietnam

poland is awash in wouldbe benefactors 
executives ambassadors governors heads of state celebrities 
the parade of visitors trailing their good intentions through the 
countrys wrecked economy is endless 
the goodwill visits have become tiring but poland must must try 
to cash in on the bonanza before the angels from the west turn to 
another fashionable cause 
for every planeload of visitors ranking government members must 
clear schedules and prepare briefings they fear closing off any 
opportunity 
but now although very politely some poles are beginning to 
wonder will much of anything come of all the meetings briefings 
and conferences 
the poles are suffering from visitor fatigue said jerzy 
gabrielczyk a london businessman working as a top adviser to the 
industry ministry through the british knowhow aid fund 
they come and have meetings with the ministers they think it 
is fantastic to have a meeting with a minister then they shake 
hands and nothing ever happens he said 
some missions have been fruitful a german builder has started a 
new airport terminal and a french firm provided computer services 
for the may municipal elections the wellpublicized homecoming of 
heiress barbara piesecka johnson brought a monumental art exhibit 
but talks on investing in the gdansk shipyard broke off 
the visits can mark the beginning of genuine cooperation said 
jerzy baczynski writing in the weekly polityka 
yet on many occasions their only outcome are suggestions 
on further aid to poland subject to further study he said 
the foreign delegations are political parliamentary 
industrial international and countless 
a small sampling from recent weeks portuguese business leaders 
japanese investors the us importexport bank indias health 
minister irans vice minister of building britains foreign 
minister swedens minister for cooperation with developing 
countries east germanys defense minister former us national 
security adviser zbigniew brzezinski french police officers and 
the governor of maryland along with his states topsail schooner 
the pride of baltimore ii 
they come to teach how to speak english run a democratic 
election organize a free press and to learn how bad are the 
telephones how much would it cost to retool a factory 
the new polish government hopes they have also come to give 
harvesters for farmers computers for banks and money to help the 
nations young market economy grow 
but some it seems mainly come for what photographers call a 
grip and grin with polands leadership 
a western diplomat regularly required to arrange visits senses a 
new ambivalence among polish officials 
it is ambivalence because intellectually even some very 
impatient people realize they are getting pretty generous aid 
packages from most of the west and it is in their interests to be a 
good trooper the diplomat said 
still we have noticed a growing impatience with this constant 
flow of visitors he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
paul schurick maryland gov william donald schaefers press 
secretary said he felt it 
that notion was in the air that theyve seen a lot of 
foreign delegations here he said 
but the governor is convinced a personal visit is worthwhile if 
it comes with an allbusiness message said schurick weve got 
no intention to solve polands problems but if there can be two or 
three specific contracts with maryland then im going to do what i 
can to make them happen a personal visit could put it over the 
top 
polish officials are reluctant to talk about the downside of 
being so soughtafter 
one with a wellknown name whose portfolio includes pressing 
economic issues was overheard by a diplomat asking with a tinge of 
annoynce when faced with a new visitor what am i the minister 
of tourism 
polish leaders have developed a lists and b lists of meeters and 
greeters according to a visitors rank the western diplomat said 
everyone wants to see solidarity parliament leader bronislaw 
geremek everyone wants to see lech walesa but just because 
everyone wants to come to poland it doesnt mean that they can see 
them said another western diplomat 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz the architect of polands 
economic reform plan is one of those in huge demand said an 
aide 
first of all there are the politicians who come here out of 
curiosity he said and of course all the ambassadors are 
pushing their way in through doors and windows we decided 
thursdays would be the day for them so we see a maximum of two 
every thursday 
then there are business executives the aide said there is 
great danger that one could be granted a meeting and another 
wouldnt be so we are really trying to limit them of course 
we have to make exceptions for really big figures such as the head 
of the west german dresdner bank 
at the labor ministry director general leslaw nawacki said many 
visits have the nature of reconnaissance people just come to see 
what we are doing or what kind of help they could offer 
the main cost of these visits is hard work and time he 
said people who come often cant really understand the situation 
in poland going from socialism to a market economy nobody has 
done it before and everybody who comes here looks at it from the 
point of view of the west 
on the other hand we must admit with shame that we are not 
prepared either its something completely new to most of us

the usjapan security pact reaches its 30th 
anniversary this month its like an old pair of shoes 
it pinched a bit when new but now its wellworn and 
comfortable 
the pacts anniversary comes as the soviet bloc disbands and 
western allies in nato seek fundamental changes in their alliance 
us and japanese officials suggest no correspondingly 
fundamental look at their defense alliance although voices in both 
countries have called for change some saying the treaty is no 
longer needed 
that is a shortsighted analysis said koichiro matsuura 
directorgeneral of the north american bureau in the foreign 
ministry we do need it for the foreseeable future there are 
still sources of instability in the far east 
yet some regional problems show signs of easing chinesesoviet 
relations have warmed a beginning of rapprochement between south 
korea and the soviet union could ease tension on the divided korean 
peninsula an end to cambodias 11yearold civil war may be in 
sight 
the united states is reducing its troop strength in the far 
east now 135000 by 14000 or 15000 over three years without 
cutting combat capability 
while the united states will enjoy a drop in defense spending 
it calls on prosperous japan and south korea to assume greater 
responsibility for their own defense 
washington wants tokyo to boost the 3 billion it spends 
annually to support the 50000 us troops based in japan the 
government says it will do all it can but sharp questions are 
being asked in japan 
the liberalleaning asahi shimbuns aera magazine recently ran a 
long article questioning whether japan has had a free ride on 
defense as some assert in the us congress asahi shimbun said 
japan provides scarce land rentfree for us bases and goes beyond 
the treatys requirements in paying billions to support us troops 
the article said japanese military commanders reacted angrily to 
a washington post story quoting maj gen henry stackpole of the 
us marine corps as saying us forces in japan were a cork in 
the bottle to prevent japan from rearming 
such a comment means us troops are not partners in defense but 
merely occupying japan as they did after the war the japanese 
officers were quoted as saying anonymously 
the pentagon quickly said stackpoles remarks were not us 
government policy 
we were very happy to hear that matsuura said 
but both washington and tokyo come close to saying the same 
thing arguing that the treaty does not hold japan down but rather 
permits japan to have security under the us umbrella without a 
military buildup that could make its neighbors nervous 
matsuura acknowledged that other asian countries see that 
because japan has the security treaty with the united states japan 
can remain to be a small or medium power 
the 1960 treaty replaced the unequal 1952 treaty that was 
negotiated while the united states was fighting the korean war the 
1952 treaty granted the united states the right to base troops in 
japan but did not obligate it to defend the country 
the treaty also admonished japan not to develop an offensive 
military capability repeating a major aim of the us occupation 
of defeated japan that the country not be permitted again to 
threaten its neighbors 
the revised treaty did not include that cork in the bottle 
and it obliged the united states to defend japan which has a 
nowar clause in its postwar constitution 
in 1960 the streets of tokyo were convulsed by antitreaty 
demonstrations president dwight d eisenhowers plan to visit 
japan was called off amid fear for his safety those signing 
petitions against the treaty were said to number 13 million 6 
million held protest work stoppages 
their argument was not so much antiamerican but more a fear 
that the treaty could drag japan into war 
the conservative government rammed a bill ratifying the treaty 
through parliament on june 23 that year with the opposition absent 
on a protest walkout 
the united statesjapan security treaty of 1960 does not need to 
be renewed either party may give notice to the other of its 
intention to end the agreement and it would expire one year later 
the treatys anniversary will be marked with receptions in tokyo 
and washington and president bush and prime minister toshiki kaifu 
have scheduled a telephone conversation to praise the durable 
relationship 
yet underneath the selfcongratulations lie challenges to the 
word and spirit of the treaty 
friction over trade problems and technology could weaken the 
web of the alliance leaders in both countries cite this danger as 
a major reason for making sure the economic frictions are resolved 
the diminished soviet threat undercuts the rationale for the 
treaty tokyo and washington say the pact is a geopolitical anchor 
on which japan can negotiate with the soviets over disputed islands 
in the kuril chain off northern japan 
japans socialists who oppose the treaty are enjoying a 
political revival they say that if they took over the government 
they would not abruptly change the treaty but their longterm aim 
is to make japan a neutral unarmed nation 
socialist lawmaker tadatoshi akiba said the treaty will not be 
necessary sometime in the future maybe it will disappear 
without anyone noticing 
relations with the united states have gone far beyond security 
matters he said citing recent trade negotiations that seek to 
change each countrys society to reduce trade frictions

soviet and us 
teenagers plan to blaze a new trail in international relations 
next month when they work together to restore yellowstones 
firescarred landscape 
the visit by 12 youths from latvia and estonia was three years 
in the making and began with a trip to moscow by a national park 
service delegation 
the politics of getting these crews over here are 
incredible said helen wellborn a regional official for the 
33yearold student conservation association which is coordinating 
the exchange 
last fall it was decided the first exchange should involve 
yellowstone which is recovering from 1988 fires that blackened 
almost half the 22millionacre park 
the us and soviet teenagers will help repair trails in the 
park doing such things as clearing debris and countering erosion 
immediately afterward the crew of 12 american youths will 
travel to the soviet union to work on trails in lahemaa and gauja 
national parks with the latvian and estonian teams 
while the main emphasis is to learn more about each countrys 
parks the exchange is a gesture of international good will as 
much as anything else said destry jarvis the associations 
executive vice president in washington 
the exchange has involved long detailed planning tensions 
between moscow and the baltic states particularly lithuania have 
caused some worries 
if there was any sense or sign of military activities against 
latvia or estonia we would certainly cancel jarvis said 
the soviets will arrive in bozeman on july 5 and leave july 28 
during their stay they will also visit nearby grand teton national 
park and travel to cody for a rodeo jarvis said

if snappy quotes sold for a buck apiece 
norman j ornstein would be a wealthy man 
a political scientist at the american enterprise institute a 
rightofcenter think tank ornstein is hardly a household name 
but he happens to be one of the most widely quoted people in 
washington 
at the ring of a telephone he spouts expert opinions on just 
about any topic from perestroika to peanut subsidies from ethics 
to ethnic restaurants 
hes the king of quotes the sultan of sound bites the imam 
of instant analysis the titan of talking heads hes the darling 
of tv producers and the garrulous savior of quotehungry newspaper 
reporters battling a deadline 
if i have an opinion ill give it he says 
joann moriarty remembers her introduction to ornstein in 1986 
when she was a rookie washington reporter for states news service 
and needed some quotes for an electionyear story she was writing 
about rep james broyhill rnc 
the guy at the next desk said have you called norm ornstein 
yet i said norm who he said hes mr congressional 
comment so i phoned ornstein and he returned my call 
immediately 
she felt flattered then astonished 
i asked him about broyhill and it was like pressing a button 
he just spit it all out everything i wanted to know said ms 
moriarty who was grateful for ornsteins punchy oneliners but a 
bit embarrassed that shed never heard of him before 
i just didnt realize he was such a big cheese she said 
journalists praise ornstein for his insiders savvy his 
accessibility and his ability to cut quickly to the essence of a 
complex subject in lively easytounderstand language 
hes a master of the pithy quote says peggy robinson 
senior political producer for public tvs macneillehrer 
newshour where ornstein frequently appears as a guest 
commentator 
i try to restrain myself and not quote ornstein too often 
says helen dewar congressional correspondent for the washington 
post but when im analyzing a situation im frequently curious 
what he thinks and he will unfailingly say something i just have 
to quote its too good to pass up no one puts it so concisely or 
so well 
how did ornstein become washingtons most quotable man 
i was sitting in a laundromat a couple of blocks from near my 
apartment on capitol hill in the early 1970s twiddling my thumbs 
while my clothes were in the dryer he recalled 
hed just finished reading a book about former harlem 
congressman adam clayton powell and thought it would make for an 
interesting book review 
i had a yellow pad and a pen so i just dashed off a review in 
an hour and sent it to the post they printed it on the front page 
of the style section with a picture 
a short time later he talked to a feature writer about his 
favorite country inns his quotes popped up in a page one story in 
the wall street journal i was thunderstruck ornstein said 
and bitten by the media bug 
he started writing reviews and oped pieces for the post and the 
new york times which led to stints as a commentator and 
documentary editor for public television which led to appearances 
on network tv talk shows 
as his visibility grew reporters started calling him for quotes 
to lend an authoritative ring to their stories ornstein happily 
obliged 
i had a pretty good feel for what journalists were looking 
for and i found frankly that it served my own interests he 
said i could learn an awful lot by talking to reporters who were 
working on stories in ways that i didnt have the time to do 
myself there could be a pooling a sharing of information 
to keep abreast of things ornstein 41 reads voraciously at 
least five newspapers every day plus stacks of magazines and 
academic journals he goes to capitol hill three days a week to 
roam the corridors he spends about two hours a day talking to 
journalists 
he attends luncheons seminars receptions and speaking events 
to schmooze and pick things up he even quizzes fellow airline 
passengers and fathers on the sidelines of neighborhood soccer 
games 
spoofing ornsteins supposed omniscience the irreverent new 
york magazine spy peppered a special washington edition last month 
with no fewer than 17 opinions from ornstein on everything from 
taxi fares to sex scandals president bush ranked second with 14 
references 
one of spys editors called to say theyd gotten hundreds of 
letters ornstein said with a chuckle most of them asked who 
the hell is this guy norman ornstein

here are some quotes from political scientist 
norman ornstein 
 
on passage of the congressional pay raise 
its a zero issue its gone for all of ralph naders 
challenges and for all of the radio talk shows the public is not 
paying attention to this issue 
 
on a proposal by sen daniel moynihan dny to cut payroll 
taxes 
i dont think moynihan proposed it with the expectation that 
it would actually happen maybe im wrong but i think he proposed 
it for the shock value 
 
on special interest groups paying for travel by members of 
congress 
youre going to have much more luck slamming a guy for doing 
it on public expense than at the expense of private interests the 
public reaction is we dont give a damn if its taken out of 
special interests but dont take it out of our pockets

shifting winds pushed an oil slick from 
the supertanker mega borg northeastward sunday buying officials a 
little more time to prepare for when it reaches shore the coast 
guard said 
its switched from traveling northnorthwest to 
northnortheast overnight said petty officer mark sedwick 
that was good because it bought us some time staying parallel to 
shore now its running east of galveston and towards louisiana 
but that could change 
officials alerted communities north of galveston to louisiana 
that the tar balls may not be far away 
coast guard officials late sunday predicted tar balls from the 
spill would hit land tuesday 
its moving slow it didnt move any significant amount 
today petty officer david oney said 
the 30mile slick which lingered about 11 miles offshore had 
stretched into a light sheen in places and continued to drift 
slowly away from the tanker crippled 57 miles offshore from 
galveston since a june 8 explosion but officials said sunday that 
the leaking had apparently stopped and the threat of a new fire had 
ebbed 
coast guard officials also lowered the spill estimate from 46 
million gallons to 39 million gallons officials said sunday that 
salvage crews found approximately 700000 gallons of oil in smaller 
tanks that catch runoff from the larger tanks on the ship 
meanwhile officials said oileating microbes spread over part 
of the slick appeared to have done their job but another 
experiment using the bacteria was launched sunday to make sure 
emergency cleanup crews had expected the angolan crude to begin 
washing ashore late sunday near galveston but a morning flyover 
showed the slick moving northnortheast of the area 
the coast guard predicted early sunday that the tar balls could 
begin showing up in a 45mile stretch of coastline from high 
island some 30 miles north of galveston to sabine pass at the 
texaslouisiana border 
its not as bad as it would have been if it would have hit 
galveston bay theres not an estuary up there but its still 
bad said houston audubon society president gary clark 
the area includes small sandy beaches and thick marshland and 
contains several national wildlife refuges including one on the 
louisiana side 
meidt said if the slick moved toward the pass the sabine river 
water flowing into the gulf would act as a natural barrier pushing 
the oil farther into the gulf but sedwick said if it hit 
marshland it will be more difficult to clean up 
the bestcase scenario is a sandy beach sedwick said 
its easier to clean up a nice sandy beach than it would be a 
marshy area so thats what were hoping for 
coastal areas in eastern texas and western louisiana are largely 
marshland 
if it hits the marshlands it seeps into the ground and kills 
off the vegetation and the eggs in that area clark said adding 
that birds could starve if it gets into those marshlands its 
going to be there a while 
still he said it could have been much worse if the slick had 
hit galveston bay where brown shrimp and many fisheating sea 
birds are breeding 
clark said the society has set up a birdsaving team 
the texas general land office has trained hundreds of volunteers 
to work on the cleanup in sessions in galveston and angleton on 
saturday and in austin last week land commissioner garry mauro 
said 1200 volunteers from the states adoptabeach program are 
ready to help once the oil comes ashore 
salvage crews working on the norwegian tanker sunday began 
transferring oil from a leaking cargo bin to another holding tank 
aboard the vessel cutting off the flow of oil into the water 
the ship has definitely quit leaking sedwick said a 
reconnaissance crew flew over at 6 this morning and didnt find any 
oil within 5 miles of the ship thats a pretty good indication 
that theyve stopped the leak 
he said crews from smit america salvage inc also began pumping 
water out of another holding tank that had become flooded during 
firefighting efforts once the oil transfer and the water release 
are complete sedwick said crews will decide when to begin moving 
the remainder of the ships 38 milliongallon cargo to a smaller 
vessel a process called lightering he expected that to begin 
monday 
on saturday crews had continued dousing the hull of the mega 
borg with cooling water so it would not reignite when the oil 
transfers began sedwick said sunday officials believed there was 
no longer a threat of a reflash 
divers attempting to rescue five loggerhead sea turtles spotted 
saturday near the leading edge of the slick had been unable to 
locate the reptiles the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said but noaa planned to continue searching for the 
members of the threatened species

the leading rightwing opposition party 
appeared headed for control of congress after voters dealt a major 
blow to president rodrigo borja in congressional elections 
unofficial returns indicated 
the results of sundays balloting the leftist presidents 
popularity has dropped over his failure to keep down inflation 
were likely to bring an end to several years of political calm in 
this small andean nation 
the conservative social christian party of former president leon 
febres cordero gained 11 seats and will control 18 seats in the 
72member congress according to returns compiled by three national 
television stations 
the unofficial returns showed borjas democratic left party 
losing half of the 30 seats it held official results will not be 
available for a week 
analysts said the social christians would be able to dominate 
the legislature through pacts with smaller parties 
ecuador has 15 registered political parties and at least a dozen 
were expected to win seats in congress 
sixty seats were contested in the elections the seats have 
twoyear terms 
twelve seats with national constituencies have fouryear terms 
and will not be contested until 1992 
borja who has served two years of his fouryear term has seen 
his popularity undermined by his failure to keep a campaign promise 
to reduce inflation from more than 50 percent last year to 25 
percent 
febres cordero has warned that when congress convenes aug 10 
his party will put president rodrigo borja and his incompetent 
ministers in their place 
borja and febres cordero a fiery conservative who governed from 
1984 to 1988 are bitter political enemies 
the democratic left has dominated the unicameral legislature 
through an alliance with seven christian democratic congressmen 
that enabled borja to push through his economic program and avoid a 
clash of powers between congress and the executive branch of 
government 
democratic rule was restored in 1979 after a decade of 
dictatorship the three presidents who preceded borja faced 
oppositioncontrolled legislatures that blocked government 
initiatives and sparked disputes 
borja took office in august 1988 after defeating populist abdala 
bucaram in an election runoff in may of that year he pledged to 
bring rising inflation under control but has fallen far short of 
his target of 25 percent 
inflation hit a record 856 percent in 1988 the government was 
able to lower it to 54 percent last year by restricting spending 
in quito on sunday soldiers armed with assault rifles guarded 
polling stations as voters including colorfully dressed highland 
indian women lined up by the dozens many balloters said they 
wanted to vote early so they could catch the world cup soccer 
matches on television 
more than 52 million ecuadorans were registered to cast 
ballots voting is required by law in this coloradosized nation on 
the northwest shoulder of south america 
the were no reports of election violence

the death toll from flash floods that 
swept through a rural area of eastern ohio rose to 20 sunday as 
searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the ohio river 
sixteen people remained missing 
workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks and 
sifted through debris at places marked with red flags where search 
dogs indicated theyd detected human scents said national guard 
capt jim boling 
divers worked where the two creeks empty into the ohio 
four bodies were found sunday but two of those were not 
immediately identified and the list of missing was not revised to 
account for them 
the number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies and 
the removal of two other names a woman who called to say she was 
safe and a person who authorities werent sure lived in the area 
said coroners investigator chuck vogt 
the 20th victim was pulled from the mouth of pipe creek at the 
ohio river about seven miles south of shadyside vogt said 
another body was found in debris along wegee creek and two bodies 
were found earlier in the ohio he said 
that brought the confirmed death toll in thursdays floods to 
20 including five children 
twentythree dog teams from four states were searching for 
victims said boling the digging will continue at least through 
tuesday said fire chief mark badia 
the thing you find once you start into these brush piles and 
piles of trees are cars and they have to be torn apart and 
searched separately badia said everything you turn up creates 
a different situation 
but vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found 
alive 
its just been too long i dont think theres anybody alive 
out there he said you cant swim out there that long in the 
ohio river 
the wegee and pipe creeks overflowed thursday night during 
storms that poured 5 inches of rain onto eastern ohio in 3 hours 
the floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40 
others 
authorities said friday that 60 people were missing some of 
those were later found dead while others notified authorities that 
they were safe 
officials also learned that some of those feared missing had 
moved out of the area officials were comparing county property 
lists and data from the census bureau with information from 
residents and relatives boling said 
investigators sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually 
heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of 
threebridges over the creeks badia said rainwater running down 
hillsides forced debris into the creeks forming dams at each 
bridge the dams broke under the water pressure 
eventually the bridges couldnt hold any more the debris 
broke loose and thats when we got three big gushes of water he 
said 
as rescue efforts continued the national guard cleared roads 
and bridges leading into the stricken area 
eighteen ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas 
since tornadoes and flooding first struck may 25 
across the border in west virginia gov gaston caperton said 
sunday he had no precise dollar figure on damage from flooding 
friday along a fivemile stretch near new martinsville and in 
nearby ohio county but estimated it will run into millions of 
dollars 
no deaths or serious injuries were reported 
caperton toured flooded areas in wheeling and the doolin run 
community near new martinsville he said he saw tremendous 
devastation to hundreds of houses house trailers and cars 
state public safety secretary joseph skaff estimated that 
repairing and replaceing bridges and roads will cost about 750000 
national guard soldiers helped with cleanup sunday

women are still being excluded from groups 
studied in federal health research projects despite an official 
policy that requires they be represented congressional 
investigators said today 
the national institutes of health has funded some projects 
that studied only men even though the diseases being researched 
affect both men and women mark v nadel of the general 
accounting office said in testimony prepared for a congressional 
hearing 
reps patricia schroeder dcolo and olympia snowe rmaine 
who lead the congressional caucus for women called on nih to take 
immediate action to eliminate sexism in medical practices and 
include women in research paid for by the federal government 
the research community and nihs attitude has been to consider 
over half the population as some sort of special case said ms 
snowe their attitude has been like that old song from the 
musical my fair lady why cant a woman be more like a man 
in a statement mrs schroeder told the house energy and 
commerce health subcommittee that gender difference is just not 
considered to be good science and since most research is conducted 
on men to begin with that too often means women get left in the 
dark 
william f raub acting nih director also was called to testify 
om his agencys performance 
nadel whose agency is the investigative arm of congress said 
nih has made little progress in implementing a 1986 policy that 
women be included in research study populations unless it would be 
scientifically inappropriate to do so 
he cited a study of 22000 male physicians begun in 1981 by the 
national heart lung and blood institute that determined that men 
who took an aspirin every other day reduced their incidence of 
heart attacks 
institute officials told us women were not included in this 
study because to do so would have increased the cost nadel 
said however we now have the dilemma of not knowing whether 
this preventive strategy would help women harm them or have no 
effect 
mrs schroeder who with ms snowe requested the study of nih 
practices said american women are concerned about the low 
investment in womens health issues 
just ask the almost 150000 women who will develop breast 
cancer this year she said one in every nine american women is 
currently diagnosed with the disease compared with one in every 20 
in 1961 yet we currently spend only 17 million a year on basic 
breast cancer research 
earlier this year the national cancer institute refused to 
fund a major study on the effect of diet in reducing the risk of 
breast cancer and heart disease in women mrs schroeder added 
she said too that american women have fewer contraceptive 
options available to them than european women and women in many 
developing countries and that there is great need for research into 
treatment of infertility 
sexism in medical practices is a reality mrs schroeder 
said for some women there are fatal consequences 
she said the womens issues caucus will propose legislation next 
month to bar the arbitrary exclusion of women from federally funded 
research

late this week budget talks between the bush 
administration and congress should evolve from preliminary 
technical discussions into hard bargaining with electionyear 
politics and billions of dollars at stake 
but none of the participants pretends to know what will happen 
i wouldnt hazard a guess said one senate budget committee 
chairman james sasser dtenn these things can go on for so 
long and then suddenly as if by magic you seem to reach a critical 
mass and then theres an agreement 
after five weeks and eight private sessions the democratic and 
republican sides agree that somewhere between 45 billion and 60 
billion in new taxes and spending cuts are needed for fiscal 1991 
which starts oct 1 
unless some deal is worked out by that date the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law will force tens of billions of dollars worth 
of spending cuts an amount both parties say is intolerable 
yet neither side is eager to be the first to lay a plan on the 
bargaining table at sessions continuing this week and risk being 
accused of championing something that the voters might find 
dreadful 
among the battlegrounds will democrats have to swallow cuts in 
some of their favorite social programs and will president bushs 
campaign mantra of no new taxes become obsolete 
democrats say the bargaining can only begin with a concrete 
offer from bush who called for the talks early last month 
i thought implicitly at the beginning that the administration 
would present a proposal here sasser said last week 
but republicans say there is no need for the white house to lay 
down a proposal and it has no plans to do so 
if democrats continue to insist that bush present a budget 
proposal it would be clear at that point that the democrats 
dont intend to work out an agreement said a gop bargainer sen 
phil gramm of texas 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota a republican negotiator who will 
retire from congress this winter said he might be willing to push 
a plan forward if no one else will 
if they need a fall guy and its said that lame ducks are 
good at that kind of stuff i wouldnt mind being put in that 
position he said 
but thats not likely to satisfy democrats 
were not interested in hearing from republican legislative 
members said sasser thats not what its all about this is a 
negotiation between the executive and legislative branches 
contributing to the unpredictability of the talks is the 
schizophrenic outlooks of the democratic and republican teams 
each side has pragmatists like white house budget director 
richard darman and house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif they seem above all to want a deal that once and for all 
takes a bite out of the federal deficit which some project could 
exceed 200 billion next year 
but the two teams also have highly partisan members such as 
sasser and white house chief of staff john sununu who seem leery 
of agreeing to anything that might provide a campaign advantage to 
the other party 
bargainers say the litmus test for the talks will be whether 
they have accomplished anything by the start of congress july 4 
recess they argue that agreement is needed by around then for 
lawmakers to have time this year to enact a deficitreduction 
package 
everyone feels that if we work day to day until then we ought 
to be either well on our way to putting an agreement together or be 
pretty much facing a task thats harder than everybody thought 
said panetta

a roadside vendor sells a watermelon for cash 
a doctor treats a plumber in exchange for a faucet repair a giant 
corporation exaggerates a deduction and the federal tax gap gets 
bigger 
the gap between federal income taxes owed and paid voluntarily 
is expected to swell to 100 billion this year and to as high as 
127 billion two years from now that does not include uncounted 
billions more taxes owed on income from illegal sources 
although the dollar figure grows the tax gap is about the same 
17 percent of taxes owed that it was when the internal revenue 
service began keeping the statistics in 1973 
viewed another way individuals and businesses pay about 83 
percent of their income taxes without further prodding by the irs 
and avoid the rest chiefly by underreporting income and 
overstating deductions 
that is not good enough for congress which is interested in any 
painless way to reduce the budget deficit or for the irs whose 
leaders fear more and more americans will join the ranks of tax 
cheats if they see evidence that others are getting away with it 
the latest analysis by the irs indicates that businesses 
ranging from the momandpop grocery stores to lawyers to big 
corporations are responsible for more than 60 percent of the gap 
the worst offenders are oneowner businesses and informal 
suppliers the irss designation for sellers childcare 
providers home repairmen and roadside vendors for example who 
usually deal in cash and seldom maintain a regular place of 
business those two groups account for more than onequarter of the 
tax gap 
nobody has a quick solution but lawmakers irs officials and 
nongovernment experts agree on the problems 
not enough tax returns are audited fewer than 1 percent of 
individuals and 2 percent of corporations will be audited this 
year however irs officials point out that about 40 percent of 
individuals whose incomes are almost entirely from wages interest 
and dividends get what amounts to an automatic audit because their 
returns are matched by computer against documents that list their 
earnings 
irs enforcement actions mainly audits and steppedup 
collection measures reduce the tax gap by about 22 billion a 
year 
too few people go to jail for cheating despite an almost 
legendary reputation for criminal investigation it took the irs 
to get al capone the fact is the irs brings criminal charges for 
tax violations against fewer than 3000 people a year the figure 
is declining 
there is a general perception in the service irs that 
criminal tax enforcement has become too much oriented toward drug 
dealers and the illegal sector and as a result there is not enough 
threat to ordinary citizens to be a credible deterrent says 
peter scott former acting chief counsel for the irs who now is 
with coopers amp lybrand accountants 
requiring the irs to share in budget cuts of the last several 
years has been counterproductive because the agency collects 200 
for each 1 it spends its collection division has been especially 
hurt 
over the years the irs has built up a backlog of accounts 
receivable assessed but uncollected taxes that totals about 87 
billion and involves 13 million taxpayers the agency says as much 
as half that will never be collected because of death bankruptcy 
or other reasons 
the irs is plagued with high turnover often outgunned by 
highpriced corporate lawyers and prone to mistakes its computers 
crank out erroneous taxdue notices that seem almost impossible to 
correct employees many of them temporary workers give the wrong 
answer to at least one of every four tax questions on average the 
irs loses 70 percent of additional taxes assessed when a taxpayer 
appeals 
closing the tax gap requires a better performance irs 
commissioner fred t goldberg jr told congress earlier this year 
taxpayers are willing to pay what they owe he said they 
cannot abide complexity uncertainty administrative burdens and 
hassles with the irs that may take months or years to resolve 
irs computers are woefully outmoded but a decadelong 
modernization costing upwards of 8 billion is under way 
any creditcard company can tell a customer the status of his or 
her account within seconds but irs computers cant talk to 
each other when a tax return is processed in austin texas for 
example it must be keyed onto a tape which then is flown and 
trucked to the irs computer center in martinsburg wva to be 
entered into a taxpayers file 
slow computers affect more than taxpayer services the general 
accounting office says the irs lacks sufficient data to either 
identify the issues most responsible for the most troublesome 
pockets of the tax gap or to track how well its programs reduce the 
tax gap 
president bushs irs budget for 1991 up 635 million to 61 
billion would continue the computer modernization and pay for more 
auditors and collectors and further improvements in taxpayer 
services the plan is designed to increase collections by 9 
billion over five years 
but the national treasury employees union which represents irs 
workers says the percentage of returns audited would drop and the 
total of unpaid accounts would rise under bushs budget by 
spending 42 billion more than proposed over the next five years 
the irs could collect almost 25 billion more the union says

individuals and corporations underpaid federal 
income taxes on their legal earnings by 942 billion in 1987 the 
internal revenue service estimates 
this figure expected to rise above 100 billion this year is 
called the tax gap the difference between what is owed and what is 
paid voluntarily without any additional pressure by the irs 
here according to the irs is what accounted for the tax gap in 
1987 the latest year for which detailed estimates are available 
the first figure is the dollar value attributable to each factor 
the figure in parentheses is that factors share of the total gap 
percentages do not total 100 because of rounding 
unreported income by informal supplies such as roadside 
vendors and childcare providers and soleproprietor businesses

huge feedlots that turn out the choicest beef 
have been increasing in number for many years and an agriculture 
department economist says the trend shows no sign of letting up 
fewer than 200 feedlots marketed more than half the nations fed 
cattle last year said ken krause of the departments economic 
research service all had capacities of 16000 head or more 
less than 30 years ago there were only 23 feedlots with 
capacities of 16000 head or more and in 1962 those accounted for 
only 83 percent of the 146 million fed cattle marketed 
by 1980 fed cattle output had increased to 232 million head 
while large lots had become more important in the feeding of the 
increased fed cattle herd he said in the june issue of farmline 
magazine 
the largest feedlots continued to increase in the 1980s last 
year 198 of those fed produced about 51 percent of the nations 
output of fed cattle 
krause said new information collected by the usdas national 
agricultural statistics service showed that 32 feedlots with 
capacities of 50000 head or more accounted for 17 percent of the 
fed cattle marketed last year 
although nass confidentiality rules do not permit 
identification of the largest existing lots several operators 
indicated that their lots have 100000head onetime capacity 
he said 
typically feeder cattle weighing 600 to 800 pounds are put in 
the pens and fed a balanced diet made up of a concentrate 
often corn or grain sorghum a protein supplement such as soybean 
or cottonseed meal and some silage or hay for roughage 
after five months or so the fattened finished cattle now 
weighing 1000 to 1200 pounds are shipped to packing plants for 
slaughter and distribution in the consumer pipeline 
krause said there has been a significant decrease in the number 
of feedlots smaller than 1000head capacity those are often 
associated with familysize farming operations that also produce 
crops and perhaps other livestock 
at the same time the fed cattle industry meaning larger 
feedlot operations has been shifting to four great plains states 
in general the location shift has been to colorado kansas 
nebraska and texas where over 71 percent of the cattle were 
finished in 1989 krause said these four states finished only 
285 percent of the fed cattle in 1962 
the decline of small feedlots meanwhile has been mainly in the 
corn belt states iowa for example had 50000 lots in 1962 most 
of them small those turned out 18 percent of the nations beef 
by 1989 iowa was down to about 16000 feedlots accounting for 
just 8 percent of the nations beef cattle 
krause said that while the number and importance of small 
feedlots have declined the last 30 years nationally they still 
produced more than 16 percent of the fed beef last year

georgia florida the carolinas and virginia the report said 
the top three cotton counties by value of sale in 1987 were 
fresno kern and kings in californias san joaquin valley 
combined with three other valley counties merced madera and 
tulare the six california counties produced about 890 million 
in cotton sales in 1987 rivaling the 970 million produced in all 
counties east of the mississippi river the report said

by the end of the decade a vaccine to combat 
the aids virus likely will be available for widespread use a 
government aids expert says 
dr anthony fauci director of aids research at the national 
institutes of health said sunday that the decade of the 90s 
will see some important advances that will have a positive impact 
on hivinfected individuals 
over the next several years youll see a real acceleration of 
vaccine development and hopefully by the end of the 1990s there 
will be a vaccine that is available for widespread use fauci 
said 
an estimated 1 million americans are believed to be infected by 
hiv or human immunodeficiency virus which can develop into the 
aids disease 
the bush administration has come under fire from aids activists 
and congressional critics for not spending enough money on aids 
research and moving too slowly in approving new drugs to fight the 
disease 
the federal government is spending 116 billion in the current 
fiscal year on aids research and the administration has recommended 
an increase to 1245 billion in fiscal 1991 
fauci appeared on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley in advance of the sixth international aids conference 
which starts wednesday in san francisco 
the conference billed as the largest gathering to date of hiv 
scientists health care workers and policymakers will run through 
june 24

despite perceived setbacks in opinion 
polls leaders of the countrys largest antiabortion group vowed 
to keep fighting in the coming decades 
the president of the national right to life committee which 
wound up its threeday annual meeting sunday urged optimism in the 
face of what he said were skewed public opinion polls bad press 
and turncoat politicians 
you would not be able to tell here that we had suffered any 
reverses jc willke said 
delegates bought buttons bumper stickers and watched 
antiabortion videos 
one poster showed an infant with the words kill her now and 
its considered murder kill her three months ago and its called 
abortion 
willke said the committees goals and tactics have not changed 
since the supreme court gave states more power to regulate abortion 
last year the groups ultimate goal remains making abortion 
illegal nationwide 
unlike groups such as operation rescue the national right to 
life committee avoids clinic blockades and other frontline tactics 
and focuses on lobbying legislation and other political activity 
susan smith the organizations associate legislative director 
said the group is working uphill to counter the media hype that 
the proabortion movement creates 
ten 20 years down the road i expect well be a little further 
along than we are now smith said 
one workshop at the convention was titled working a biased 
media to the advantage of the movement 
public opinion surveys have frightened some politicians away 
from the antiabortion stance said richard e ryan senior vice 
president of the texasbased polling company tarrance amp associates 
but he questioned the surveys validity 
even though about 60 percent of those polled tend to favor 
allowing abortion some 50 percent to 60 percent also tend to favor 
placing some controls on abortion ryan said 
they are the mushy middle he said they want to have 
their cake and eat it too

floridas electric chair and its manmade 
lightning forever silenced the wouldbe assassin of franklin 
roosevelt and jolted the life out of the charming ted bundy 
dubbed old sparky the threelegged oak chair has killed 219 
inmates in 66 years 
but only the execution of john spenkelink the first person in 
the nation to be put to death against his will after the us 
supreme court reinstated the dealth penalty in 1976 has stirred 
as much controversy in florida as the recent botched execution of 
jesse tafero 
because of taferos execution in which 12inch flames and 
sparks leaped through the hood over his head attorneys for poor 
inmates want to ban the chair they claim tafero was burned alive 
and that the chair is cruel and unusual punishment 
that is the issue in the appeal of black widow killer judi 
buenoano the state supreme court on friday granted her a stay to 
give her lawyers time to pursue that argument 
ms buenoano was condemned for the 1971 poisoning death of her 
husband she is serving a life term for the 1980 drowning murder of 
her paralyzed son 
she stands to become the first woman to die in floridas 
electric chair since it came into use in 1924 
hewn from an oak tree by prisoners the chair which is at 
florida state prison replaced hanging it has been used to execute 
175 people convicted of murder 43 convicted of rape and one 
convicted of a fatal kidnapping 
one of the most notorious to die in the chair was giuseppe 
zangara executed in 1933 for the shooting death that same year of 
chicago mayor anton cermak cermak was fatally wounded in an 
attempted assassination of presidentelect franklin roosevelt in 
miami 
an account of the execution said zangara muttered in 
deliberate measured tones the rich are a bunch of scrum the 
rich are a bunch of just then a switch clicked and the manmade 
lightning struck through its appointed target and forever silenced 
the muttering voice 
after a 15year lull caused in part by a us supreme court 
ruling that put the death penalty on hold executions resumed in 
florida in 1979 with spenkelink unlike utahs gary gilmore the 
first person executed after the death penaltys reinstatement 
spenkelink did not go willingly 
the bestknown killer to die in floridas electric chair was 
bundy executed last year for the slaying of a girl bundy also was 
convicted of murdering two college students in tallahassee and was 
believed to have killed as many as 50 women 
florida has executed 22 people since the 1976 us supreme court 
ruling second only to texas 35 the latest person to die in the 
chair was tafero on may 4 
witnesses said he appeared to breathe and move after the first 
and second jolts the malfunction opened a new avenue of appeals 
an inmate about to be executed in florida will likely be 
burned and tortured during that execution will be conscious during 
the event and will suffer pain said the appeal filed in the 
buenoano case 
color photographs of the bodies of nine executed men accompanied 
the appeals filed by statepaid attorneys in buenoanos case and in 
another death row case 
after gov bob martinez ordered an investigation the state 
department of corrections concluded taferos death was instant but 
that the mistaken replacement of a natural sponge with a synthetic 
sponge had caused the burning 
but the statepaid attorneys who are from an agency that 
represents poor death row inmates maintain that the problem lies 
with a faulty electrode that reduced the electricity from 2000 
volts to as low as 100 or 90 
they blasted the department for testing the flammability of the 
sponge by using a household toaster and alleged the problem had not 
been fixed 
spokesmen for martinez and corrections secretary richard dugger 
said the state stood by its investigation dugger called the 
allegations absurd

last month communist north korea 
turned over what it said were the remains of five us servicemen 
killed in the korean war now american officials say theyre not 
sure whose remains they have 
the remains were handed over to to a us congressional 
delegation in an emotional memorial day ceremony in the truce 
village of panmunjom in what was billed as the first return of us 
korean war dead since 1954 
only two of the five bodies were identified by name by the north 
koreans based on dogtags they said were found with them they were 
us army 1st lt jack j saunders 27 of ogden utah and army 
cpl arthur leo seaton 20 of chester pa 
but the united nations command said today that the bodies which 
were sent to the armys central identification laboratory in 
honolulu for identification were not those of saunders and seaton 
while north korea has indicated name association for two of 
the five remains dental and physical characteristics of the 
remains were compared with the dental and physical records of the 
those two individuals with negative results the command said 
the command said its findings were preliminary but said it did 
not appear that the other remains returned were those of saunders 
or seaton either 
until the identification process is complete we cant even be 
sure they were the remains of americans the command added 
the soldiers relatives have been told of the findings the 
command said 
the other three sets of remains were not identified by north 
korea but it said at the time of the return that they were 
believed to be those of another army servicemen and two us air 
force members 
all five were believed to have been prisoners of war who died in 
hwanghae pukto province south of north koreas capital of 
pyongyang 
saunders and seaton had been listed as missing in february 1951 
the pentagon said according to us military 8172 us soldiers 
remain unaccounted for from the war 
the return of the remains was widely seen as a sign of healing 
and reconciliation after decades of emnity an effort by north 
korea to improve relations with the united states 
the two countries do not have diplomatic ties 
the united nations command says 33629 us soldiers were killed 
and 103284 wounded in the war more than 2 million koreans were 
killed 
the 16nation command led by an american general was formed at 
the outbreak of the 195053 korean war to help south korea repel 
invaders from the north 
there were largescale returns of remains of us war dead in 
1953 and 1954 then after years of no returns the north koreans 
announced may 14 that they would turn over the remains of the five 
ho jong north koreans deputy permanant representative at its 
un mission said at the time that the communist government was 
prepared to discuss the return of more remains 
he said the move was an eloquent illustration of north 
koreas wilingness to settle pending issues with the us 
government in a good way 
north korea acknowledged for the first time in january 1988 that 
it was still holding the remains of un command war dead

a decision to accept more planes per hour at 
kennedy airport than an air traffic supervisor recommended may have 
contributed to the crash of a fuelstarved avianca jet new york 
newsday reported 
the jet crashed in cove neck on jan 25 killing 73 people 
after it had been placed in holding patterns for more than an hour 
as it flew up the east coast from colombia 
when the weather is good kennedy accepts about 60 planes an 
hour but the day of the crash because of fog and rain a local 
air traffic supervisor recommended a flow of 22 planes an hour 
newsday reported sunday 
however his recommendation was rejected the newspaper said 
after consultations with officials including the federal 
aviation administrations central flow headquarters in washington 
the rate was set at 33 per hour the newspaper said citing 
unidentified sources 
yet because of the bad weather the airport barely landed 22 
planes an hour the newspaper said 
the flow system fell apart an unidentified source was 
quoted as saying it did not work the way it was supposed to 
work they controllers were playing a game of catchup all 
afternoon they never caught up 
the jets crew never declared a fuel emergency which would have 
enabled it to get priority to land before it ran out of fuel 
an unidentified investigator told the paper that if the airport 
had decided to accept fewer planes there might have been fewer 
ahead of the avianca jet 
the national transportation safety board will hold hearings 
wednesday and thursday on the accident

officials hope the second phase of an 
experiment using oileating bacteria to break up a slick from the 
wrecked mega borg will remove any doubts that the process works 
on friday about 100 pounds of the bacteria was spread over an 
acre of the slick caused by the norwegian supertanker that exploded 
june 8 in the gulf of mexico the coast guard estimates 39 million 
gallons of light crude spilled 
a flyover sunday showed little oil in the treated water and the 
microbes appeared to have done the job state officials said but 
there was no conclusive proof and a second test application began 
sunday 
there certainly wasnt any oil over there said texas water 
commission chairman bj wynne but wynne said it could not be 
determined if the oil was removed by the microbes or currents or if 
a buoy marking the treated area had moved 
it was the first use of the process called bioremediation on 
open water the process was used this year to clean rocks fouled in 
alaska by the exxon valdez spill in march 1989 
the naturally occurring bacteria break oil down into a harmless 
fatty substance that is eaten by fish 
in the second application the microbes were to be unleashed in 
one area while another area would go untreated

the hardest part after a killer flood a 
coroners deputy says is telling relatives a child has been lost 
you expect death in the elderly and it doesnt bother me 
chuck vogt the belmont county coroners investigator said sunday 
but death in the young thats hard theyve never had a 
chance 
it is vogts job to notify relatives of people who were killed 
after 5 inches of rain fell in about three hours in eastern ohios 
belmont county on thursday and sent a wall of water crashing down 
the wegee and pipe creek valleys 
at least 20 people died and 16 were missing 
vogt a lifelong resident of this town of about 4700 said he 
knew most of the dead and knew relatives of the others he is 
responsible for taking survivors to the morgue to identify the 
remains of loved ones 
i think that right now it hasnt hit me yet itll hit me 
later when all this has calmed down and im sure ill be a basket 
case some time next week vogt said 
he said it was especially hard to face the mother of kerri 
polivka kerri was with amber colvin a 9yearold who was swept 
seven miles down a creek and rescued friday in the ohio river 
i see that girls mother the girl who was with amber vogt 
said and she gives me that look that says what have you found 
can you tell me anything 
vogt said the worst of his job may still be ahead he said he 
did not expect any of the missing who were swept down the creek to 
be found alive 
its just been too long i dont think theres anybody alive 
out there you cant swim out there that long in the ohio river 
vogt said 
he said bodies submerged in the river would probably begin 
surfacing today as gases in them accumulate 
vogt wasnt the only worker putting in overtime since the flood 
the sirens that marked the first three days after the storm have 
given way to the roar of bulldozers and dump trucks automobiles 
crushed by the water or wrapped around trees like bow ties were 
taken out on national guard flatbeds 
pickandshovel crews worked ahead of most of the earthmoving 
equipment searching for victims in piles of debris where search 
dogs indicated bodies might lie 
if theres enough equipment in there im talking dozers and 
trucks to haul it out and loaders to load it with enough 
equipment and a months time they can clean up a lot of this 
debris and get it out said don keyfer who drives a backhoe for 
a construction company 
it could take two years before the area is back to normal he 
said

radical reformers are threatening to walk out of 
next months communist party congress if their demands are not met 
opening a rift that could lead to the creation of a new party 
a conference of the reform faction democratic platform on sunday 
instructed its delegates to the party congress that begins july 2 
to leave the session if delegates do not eliminate party control 
over the armed forces the kgb security police and other government 
bodies 
if the 4700 delegates to the congress balk at those and other 
demands as seems likely the groups estimated 100 delegates are 
to quit and organize a new party by september 
factions have been banned in the communist party since 1922 
also sunday the mainstream moscow city party organization 
published a precongress platform that sharply criticized national 
leaders for drifting into an ideological and organizational 
crisis that was costing them support 
the danger for the party today is a split among communists who 
support perestroika said the moscow party platform it did not 
directly mention soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the moves reflected the growing polarization of party politics 
and widening dissatisfaction with gorbachevs failure to push 
reforms past conservatives who retain control of many government 
and party bodies 
democratic platform leaders claim to have the general support of 
40 percent of the 18 million communist party members a much higher 
ratio than reflected in the composition of the party congress 
but they say that only about 500000 party members would take 
the decisive step of actually leaving the party to form a new one 
democratic platform founded six months ago has included boris 
n yeltsin who last month was elected president of the russian 
republic and also the new mayors of moscow and leningrad gavriil 
popov and anatoly sobchak but they have cut their activities in 
the group since their elections 
the resolution adopted sunday by the democratic platform after 
two days of often stormy debate blamed the crisis facing the 
soviet union in part on the inconsistency indecisiveness and 
either incompetence or unwillingness of the leading party 
structures to carry out a radical reform 
the polarization of political forces is accelerating it 
said 
the group told members who are delegates to the party congress 
to present a package of demands that include the transformation of 
the communist party from a totalitarian type into a 
parliamentary type that would compete with other political 
groups 
the resolution demands the communist party divide its billions 
of dollars worth of buildings publishing houses vehicles and 
other assets among emerging political groups 
those steps would vastly reduce the role of the communist party 
earlier this year the party agreed to give up its constitutionally 
guaranteed monopoly on power but has been slow to surrender its 
privileges in society 
the resolution published sunday by the moscow party 
organization the largest and most influential in the nation was 
not as radical as the democratic platform resolution but it also 
called for an end to party control over the armed forces police 
and kgb 
it said that during the years of totalitarianism and 
stagnation from 1929 until 1985 the party had developed a 
nondemocratic structure of power and that its mistakes had cost 
many lives

a cambodian rebel group said today it 
had seized almost all of the central province of kompong thom 
just north of the national capital of phnom penh and briefly held 
its capital city 
the report could not be independently verified in the past the 
guerrillas in the past have exaggerated military successes 
if the claim were true however it would be a significant 
development the provincial capital kompong thom is just 63 miles 
north of phnom penh 
the statement was from the forces of prince norodom sihanouk 
one of three guerrilla armies fighting the countrys 
vietnameseinstalled government 
the guerrilla groups have intensified attacks since september 
when vietnam said it pulled its last troops out of cambodia 
the guerrillas seized several strategic areas mostly in the 
west and northwest bordering thailand only to have them retaken by 
the government 
fighting has continued although sihanouk and prime minister hun 
sen on june 5 signed in tokyo an agreement calling for military 
selfrestraint 
hopes for an early political settlement were set back with the 
failure of talks last week between the deputy foreign ministers of 
vietnam and china china is the major supplier of arms to the 
guerrillas 
in a statement the guerrillas claimed they launched a 
fourpronged attack on kompong thom city and seized it sunday after 
three hours of fighting 
they said they withdrew after a few hours though due to the 
large civilian population and for security reasons 
the rebels claimed to have seized three district towns in the 
province in the past three weeks 
as of yesterday the entire province is totally in the hands 
of the cambodian national resistance forces the statement said

a 2dayold ceasefire between 
government troops and tamil guerrillas collapsed today amid new 
fighting 
the truce which began saturday had been marred by minor 
attacks by today both sides reported exchanges of fire along sri 
lankas east coast and in the north 
the government and the tamil tiger rebels had already accused 
each other of using the ceasefire to fortify their positions and 
to bring in supplies and reinforcements 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told parliament the 
government has been compelled to fight a rebel spokesman 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the war situation 
continues 
ethnic tamil militants took up arms against the 
sinhalesedominated government in 1983 in their quest for a 
separate homeland 
at least 378 people have been killed since june 11 when the 
rebels broke a 13monthold truce the death toll was compiled from 
reports by witnesses military sources and tiger officials 
rebels in the east coast town of batticaloa today set fire to 
the police station they captured a week ago and streamed out of 
town toward the jungle in jeeps vans and small trucks a local 
journalist reported batticaloa is 140 miles northeast of colombo 
on sunday the rebels blew up a bridge outside batticaloa in an 
attempt to keep the army from advancing the tiger spokesman said 
government troops hold an airstrip outside the town 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said government forces 
returned fire in at least two areas near batticaloa and also near 
the north central town of vavuniya both areas were the scene of 
fighting last week 
last weeks battles began after the tigers overran the 
batticaloa police station then seized other stations in the region 
at least 850 policemen ordered by their government not to 
return fire surrendered to the tigers last week the fate of most 
of them is still unknown 
a survivor and military sources said at least 137 of the captive 
policemen were gunned down by the tigers after they surrendered 
the government opened direct negotiations with the tigers in may 
1989 and implemented a ceasefire that had generally held until 
last week 
during the negotiations the government pledged to delegate 
provincial autonomy to the tamils in the north and east at the 
same time it allowed the tigers virtually a free hand in the 
region 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
are predominantly hindu and claim the sinhalese majority who are 
mostly buddhist discriminate against them in jobs and education 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population 
more than 11000 people have been killed since the insurrection 
began

aides to foreign minister david levy are angry 
with prime minister yitzhak shamir for rebuffing american proposals 
on starting israelipalestinian peace talks a leading heberw daily 
reported today 
the haaretz newspaper also said levy blocked the delivery of a 
message shamir wanted to send to egyptian leaders through the 
israeli embassy in cairo last week 
shamirs new rightwing government assumed power last week 
levy is the no 2 man in the likud bloc and his aspirations to 
eventually replace shamir as likud leader have caused past diputes 
between the two 
in shamirs last cabinet levy was a chief critic of us peace 
plans but he has taken a more moderate stance since taking over 
the foreign ministry 
levys spokeswoman aliza goren said in a telephone interview 
today that the reports of disagreement between shamir and levy were 
an exaggeration and blown out of proportion 
levy 52 was hospitalized last week after a mild heart attack 
he has begun working from his sickbed and is expected to be 
released this weekend 
israelius ties have been strained in the past year because of 
disagreement over middle east policies and the american dialogue 
with the plo which israel considers a terrorist organization 
haaretz said aides to levy were annoyed by statements made 
friday by shamirs top political adviser yossi benaharon 
benaharon suggested on army radio that israel wanted to shelve 
peace proposals raised last year by secretary of state james a 
baker iii as a way to revive israels stalled initiative for 
palestinian elections 
we are asking to start from the beginning benaharon said 
according to haaretz levys aides considered the remark among 
others coming from shamirs office to be unneccesary instigation 
at a sensitive moment 
haaretz did not say what was in the censored message to cairo 
it said benaharon sent it to the israeli embassy in egypt last 
week and that levy ordered staff members not to deliver it 
the newspaper said levy was angry that he had not been consulted 
before the message was sent to egypt the only arab country to make 
peace with israel and a key middleman in negotiations with the 
palestinians 
shamir himself sharply criticized the united states today for 
continuing a dialogue with the plo despite an aborted seaborne 
attack may 30 that was claimed by a plo faction 
week after week passes and they are still holding 
consultations there in the political offices in the united states 
about whether indeed the plo is still a terrorist organization 
shamir told students in a speech in a tel aviv suburb 
the united states has demanded that the plo condemn the aborted 
raid as a condition for continuing diplomatic contacts that began 
18 months ago in the plos home base of tunis so far the plo has 
only indirectly criticized the action

cardinal john j oconnor says a newspaper 
column he wrote last week should not have been interpreted to mean 
he supports excommunicating catholic politicians who support 
abortion rights 
oconnor said sunday the column instead was intended to help 
prevent excommunications 
we dont want to see people excommunicated oconnor said at 
a news conference were talking about trying in every way 
possible to bring it about that individuals wont excommunicate 
themselves 
i have never threatened to excommunicate anybody i have never 
suggested that any other bishop excommunicate anybody i have no 
intention of excommunicating anybody he added 
in the column in the archdiocese of new yorks weekly paper the 
cardinal said roman catholic officials risked being excommunicated 
for supporting a womans right to choose abortion 
those at risk he wrote are catholics who are perceived not 
only as treating church teaching on abortion with contempt but 
helping to multiply abortions by advocating legislation supporting 
abortion or by making public funds available for abortion 
if such actions persist he wrote bishops may consider 
excommunication the only option 
but he also read a portion of the column sunday that said to 
have the power to impose penalties and to use that power are 
two different things 
excommunication is a rarely used sanction that bars a catholic 
from most sacraments 
in an interview televised sunday gov mario m cuomo a 
catholic who says he is personally opposed to abortion but supports 
abortion funding reaffirmed his prochoice position 
cuomo said on wnbctvs news forum program that he still 
favored public funding for abortion but he said no catholic could 
feel good about a cardinal suggesting his soul was in peril 
i love being governor said cuomo i wouldnt do it if i 
thought i were risking my soul

associated press writerequals 
beijing ap communist party chief jiang zemin in a long 
letter to nine california university students defended last years 
military suppression of the prodemocracy movement 
he acknowledged that the disintegration of communist rule in 
eastern europe was a setback for socialism but said china will 
not tolerate opposition to its socialist system 
the official xinhua news agency today carried the text of the 
letter it said was written to nine political science students from 
california state polytechnic university in san luis obispo 
it said ma yuzhen chinas consulgeneral in los angeles 
delivered the letter to the students on friday 
xinhua said the students had asked about chinas current 
policies in a march 8 letter to jiang 
jiang repeating previous government statements said 
authorities displayed maximum patience toward student 
demonstrators last year he said the military was only called in 
when a small number of agitators used the student unrest in an 
attempt to overthrow the communist party and the government 
he said the western press concocted a lot of false 
sensational stories about the crackdown in which hundreds and 
perhaps thousands were killed 
some foreigners he said based their judgment merely on their 
own values 
jiang said china wants good relations with the united states 
but in an apparent reference to us criticism of chinas human 
rights record he denounced foreign interference and bullying 
jiang became party general secretary last june after his 
predecessor zhao ziyang was purged for supporting the students 
he indirectly criticized zhao saying divergent views on how 
to respond to the democracy movement pushed the nation to the brink 
of disintegration 
jiang said chinas people today are living and working in 
peace and contentment with extensive democratic rights and 
freedom unseen in our history 
he noted the demise of communist governments in eastern europe 
but said one should not conclude from this that socialism has 
failed or collapsed 
thousands of students and other activists from last years 
democracy movement remain in prisons without being formally 
charged leaders of the movement have been accused of 
counterrevolutionary crimes 
the closest jiang came to expressing regret over the bloodshed 
was when he said china should learn from the west and keep a 
certain amount of police force armed with necessary nonlethal 
weapons to put down disturbances 
he urged chinese who participated in prodemocracy 
demonstrations while studying in foreign countries to return 
saying they would not be punished 
it was jiangs latest defense in the united states of last 
years june 34 crackdown in an interview last month on abcs 
2020 television news program he said the western outcry over 
the killings was like much ado about nothing

the soviet helicopter pilot hailed as a hero for 
trying to douse the meltdown at the chernobyl nuclear reactor was 
near death today after a lung infection worsened during leukemia 
treatments 
anatoly grishchenko 53 was listed in critical condition at 
fred hutchinson cancer research center with a high fever and a lung 
infection he has been on a respirator since early friday 
grishchenko showed no signs of improvement and doctors said his 
chance of surviving the infection were poor center spokeswoman 
susan edmonds said sunday 
hes the same theres been no changes she said my 
understanding is hes sedated but cognizant of whats going on 
around him he does recognize people who are there 
his wife galina and a cousin were with him ms edmonds said 
grishchenko was stricken by the infection last week after 
undergoing a bonemarrow transplant to fight leukemia linked to 
radiation exposure 
grishchenko repeatedly flew his heavylift copter through the 
intensely radioactive gases spewing from the chernobyl plant 
dumping sand and cement in an overmatched effort to cap the 
crippled reactor 
he and a handful of others in the operation were designated 
heroes of the soviet union that countrys highest honor 
at least 31 deaths are officially blamed on the april 26 1986 
explosion and fire at the plant in the ukraine and scientists say 
many more people may eventually be stricken with radiationrelated 
diseases 
despite lead shielding on the aircraft and other protective 
gear grishchenko suffered radiation sickness and was found to have 
preleukemia in september 1988 he was diagnosed with acute 
myelocytic leukemia late last year 
a lot of people are praying for him said cap parlier of 
mesa ariz an administrator for mcdonnell douglas corp parlier 
arranged for the transplant after hearing of grishchenkos plight 
from a soviet colleague during the 1989 paris air show 
he arrived in seattle april 11 for the marrow transplant which 
was performed april 27 after he underwent chemotherapy and 
radiation treatment to kill off his own marrow 
the pretransplant therapy leaves patients with no natural 
immunity against disease until the new marrow which is 
transplanted intravenously takes hold ms edmonds said 
grishchenko had been in stable condition and doctors were 
expecting a normal recovery when they decided tuesday to operate to 
remove a fungal infection in his right lung antibiotics had failed 
to knock down the potentially lifethreatening infection which 
grishchenko developed before coming to seattle she said 
the surgery was successful and grishchenko appeared to be doing 
fine until thursday night when he developed the high fever and 
breathing problems 
doctors had waited until grishchenko appeared strong enough to 
tolerate the surgery but the procedure may have ben too much for 
his weakened system

the supreme court today agreed to hear an 
appeal by columbia sc officials and a billboard company jointly 
found to have violated federal antitrust law 
the court said it will review a ruling that the city and company 
conspired to exclude a rival advertising firm from putting up new 
billboards 
the rival company omni outdoor advertising inc was awarded 3 
million by a federal jury in 1986 
the award was overturned by a trial judge but reinstated last 
december by the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court ordered columbia outdoor advertising inc to 
pay the sum and barred city officials from enforcing an ordinance 
the appeals court said was aimed at giving that company a virtual 
billboard monopoly in the city 
omnis lawsuit said columbia outdoor advertising established its 
dominance in the city through the lifelong friendship of its 
principal owner j willis cantey with mayor kirkman finlay he no 
longer is columbias mayor 
the jury also heard evidence that columbia outdoor advertising 
gave finlay and columbia city council members either free or 
reducedrate space on its billboards for their political ads 
the council in 1982 adopted a moratorium on billboard 
construction that blocked omni from entering the market 
after a state court declared the moratorium unconstitutional it 
was replaced the same year with an ordinance requiring billboards 
be at least 1000 feet apart the new law had the effect of 
preventing omni from putting up signs 
the 4th circuit court said the supreme court has granted cities 
a broad exemption from federal antitrust law when they enact 
anticompetitive rules in accord with state policies 
but the appeals court said the exemption does not permit the 
type of behavior engaged in by columbia officials 
sufficient evidence supports the jurys finding that there was 
a conspiracy between the city and columbia outdoor advertising 
the appeals court said the city was participating in the 
conspiracy solely for the purposes of restraint of trade and 
monopolization 
the appeals court said the city is immune from paying damages 
because of a federal law that exempts local governments from such 
awards 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the city and columbia 
outdoor advertising said the company engaged in wholly legitimate 
and successful lobbying of city officials to restrict outdoor 
advertising in the city 
the case is city of columbia vs omni outdoor advertising

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
killing a lawsuit by a texas businessman who says federal 
regulators caused the financial ruin of his failed savings and loan 
association 
the court said it will review a ruling that revived part of 
thomas m gauberts negligence suit against the government 
the suit alleges the federal regulators who assumed daytoday 
operation of the irvingbased independent american savings 
association ran it out of business 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals last oct 17 reinstated 
that part of the suit in which gaubert is seeking compensation for 
25 million worth of real estate he lost when the thrift went bust 
the appeals court however did not let gaubert pursue his bid 
to collect from the government the 75 million lost value of his 
independent american shares 
gaubert a prominent political fundraiser who persuaded former 
house speaker jim wright dtexas to intervene with federal 
regulators on his behalf acquired a controlling interest in what 
was to be known as independent american in 1983 
the rapidly expanding sampl proposed in 1984 to merge with 
investex savings a failing texas thrift and purchase 22 branch 
offices from united savings association 
according to gauberts suit the federal home loan bank board 
favored the merger but postponed approval government lawyers said 
regulators were awaiting completion of an investigtion into 
gauberts dealings with an iowa thrift capitol savings and loan 
before approving the merger the bank board persuaded gaubert to 
sign a neutralization agreement that effectively removed him 
from independent american affairs gaubert also personally 
guaranteed independent americans minimal net worth with real 
estate worth over 25 million 
in 1985 he agreed to remove himself permanently from 
independent americans management and not to serve as an officer or 
director of any institution insured by the federal savings and loan 
insurance corporation 
federal officials subsequently assisted independent american in 
its merger with investex 
federal involvement came as a result of the inherent 
persuasive power of the fhlbb which no doubt rises from the 
position of authority it occupies the 5th circuit court 
recounted the government euphemistically refers to this ability 
to pressure sampls as jawboning 
the thrifts board of directors was replaced under bank board 
supervision and in 1986 a former federal regulator was installed 
as independent americans chief operating officer 
in may 1987 the texas savings and loan department closed 
independent american and the bank board appointed the fslic as a 
receiver 
after an unsuccessful administrative claim gaubert sued under a 
law that in some instances waives the federal governments 
sovereign immunity 
the law the federal tort claims act does not allow lawsuits 
based on federal employees discretionary duties and government 
lawyers cited that exception in seeking to have gauberts suit 
dismissed 
a federal trial judge threw out the suit but the 5th circuit 
court reinstated it 
the appeals court said past supreme court rulings have 
distinguished discretionary and daytoday operational duties when 
deciding whether lawsuits against the government should be allowed 
federal regulators were only protected by the laws 
discretionary function exception until their actions became 
operational in nature and thus crossed the line the appeals 
court said 
the case is us vs gaubert 891793

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
lawsuit in which a woman who claims to be hank williams srs 
daughter seeks some of the late country music legends copyright 
royalties 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that cathy yvonne stone 37 is entitled to have her legal 
fight put before a jury 
at the same time the court rejected an appeal by country singer 
hank williams jr that sought to reverse an alabama supreme court 
ruling that declared ms stone a legal heir to the elder williams 
named as defendants in ms stones royalties suit are hank jr 
and other copyright owners 
ms stone was born in alabama five days after williams died at 
age 29 in 1953 
her mother bobbie jett and williams had signed an agreement 
months earlier in which he acknowledged he might be the father of 
the thenunborn child 
the girl first was adopted by lillian stone williams mother 
after mrs stone died the child was adopted by george and mary 
deupree the deuprees in 1967 refused to be included in court 
proceedings to determine whether williams had fathered any children 
other than hank jr 
mrs deupree first told her adopted daughter in 1973 that the 
elder williams might have been her father but ms stone did not 
take any immediate legal action to establish her real parentage 
soon after marrying attorney keith adkinson in 1985 ms stone 
filed federal and state court lawsuits seeking a share of williams 
songwriting royalties 
state courts in alabama initially ruled that she was williams 
daughter but not a legal heir 
the federal lawsuit was dismissed by the new yorkbased 2nd us 
circuit court of appeals in april 1989 presuming that williams was 
ms stones father the appeals court said she had waited too long 
before suing 
ms stone then appealed to the nations highest court but the 
justices rejected her appeal last november 
meanwhile the alabama supreme court last july reversed lower 
state court rulings that had denied ms stone status as an heir 
the state supreme court ruled that some of the defendants but 
not hank jr had intentionally and fraudulently concealed ms 
stones identity and legal rights 
the 2nd circuit court citing the alabama supreme courts 
ruling set aside its april 1989 ruling last dec 5 
the evidence of fraud excuses ms stones delay in taking 
legal action the appeals court said 
it added the figure representing justice is blindfolded so 
that the scales are held even but justice is not blind to reality 
ms stone therefore should have her day in court and an 
opportunity to have a jury determine the merits of her claim 
in the royalties case appeal acted on today lawyers for hank 
williams jr and the other copyright owners argued among other 
things that the supreme courts denial of review last november 
should have ended the federal case 
they said the appeals court was not authorized to grant a 
rehearing after the high court turned down ms stones initial 
appeal 
ms stone has begun her own countrysinging career using the 
stage name jett williams 
the cases are williams vs stone 891538 and 891563

the supreme court today left intact a decision 
forcing boston university to grant a lifetime professors job to a 
woman found to have been a victim of sex bias 
the court without comment rejected arguments that requiring 
the university to grant her tenure interferes with its academic 
freedom 
a key issue in the case of english literature professor julia 
prewitt brown was the admissibility of trial evidence allegedly 
showing university president john silber harbored sexist attitudes 
silber is on leave from the university to seek the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination in massachusetts 
the university argued that evidence of silbers alleged sexism 
should not have been presented to a federal jury that awarded ms 
brown 200000 
a judge added 15000 to compensate ms brown for emotional 
distress and ordered the university to reinstate her with lifetime 
tenure 
ms brown currently is teaching at providence university in 
rhode island where she has received tenure she said she would 
return to boston university if the university lost its supreme 
court appeal in the decadelong dispute 
ms brown had been teaching at bu for six years when she became 
eligible for tenure in 1979 
an english department committee voted 220 that she receive 
tenure and its recommendation was supported 92 by a university 
committee 
but silber opposed tenure and recommended instead that ms brown 
remain on probation for three more years 
silber relied in part on a report by the university provost 
questioning ms browns scholarly credentials 
she had published a book of criticism on jane austens novels 
that generally was well reviewed by other scholars but the provost 
said the university should await further evidence of ms browns 
abilities before awarding tenure 
after ms brown rejected the offer of three more years on 
probation the university board of trustees denied her tenure 
when her lawsuit reached a trial evidence was introduced of 
silbers alleged sexism 
it included a remark he made describing the english department 
as a damn matriarchy at a time when the department was headed 
by a woman and included six female and 20 male faculty members 
silber also had told another woman on the faculty that she 
should not be worried about job security since your husband is a 
parachute an apparent reference to the fact her husband was 
employed 
the jury also heard a portion of an old speech by silber in 
which he lamented the lack of parental supervision in families in 
which both husbands and wives work outside the home 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals in ruling last year for 
ms brown refused to order a new trial in which the silber remarks 
would be excluded 
the appeals court also rejected the universitys arguments that 
awarding ms brown a lifetime job interfered with its academic 
freedom 
academic freedom does not include the freedom to discriminate 
against tenure candidates on the basis of sex or other 
impermissible grounds the appeals court said awarding ms 
brown tenure is the only way to provide her the most complete 
relief possible 
the american council on education representing some 1500 
colleges and universities supported the universitys appeal 
the american association of university professors urged the high 
court to reject the appeal 
the case is boston university vs brown 891680

the supreme court today left intact the 
conviction and 250 fine of a man cited for preaching too loudly 
outside a hagerstown md abortion clinic 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the state law used to prosecute jerry wayne eanes violates 
freespeech rights 
marylands highest court rejected those arguments by a 43 vote 
last february 
the challenged state law makes it a crime to disturb the peace 
in public places by making loud and unseemly noises 
eanes was arrested outside the hagerstown reproductive clinic on 
may 18 1988 while preaching on the city sidewalk outside the 
clinic 
the police officer who arrested eanes had previously asked him 
to lower his voice and said eanes continued to shout 
there was testimony that eanes could be heard over a block away 
although eanes was arrested during business hours on a busy 
downtown street the neighborhood has several residential apartment 
buildings police received complaints from residents about the 
loudness of eanes voice but not about his message 
eanes did not try to restrain anyone who entered or left the 
abortion clinic he did not try to block access to the clinic 
threaten anyone trespass on private property or use profanity 
a day before his arrest eanes had been acquitted in the 
washington county circuit court for allegedly making loud and 
unseemly noises in front of the same abortion clinic on in july 
1987 eanes had not returned to the clinic until his acquittal 
judge frederick c wright iii found eanes guilty of willfully 
disturbing the peace and tranquility of that particular 
neighborhood on may 18 by making loud and otherwise unacceptable 
noises 
the judge said eanes loud preaching was improper under the 
circumstances 
the maryland court of appeals last february upheld the 
misdemeanor conviction ruling that the law was aimed at the manner 
of eanes communication not its content 
judge wright properly balanced eanes first amendment rights 
against a substantial public interest protected by a narrowly 
drawn contentneutral regulation the state court said 
the three dissenting judges voted to overturn eanes conviction 
eanes was entitled to deliver an unamplified speech on the 
topic of abortion from a public sidewalk in downtown hagerstown 
during the late morning the dissenters said to punish as 
criminal the making of the speech purportedly because it was too 
loud distorts both the statute and our basic constitutional 
guarantees 
the case is eanes vs maryland 891745

private jet wednesday the man many regard as a modern civil rights 
hero will be greeted by new york city at its best and its worst 
there will be a tickertape parade and traffic jams diplomatic 
meetings and media circuses adoring crowds and hostile protesters 
speeches of sweeping scope and tshirt proclamations 
for the deputy leader of the african national congress released 
in february after 27 years in south african jails it will be his 
first view of the united states 
and for the city disrupted at times by its own racial ethnic 
political and economic animosities it could be a rare moment of 
selfappraisal 
the fact that this is the first stop gives the average new 
yorker a great sense of pride said jean owensby a local 
spokeswoman for mandelas national tour if theres a time to 
come together this is it 
in a city so big togetherness is a relative thing a bronx 
rabbi avi weiss announced he will hold a prayer vigil to protest 
mandelas friendly relations with the palestine liberation 
organization 
but planning for the visit has mainly drawn cooperation there 
are the small details such as the trans lux corps donation of 
100 miles of ticker tape and there are the major ones such as 
producer bill grahams volunteer work organizing a concert and 
rally for 60000 people at yankee stadium 
like mandela i came out of a suppressed society said 
graham a jew born in berlin there is something about freedom of 
expression thats always meant a great deal to me and a great deal 
to all of us 
mandela also will raise money at starstudded fundraisers 
including one with robert de niro as host and lobby for his cause 
at a session with business leaders he will address the un 
general assembly and submit to interviews including an hour and a 
half with abcs ted koppel 
the proceedings will be similar in the other cities on mandelas 
10day tour which is part of a 14nation sixweek tour of the 
world 
gatherings are scheduled at tiger stadium in detroit the los 
angeles coliseum and the oakland coliseum bostonians are planning 
a luncheon at the john f kennedy presidential library and a public 
reception at boston common 
in miami he is to address the convention of the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees in atlanta he 
is expected to stop at the martin luther king jr center and will 
receive an honorary degree from a group of black colleges 
the political peak will be in washington where he meets with 
president bush and addresses a joint session of congress 
the highlights in new york include a motorcade wednesday morning 
through brooklyn and then the parade up lower broadway in manhattan 
to city hall where mayor david dinkins will give mandela the key 
to the city 
mandela will spend wednesday thursday and friday nights at 
gracie mansion the mayors residence 
i would be delighted to be just standing in the throng just 
one of those persons in the audience listening to him looking at 
him dinkins said and so to be in a position to welcome him in 
an official capacity as mayor of the city and to have him stay at 
gracie mansion is beyond my fondest dreams i just never envisioned 
anything as wonderful and as great as this 
another major gathering is thursday evening in harlem where 
mandela will address what organizers say will be as many as 100000 
people 
then thursday night at yankee stadium 60000 are expected at 
an anc fundraiser with tickets selling for 5 to 25 
billy joel who plays the stadium the next two nights is 
lending the rally his production equipment graham and tour 
planners have declined to identify which bands will perform saying 
they want the focus to remain on mandela and his cause 
that will not be difficult for people like owensby who were too 
young to have joined the civil rights marches of the 1960s 
this is like me witnessing history for the first time in my 
life she said im about to bust

india and pakistan agreed today to hold 
talks to try to ease the threat of war over the disputed northern 
region of kashmir 
an indian government spokesman said top officials of the nations 
will meet early next month but that the date and location had not 
been decided the foreign ministry spokesman could not be 
indentified under briefing rules 
in islamabad pakistans foreign secretary tanvir ahmed khan 
confirmed the proposed meeting i think this is a welcome 
development he said this could be a good beginning 
a dispute over the kashmir valley has brought the neighbors 
close to their fourth war since they gained independence from 
britain in 1947 
india and pakistan both claim kashmir a predominately moslem 
state that joined mainly hindu india when britain partitioned the 
subcontinent along religious lines 
the territory is divided between the nations by a ceasefire 
line and the armies of both countries have massed troops and 
artillery along the border 
talk of war has disturbed many countries because both nations 
are believed to possess nuclear weapons technology india exploded 
an atomic device in 1974 two of the three previous indiapakistan 
wars fought in 1948 and 1965 have been over kashmir both were 
won by india 
india accuses pakistan of arming and training moslem kashmiri 
militants who are fighting for independence from india 
pakistan denies the charges however islamabad has often said 
it supports the kashmiri secession calling it a movement for 
selfdetermination 
india launched a crackdown on the separatist movement on jan 
20 since then more than 550 people have died in the valley 
mostly independence activists or their supporters 
in may a deputy us national security adviser robert gates 
traveled to pakistan and india to urge them to open talks western 
diplomats in new delhi today credited the gates visit and soviet 
pressure with helping to defuse the situation slightly 
the americans read the pakistanis the riot act and the soviets 
have done the same to the indians said a middle eastern military 
official now we have some hope 
the indian foreign ministry spokesman said the decision today 
was taken after a meeting between indian foreign secretary muchkund 
dubey and pakistans ambassador bashir khan babar

a jury was seated today in the cocaine and 
perjury trial of mayor marion barry and was immediately placed in 
the care of us marshals for the duration of the case 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson scheduled 
opening statements in the case for tuesday morning and said the 
jurors will be sworn in at that time the judge told them they 
would collect their belongings and be sequestered 
the panel of 12 people plus six alternates includes 13 blacks 
and five whites there are just three men among the 18 people 
barry 54 is black and a number of prospective jurors questioned 
in the past two weeks said they thought race and politics played a 
role in the investigation and prosecution of the threeterm mayor 
during the trial the group of 18 wont be told which are jurors 
and which are being held as alternates 
us marshals will transport them between the us courthouse 
and an area hotel where they will be housed until the trial is 
over 
barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession one count 
of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a federal grand 
jury about his alleged involvement with drugs 
many of the prospective jurors questioned for barrys trial 
expressed strong opinions about the case and the fbi sting 
operation that led to the washington mayors arrest 
the 18 were drawn from a group of 81 people approved during two 
weeks of questioning 
barry announced last week that he would not seek reelection to 
a fourth term as mayor of the district of columbia 
plea bargaining discussions havent produced any agreement that 
would avert a trial sources familiar with the case say us 
attorney jay stephens is insisting barry plead guilty to a felony 
which would almost certainly mean at least a short jail term 
on friday defense lawyer r kenneth mundy said there was 
nothing going on except preparations for a trial 
the jury that will sit in judgment of the mayor was drawn from a 
group that includes 
an art teacher at a private school who said she would have 
difficulty presuming barrys innocence 
a retired census bureau worker who said the fbi sting operation 
aimed at barry was an invasion of the mayors privacy 
a man who said he thought it was unfair for the fbi to bring 
exmodel rasheeda moore all the way from los angeles to help them 
catch barry smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room the videotape 
should not have been done the man said of the undercover 
operation 
despite these responses and similar answers by numerous other 
potential jurors us district judge thomas penfield jackson made 
them eligible to serve on the jury 
all said they would be fair and impartial if they sat as jurors 
even though they had strong opinions about aspects of the case and 
some voiced concern that the fact that barry is black and a 
democrat could have figured in the investigation 
the judge disqualified more than 60 other people whose answers 
suggested they couldnt set aside their personal views and focus 
only on the evidence presented in the courtroom 
but some of those who remain expressed doubts about their 
ability to be totally impartial 
mundy asked the art teacher if it was difficult to overcome a 
presumption of guilt 
it is she conceded but i dont think it would be 
impossible

the supreme court today spared the federal 
program protecting the pensions of 30 million american workers from 
a potential financial crisis 
by an 81 vote the court broadened the authority of the pension 
benefit guaranty corporation to order employers to restore 
terminated pension plans 
a federal appeals court limited such authority last year by 
setting aside the agencys order that ltv corp and its subsidiary 
ltv steel co restore three pension plans with unfunded 
liabilities of 23 billion todays decision reversed the appeals 
court ruling 
government lawyers told the justices the appeals court ruling 
if not overturned could lead to a financial crisis similar to 
that currently facing the government insurance program for the 
savings and loan industry 
at issue was the agencys power to shift liability for pension 
payments back to an employer in what is called an antifollowon 
policy 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said the policy 
is not contrary to clear congressional intent and is based on a 
permissible construction of federal law 
in other action the court 
buttressed the power of police to videotape and record and 
responses of suspected drunken drivers 
by an 81 vote the justices ruled that police did not violate a 
pennsylvania mans rights when without warning him of his rights 
they recorded his answers to questions about his height weight 
and color of his eyes 
ruled that a federal law reducing patent infringement 
protection for drug companies applies to medical devices 
the court by a 62 vote refused to reinstate a 267 million 
award against medtronic inc of minneapolis eli lilly and co of 
indianapolis said medtronic infringed patents on a device implanted 
in patients to correct potentially fatal heart rhythms 
agreed to consider killing a lawsuit by a texas businessman 
who says federal regulators caused the financial ruin of his failed 
savings and loan association 
the court said it will review a ruling that revived part of 
thomas m gauberts negligence suit against the government the 
suit alleges the federal regulators who assumed daytoday 
operation of the irvingbased independent american savings 
association ran it right out of business 
refused to kill a lawsuit in which a woman who claims to be 
hank willilams srs daughter seeks some of the late country music 
legends copyright royalties 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that cathy yvonne stone 37 is entitled to have her legal 
fight put before a jury 
left intact the conviction and 250 fine of a man cited for 
preaching too loudly outside a hagerstown md abortion clinic 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the state law used to prosecute jerry wayne eanes violates 
freespeech rights 
rejected a challenge to californias daycare licensing system 
by a religiously affiliated preschool center 
the court without comment left intact rulings that the 
centers religious freedom was not violated by state licensing 
rules that include a ban on corporal punishment for children 
attending daycare centers 
the pension benefit guaranty corporation modeled after the 
federal deposit insurance corp and the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp is wholly owned by the federal government its 
board of directors is comprised of the secretaries of labor 
treasury and commerce 
the agency protects the pension benefits of the 30 million 
workers who participate in singleemployer pension plans 
when a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy 
promised benefits the agency becomes the pension plans trustee 
taking over its assets and liabilities the agency then pays with 
taxpayer money benefits workers had earned as of the date the 
pension plan ended 
the pbgc in fiscal year 1988 paid 3247 million in insured 
benefits to 113000 retirees who participated in 1476 terminated 
pension plans 
the cost of the pension insurance is paid primarily by employers 
with active pension plans and by employers who terminate 
underfunded pension plans 
but the pbgc has money problems of its own a 1 billion 
deficit it currently lists assets of about 32 billion and 
liabilities of about 42 bilion 
the pbgcs executive director james b lockhart told a 
congressional subcommittee last week the agency soon could be 
unable to meet its obligations 
lockhart told the subcommittee the overall pension system is 
extremely healthy were not an sampl crisis i dont think wed have 
to go to the taxpayer for a bailout 
but lawyers representing the pbgc previously had raised the sampl 
crisis analogy in briefs submitted to the supreme court 
the dallasbased ltv and its clevelandbased ltv steel 
subsidiary after filing for reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy law in 1986 advised the pbgc that they could not fund 
the three pension plans they sponsored the plans were ended in 
1987 
in a deal with the united steelworkers union however ltv steel 
agreed to what government lawyers contended is a followon 
arrangement under it ltv agreed to make up any benefits lost to 
retirees because of the pension plans termination those benefits 
not covered by the federal pension insurance program 
the result retirees continued to receive the same benefits they 
did before the plans were terminated and payment of underfunded 
pension liabilities was shifted to the pbgc 
ltv was responsible for 75 million in annual supplemental 
retirement benefits and the federal agency was picking up the tab 
for some 400 million in annual obligations to ltv pensioners 
the pbgc contended such arrangements are abusive and the agency 
ordered ltv to reassume responsibility for the three pension 
plans when ltv refused the agency sought to enforce its order in 
federal court 
a federal judge threw out the pbgcs order for restoration and 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling both 
lower courts ruled that congress never intended to give the agency 
the power to order restoration based on the creation of such 
followon benefit plans 
in seeking the supreme courts help lawyers for the pbgc said 
other companies will follow ltvs example and use pension 
insurance as a subsidy to reduce costs and gain a competitive 
edge 
the pbgc estimates that the underfunding of pension plans it 
insures could run as high as 30 billion 
today the high court ruled for the pbgc 
only justice john paul stevens dissented 
the courts ruling comes against a backdrop of serious problems 
in the administration of private pension programs 
an associated press investigation last year found that one in 
four of the private pension plans audited by the government is 
violating the law fraud and mismanagement could wipe out the 
retirement nest eggs of millions of workers and saddle taxpayers 
with a multibilliondollar bailout experts told the ap 
nationwide some 870000 private pension plans hold assets of 
about 2 trillion dollars 
most claims for pbgc money have come from the steel industry 
but lockhart cautioned that his agencys 1 billion deficit could 
double if the pbgc has to bail out the financially ailing airlines 
industry 
if they go bust the taxpayer picks up the bill just like 
the sampls said joe mcgowan of the labor departments inspector 
generals office 
the case is pbgc vs ltv 89390

the supreme court ruled today that a federal 
law reducing patentinfringement protection for drug companies 
applies to medical devices 
the court by a 62 vote refused to reinstate a 267 million 
award against medtronic inc of minneapolis 
eli lilly and co of indianapolis said medtronic infringed 
patents on a device implanted in patients to correct potentially 
fatal heart rhythms 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court upheld 
medtronics interpretation of a 1984 patentinfringement law the 
statute applies to patented inventions as well as generic drugs he 
said 
scalia said medtronic did not infringe on eli lillys patent as 
long as the activities of the former firm were reasonably related 
to the development of information necessary to obtain federal 
approval for its device the case now goes back to a lower federal 
court to determine whether medtronic met that condition 
the 1984 law is intended to help generic drug manufacturers 
seeking to place their substitutes for patented drugs on the market 
as soon as patents expire 
the law permits the generic drug firms to get information from 
the federal food and drug administration and apply to the fda for 
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patented 
drugs 
also as long as the purpose is related to its application to 
the fda the generic companies are allowed by law to make use or 
sell a patented invention prior to the patents expiration 
eli lilly with support from other major medical companies and 
patent holders said applying the law to medical devices could 
undermine health care research and development of lifesaving 
inventions 
it said the pace of costly innovative research will be slowed 
because patent holders will fear their work soon would be copied 
but medtronic said eli lilly is distorting economic reality 
medtronic said the value of the heartimplant devices it tested 
is less than 415000 by contrast it said eli lilly is expected 
to sell more than 100 million worth of the devices before a 
twoyear extension of its patent expires on oct 26 1990 
medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac 
distrubances painlessly with lowenergy electrical impulses as a 
substitute for the higherenergy shocks that accompany the lilly 
device 
lillys appeal to the supreme court was supported by sen orrin 
hatch rutah sponsor of the 1984 legislation and rep carlos 
moorhead rpa floor manager of the bill in the house 
the case is eli lilly vs medtronic inc 89243

the death toll from last weeks flash 
floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the ohio river 
and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still 
listed as missing 
its just been too long i dont think theres anybody alive 
out there you cant swim out there that long in the ohio river 
said chuck vogt belmont county coroners investigator 
the search for the missing was suspended briefly this morning 
when a thunderstorm rolled through the area heavy rain fell for 
about 45 minutes swelling wegee creek one of two creeks that 
overflowed in thursday nights flash flood 
by midmorning the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road about 
three miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the most 
damage lt dean irvin of the ohio army national guard said there 
were no immediate reports of additional property damage 
the body found this morning was in the ohio river near 
moundsville wva about 10 miles south of shadyside according to 
chuck vogt belmont county coroners investigator 
the number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14 
with the identities of three victims and a call by one person 
alerting authorities that she was safe vogt said one of the 
recovered bodies remains unidentified authorities are not ruling 
out the possibility that other people not on the list could be 
missing 
four bodies were recovered sunday 
officials said friday that 60 people were missing some of those 
later were found dead while others notified authorities that they 
were safe and officials learned that still more had moved out of 
the area 
wegee and pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5 
inches of rain in 3 hours the floods destroyed as many as 70 
houses and damaged up to 40 others 
most of those whose homes and belongings were swept away by the 
wall of water will have to put their lives back together largely 
without benefit of insurance 
few people in the coalmining and steelmaking area carried 
flood insurance and homeowners insurance will not cover damage 
from thursdays flood residents and insurers said 
we didnt think we needed to have flood insurance for what 
that creek never flooded then this everybody just got wiped 
out said julia kulazenka 
rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the 
creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them shadyside fire 
chief mark badia said 
eventually the bridges couldnt hold any more the debris 
broke loose and thats when we got three big gushes of water 
badia said 
the home mrs kulazenka shared with her husband until his death 
last july was damaged as wegee creek raged out of control she said 
replacing a machine shop garage deck and automobiles she and her 
son owned would cost more than 80000 
they told us homeowners wont do us no good so unless the 
government helps us rebuild i dont know what ill do with this 
place mrs kulazenka said 
the federal emergency management agency said it will open an 
office tuesday in shadyside to accept applications from residents 
for lowinterest loans and grants to help them rebuild 
before the flood land in the wegee creek valley fetched 
handsome prices said kulazenkas son charles kulazenka that was 
especially welcome to residents many of whom were either retired 
or laid off from jobs in coal mines in belmont county where 
unemployment in april was 68 percent 
ground was at a premium down here before this because it was 
just outside the city limits of shadyside it was quiet and 
peaceful and people were looking to buy and build new homes out 
here now you couldnt give it away kulazenka said 
but we cant be bitter though because weve got our lives 
and a lot of our neighbors real close buddies werent that 
lucky

an environmental group called on consumers 
today to boycott products containing a chemical used in such items 
as hornet sprays and art supplies which it said is harming earths 
ozone layer 
the natural resources defense council also accused the bush 
administration of waffling in its position on an international 
agreement designed to curb production of the chemical 
111trichloroethane 
the nrdc said approximately 724 million pounds of the chemical 
known as 111 for short were produced in the united states in 
1988 
david doniger an attorney with the group said 90 percent of 
the substance is used in industry where it is an ingredient of 
solvents used to clean electronic and metal parts 
among consumer goods which contain the chemical the nrdc said 
are some of the varnishes and fixatives marketed by m grumbacher 
inc the art supply firm 
godfrey chambers technical services manager for grumbacher 
said by telephone from the firms headquarters in cranbury nj 
that the company has eliminated 111 from some of its products and 
is hoping to get it eliminated from the ones listed 
chambers said the products damar varnish myston retouch 
varnish and tuffilm fixative are manufactured by a supplier and 
purchased by grumbacher for resale 
the person we purchase it from is continuing research in this 
matter to try and eliminate it he said 
formerly more of our aerosols did contain it but through the 
process of research we have been able to eliminate it he said 
it is a concern of the industry at large chambers said 
doniger said substitutes are available for 111 in most of its 
industrial and consumer uses 
we recommend that consumers avoid buying products which 
contain 111trichloroethane or any other substance which 
contributes to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer 
the council said for most applications there are alternative 
products on the market that serve the same purpose 
the nrdc listed 141 products but said there are more the ones 
listed included hair sprays spot removers solvents and cleaners 
furniture polish water repellents insecticides automotive 
products and other office and household items 
doniger said he will be pressing for phasing out of 111 when 
representatives of more than 70 nations gather in london wednesday 
under sponsorship of the united nations environmental program to 
consider revisions to an international agreement on the ozone layer 
the us delegation is still waffling somewhere between a 25 
percent rollback and a 100 percent phaseout by 2000 he said 
indications are that the european community and japan and now 
the united states are balking at going farther than 50 percent 
he added 
some environmentalists say manmade chemicals are eating away the 
earths protective ozone shield allowing more ultraviolet rays to 
reach the planets surface they contend this increases the risk of 
skin cancer cataract formation and disruption of the environment

the heirs of the communist party have won 
control of parliament in bulgarias first free elections in 58 
years but unofficial results today showed the capital firmly in 
opposition hands 
bulgarias ruling socialists are the only reform communists to 
hold onto power in an eastern europe where authoritarian rule gave 
way to popular elections this year after decades of soviet 
domination 
premier andrei lukanov today said he was confident he could form 
a government with broad support he said he was encouraged by the 
main opposition coalitions support for a government of 
nonpartisan administrators 
members of bulgarias communist party formed the socialist party 
and staterun sofia radio said unofficial final results showed the 
socialists won 39 of the 81 seats at stake in sundays runoffs 
that would give them them a total of 211 seats in the 400member 
parliament 
the main opposition alliance the union of democratic forces 
won 37 seats for a total of 144 the radio said among those were 
six more seats in sofia to give the alliance 24 of the capitals 26 
seats unofficial counts showed 
the opposition in this country of 9 million gets much of its 
backing from the urban intelligensia while the socialists are seen 
as a force for stability in the balkan countrys more conservative 
countryside 
the agrarian party a once docile ally of the communists won 16 
seats in the june 10 first round and had no candidates in the 
runoff other smaller opposition groups and independents won a 
total of six seats 
official results were expected tuesday 
noncommunists have triumphed in nationwide elections in east 
germany czechoslovakia hungary and romania although the party 
that swept last months balloting in romania has many former 
communists in its leadership 
the communists have been a strong political force in bulgaria 
for nearly a century and as the socialist party the name they took 
in april have essentially maintained political control of small 
towns and villages 
opposition leaders have accused the socialists of using 
intimidation and fraud to secure votes 
foreign observers say they have not noted significant 
irregularities and sundays voting appeared to proceed smoothly at 
most polling sites however state television reported some 
irregularities including illegal canvassing 
dimiter ivanov an activist from the association for fair 
elections said that in some cases the number of people voting 
exceeded the number of people registered in the respective 
precincts 
outside a polling station in the town of stanke dimitrov about 
40 miles south of sofia a young soldier who refused to give his 
name said he voted for the socialists because i want security i 
am scared of the udf 
the opposition was only nascent when reform communists ousted 
longtime communist strongman todor zhivkov in november and had 
wanted the elections postponed until the fall to give it more time 
to organize 
shortly before the polls closed state television said 75 
percent of the eligible voters had cast ballots in the first first 
round 91 percent voted 
the socialists have proposed a coalition government of national 
unity but the union of democratic forces has resisted 
the socialist leader alexander lilov said in an interview 
published sunday in the party daily duma that if the opposition 
refuses to join a coalition his party will approach respected 
personalities to form a government of experts and 
professionals 
petar beron a union of democratic forces leader said today 
that his 16party coalition would favor such a government if it 
were temporary such a government is usually a caretaker 
government but it cannot rule the country for very long 
the chief task of the new government will be tackling the 
countrys 10 billion foreign debt rising inflation and consumer 
goods shortages while gearing the economy toward capitalism 
the union of democratic forces favors sweeping private ownership 
and privatization of agriculture 
the socialists would prefer to leave some industry 
governmentrun for the time being and are vague on the future 
status of farming which is currently governmentowned or 
cooperative

a wisconsin experiment aimed at keeping 
welfare children in school was praised monday as a longterm 
investment in youth and at the same time criticized as cruel and 
ineffective 
the federal government is interested enough in the learnfare 
concept which cuts off welfare payments to families whose 
teenagers miss class to authorize an expansion supporters 
acknowledged it is too early to judge whether the program begun in 
1987 has worked 
patricia a goodrich secretary of the wisconsin department of 
health and social services told a senate finance subcommittee 
hearing that learnfare provides the unique opportunity to have a 
direct and positive influence on the futures of our children and 
through them the future of our state and nation 
learnfare covers 27000 wisconsin teenagers whose parents 
receive aid to families with dependent children and 92 percent 
of those students are meeting the programs attendance 
requirements ms goodrich said 
if a teenager whose parents receive welfare has more than two 
unexcused absences in a month the familys welfare payment is cut 
by the amount normally included for the teenagers needs 
carol croce executive director of the wisconsin nutrition 
project said learnfare exacerbates family situations already 
strained by poverty and the pressures of single parenting 
grants reduced by learnfare sanctions have resulted in 
evictions and utility shutoffs and have forced some families into 
emergency shelters ms croce told the subcommittee it has had 
a perverse and destructive effect on family structure by giving 
teens unwarranted control over the familys income 
even with the program she added we still dont know why 
these teens are absent from school 
backers of the program say that requiring teenagers to stay in 
school will help break the cycle of poverty and prepare them for 
better jobs 
the us department of health and human services recently 
approved wisconsins proposal to expand the program to cover 
younger children however families of these children will not face 
a reduction in their welfare payments so long as parents cooperate 
with learnfare case workers

nine of the 23 us soldiers killed in the 
invasion of panama were accidentally slain by their comrades and 
most of the americans wounded were probably hit by friendly fire as 
well newsweek says 
the apparent reason is that americans did most of the shooting 
the magazine reported in its june 25 issue which goes on sale 
today 
as many as 60 percent of the 347 us soldiers wounded in the 
dec 20 attack were probably hit by fire from their comrades and 
nine were killed by other american servicemen newsweek said 
citing unidentified military sources 
we just dont have any comment on that at this time said 
pentagon spokesman ken satterfield 
the magazine also said it had learned the surprise attack was 
compromised by up to 15 different security leaks 
gen manuel antonio noriega knew at 10 pm the night before the 
invasion that there was a chance the united states would attack 
newsweek said 
however noriega dismissed the reports newsweek said 
the leaks came from girlfriends of us soldiers in panama 
panamanian customs agents who warned of arriving cargo planes and a 
panamanian telephone operator at fort clayton who monitored calls 
about the invasion the magazine said 
newsweek also said it had learned that contrary to the bush 
administrations insistence that the invasion was a lastminute 
response to provocation after a us soldier was shot plans for 
the invasion were approved by president bush in november 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
declined today to respond to the report and said we continue to 
believe that the panama invasion was very effectively efficiently 
carried out given the complexity of the operation

an army private who was demoted and thrown out 
of the service after his rifle was stolen will receive an honorable 
discharge and back pay the service said today 
the action involves pfc james griffin iii of fort lauderdale 
fla whose case was the subject of a 60 minutes television 
report last month 
griffin was serving with task force arriba in san lorenzo 
honduras in march 1989 when he was charged with loss of his rifle 
the enlisted man contended that the rifle had been stolen but his 
us superiors turned him over to honduran authorities for 
interrogation 
he was released 18 hours later after undergoing brutal 
questioning and was eventually returned to fort bragg nc where 
five months later he was thrown out of the army 
the army decision to reverse its earlier action was taken by the 
army board for the correction of military records according to 
army spokesman maj joe allred it calls for giving griffin an 
honorable discharge dated june 8 1990 restoration to the rank of 
private first class and e3 pay grade and lifting a ban on his 
reenlistment 
allred said griffin will receive full back pay and allowances 
for the period covering his initial discharge date of sept 19 
1989 to june 8 1990 but that the exact amount has not yet been 
determined 
the army action came after the pentagons inspector general 
recommended that griffin receive the honorable discharge 
the inspector general said griffin had been the victim of a ruse 
devised to obtain information about the lost weapon four army 
officers stationed in honduras with griffin were involved in the 
affair three were given letters of reprimand while a fourth 
received verbal counseling

barring a lastminute reprieve john 
edward swindler tonight will become the first person executed in 
arkansas since 1964 
swindler 46 is scheduled to die in the electric chair at the 
state prison near grady for the 1976 slaying of a policeman during 
a shootout while on the run from a double murder he committed in 
columbia sc 
arkansas would become the 14th state to carry out an execution 
and swindler the 130th inmate put to death since the us supreme 
court in 1976 let states resume use of capital punishment 
arkansas plans another execution on june 25 ronald gene simmons 
is to die by injection for the 1987 killings of 16 people 
including 14 family members 
because swindler was sentenced before arkansas changed its 
method of execution from electrocution to injection he was given a 
choice of either method he left the choice up to prison officials 
who selected the method originally specified in his sentence 
electrocution 
the us supreme court denied a stay on saturday only the 
intervention of gov bill clinton who last week denied clemency 
or a lastditch appeal from swindlers lawyers or another group 
could stop the 9 pm execution attorney general steve clark said 
none of those scenarios appeared likely clark said 
one of swindlers attorneys gerald coleman said there would be 
no 11thhour appeal from them im not planning on doing 
anything i know of no other plans of anybody else to file 
anything coleman said in a telephone interview today 
we reviewed the case and took our best shot theres nothing 
else that could be done that wouldnt be just a frivolous filing 
he said you could file most anything making some allegation in 
just trying to delay it 
swindler was sentenced to die for the murder of fort smith 
police officer randy basnett who was killed at a gas station after 
recognizing swindler 
at the time swindler was wanted for killing two people in south 
carolina three days after his release from the federal prison at 
leavenworth kan swindler who was driving a stolen car told 
authorities he was headed back to kansas to kill as many people as 
he could for his treatment there 
while awaiting execution in arkansas he was convicted of two 
murders in south carolina and sentenced to four life terms 
the last person executed in arkansas was charles franklin 
fields who was electrocuted in 1964 for rape 
about 50 members of the human rights group amnesty international 
held a 26minute vigil sunday night commemorating 26 years without 
an execution in the state 
amnesty international member cynthia crawford read a statement 
imploring clinton not to end the decency of the past 26 years by 
reinstituting this brutish form of violence 
the members of amnesty international in arkansas are repulsed 
at this reactivation of this states machinery of death crawford 
said just as amnesty international opposes any use of torture 
we also oppose executions the ultimate form of torture 
the group urged clinton to grant clemency to swindler and 
simmons crawford urged citizens who oppose the death penalty to 
wear black armbands on the execution days 
there was no counterprotest but someone in a passing car 
shouted burn swindler burn 
peggy basnett the mother of the policeman swindler killed also 
welcomed the execution it will be a very happy occasion she

the supreme court today said it will decide 
the effective date for a 1986 federal law setting tough new minimum 
sentences for drug violations 
at issue is whether the laws penalty provisions took effect in 
1986 or 1987 
the court agreed to hear an appeal by moshe gozlonperetz who 
was convicted in new jersey of conspiracy to distribute heroin and 
related offenses and was sentenced to 15 years in prison plus five 
years of supervised release after he completes his term he also 
was fined 200000 
gozlonperetz was caught in a drug enforcement administration 
sting when he sold heroin to a federal agent in atlantic city in 
february 1987 
gozlonperetz said he should not be subject to the fiveyear 
supervised release provisions of the 1986 law because those 
provisions did not become effective until nov 1 1987 after the 
commission of the crime 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals said the penalty 
provisions of the law took effect oct 27 1986 the date the law 
was enacted 
the case is gozlonperetz vs us 897370

the chief taxwriter of the house of 
representatives today bluntly dashed the hopes of mayors seeking 
billions of dollars of the expected peace dividend for their 
cashpoor cities 
theres no money to pay for such programs house ways and 
means committee chairman dan rostenkowski told the us conference 
of mayors the peace dividend is already going to be swallowed 
rostenkowski said budget negotiations between congress and the 
white house are going fairly well but he said the budget is 
unlikely to include more money for cities 
we need to slash spending and raise taxes merely to reach 
ground zero the chicago democrat told more than 200 mayors 
meeting in his home city 
two democratic mayors challenged rostenkowski to confront 
president bush and demand that aid to cities be increased they 
said the 500 billion or more needed to bail out the savings and 
loan industry should be found elsewhere 
we havent got the votes rostenkowski said he broke off 
the questions and left the meeting after telling the mayors 
goodnaturedly im going to tell you like it is if you dont 
like it too bad 
while the mayors expressed affection for rostenkowski a 
supporter of their causes they did not like the message 
the cities are in desperate need said atlanta mayor maynard 
jackson i really dont feel we have a partner in washington 
rostenkowski said he was prepared to support an array of new 
taxes but he said his fellow democrats want bush to be the first 
one to propose new taxes 
rostenkowski was the first of two congressional democrats to 
address the mayors on the first full day of their summer meeting 
nebraska sen robert kerrey was to address the mayors at lunch 
rostenkowski delivered the dour message to the mayors a day 
after they gave initial approval to a broad costly domestic agenda 
that calls on congress to abandon the grammrudman law complaining 
the deficitreduction measure unfairly chops urban programs first 
were always first in line when it comes to cuts new 
bedford mass mayor john k bullard said sunday as the mayors 
gave initial approval to a sweeping and costly domestic agenda that 
would get most of its money from a congress that has been cutting 
aid to cities for a decade 
sundays votes by the conferences key policy committee must be 
ratified by the full conference of more than 200 mayors on 
wednesday but few changes are expected in a plan that blames many 
urban woes on federal cutbacks and warns that urban tensions are at 
dangerous levels because cities are too strapped for cash to deal 
adequately with drugs and housing 
the centerpiece of the mayors agenda is a handful of economic 
development proposals that include the demand that congress repeal 
the grammrudman law 
the mayors said they were reluctant to take that stance but said 
they had little choice because congress and the bush administration 
have failed to negotiate a comprehensive deficitreduction plan 
grammrudman imposes automatic cuts if the deficit eclipses certain 
targets 
the mayors across this country have got to say this is a 
charade said mayor lee robinson of macon ga weve got to say 
enough is enough 
mayor paul soglin of madison wis added too many of our 
members of congress and the administration are seing this as a 
crutch to hide some of the problems of our economy 
conference staff members said the mayors would be the first 
national organization of elected officials to call from 
grammrudmans repeal 
also included in the blueprint is a call for congress to reduce 
the social security payroll taxes paid by nearly 120 million 
workers and lift the outside earnings cap on social security 
recipients 
the plan given initial approval also calls on congress to stop 
using the balance of the social security trust fund to mask the 
true size of the deficit and if formally adopted wednesday it will 
put the mayors on the record in opposition to a reduction in 
capital gains taxes favored by president bush 
the mayors agenda crafted at three days of committee meetings 
also seeks new powers for cities to regulate and remove billboards 
along federal roads but the conference committee that endorsed the 
package refused to adopt a measure that would have put the mayors 
on record against all tobacco and alcohol advertising

the foundation that finances the nobel 
prizes on monday rejected a proposal from 30 laureates to create a 
nobel environmental prize 
the laureates including peace prize winners willy brandt of 
west germany and adolfo perez esquivel of argentina suggested the 
prize be awarded in the netherlands by a committee of the dutch 
parliament 
we fear an inflation of prizes would seriously diminish the 
value of those already existing said stig ramel chairman of the 
nobel foundation 
the first nobel prizes were awarded in 1901 from a trust 
bequeathed by alfred nobel the swedish inventor of dynamite he 
established prizes in medicine chemistry physics literature and 
peace 
a sixth prize in economic sciences was established in 1968 
funded by the bank of sweden and was called a nobel memorial prize 
to distinguish it from the others 
this year each prize is worth 650000 
ramel said there will be no more prizes the foundation has 
exclusive rights to the nobel name and will not allow it to be 
linked to another prize he said

for higher pay and brought state hospitals across the country to a 
standstill 
more than 70 percent of the countrys 10000 doctors walked off 
the job said vassilis laopodis vice president of the greek 
federation of hospital doctors unions the strike was to last four 
days 
we just want to be paid for the hours we work we havent 
received a proper increase since 1983 and many overtime shifts go 
unpaid laopodis said in a telephone interview 
the doctors are demanding a 30 percent salary increase in 
addition to inflationary adjustments covering the past seven years 
this year the state audit council ruled that public employees 
could not earn more than their monthly salary in overtime pay the 
costcutting measure could force some clinics to close unless 
doctors are willing to work for no pay according to the doctors 
union 
the union said interns receive 212 per month not quite half 
the wage of a factory worker

a store run by the religious affairs foundation the agency 
oversees religious affairs in turkey and came under criticism last 
week from moslems planning to make the holy pilgrimage this year to 
saudi arabia

them in advance for the pilgrimages even though the saudi 
government decided to restrict the number of moslems allowed into 
the country for the annual pilgrimage 
the foundation collected 740 from each pilgrim for travel and 
accommodation expenses it said it will return the money to those

about 25000 men flocked to indias only 
marriage fair for matchmaking negotiations and news reports said 
5000 couples agreed to tie the knot 
the fair was held over the weekend in a meadow in bihar state 
about 550 miles southeast of new delhi 
groups of men in sarongs negotiated with the male guardians of 
prospective wives lineages were checked with information supplied 
by local priests negotiations were limited to points such as what 
the man earns and what the bridetobe looks like no women were 
present 
if the priest gives the goahead that is if the bride and 
groom are not related by blood ties the marriage is on the 
couples will meet for the first time at their weddings 
according to press trust of india the practice was started by a 
14th century king to make it easier for uppercaste brahmin 
families to fix marriages and eliminate the expensive practice of 
giving dowries 
the marriage fair attracts prospects from brahmin families all 
over northern india priests reportedly maintain the lineage 
registers of brahmins from 16800 villages in the region and check 
back seven generations to avoid marriages between couples sharing 
blood ties 
the report said the number of people visiting the annual fair is 
declining a few decades ago at leat 150000 people would visit the 
fair each summer it said 
the reason for the decline the report said was that more 
people prefer private negotiations where questions of dowries can 
be raised 
although ostensibly outlawed the dowry practice is widespread 
in india where about 90 percent of marriages are arranged by 
families 
in india the family of the bride presents a dowry usually 
consisting of gold to the family of the groom

world cup fever is sweeping lebanon when 
matches begin rival christian fighters lay down their guns switch 
on their portable television sets and for a while the country is 
calm 
the only gunfire comes when excited militiamen shoot in the air 
in jubilation when their favorite soccer teams score 
when west germany played yugoslavia last week a group of 
scruffy militiamen from samir geageas christian militia gathered 
around a mobile antiaircraft gun in east beiruts ashrafiyeh 
district they watched the game on a portable tv propped up beside 
the weapon 
a few yards away their rivals the troops of gen michel aoun 
also watched the game on a tv powered by a truck battery 
when west germanys lothar matthaeus scored his second goal 
both groups whooped for joy and fired off clips of bullets into the 
air 
the germans 41 victory triggered more celebratory gunfire 
it was easy to forget for a moment that aouns troops and 
geageas militiamen have been fighting since jan 30 in a savage 
struggle for control of the christian enclave north of beirut 
the world cup has been a godsend said one man in east 
beirut we really needed a diversion even if its only for a 
month 
we know well be going back to the salt mines afterward 
he said reflecting fears that a ceasefire between aouns troops 
and geageas militiamen will collapse like others have 
the uneasy ceasefire reached last month is violated frequently 
but when world cup is on television both sides are too engrossed 
to skirmish 
across the devastated city in the teeming shiite moslem slums 
of south beirut it is the same the hezbollah and amal movements 
have been battling for three years for dominance of lebanons 
shiites but when the soccer matches begin in italy each day 
television sets in the shiite battleground and across lebanon 
switch on and the countrys 15yearold civil war eases for a few 
hours 
electricity in beirut has been cut off since early february 
because the citys power plants were knocked out in the aoungeagea 
fighting so everyone uses generators the city hums the 
authorities have allowed generators to run until midnight or until 
the end of the last game whichever comes first 
just before the world cup telecasts begin the city of beirut 
shuts down the streets are virtually deserted shops are 
shuttered people go home or congregate in bars to watch the games 
on tv 
entire streets for reasons known only to their residents 
support different teams the choice is usually arbitrary 
few lebanese have particular links with any of the countries 
competing in italy tiny lebanon has not had a national soccer team 
for years and when it did it never got anywhere near qualifying 
for the world cup 
but lebanese like most arabs are big on soccer 
at the american university of beirut in the citys moslem 
sector the campus is festooned with the flags of the competing 
soccer nations 
the night egypt scored a surprise 11 tie with the netherlands 
arab emotions erupted 
when the underdog egyptians held ireland to a scoreless draw 
sunday militiamen let their guns rip with wild abandon 
joyful aub students ran through campus carrying burning torches 
beating drums waving egyptian flags and lobbing plastic bags 
filled with water at bystanders 
i got at least 30 waterbags on my head when i tried to cross 
from the dorms to the classrooms said one student

a weekend raid by dick tracy netted an 
estimated 226 million in box office receipts including 12 
million in sales for tshirts that served as tickets at midnight 
openings 
the total led all other movies for the weekend but was lower 
than the early receipts of some recent blockbusters disney stock 
fell on the news 
the tracy debut put the cuffs on warner bros gremlins 2 
the new batch which finished fourth with 98 million for its 
first weekend 
in second place behind tracy was another 48 hrs with 
111 million followed by total recall with 102 million 
according to estimates this morning from exhibitor relations co 
in fifth place was back to the future iii with 5 million 
in ticket sales 
the debut weekend boxoffice championship remains with another 
comicbook crime fighter batman which cleaned up 405 
million for warner bros on a first weekend last summer 
dick tracy also failed to top the debut earnings of arnold 
schwarzeneggers total recall which earned 25 million in its 
opening earlier this month 
investors regarded the tracy results as well as those for 
gremlins as disappointing 
common stock in the walt disney co bid up last week on the new 
york stock exchange on favorable reviews fell by 337 per share 
in midday trading today to 12837 time warner inc stock fell by 
112 to 10537 per share 
but dick cook president of disneys buena vista pictures 
distribution said he believes dick tracy has staying power 
its never where you start its where you end cook said on 
sunday 
the way its been reviewed and the favorable way it has been 
received it is going to do extraordinarily well cook said in a 
telephone interview sunday and theres a lot of summer left 
and there are a lot of movies yet to be released too including 
tom cruise in days of thunder and sequels to robocop and 
die hard 
nevertheless cook said dick tracy was a record opening for 
disney and had all the signs of a summer winner the movie 
directed by its star warren beatty features madonna and a 
thieves den of other bigname actors reviews were mostly 
favorable 
cook estimated a weekend boxoffice of between 22 million and 
23 million and said dick tracy would get double the amount 
of business that any other movie will do this weekend 
an industry observer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the opening was not great somewhere in between its not a 
bad opening 
both noted dick tracy was opening against total recall 
back to the future iii and another 48 hrs 
dick tracy opened at 2223 theaters around the nation with a 
new roger rabbit cartoon rollercoaster rabbit admission for 
midnight thursday openings was a tshirt sold by theaters for as 
much as 20 apiece 
disney said it will include the price of the tshirt in its 
boxoffice gross despite protests from others in the movie 
industry that it would inflate the films numbers 
it is part of the box office the ticket to the event said 
cook it didnt amount to that much 
one source placed the tshirt boost at 12 million to 15 
million 
cook said the opening of dick tracy outstripped disney first 
weekend earnings for honey i shrunk the kids which took in 
142 million last year and who framed roger rabbit which 
took in 11 million 
honey went on to earn 130 million domestically roger 
brought home 160 million as the hit of 1988

chancellor helmut kohl said monday 
that full unification of the two germanys will occur this year but 
an east german leader countered that too many questions remain 
kohls remarks came as foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze met to find what 
shevardnadze called a common language for settling remaining 
questions 
in britain prime minister margaret thatcher said she was 
apprehensive about german unification its not surprising if you 
look back at the history of this century world war i and world 
war ii she told a bbc radio talk show 
kohl spoke to a meeting of christian democrats that was attended 
by east germanys prime minister lothar de maiziere kohl told his 
conservative party the year 1990 will be the year of german 
unity 
the comments followed sundays stormy session in east berlins 
parliament where lawmakers surprisingly agreed to consider 
immediate unification the legislators later backed away from a 
vote to dissolve the country and automatically join west germany 
wolfgang thierse the leader of east germanys social democrats 
said too many questions on unification remain to be resolved to 
permit it to happen this year the social democrats form part of de 
maizieres governing coalition but favor slower unification than 
the christian democrats 
thierse said lingering topics include the completion of the 
twoplusfour talks between the two germanys and four victorious 
world war ii allies the united states soviet union britain and 
france 
the foreign ministers of the six nations are scheduled to meet 
this week to discuss aspects of unification 
it would show insensitivity to our neighbors to complete 
unification before the twoplusfour talks are completed thierse 
said 
his remarks were in reference to the question of what will 
happen to former german land ceded to the poles after world war ii 
kohl and de maiziere have already said their governments are 
ready to sign a treaty guaranteeing a united germany will respect 
the existing polish border 
at mondays christian democratic meeting in bonn a resolution 
reiterating that guarantee was passed 
kohls christian democrats have also called for united german 
elections to take place dec 9 replacing west germanys federal 
elections currently set for dec 2 
both the west german and east german social democratic parties 
are against holding the ballot this year 
kohls main challenger for the chancellorship social democrat 
oskar lafonatine has also said they are against quick economic 
monetary and social union with east germany which is to take 
effect next month 
however kohl said at mondays meeting he was completely 
confident that the west german bundestag and bundesrat the lower 
and upper houses of parliament would ratify a treaty with east 
germany this week to ensure economic and monetary union begins july 
2 as planned 
there are no alternatives kohl said 
the symbolic vote of 26792 in east berlins parliament on 
sunday for discussions on immediate unity also bolstered kohls 
confidence giving him a preview of how strong support for 
unification is in east germany 
among the issues covered by shevardnadze and genscher in the 
city of muenster was a united germanys military alliance once the 
two countries have merged 
the united states and kohl and genscher support a united 
germany being in nato the soviets oppose nato membership for the 
new country

secretary of state james a baker iii 
met today with five central american presidents and discussed how 
to coordinate us and other foreign aid to build the regions 
economies 
he arrived in antigua on sunday night to attend the close of the 
threeday meeting in which the central american leaders agreed to 
form a central american economic community to fight poverty 
officials said baker outlined a plan for coordinating aid trade 
and investment in central america from a variety of nations and 
organizations 
the idea is based on the model adopted by a group of 24 
developed nations for helping poland and hungary make the 
transition to freemarket democracies 
bakers proposal is seen as a clear affirmation of us 
intentions to maintain its traditional influence in the region 
after a breakfast meeting with baker president rafael callejas 
of honduras told a joint news conference the central american 
leaders fully expect the us proposal to mean additional aid for 
the region but that no specific sums nor the touchy issue of who 
would manage the program had been discussed 
the united states has been saying it wants to manage the 
program but the regions leaders have indicated they want to 
manage it themselves or have the final decision on who would run it 
we didnt talk about sums or structures callejas said 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said there will be more 
detailed discussions at the next central american summit to be 
held sometime within the next three months in costa rica 
he said baker had committed the united states to further talks 
with the donor countries among the industrialized nations expected 
to provide central america with aid are japan canada and the 
european economic community 
baker also was to hold individual meetings with each of the 
presidents today 
the presidents all elected civilians agreed in two accords 
sunday night to try to mesh the regions economies they pledged 
coordinated action on foreign trade and debt on rebuilding 
infrastructures on agricultural and industrial policy and 
attracting investment 
costa rican president rafael calderon said the region deeply 
scarred by a decade of civil strife needs international support 
we dont extend our hand to ask for charity calderon said 
but we say to you here are the central american people who are 
willing to give their labor their effort and their dedication but 
who also need the friendly hand of the developing world 
callejas has said central america needs at least 25 billion in 
aid over the next three years to begin rebuilding 
the task will be immense according to a study by the un 
economic commission for latin america and the caribbean the 
regional gross domestic product has fallen 20 percent since 1978 
the summit marked a turning point for central america which has 
suffered decades of dictatorship revolution and political social 
and economic crisis 
war and violence are an act of human cruelty but poverty is 
an act of human abandonment we must confront the presidents of 
guatemala el salvador nicaragua honduras and costa rica said in 
their accords 
violence is a part of our history we will not forget but we 
must not repeat now we set out on other roads 
the antigua meeting was the eighth central american summit but 
the first to deal almost exclusively with economic issues 
the presidents hope to repeat the success of the nobel 
prizewinning regional peace plan in nicaragua the plan helped 
end the war and brought elections that ousted central americas 
only leftist government 
the peace plan was also the catalyst for peace talks now under 
way between leftist rebels and the governments of el salvador and 
guatemala 
the economic accords reflect a search for solutions acceptable 
to the regions powerful vested interests 
attempts to redistribute wealth have cost tens of thousands of 
lives and the development agenda for the 1990s aims at generating 
more wealth instead of at redistribution 
nicaraguan president violeta barrios de chamorro and costa rican 
president calderon both elected this year signed the plan as 
firsttime participants in a regional summit 
signing for guatemala was president vinicio cerezo 
panamanian president guillermo endara signed as an invited 
observer

crews started laying booms and 
volunteers began cleaning up beaches today to make them ready for 
an oil slick expected to wash ashore tuesday from the wrecked 
supertanker mega borg 
we cannot wait any longer texas land commissioner gary 
mauro said we dont know if oil or tar balls will ever make it 
to the coast but we have to get ready 
although 200 or more volunteers were expected only about 60 
initially showed up this morning at sea rim state park to get ready 
for the slick to hit the beach they walked the sandy beaches 
picking up seaweed and garbage to make it easier to clean up any 
tar balls that may wash ashore 
tar balls were expected to begin showing up tuesday along the 
45mile stretch of coastline from high island some 30 miles north 
of galveston to sabine pass at the texaslouisiana line the coast 
guard said 
officials tracking the 30mile slick situated about 10 miles 
offshore sunday hoped the oil would hit the areas small sandy 
beaches instead of its marshes which include wildlife refuges 
if it hits the marshlands it seeps into the ground and kills 
off the vegetation and the eggs in that area said gary clark 
president of the houston audubon society he said birds could then 
face starvation 
sandy beaches also are easier to clean officials said 
crews on sunday stretched a boom across the eastern end of 
bolivar peninsula between galveston and high island to deflect 
any oil from marshy areas 
coast guard officials said the 886foot norwegian tanker 
crippled 57 miles off galveston by an explosion june 8 has stopped 
leaking oil the vessel had been carrying 38 million gallons when 
the blast occurred 
the coast guard also lowered the spill estimate from 46 million 
gallons to 39 million still the fifthlargest us spill 
officials said salvage crews found about 700000 gallons in smaller 
tanks that catch runoff from the larger tanks on the ship 
two crew members died and two are missing and presumed dead the 
cause of the blast which occurred when the ship was transferring 
oil to a smaller vessel has not been determined 
most of the spilled oil either evaporated or burned in fires 
that raged on the ship for a week officials said twelve skimmer 
vessels have captured 250000 gallons of the crude according to 
the coast guard 
cleanup crews had expected the angolan light crude to begin 
washing ashore late sunday near galveston but shifting winds 
pushed the slick to the northeast parallel to the coast 
in the first opensea use of a process called bioremediation 
which uses bacteria to break down oil into a harmless fatty 
substance oileating microbes spread over part of the slick appear 
to have worked state officials said 
on friday about 100 pounds of bacteria were spread over an 
acre a flyover sunday showed little oil in the treated water but 
a second experiment was planned to confirm whether the process 
worked or whether the oil was removed by the current officials 
said 
meanwhile salvage crews working on the mega borg began 
transferring oil from a ruptured cargo tank to another holding bin 
aboard the vessel 
crews from smit america salvage inc also began pumping water 
out of another holding tank that flooded during the firefighting 
once those operations are finished crews will probably start 
transferring the rest of the ships cargo to smaller vessels the 
coast guard said 
by sunday crews had stopped dousing the hull of the mega borg 
coast guard chief petty officer mark sedwick said officials 
believed there was no longer a threat of the fire reigniting 
divers attempting to rescue five loggerhead sea turtles spotted 
saturday near the edge of the slick were unable to locate the 
reptiles the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said 
noaa planned to continue searching for members of the threatened 
species

the leading conservative on the soviet politburo 
yegor k ligachev on monday criticized advocates of a free market 
and called for a referendum on whether the nation should be 
capitalist or socialist 
ligachev spoke out in an interview published by the communist 
party newspaper pravda in two weeks the party is to open a 
crucial congress to debate the course of reform 
lets ask the people what direction restructuring should take 
to socialism or capitalism lets hold a national referendum 
ligachev said 
he outlined a traditional marxistleninist position that 
contrasted sharply with calls for reform being heard in the soviet 
media and legislative bodies and he urged that the nation stick 
with a planned market economy 
those who advocate a free market are pushing us back to 
private appropriation of the results of the labor of other people 
to their exploitation he said 
we have already realized the destructiveness of such freedom 
at the macrolevel when large units and republics try to secede 
from an integrated community thereby harming other republics and 
peoples he said alluding to the steps toward independence by 
the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia 
meanwhile the reformist weekly ogonyok published results of an 
opinion poll that indicated diminished support for the communist 
party among soviet citizens 
the poll was conducted by the allunion center for the study of 
public opinion it said that of soviets surveyed last month 49 
percent believed the communist party was losing the initiative 
ogonyok said 112 percent of those surveyed thought the party 
was leading society on the path to democratic renewal while 
138 percent thought the party was putting the brakes on the 
process of democratic renewal 
asked which institutions commanded the most authority in the 
soviet union 618 percent expressed complete faith in the 
army 479 percent complete faith in the church and 408 percent 
complete faith in the supreme soviet legislation the three most 
respected bodies 
at the low end of the scale were the communist party with 295 
percent expressing complete faith the police with 222 percent and 
the young communist league with 101 percent 
the poll did not say how many people were questioned or give a 
margin of error

the state of florida will test the new 
legal climate for abortion restrictions this week when it asks a 
federal judge for more authority to regulate abortion clinics 
eight years ago us district judge jose gonzalez issued a 
ruling that limited regulation of private abortion clinics to four 
areas on tuesday gonzalez is to hear testimony and arguments in 
his fort lauderdale courtroom over proposed changes in that 
injunction 
state officials hope the result will be a ruling that gives them 
broader powers to regulate sanitation and other aspects of abortion 
clinic operations abortion rights activists hope gonzalez will 
continue to give the state only limited authority over the clinics 
this is the second highprofile case in a month for gonzalez 
who on june 6 declared an album by the rap group 2 live crew to be 
obscene 
in the abortion case the state has argued that current rules of 
floridas department of health and rehabilitative services arent 
strong enough to guarantee public health and safety 
women served by abortion clinics are now treated as 
secondclass citizens in comparison to similar patients at birthing 
centers and ambulatory surgical centers the motion says 
charlene carres a lawyer representing a fort lauderdale clinic 
owner named as a plaintiff in the classaction lawsuit said the 
state wants to further regulate a procedure that already is safe 
and protected as a fundamental privacy right 
there is no justification for changing the injunction mainly 
because the safety of abortion has not declined since 1982 
carres said last week citing the states own statistics that 
firsttrimester abortions are far safer than childbirth 
while a single abortionrelated death is recorded every few 
years she said anywhere from 15 to 23 childbirthrelated deaths 
occur each year 
the numbers of death and injuries from abortion is so low its 
even difficult to make a valid statistical comparison carres 
said 
the state has less faith in that data because women are 
reluctant to come forward with complaints about abortions said jim 
peters assistant attorney general 
in its motion before gonzalez the state says it can no longer 
rely on the assumption that firsttrimester abortions are safer 
than childbirth 
in 1982 gonzalez said the state can inspect only to see if the 
clinic posts its license maintains records properly disposes of 
fetal remains and allows only physicians to perform abortions 
under the judges order the state is not allowed to enforce 
requirements on minimum care standards transportation of patients 
in emergencies staffing and equipment 
the state didnt appeal gonzalezs ruling but peters said that 
a us supreme court ruling last summer and a florida newspaper 
article last fall justified a change in the order to let the state 
inspect abortion clinics for such aspects as sanitation and 
infection control equipment maintenance staffing emergency 
procedures medicine storage and administration 
in its webster ruling last july the nations high court upheld 
a missouri law requiring viability testing of fetuses before 
allowing abortions after 20 weeks 
two months later the miami herald detailed dirty and dangerous 
conditions in south florida clinics created an unroar prompting 
hrs to use emergency powers under floridas public health statute 
to close four clinics

the worlds most dangerous terrorist it blamed his hirelings for 
34 terrorist attacks in 20 countries since he split from yasser 
arafats plo in 1973 
at least 900 people were killed or wounded in these attacks the

youngsters during a oneday federal sweep this month face more than 
1 million in fines the labor department said monday 
most of the child labor violations involved youngsters working 
more hours than is allowed under federal labor law the agency said 
but there were also 490 minors mostly 16 and 17yearolds who 
were working at dangerous tasks such as using powerdriven meat 
slicers or paperbaling machines 
the june 6 sweep in which investigators visited 2033 
businesses uncovered violations in 753 establishments or at 37 
percent of the companies visited nationwide the department said 
the names of the companies were not released 
the most recent sweep is part of an ongoing effort to crack down 
on employers illegally using teenage labor 
in march investigators working on a threeday sweep visited 
3400 businesses and found that nearly half were in apparent 
violation of child labor laws 
investigators have found 15500 violations as a result of the 
march sweep fines from that effort are expected to total 5 
million

government medical research is so sexually 
biased that even male laboratory rats are the preferred animal for 
studies according to congressional testimony monday 
what its really saying is its ok to put womens health at 
risk rep patricia schroeder dcolo told the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on health and the environment 
she was among critics who say clinical trials and the resulting 
data are skewed in favor of men 
the lack of genderspecific data communicates to doctors that 
women really arent that much at risk she said as a result 
womens problems often arent taken seriously until they reach a 
critical stage 
the national institutes of health has a 76 billion research 
budget this year an nih advisory committee reported in 1987 that 
less than 14 percent of the institutes budget went to womens 
health issues even though women make up more than half the 
population schroeder said 
only 17 million is spent on basic breast cancer research 
annually while less than 2 percent of nih grants for research went 
to obstetric and gynecological programs in 1986 and 1987 she said 
heart disease and cancers of the lung and breast are the top 
killers of women 
nih has only three obstetriciangynecologists on its permanent 
staff added schroeder mentioning also a dearth of money for 
research on infertility and contraception 
schroeder also referred to conclusions of a congressionally 
mandated study that the national institutes of health has made 
little progress in implementing its policy of including women in 
research study populations 
the policy announced in october 1986 has neither been well 
communicated nor well understood the draft study by the 
congressional general accounting office said the report was 
released at the hearing 
although nih was not given the customary opportunity to review 
the draft and have its comments made part of the final report 
before its release the acting head of the institutes said he 
generally agreed with its findings 
my colleagues and i agree that the matter warrants sustained 
high priority attention said william raub referring to the 
arrogance or indifference of scientists who knew the policy but 
refused to implement it 
he acknowledged under questioning by rep henry a waxman 
dcalif the subcommittee chairman that most laboratory 
researchers begin their work using male animals to rule out the 
menstrual cycle as a variable 
raub said this control is usually confined to the early 
stages of research waxman asked whether such a control skewed the 
results from the outset and raub acknowledged that the control 
argument has been an overworked and overused rationale 
dr claude lenfant head of the national heart lung and blood 
institute disputed one of the key assertions of the gao report 
that research on the effects of aspirin in preventing heart attacks 
in women was blocked because of cost concerns 
lenfant said the only reason for leaving women out of the study 
begun in 1981 on aspirin and heart attacks was that its design was 
flawed

the supreme court said today it will use the 
case of an eye surgeon denied staff privileges at a los angeles 
hospital to study the scope of a key federal antitrust law 
the justices agreed to hear an appeal by the hospital seeking to 
dismiss the doctors antitrust suit a ruling is not expected until 
next year 
the case stems from a dispute between dr simon pinhas and 
midway hospital medical center which is owned by summit health ltd 
pinhas a member of midways staff since 1981 protested in 1986 
a hospital requirement that an assistant surgeon be present for the 
performance of eye surgery 
medicare reimbursement for assistant eye surgeons was 
discontinued in 1986 and pinhas said requiring him to have an 
assistant present when he performed operations would cost him 
60000 a year 
the hospital refused to abolish the assistant surgeon 
requirement but offered pinhas what he called a sham contract 
promising to pay him 60000 a year for nonexistent consulting 
services 
pinhas refused to sign the contract or to return it to hospital 
officials 
he said that prompted hospital administrators to suspend his 
staff privileges at midway 
he then sued accusing hospital officials of engaging in an 
anticompetitive conspiracy forbidden by the sherman antitrust act 
he said the officials boycotted his practice and prevented his 
continued competition in the marketplace 
a federal judge threw out the suit but it was reinstated last 
year by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
at issue is whether there is enough of a connection with 
interstate commerce to invoke the sherman antitrust act 
the 9th circuit court said pinhas need only prove that 
peerreview proceedings have an effect on interstate commerce a 
fact that can hardly be disputed the proceedings affect the entire 
staff at midway and thus affect the hospitals interstate 
commerce 
hospital officials said pinhas should be required to show that 
the hospitals alleged anticompetitive conduct affects interstate 
commerce not merely that the hospital is engaged in interstate 
commerce 
the california association of hospitals and health systems 
supported midways appeal 
the case is summith health ltd vs pinhas 891679

the house on monday passed and sent to 
president bush a bill calling on the united nations to repeal a 
15yearold resolution equating zionism with racism

requires the president to report to congress periodically on 
progress toward repeal the administration supports the bill and is 
expected to sign it

justify terrorist attacks has encouraged antisemitism and has 
been a device to damage israels legitimacy 
zionism the movement to establish a jewish homeland is opposed 
by many of israels arab neighbors and their allies 
but john bolton assistant secretary of state for international 
organizations told congress in march that some countries which 
voted for the resolution now have changed their thinking he said 
us officials are talking with un member nations including the 
soviet union about repeal

candidate george bush advocated job protection 
for parental care but president bush is ready to veto a bill that 
would offer such protection 
the white house on monday denied any conflict between the two 
stances suggesting that bush now as then supports such 
protection only if it is voluntary for employers 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush stands ready to 
cast the 13th veto of his presidency on the parentalcare bill 
i wouldnt be surprised to see it this week fitzwater said 
the measure passed by congress last week would guarantee 
workers as much as 12 weeks unpaid leave for childbirth adoption 
or serious family illnesses the measure would apply to all 
businesses with 50 or more employees 
during his presidential campaign bush touched on the issue 
sept 9 1988 
look we also need to assure that women dont have to worry 
about getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a 
child during serious illness he told the illinois federation of 
republican women in rockford 
fitzwater who was president reagans spokesman throughout 1988 
and did not work in the bush campaign said he was unaware of those 
bush comments 
but fitzwater said the president opposes the present 
legislation because it is a federally mandated benefit and were 
opposed to federally mandated benefits 
deputy press secretary alixe glen who was a 1988 campaign aide 
to bush said the president supports and encourages parental 
and medical leave policies designed to meet the needs of individual 
companies and employees 
he has always been opposed to the federal government dictating 
or mandating what every business in this country should do she 
said this particular bill would badly impact a lot of companies 
it reduces small business flexibility reduces us 
competitiveness and really could undermine the current trend toward 
flexible policies ms glen said

the bush administration has asked congress to 
add 10 million or 15 million to a secret arms program for rebels 
fighting the sovietbacked government of angola a congresional 
source said monday 
some of the money would be used to buy hawk antiaircraft 
missiles adding to an arsenal of shoulderfired stinger rockets 
the rebels have used to attack government planes said the source 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
the request for the extra money prompted an angry letter from 
the congressional black caucus to sen david boren dokla 
chairman of the senate intelligence committee which oversees the 
us aid 
rep ron dellums dcalif head of the caucus said us 
weapons were directly responsible for rebel landmines that have 
resulted in angola having the largest population of amputees in the 
world according to red cross figures he called us aid morally 
indefensible 
in the june 12 letter dellums told boren he was writing in 
advance of reported pending action in your committee which would 
again direct united states resources to the angolan rebels 
he said the caucus is unalterably opposed to congressional 
action to direct american aid to rebel forces and asked boren 
and his committee to reject all attempts to allow us resources 
to enter this war region 
word of the request for extra money came as representatives of 
angolas marxist government met in portugal with rebels of the 
union for the total independence of angola unita to discuss a 
ceasefire and an end to their countrys 15year civil war 
the current annual allocation for the secret program which is 
handled by the cia and overseen by the house and senate 
intelligence committees is thought to be 50 million this fiscal 
year that ends sept 30 
the program grew from an estimated 30 million two years ago 
partly to make up a shortfall caused by south africas agreement to 
stop arming unita 
the united states airlifted large quantities of weapons to unita 
last january to counter a massive government offensive into 
rebelheld territory 
rebel leaders credit the airlift which followed a hiatus of 
several months in us arms supplies with helping to turn the tide 
against government forces and bring about their retreat from the 
strategic town of mavinga last month 
but unita representatives have said recently that their stocks 
were depleted by the battle for mavinga and that they would require 
additional arms 
the soviet union which supports angolas government with 800 
million annually according to the state department has proposed 
to the united states a cessation of arms to both sides 
secretary of state james baker said last week the united states 
would only consider stopping its support for unita if the 
government of president jose eduardo dos santos agrees to rebel 
demands for free elections in the oneparty state 
but he disclosed that the americans and soviets have proposed 
joint sponsorship of peace talks between the sides 
us officials argue that angolan forces have far bigger 
stockpiles of weapons than the rebels and an arms cutoff now would 
place unita at a disadvantage 
unita has been fighting the government since shortly after 
angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 an initial 
ceasefire mediated by zairean president mobutu sese seko last june 
collapsed within days and peace talks only restarted in april in 
evora portugal

a parliamentary chamber on monday gave 
police and soldiers authority to move against government opponents 
who retook a bucharest square after being brutally routed by 
police last week 
also monday opposition parlimentarians demanded the government 
investigate the events that led presidentelect ion iliescu to 
summon thousands of miners to help crush the unrest last week the 
miners swinging iron bars and sticks beat anyone they suspected 
of opposing iliescu 
a student leader who was severely beaten was taken into police 
custody monday and charged with helping incite the unrest 
hundreds of people gathered for a second day in university 
square to demand the ouster of iliescu and students said they 
would go on strike tuesday 
iliescus inauguration had been scheduled for last week and has 
been postponed for later this week amid the turmoil 
of the lawmakers present in the newly elected 377member chamber 
of deputies only 72 voted against the motion to have the forces 
of law and order end the university square demonstration seven 
abstained 
the vote split generally along party lines with deputies of 
iliescus national salvation front and splinter parties supporting 
it and the three main opposition parties against it 
it was unclear when action might be taken against the 
protesters who numbered about 300 late monday passage was 
virtually certain in the senate where the front also holds a clear 
majority 
the unrest began wednesday when police broke up a 535day 
sitin by protesters demanding iliescu and other communists be 
banned from office when the unrest continued iliescu summoned 
thousands of miners to the city to crush the protests 
six people were killed and more than 500 injured in the ensuing 
violence the worst since the december uprising that toppled 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
student leader marian munteanu was moved monday from the 
emergency hospital to a police hospital after being charged with 
instigation and participation in violence according to his 
opposition group the students league 
munteanu was beaten and suffered a fractured skull and broken 
left leg and arm doctors said 
the league told a news conference that students and faculty at 
the university of bucharest would go on strike tuesday to protest 
violence directed at them in the past few days 
on sunday force was not used against the demonstrators and the 
government promised dialogue 
there was no sign monday of talks between the two sides 
the protesters who demand iliescu and other excommunists be 
banned from politics shouted down with iliescu 
some spectators berated them and urged them to disperse two 
truckloads of army troops equipped with nightsticks and machine 
guns were parked nearby 
sen radu campeanu head of the liberal party told reporters as 
lawmakers convened that his party would push for a special 
parliametary commission to investigate the clashes his partys 
officies were sacked 
outside parliament dan iosif a senator close to iliescu 
defended the governments actions he said there were excesses on 
both sides but insisted the miners excesses were not so 
blameworthy 
iliescu did nothing to stop the attacks and his tactics cost 
the government western aid 
the violence ended after he thanked the miners with all my 
heart and ordered them home late friday 
that miners were called in to put down thursdays rioting raised 
questions about whether iliescu commands the loyalty of the police 
and army some romanians wondered whether iliescus front might 
have provoked the unrest in order to crack down on the opposition 
the government claims wednesdays rioting constituted a 
rightwing revolt it has said the miners seized incriminating 
material from opposition party headquarters and elsewhere but has 
yet to produce any evidence 
the university square demonstrators accuse iliescus front 
which took power in the december revolution of running a disguised 
version of the old communist order 
the front won may 20 elections by a landslide but iliescu and 
many other of its leaders are former highranking communist 
officials and opposition activists are demanding that former 
communists be barred from holding office

the head of burmas military junta on 
monday stressed that his government will not be rushed into handing 
over power to the civilian opposition that won national elections 
on may 27 
gen saw maung said a new constitution must be drafted and 
emphasized that it will be a complicated and lengthy process he 
spoke to members of historical commission 
a constitution should be sound and stable so that there would 
be no subsequent problems arising out of its shortcomings he 
said 
he implied that the constitution adopted in 1947 at the end of 
british rule was flawed and led to national strife that climaxed 
with the 1988 civilian uprising against the military 
burmese took to the streets that year to press for democracy 
briefly triumphed then were brutally crushed by army gunfire 
several thousand civilians were killed 
we will not tolerate recurrence of the 1988 situation said 
the general and will not tolerate endangerment to our three 
basic duties preventing disintegration of the union preventing 
disintegration of national solidarity and perpetuating national 
independence and sovereignty 
referring to foreign media comments urging an immediate transfer 
of power gen saw maung said it is not a trivial matter we are 
an independent nation and we are not subservient to any foreign 
influence 
we have done what we should do and every person with an 
objective mind appreciates it except the insurgents we have no 
opposition he said 
it appeared to be strong warning against pressure for immediate 
transfer of power 
the opposition scored a huge victory over conservative 
promilitary forces in the may 27 vote tallies show the parliament 
will be overwhelmingly dominated by the juntas harshest critic 
the national league for democracy 
the military has promised to yield power after newly elected 
legislators enact a constitution and form a civilian government 
but many are skeptical this promise will be kept 
gen saw maung seized power last september replacing the 
26year socialist system of army strongman ne win who many believe 
still holds behindthescenes power 
the tense political scene in burma is complicated by economic 
malaise and insurgencies by groups demanding more autonomy 
guerrillas of one of the groups the karen ethnic minority 
attacked a ferry in eastern burma on saturday and wounded 17 
passengers the stateowned working peoples daily said monday 
the paper said 20 guerrillas attacked the double decker ferry on 
the salween river in karen state about 100 miles northeast of 
rangoon they retreated when security personnel aboard the ferry 
fired back it said 
the karens have been fighting more than four decades rebel 
sources say fighting has resumed in the northern part of karen 
state following a twoweek lull that coincided with the may 
election the karens have suffered heavy losses during intensified 
government offensives in the past two years

rex harrison was recalled monday as an actor of 
charm elegance and wit at a memorial that combined an anglican 
church service jazz interludes and recollections by colleagues and 
harrisons sons carey and noel 
the crowd that gathered for the ceremony at the church of the 
transfiguration included such performers as claudette colbert 
glynis johns douglas fairbanks jr kitty carlisle hart zoe 
caldwell eileen atkins maggie smith and cliff robertson 
harrison who died june 2 at age 82 of pancreatic cancer was 
particularly remembered for portraying henry higgins in the stage 
and film versions of my fair lady the role won him both a tony 
and an oscar 
the craft of acting is a most secret subtle and complicated 
mystery and the art of comedy perhaps the most difficult and 
mysterious quality to describe or define said miss smith now 
appearing on broadway in lettice amp lovage but rex harrison 
somehow managed in his long career to master the difficulty and to 
understand the mystery 
the charm was of course not always evident offstage she 
added as the congregation laughed he seldom suffered fools 
gladly and his relationships with certain pompous directors and 
many overbearing leading ladies were often stormy he could be 
exceedingly sharp but to the general audience whether in london 
or new york he was the total matinee idol 
noel harrison the actors older son recalled some advice from 
his father dont cower charge three words he says he 
keeps in his heart as his fathers epitaph 
striding thats how i remember him noel harrison added 
he loved to take walks he didnt saunter he strode carrying 
himself with style with his head held high putting the world and 
the elements to the test 
carey harrison spoke of his fathers keen sense of himself 
faults and all 
he never preached to anyone least of all to his sons 
carey harrison said he forced us and god bless him for it it 
was the only thing he forced on us to see him clearly as a man 
and not blindly as a parent and thats how hed want us his sons 
to talk about him as a man 
brendan gill retired theater critic of the new yorker praised 
harrisons style on stage 
he only had to step from the wings to seize our attention 
gill said we leaned forward in our seats to hear the least 
utterance of that quirky enchanting voice even before he spoke 
his body language was in effect moving us 
gill also apologized on behalf of the american theater wing for 
not mentioning harrisons death on the television broadcast of the 
1990 tony awards harrison died the day before the awards ceremony 
a remembrance by jessica tandy was planned gill said but tv 
is an illmannered medium at best and because the program ran 20 
minutes over schedule the television tribute was never done

police may ask suspected drunken drivers most 
routine questions and videotape their answers without warning them 
of their rights the supreme court ruled monday 
the 81 ruling in a pennsylvania case means slurred responses to 
questions about age height and weight may be used to convict 
motorists who have not been told they have a right to a lawyer and 
to remain silent 
but the court said police may not ask a suspect more difficult 
questions for example the date of the drivers sixth birthday 
without giving socalled miranda warnings 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said 
responses to questions about height weight and similar 
biographical data are admissible because the questions fall 
within a routine booking question exception which exempts them 
from mirandas coverage 
the court ordered a state court to consider reinstating the 
drunkendriving conviction of inocencio muniz 
it was the second time in a week the court upheld police tactics 
to fight drunken driving the court ruled last week that sobriety 
checkpoints dont violate motorists rights 
an upper allen township pa policeman noticed munizs car 
stopped by the side of the road nov 30 1986 with the motor 
running 
the officer said he smelled alcohol on munizs breath and that 
the mans eyes were glazed and bloodshot the officer said he told 
muniz not to drive until he was in a condition to operate the car 
safely but muniz drove off as the officer returned to his patrol 
car 
the patrolman pursued muniz ordered him to stop and told him to 
perform some sobriety tests muniz failed all the tests 
the officer took muniz to a police station where the motorist 
was videotaped answering questions about his name address height 
weight eye color date of birth age and date of his sixth 
birthday 
only after those responses was muniz given the miranda warnings 
muniz convicted previously of drunken driving was convicted 
again and sentenced to 45 days to 23 months in prison 
the supreme court action monday reversed a pennsylvania appeals 
court ruling that threw out the latter conviction in 1988 
brennan said permitting the judge who convicted muniz to hear 
his slurred responses did not violate munizs privilege against 
selfincrimination but brennan said asking muniz to state the date 
of his sixth birthday falls into a different category 
muniz was left with the choice of incriminating himself by 
admitting that he did not then know the date of his sixth birthday 
or answering untruthfully by reporting a date that he did not 
believe to be accurate brennan said 
he said that unlike munizs responses to the other questions 
the suspects answer to the sixthbirthday question was 
incriminating because of its content not just because of the 
delivery 
four justices said they would permit the sixthbirthday question 
as well they are chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
justice thurgood marshall dissented voting to bar munizs 
conviction

a leading congressional democrat bluntly told the 
nations mayors monday they stood no chance of getting billions 
or even millions more for urban programs from expected federal 
defense savings 
theres no money for such programs until the budget blockade 
is broken house ways and means committee chairman dan 
rostenkowski told the us conference of mayors the peace 
dividend is already going to be swallowed 
rostenkowskis address to the more than 200 mayors quickly 
dampened the spirits of a group that for three days had been making 
the case that cities need a multibillion dollar infusion from the 
federal government to fight drugs poverty housing education and 
other problems 
rostenkowski came home to chicago to tell the mayors they would 
be going it alone 
yours is not an easy task the congressman said in a speech 
blaming the reagan administration for most festering urban 
problems he added that congress too was far from ready to come 
to the aid of mayors and that taxpayers were unlikely to support 
higher taxes to help cities 
he devastated everybody said boston mayor raymond flynn 
later the mayors heard a somewhat more encouraging talk from 
democratic sen robert kerrey of nebraska still even kerrey said 
peace dividend money will not fall like manna from heaven to 
cities mayors hopes rest on selling their ideas to voters much 
like reagan sold his military buildup in the early 1980s kerrey 
said 
during the weekend the mayors crafted an ambitious costly 
battle plan for attacking urban problems 
the centerpiece of the plan was a demand that money from the 
programs come from expected defense cuts with the mayors seeking 
half of whatever savings materialize rostenkowskis speech in 
effect made much of the mayors new lobbying agenda appear moot 
even before it gets final approval wednesday 
rostenkowski said he personally would support most of the 
mayors causes but decided in advance of the speech not to offer an 
upbeat prognosis 
lying is not only dishonest it can also be politically 
dangerous he said he closed his speech by saying im going 
to tell you the way it is if you dont like it too bad 
the mayors didnt like it 
the cities are in desperate need said atlantas maynard 
jackson i have heard your calls for strong leadership but what 
we need are strong answers 
when madison wis mayor paul songlin challenged rostenkowski 
and fellow democrats to tell president bush that congress was 
giving billions to cities and that money to bail out failing 
savings and loans would have to be found elsewhere the congressman 
was characteristically blunt 
we havent got the votes he said 
rostenkowski said he believed taxpayers would support new taxes 
for the environment and perhaps for basic services but he said 
they were very suspicious about higher taxes to help cities and 
their needy residents because of perceived abuses of past programs 
including those at the reaganera department of housing and urban 
development 
as for raising taxes to slash the deficit rostenkowski said 
taxpayers get downright surly when we say we have to raise taxes 
to pay for the past before we can even think about the future 
still he said some new taxes were inevitable and likely to be 
included in a deficitcutting pact congress is trying to negotiate 
with the white house 
we need to slash spending and raise taxes merely to reach 
ground zero rostenkowski said until then we will be fiddling 
at the margins 
rostenkowski said housing education and racial problems in the 
nations cities were greatly exacerbated because in the last 
administration there was ignorance and indifference to americas 
cities 
in bush rostenkowski said cities have a president whose 
rhetoric is full of support but whose programs are little different 
from his predecessor 
unfortunately will without wallet doesnt yield much of a 
result he said 
rostenkowski said he and other bigcity democrats in congress 
fail to win more federal support for cities because of powerful 
rural lobbies that back huge farm subsidies even for 
millionaires and rural health care 
the result he said is cities get no help to combat drugs and 
violence at the root of so many other urban problems 
political turf wars can be equally destructive even if they 
are less bloody he said

libyan leader moammar gadhafi may be building 
a second chemical weapons factory at a remote underground location 
hundreds of miles south of tripoli bush administration officials 
disclosed monday 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said in 
interviews with the associated press that its not clear whether 
construction is complete 
were not sure until then what exactly the facility will be 
one official said 
however the officials declined to say how the activity that 
points to work on a second plant was detected or to pinpoint the 
exact location 
even so the state department publicly registered concern 
its dangerous for the entire region and for the entire 
world you could say said spokesman richard boucher 
there are reports that libya has already used a weapon of mass 
destruction chemical weapons in combat and because of the 
gadhafi regimes support for terrorism boucher said 
he referred to allegations that libya used chemical weapons in 
an invasion of chad a neighboring african country several years 
ago 
us intelligence with assistance from such friendly countries 
as france and israel keeps watch over gadhafis military 
activities 
we dont comment on intelligence matters generally white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said when asked about a report in 
mondays washington times that libya as building a second plant 
on the other hand we are making an assessment we just dont 
have any conclusions to give he said 
the officials said gadhafis purpose in building a second plant 
would be to divert some poison gas production from rabta even 
though the purported march fire at the factory about 40 miles 
south of tripoli evidently was a hoax 
there was little damage and were still talking about the 
possibility of a hoax an official said in fact thats the 
only possibility under consideration 
fitzwater also said the rabta fire apparently was a hoax and 
also a pretty clear indication of intentions and willingness to 
deceive the world in order to further their own intents on this 
issue 
were prepared to believe the worst fitzwater said 
gadhafi says the rabta plant is a pharmaceutical production 
factory however us and west german officials have said it was 
producing small amounts of chemical weapons and that libya was on 
the verge of bringing production up to full capacity 
boucher called rabta a dangerous facility 
were very seriously concerned about it he said were 
reports of a second chemical weapons production facility to prove 
true our concern would be that much greater our position remains 
that any chemical weapons facility in libya must be dismantled 
boucher said rabta was still capable of producing chemical 
weapons 
weve spoken with many countries capable of supplying 
manpower expertise or equipment to a libyan chemical weapons 
facility he said we have urged them of course not to do so 
last week west german businessman jurgen hippenstielimhausen 
confessed in a regional court in mannheim that he was responsible 
for secretly selling a chemical production plant to libya for 150 
million 
meanwhile the libyan news agency jana monitored by the british 
broadcasting corp quoted gadhafi as urging scientists sunday to 
work day and night to build a nuclear weapon in defiance of 
america 
he also called for development of libyan space technology 
america manufactures missiles and puts above our heads 
satellites gadhafi was quoted as saying this provokes you and 
ignites in you the spirit of defiance and revolution to reach space 
and manufacture the atom 
he blamed the united states for withholding technology libya 
needs 
gadhafi also accused israel of aiming nuclear weapons at arab 
cities

the third defendant in the bensonhurst racial 
slaying played a key role in assembling the white mob that attacked 
and killed a black teenager last summer a prosector said monday 
in her opening argument 
the 21yearold defendant john vento also heard joseph fama 
convicted of murder in the ase say he was going to shoot one of 
the blacks and knew fama was carrying a pistol assistant district 
attorney pamela hayes told the jury 
the attack ms hayes said was to be a group project one for 
all and all for one 
vento she said was as guilty of the killing as the trigger 
man john vento was no mere follower she said 
defense lawyer gerald dichiara maintained that fama who 
prosecutors said was the triggerman acted independently in 
shooting yusuf hawkins in the chest vento was present and ready to 
fight if necessary dichiara acknowledged but neither hurt nor 
threatened anyone 
nobody saw joey fama with a gun that night until it was too 
late the lawyer said fama he said acted alone and without 
warning when he pulled an automatic pistol and shot the 16yearold 
hawkins 
yusuf hawkins was not kicked to death yusuf hawkins was not 
beaten to death it was not a mob that caused yusuf hawkins to 
die dichiara said 
dichiara also cited the deal vento struck with prosecutors after 
fleeing new york following the aug 23 slaying in september vento 
called prosecutors and said he had taken part in the attack in 
brooklyns bensonhurst section 
in exchange for immunity from prosecution vento agreed to 
testify before a grand jury and said he would take the stand 
against his friends but around christmas vento again fled new 
york 
if he was this evil kid they just described in their opening 
statement do you think they would have considered that deal 
dichiara asked of the pact vento made with prosecutors in the weeks 
after the slaying 
in march vento surrendered to federal law enforcers in ohio 
but said he would no longer honor his agreement to cooperate he 
was indicted by a grand jury 
he was charged with two counts of seconddegree murder riot 
assault unlawful imprisonment menacing aggravated harassment 
discrimination and criminal possession of a weapon and is being 
held without bail 
vento faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of murder 
fama was convicted may 17 of murdering hawkins the following 
day codefendant keith mondello was acquitted of murder and

militant kashmiris declared a 
governmentinexile monday to advance their moslem secessionist 
movement in the disputed region between india and pakistan 
the move complicates already tense relations between the two 
countries their governments agreed monday to talks aimed at easing 
the threat of war ovr kashmir 
amanullah khan chairman of the jammukashmir liberation front 
announced the governmentinexile at a news conference in 
muzzaffarabad capital of pakistanheld kashmir his front is one 
of the key groups behind the uprising in indias jammukashmir 
state 
a former indian ambassador to the united states karan singh 
was named a member of the 24seat cabinet said liberation front 
spokesman raja muzzafar 
khans organization wants the former princely state of kashmir 
now split between india and pakistan to be reunited and granted 
independence clashes during the 6monthold uprising mostly in 
india have left more than 550 people dead 
mondays announcement by the secessionists came shortly before 
india formally agreed to highlevel talks with pakistan to defuse 
tension along their common border 
indian officials said delegates from the two nations will meet 
early next month but a date and site has not been set 
in islamabad pakistans foreign secretary tanvir ahmed khan 
confirmed the proposed meeting i think this is a welcome 
development he said this could be a good beginning 
india and pakistan both claim kashmir a predominately moslem 
state that joined mainly hindu india when britain partitioned the 
subcontinent along religious lines in 1947 
india and pakistan fought wars over kashmir in 1948 and 1965 
the territory is now divided by a ceasefire line and the armies 
of both countries have massed troops and artillery along the border 
india accuses pakistan of arming and training moslem kashmiri 
militants who are fighting for independence from india 
pakistan denies the charges but supports the uprising on the 
indian side of the ceasefire line calling it a movement for 
selfdetermination 
an indian official said the new governmentinexile could 
endanger the planned talks 
it is certainly not going to help pakistan or relations 
and i hope it has not derailed this process of opening talks 
said one senior official at the indian high commission the embassy 
in islamabad he spoke on condition of anonymity 
militant members of khans group have warned the uprising could 
spill into pakistan if it refuses demands for independence 
but tanvir ahmed khan pakistans foreign secretary rejected 
khans government and the groups demands for independence 
pakistan has instead called for a plebiscite that would allow 
kashmiris to decide whether to join pakistan or india there was 
no question of a third choice ahmed khan said monday 
muzzaffar refused to identify the headquarters of his new 
government 
the indian embassy official warned that peace talks with 
pakistan would be very difficult if prime minister benazir 
bhuttos government allows khans provisional government to 
establish its headquarters in pakistan 
the newly elected president of pakistancontrolled azad free 
kashmir sultan mahmood also rejected khans government 
there is already a government there is no need for his 
mahmood said i dont think of myself as only the president of 
azad kashmir but also of indianoccupied kashmir 
most of indias 880 million people are hindus kashmir is the 
countrys only moslem majority state

and drove both rotor systems and we landed without incident it was 
designed to do just that 
arnold said it was the first emergency landing on record for the 
v22 the cause of the malfunction was not immediately known 
the osprey can hover and land like a helicopter but also flies 
at up to 340 mph as a fixedwing airplane much faster than a 
helicopter large rotors on the ends of the wings tilt up for 
vertical flight and rotate forward for the long haul 
arnold said the aircraft one of four osprey prototypes was in 
airplane mode when the engine failed 
it flew in airplane mode back to the airport where it 
swooped down and landed like a helicopter said bob leder another 
bell helicopter textron spokesman

has contracted 
the defense department has spent 2 billion to develop the v22 
osprey and its predecessor the xv15 for military use but 
defense secretary dick cheney wants to end funding in favor of

politics had played a role in the investigation and prosecution of 
the threeterm mayor

already have formed opinions about the investigation and 
prosecution of barry but all said in questioning as prospective 
jurors that they would set aside their personal views if called to 
deliberate the mayors fate 
one member of the panel harriedell jones said she regards the 
undercover operation against barry as unfair and added that she 
felt race had played a role in the case

persuaded to come to the room by exmodel rasheeda moore who was

judge will instruct the panel that the fbi sting operation was 
legal

misdemeanor count of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to 
a federal grand jury about his alleged involvement with drugs

courier for a local messenger service an unemployed school 
crossing guard and an accounting assistant at the us department 
of housing and urban development

an environmental group called on the bush 
administration monday to participate in an international effort to 
phase out a commonly used chemical that is depleting the ozone 
layer 
the natural resources defense council also urged consumers to 
avoid buying 141 products ranging from artists varnishes to 
hornetkilling sprays that contain the chemical 
111trichloroethane 
chloroflourocarbons or cfcs have been singled out as the most 
potent ozonedestroying substances but the council said 111 as 
it is known for short is responsible for a large share of ozone 
depletion because it is produced in such large quantities 
approximately 724 million pounds of 111 were produced in 1988 
by dow chemical ppg industries and vulcan chemical according to 
the nrdc 
the group said 90 percent of the chemical is used in industrial 
solvents consumer goods that contain it include scotchgard fabric 
protectors manufactured by 3m products of st paul 
for most applications there are alternative products on the 
market that serve the same purpose both in industry and 
individual homes the nrdc said 
representatives of 70 nations will open a 10day meeting in 
london on wednesday to consider revisions to an international 
agreement that freezes production and consumption of cfcs at their 
1986 level the pact known as the montreal protocol also calls 
for a 50 percent reduction in cfcs by 1998 
the most difficult decisions remaining relate to 
111trichloroethane said david d doniger director of the 
nrdcs ozone protection project he said options under 
consideration range from a 25 percent rollback to a complete 
phaseout in the next 10 years 
doniger said japan the united states and the european community 
are balking at going further than 50 percent but he said that 
would not be sufficient to prevent serious damage to the ozone 
layer 
so we call on the nations represented in london and 
particularly on the united states to do all that is needed to 
protect the ozone layer the nrdc attorney said lets not 
settle for another treaty that goes only part way 
thomas snead special assistant for public affairs in the state 
departments office of environmental affairs said he was not able 
to say what the us proposal would be because it was part of the 
negotiating position 
evidently it will be one of the things that they will be 
discussing at the meetings of the parties snead said 
the nrdc and other environmental groups have argued that 
manmade chemicals are stripping away the earths ozone layer 
permitting more of the suns ultraviolet rays to slip through and 
increasing the danger of cancer and environmental damage 
rick renner a spokesman for 3m said the company is working on 
replacements for 111 
i have to say that this is not easy renner said at this 
point the available substitutes tend to be flammable contribute 
to global warming and contribute to smog and are toxic and we are 
not using them 
four varnishes and fixatives marketed by m grumbacher inc a 
cranbury njbased art supply firm were on the nrdc list of 
consumer products containing 111 
godfrey chambers technical services manager for grumbacher 
said the four products damar varnish myston retouch varnish and 
tuffilm fixative are manufactured by a supplier and purchased by 
grumbacher for resale 
the person we purchase it from is continuing research in this 
matter to try and eliminate it chambers said he said the 
company has already removed 111 from some of its other aerosols

a soviet pilot landed a passenger plane on 
a beach on turkeys black sea coast monday and asked for political 
asylum officials quoted him as saying he wanted to flee the 
undemocratic regime in moscow 
a government announcement said the pilot was alone in the 
antonov2 plane when it landed near kumcagiz a village in kocaeli 
province 
the official soviet news agency tass said the 12seat plane was 
seized in izmail near the ukrainian port of odessa the report 
offered few details 
the turkish statement identified the pilot as valeri yuricevic 
kocaeli gov ihsan dede said yuricevic was married and had a 
child he said the pilot recently separated from his wife 
tass said the pilot resigned several months ago from his job 
with an odessa air crew 
officials quoted yuricevic as saying during an interrogation 
that he escaped the undemocratic regime in his country and 
wanted to live in turkey 
dede told the associated press that yuricevic 29 complained 
about harsh living conditions in the soviet union where shortages 
are widespread and economic problems continue he said the pilot 
did not elaborate 
dede said yuricevics request for political asylum was being 
examined 
state tv showed the plane near the coastline a village girl 
interviewed on television said residents watched the plane land 
she said the pilot approached her after he got out of the plane and 
spoke to her in russian 
another villager said the pilot was shaking and looked nervous 
villagers brought the pilot to the police station dede said 
the plane flying at low altitude made the trip in two hours 
turkeys announcement said the plane was tracked immediately 
after it entered turkish airspace and military planes were put on 
alert 
however the plane was allowed to land safely when authorities 
determined it posed no threat there are no airports in the 
province 
a government official who requested anoynmity said the soviets 
immediately asked turkey to return the plane and the pilot 
dede said local officials were waiting for a team of technical 
experts to move the plane which sunk into the sand on the beach 
when a soviet air force captain defected to this country in a 
mig29 jet a year ago turkey allowed the plane to be flown back to 
the soviet union but sent the pilot to the united states upon his 
request

volunteers gathered on a beach monday 
to begin searching for a wave of tar balls expected to come ashore 
this week from the wrecked super tanker mega borg a mexican vessel 
continued to skim oil off the gulf of mexico 
although hundreds of volunteers were expected only about 60 
showed up monday morning at sea rim state park between high island 
and sabine pass for the first beach sweep 
they walked the sandy shoreline picking up seaweed trash and 
tar balls from smaller oil spills to make it easier to clean up any 
oil from the norweiganowned tanker small amounts of tar 
frequently wash up on the beach here 
they said they needed volunteers and i said does that mean 
me and i said why not me said jo krose who drove two hours 
from kirbyville to participate in the beach cleanup 
they need some help and nobodys depending on me today so i 
came down she said 
state officials expect several hundred more volunteers to help 
in the cleanup this week said andy mangan deputy texas land 
commissioner 
tar balls are predicted to begin washing ashore on tuesday 
somewhere along a 45mile stretch northeast of galveston the area 
predicted to be hit is between high island and sabine pass a town 
near the texaslouisiana line 
the 30mile oil slick was about seven miles offshore monday and 
had been moving about two miles a day the coast guard said 
officials hoped the oil would hit the sandy beaches rather than 
the marshes where wildlife refuges are located sandy beaches are 
easier to clean 
the major part of the toxicity has gone dissipated from the 
oil said sharon christopherson of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric adminstration the longer it stays out there the 
less oil youll see come ashore 
although coast guard officials said most of the 39 million 
gallons of oil that has leaked from the vessel has either burned 
off or been collected they conceded they were not sure how much 
remained on the water 
its really hard i keep telling you 12000 to 40000 gallons 
and now weve picked up 250000 and my credibility is waning 
here said coast guard capt thomas greene 
he said 250000 gallons had been collected d3of sunday but the 
figure is rising 
a 200footlong skimming vessel owned by pemex the national oil 
company of mexico was being used to suck oil off the water 
the vessel was first used sunday to suck about 63000 gallons of 
mostly oil and water from the gulf about 12 skimmers have been 
used during the past week to get more oil off the water 
the mexican vessel works by opening its front end sucking up 
the oil and water and filtering it so the oil can be reused this 
is the first time it has been used on open waters said armando 
espinola a vice admiral with the mexican navy 
the vessel can suction up to 1000 gallons an hour 
it exceeded my expectations greene said i had no idea 
what it could do 
professional cleanup crews also laid booms monday to help 
protect the shore from oil that leaked from the tanker now 
crippled some 57 miles off galveston 
salvage crews also continued to pump water from the fiveravaged 
pump and engine rooms and a cargo tank that spilled the oil they 
also poured more firefighting foam on the cargo tank to keep it 
from reigniting 
coast guard cmdr michael slack said crews plan to begin 
transferring oil from the tanker to a smaller vessel on tuesday 
the 886foot mega borg was carrying 38 million gallons of light 
angolan crude oil when it was rocked by an explosion june 8 two 
crew members died and two are missing and presumed dead

bulgaria on monday became the first east 
european nation to freely elect a parliament dominated by the 
former communist party opting for a slow changeover to a market 
economy 
while bulgarias first free elections in 58 years ends the 
communists rubberstamp domination of politics it also ensures a 
sizeable opposition with enough votes to veto constitutional 
proposals 
we will resolutely move in the direction of a democratic 
european leftist party premier andrei lukanov said expressing 
confidence he could form a government of consensus 
but the leader of the main opposition alliance rejected any deal 
with the former communists 
according to official results of sundays runoff elections the 
ruling socialist party which until april was the communist party 
clinched an absolute majority with 211 seats in the 400seat 
parliament 
the main opposition union of democratic forces udf a 16party 
alliance captured 144 seats the ethnic turkish rights and 
freedoms movement won 23 seats and the mainstream agrarian party 
16 smaller parties and independents won six seats 
the capital sofia going against the nationwide trend voted 
overwhelmingly for the opposition electing udf candidates for 24 
of 26 available seats 
analysts say the socialists represent stability for many who 
feared the loss of jobs and social upheaval in a quick switch to 
private ownership favored by the udf the socialists favor leaving 
some industry staterun for now 
bulgaria has a nearly centuryold communist tradition more 
deeply rooted than elsewhere in eastern europe and the current 
socialist leadership scored points for ousting hardliner todor 
zhivkov in november and initiating gradual reforms 
the socialist leaders were also seen as more charismatic and 
their campaign more professional than the sevenmonthold udf 
apart from bulgaria noncommunist parties have triumphed in 
this years round of national elections in east germany 
czechoslovakia and hungary following last years regional 
revolutions in romania the national salvation front that won a 
landslide victory includes many excommunists 
the new government must tackle the countrys 10 billion foreign 
debt rising inflation and shortages of basic goods the newly 
elected unicameral grand national assembly must also write a 
constitution which requires twothirds approval for adoption 
victorious socialist party leaders many carrying red 
carnations were applauded and kissed by cheering supporters 
in an interview with the associated press lukanov reiterated 
his refusal to head a cabinet composed only of members of his own 
socialist party 
he welcomed remarks made by udf chairman zhelyu zhelev about the 
possibility of what lukanov described as a government of 
responsible and competent personalities 
this does not mean i accept his idea i note with great 
interest his recognition that a government if it is to be 
successful has to be supported by all political forces lukanov 
declared 
but zhelev told the ap the udf would not be part of a socialist 
government though another senior udf official petar beron said a 
government of experts remained a possible consideration 
the udf coordinating council the alliances executive organ 
was scheduled to meet tuesday to hammer out a joint stand and 
informed sources said heated discussions were expected 
zhelev described the outcome of the elections means we are a 
strong constructive opposition and the bsp socialists will be a 
weak oneparty government 
he said the idea of a government of nonpolitical professionals 
was made when there was a real likelihood of a hung parliament 
in such a situation as is usual in theory and practice in the 
world they have to form their own government zhelev explained 
if they dont like that they can form a government of experts of 
their own but we will not be part of it 
lukanov 51 a multilingual economics expert suggested a split 
in his party possibly at a new party congress this fall and in 
the udf could change bulgarias political landscape and ensure 
ultimate stability 
the present distribution of forces is rather artificial the 
premier noted it hides the diversity of views nuances 
ideologies 
the socialists gained 172 seats in firstround voting june 10 
and needed to capture only 29 of the 81 seats at stake in sundays 
runoff to win a majority 
according to the official results released by the central 
electoral commission the socialists won 39 and the udf won 37 the 
remainder went to independents and smaller parties 
state television reported some voting irregularities in the 
runoff dimiter ivanov an activist from the association of fair 
elections said in some cases the number of people voting exceeded 
the number of people registered in the respective precincts

two us soldiers possibly three were 
accidentally killed by their comrades during the panama invasion 
the pentagon said monday in disputing a newsweek report that nine 
were killed that way 
the defense department also disputed the magazines contention 
that as many as 60 percent of the more than 300 us soldiers 
wounded in the dec 20 invasion were hit by socalled friendly 
fire 
of the 324 american servicemen wounded in action during 
operation just cause 19 were definitely the result of friendly 
fire said the statement 
the statement added that an additional 21 soldiers were injured 
during intense fighting in the vincinity of the commandancia the 
headquarters of gen manuel noriegas headquarters by either 
friendly or enemy fire 
we cannot distinguish which of the 21 were hit by friendly or 
enemy fire the pentagon statement said 
if all 21 in the uncertain category were hit by friendly fire 
the total of 40 wounded that way would be 12 percent of the wounded 
the statement said that the two soldiers killed as a result of 
friendly fire died during the battle at rio hato where us 
rangers were dropped as part of task force red southwest of panama 
city 
in the case of one additional serviceman killed in action it 
has not been determined if his death was a direct result of 
friendly or enemy fire the circumstances of his death are under 
investigation the statement said 
the other 20 servicemen who were killed died as a result of 
enemy fire said pentagon spokeswoman maj kathy wood 
the statement amounted to one of the most detailed reports on 
the deaths of us servicemen that has been issued in the six 
months since the invasion 
normally very detailed after action reports are compiled in 
the wake of any military action but they are usually very closely 
held 
in its statement the pentagon said it has been investigating 
every report of injury to us personnel caused by friendly fire 
during operation just cause 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition of not being identified 
by name said confusion over the deaths could have arisen because 
noriegas troops used ussupplied bullets and weapons 
given the sensitivity of the issue the response to the newsweek 
report was approved by secretary of defense dick cheney and gen

the national transportation safety board said 
monday that federal authorities arent doing enough to protect 
airliners from dangerous winds during takeoff and landing at major 
airports 
the board which has no regulatory power recommended that the 
federal aviation administration buy additional groundbased 
equipment to warn planes of sudden changes of wind speed and 
direction known as windshear 
at least eight passenger plane accidents in the last 17 years 
have been blamed at least in part on wind hazards 
the fourmember board noted that the faa has taken several steps 
to protect airplanes against windshear including future required 
installation of detection equipment aboard airliners 
however the board believes that additional actions are 
required by the faa for maximum protection against this hazard in 
the national airspace system said a board announcement 
board recommendations were outlined in a 11page letter to faa 
administrator james busey 
the board called for appointment of an faa meteorologist at 
major airports and purchase of sophisticated weather radar systems 
at all airports determined to be susceptible to lowaltitude 
windshear conditions 
the invisible hazard which occurs under thunderstorms or in 
connection with weather fronts is considered most dangerous near 
the ground at airports where it can affect planes during takeoff or 
landing 
the board also called for interim improvements at airports where 
installation of windshear detection equipment might take some time 
to install or where the weather radar systems arent planned 
the board said its recommendations were based on a review of 
more than 40 safety recommendations it has issued to the faa over 
the past 16 years 
the safety board which operates independently from the faa or 
the transportation department investigates accidents and regularly 
makes recommendations for safety improvements in transportation 
systems it gave the faa 90 days to respond

with an estimated one million americans 
infected with the aids virus the american medical association on 
monday announced plans to teach the public and frontline 
physicians about the deadly disease 
virtually every physician will see aids or hiv disease 
firsthand within the next 10 years dr roy m schwarz the amas 
top executive for medical education said in opening the second 
annual american medical association hiv conference 
the amas posture is that every physician has to be prepared 
to treat cases he said schwarz estimated that five percent of 
doctors and nurses refuse to treat aids patients 
the ethics of the situation are patently clear you cannot 
according to any ethical code refuse to treat anybody solely on 
the basis of positive hiv test lifestyle or frank hiv 
disease he said 
the twoday ama onference combined with a campaign by the 
centers for disease control came on the eve of the sixth 
international conference on aids in san francisco which begins 
wednesday 
although getting americans to realize what human 
immunodeficiency virus is and the risks involved is crucial said 
schwarz the goal of the ama is to instruct the physician to assume 
leadership in providing patient counseling specifically on the hiv 
test 
schwarz displayed guidelines designed to teach doctors about 
blood testing and counseling patients whose behavior may put them 
at risk for the disease schwarz said an estimated million 
americans are hivinfected and that 15 million to 20 million 
people may be infected globally by 2000 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv 
the guidelines for physicians are frank one section discusses 
the physicians responsibility to learn beforehand whether a 
patient might commit suicide if a blood test turns out positive 
dr gary noble cdc deputy director in charge of the hiv program 
and assistant surgeon general of the us public health service 
told plans for a nationwide media blitz to get the aids story to 
every american 
key to the program dubbed phase 5 are public service ads 
on television radio and in print four of the ads will be in 
spanish 
we have two main goals in this phase first to familiarize 
the public with hiv since we want people to understand that hiv 
infection can occur without symptoms and the patient can remain 
relatively well for yearswithout developing aids he said 
the second goal is to get every american to think about how 
much danger of hiv infection they may be at because of their own 
behavior having sex with someone who has shared a needle with 
an infected person he said 
noble went on we would hope that each individual would decide 
if there is any danger that they have been infected and that urges 
them to seek counseling and an appropriate evaluation hiv can 
happen to anyone

as hurricane season begins 
burnedout light bulbs have forced storm specialists to rely on 
one instead of two highorbit weather satellites for the fifth 
time in seven years 
only one highorbit us weather satellite is watching us 
coastlines meaning that this year again hurricane specialists 
wont get a full picture of the atlantic oceans hurricane breeding 
grounds 
efforts to keep two satellites going havent worked so the 
working one being nudged into hurricaneseason position at a mere 
mph to save fuel will have to get through the 1991 season alone 
if this satellite goes 7 fails like three predecessors 
forecasters lose one of their best tools for monitoring everything 
from hurricanes threatening the east coast to typhoons off hawaii 
the problem is the satellites 1000 light bulbs which create 
the photographic images forecasters use to watch weather systems 
only one satellite has outlived its fiveyear design life before 
its light bulbs burned out and then by just seven months two 
others lasted only three years before their 1000 light bulbs 
failed 
a fourth satellite was lost in 1986 when the delta rocket 
carrying it had to be destroyed in flight 
to solve the light bulb problem goes 7 also was equipped with 
lightemitting diodes similar to whats used in calculators 
that should be more durable said gary davis noaas chief of 
satellite operations 
the geostationary operational environmental satellite placed in 
orbit 22300 miles above earth has a speed matching earths 
rotation so it appears parked above a particular spot 
when two goes satellites work in tandem forecasters can see 
from the coast of africa out into the pacific ocean beyond the 
hawaiian islands but noaa has had trouble keeping two working at 
once 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration says the 50 
million goes 7 is the sturdiest of its series 
for two years goes 7 has bounced back and forth across the sky 
spending the hurricane season at 98 degrees longitude above the 
galapagos islands and the rest of the year 611 miles to the west 
at 108 degrees longitude where theres a better view of the 
pacific ocean beyond the hawaiian islands 
goes 7 should be in hurricane position by aug 21 the season 
runs june 1 to nov 30 but historically the worst storms are born 
in september and october 
the satellites position is a compromise goes 7 will not be 
able to see all the way to the cape verde islands off the coast of 
africa where killer hurricanes tend to form but if it was moved 
farther east it couldnt be used to monitor pacific ocean storms 
if goes 7 fails the national hurricane center still will be 
able to get pictures four times a day from two polarorbiting 
weather satellites and as a storm approaches land 
hurricanehunter airplanes could provide updates 
goes has a tremendous public relations value lawrence said 
all the news programs show the satellite pictures its such an 
excellent way to get people to respond to the threat he said 
next summer noaa plans to launch the first of a new generation 
of more powerful satellites called goes next but that satellite 
wont be ready for hurricane duty until 1992 
ground controllers hope they can keep goes 7s fuel burning 
slowly enough to keep its lights on until both goes next satellites 
are up and running

another red army faction suspect the eighth fugitive of the 
terrorist organization taken into custody in 12 days 
the official news agency adn reported silke maierwitt one of 
24 remaining top red army faction suspects wanted by west germany 
was arrested monday afternoon without resistance 
ms maierwitt 40 is wanted in connection with the 
kidnapslaying of west german industry chief hansmartin schleyer 
in october 1977 and an attempted rocket attack against west 
germanys federal prosecutors office in august 1977 
adn quoting a statement from the east german interior ministry 
did not say where in east germany that the womans arrest occurred 
interior minister peter michael diestel in a statement said he 
plans to hold a news conference on ms maierwitts arrest tuesday 
adn said in the short report 
no one from the west german federal prosecutors office could be 
immediately reached late monday for comment 
the red army faction has been waging attacks against nato us 
and west german industrial targets since the early 1970s among 
those killed were a us army officer and leading west german 
bankers and industrialists 
the first of the recent arrests took place june 6 when east 
german officials announced the apprehension in east berlin of 
sussanne albrecht the 39yearold suspect is also wanted in the 
schleyer case and for killing prominent dresdner bank chief juergen 
ponto in july 1977 
a week later officials arrested inge viett 46 in the east 
german city of magdeburg ms viett has been linked to the murder 
of prominent west berlin judge guenter von drenkmann in 1974 and 
the shooting death of a french policeman in 1981 
on june 15 authorities announced the arrest of four more 
suspected terrorists in the east german cities of frnkfurt an der 
oder and cottbus 
they have been identified as monika helbing 36 ekkehard von 
seckendorffgudent 39 werner lotze 38 and christine duemlein 
41 
ms helbing and lotze have also been linked to the schleyer case 
seckendorffgudent a doctor who had a permanent visitors pass 
to a hamburg prison is accused of supporting the gang by providing 
his pass to other terrorists to visit their jailed comrades 
ms duemlein was released shortly after her arrest because the 
warrant against her issued in 1980 for being a suspected terrorist 
group member expired in 1985 west german officials said the 
warrant will not be renewed 
on june 16 officials arrested red army faction suspect sigrid 
sternebeck 40 who is wanted in the shooting death of us army 
spec 4 edward pimental in august 1985 
sternebeck allegedly lured the soldier out of a discotheque near 
wiesbaden to steal his identification card 
the identification card was used the next day to plant a car 
bomb at the headquarters building of the us air forces 
rhinemain air base two more americans were killed in the aug 8 
1985 blast and 20 people were injured 
west germany have been infuriated by revelations that some of 
its top fugitives were sheltered by the now ousted communists 
both sternebeck and albrecht have told investigators they were 
provided help and new identification by east german secret police 
adn reported 
eduard lintner a leading conservative lawmaker in bonn has 
called for former east german leader erich honecker and his top 
lieutenants to be extradited to west germany to face possible 
charges of aiding the terrorists 
but early monday west german chief federal prosecutor 
alexander von stahl said in an interview with deutschlandfunk 
radio in cologne that until now there are only vague 
indications of official support for west german terrorists during 
the honecker era 
simply providing the red army faction members with shelter is 
insufficient for an indictment against the former leaders of the 
german democratic republic for supporting a criminal 
organization von stahl said

an indian tribe can enforce its own hiring 
and promotion laws against a nonindian employer operating within 
the reservation a federal appeals court ruled monday 
reversing a lowercourt decision the panel of the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals ruled 30 that the shoshonebannock tribes 
on the fort hall reservation in southeastern idaho could regulate 
employment practices at a phosphorus plant owned by fmc corp on 
private land inside the reservation borders 
the tribes said fmc the largest employer on the reservation 
with 600 workers had violated a 1981 agreement requiring it to 
hire and promote more indians the tribes suit sought enforcement 
of their ordinance requiring preferential hiring and promotion of 
indians by all employers on the reservation 
this is an extremely important case to indian tribes said 
melody mccoy lawyer for the native american rights fund which 
filed papers siding with the shoshonebannocks she said several 
other cases pending in the court raise the same issue of tribal 
authority over nonindian employers 
most reservations suffer from severe unemployment and shoban 
is no exception mccoy said when there are big employers like 
fmc they are trying to say youre on our reservation taking 
tribal resources and making a profit how about cutting us some of 
the pie 
fmcs lawyer in the case did not return telephone calls the 
company could appeal the ruling to the supreme court 
the tribes dissatisfied in late 1986 with fmcs performance 
under the 1981 agreement sued the company in tribal court 
fmcs employment record is very bleak the tribes general 
counsel jeanette wolfley said monday they only employ a 
handful of indians she said the company also fell far short of 
the required standards for promotions and contracting with 
indianowned firms 
the tribal appellate court ordered fmc to choose qualified 
indians for 75 percent of new jobs and all new promotions give 
local indians onethird of all training opportunities and pay a 
100000 annual fee 
fmc went to federal court and won a ruling in april 1988 from 
us district judge marion callister that it was not governed by 
the tribal ordinance but the appeals court disagreed 
the court said the phosphorus plant though on privately owned 
land within the reservation borders uses minerals from tribal land 
under leases with the indians and is subject to tribal taxation 
fmc actively engaged in commerce with the tribes and so has 
subjected itself to the civil jurisdiction of the tribes said 
the opinion by judge jerome farris 
the court did not order immediate enforcement of the tribal 
hiring plan however instead the case was returned to the tribal 
appellate court to consider any claims by fmc that its rights would 
be violated by the application of the tribal ordinance

the us supreme court on monday let stand a 
decision that granted a lifetime professorship to a woman whose 
sexual bias lawsuit alleged that boston university president john 
silber harbored sexist attitudes 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the lower 
court decision interfered with the schools academic freedom the 
decision required the university to grant tenure to julia prewitt 
brown 
i am glad that the supreme court has affirmed the longstanding 
authority of college faculties to judge scholarship and teaching 
an authority that has been undermined of late by the impositions of 
college administrators ms brown said in a statement released by 
her attorney 
ms brown who now teaches at providence college intends to 
return to boston university said dahlia rudavsky her lawyer 
she wants to go back now that were at a logical place between 
semesters shell be back soon 
ms brown had been teaching at boston for six years when she 
became eligible for tenure in 1979 an english department committee 
voted 220 that she receive tenure and its recommendation was 
supported 92 by a university committee 
silber opposed tenure and recommended instead that she remain on 
probation for three more years silber relied in part on a report 
by the university provost questioning ms browns scholarly 
credentials 
silber on monday said the issue was settled and he wished ms 
brown all the best 
he also defended himself against accusations that he was biased 
against women saying that 25 percent of the fulltime faculty at 
boston university are women and that 28 percent of the women have 
tenure figures that compare favorably with many other universities 
silber is on leave from the university to run for governor of 
massachusetts as a democrat his campaign spokeswoman michal 
regunberg said she was not familiar with the supreme court action 
and could not comment 
ms brown had published a book of criticism on jane austens 
novels that generally was well reviewed by other scholars but the 
provost said the university should await further evidence of ms 
browns abilities before awarding tenure 
after ms brown rejected the offer of three more years on 
probation the university board of trustees denied her tenure 
the university argued that evidence of silbers alleged sexism 
should not have been presented to a federal jury that awarded ms 
brown 200000 a judge added 15000 to compensate her for 
emotional distress and ordered the university to reinstate her 
with lifetime tenure 
as evidence of silbers alleged sexism ms brown introduced 
several statements made by silber 
one included a remark he made describing the english department 
as a damn matriarchy at a time when the department was headed 
by a woman and included six female and 20 male faculty members 
silber also had told another woman on the faculty that she 
should not be worried about job security since your husband is a 
parachute an apparent reference to the fact her husband was 
employed 
the jury also heard a portion of an old speech by silber in 
which he lamented the lack of parental supervision in families in 
which both husbands and wives work outside the home 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals in ruling last year for 
ms brown refused to order a new trial in which the silber remarks 
would be excluded 
the appeals court also rejected the universitys arguments that 
awarding ms brown a lifetime job interfered with its academic 
freedom 
academic freedom does not include the freedom to discriminate 
against tenure candidates on the basis of sex or other 
impermissible grounds the appeals court said awarding ms 
brown tenure is the only way to provide her the most complete 
relief possible

west germanys chief prosecutor said monday 
there is insufficient evidence for bringing criminal charges 
against former east german leader erich honecker despite claims 
his regime harbored leftist terrorists 
however he indicated that charges could be brought in the 
future 
west germans have been infuriated by revelations that some of 
their most wanted fugitives were once sheltered by the east german 
communists who were ousted in last years democratic revolution 
those disclosures came to light with the recent capture of seven 
suspected members of the red army faction terrorist group eduard 
lintner a member helmut kohls governing coalition in west 
germany has called for honeckers extradition to face 
terroristrelated charges in west germany 
this weekend chief west german prosecutor alexander von stahl 
was quoted by a newspaper as saying he was investigating whether 
there was evidence to bring charges against honecker and his ousted 
deputies 
however in a radio interview monday von stahl said that 
until now there are only vague indications of official support 
for west german terrorists during the honecker era 
von stahl told deutschlandfunk radio of cologne that he was 
ruling out for the time being bringing charges against honecker 
his security chief erich mielke and legendary former spy chief 
markus wolf the exspy has denied any contacts with red army 
faction terrorists 
simply providing the red army faction members with shelter is 
insufficient for an indictment against the former leaders of the 
german democratic republic for supporting a criminal 
organization von stahl said 
a criminal probe against honecker mielke and their 
accomplices could only be started if it can be proved they 
knowingly or intentionally provided red army faction members with 
active help von stahl said 
honecker mielke and other members his regime are already 
targets of probes by east german prosecutors investigating charges 
of corruption it is uncertain whether any trials will result

president fw de klerk and 
the leaders of six black tribal homelands agreed monday that talks 
on ending apartheid should begin as soon as possible 
south african newspapers said de klerk met the homeland leaders 
in a bid to find allies prior to opening formal constitutional 
negotiations with black opposition groups such as the african 
national congress 
de klerk and the homeland leaders met at the presidents office 
in cape town to discuss prospects for negotiations on the new 
constitution that will include the countrys 28 million black 
majority 
all parties at the meeting agreed that negotiations for a new 
constitution should be the highest priority and should start as 
soon as possible according to a statement by de klerks office 
de klerk says he wants to end racial discrimination and bring 
blacks into the national government but he opposes the oneman 
onevote majorityrule system that black leaders such as anc 
leader nelson mandela have been demanding saying it will replace 
white domination with black domination 
he envisions a mechanism that will give the 5 million whites 
veto power on major policy decisions 
de klerk arranged a meeting with homeland leaders earlier this 
year but most canceled at the last moment reportedly under 
pressure from the anc 
south africa has 10 black homelands none is recognized abroad 
the anc considers the homelands part of the countrys apartheid 
system of racial segregation 
de klerk met monday with the leaders of the six 
selfgoverning territories the leaders of the four homelands 
the south african government considers independent were not present 
the president has made clear that homeland leaders would be 
welcome to participate in negotiations on a new constitution 
several homeland leaders such as kwazulu chief minister 
mangosuthu buthelezi are relatively conservative and considered 
potential government allies 
in other developments monday 
the leader of the ancs military wing chris hani returned to 
south africa from the groups exile headquarters in zambia most of 
the anc leadership now is inside south africa for the first time 
since the group was banned in 1960 forcing leaders to go 
underground or into exile de klerk legalized the anc in february

of a 13yearold girl who was swept away by flood waters while 
playing at a friends house

miles below the mouth of wegee creek kerri was at the home of a 
friend 9yearold amber colvin when the storm struck the 
onestory house thursday 
the two girls jumped into a bathtub for safety but it was 
washed into wegee creek flood waters carried amber about seven 
miles into the ohio river but she survived by clinging to logs for 
7 hours before reaching shore 
thirteen people still were listed as missing monday night 
the first funeral for a flood victim was held in a funeral home 
that was used as a temporary morgue about 100 people crowded into 
three rooms to mourn the death of roger denoon sr 51 
it rained and it thundered this morning and they say when it 
rains on the morning of the funeral the dead go to heaven said 
denoons daughter kimberly that was his way of saying goodbye 
because he didnt get a chance to say goodbye 
im not sure any of us can prepare for this type of a 
tragedy said capt tim muir a salvation army chaplain who 
delivered the eulogy the thing we have to look at is found in 
isaiah 381 thus saith the lord set thy house in order for 
thou shalt die and not live

casket draped with an american flag he was to be buried in 
cambridge about 50 miles west of shadyside

the ohio flash flood thursday night was the most serious in a 
series of severe storms that have hit parts of the midwest and east 
the national weather service meteorologist in charge of the 
station responsible for belmont county said monday that the storm 
developed so rapidly a flood warning would not have helped 
were dealing with god almighty here nature itself sometimes 
nature just isnt predictable ed heath said at a news conference 
in shadyside 
but the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which 
oversees the weather service planned to investigate why a flood 
warning which alerts that flooding has occurred or is imminent 
was not issued 
on monday a fastmoving line of thunderstorms whipped across 
large portions of new york state leaving fires blackouts and 
homes crushed by trees 
in iowa a second day of sunshine allowed floodwaters to recede 
at least three deaths were blamed on the storm fifteen more iowa 
counties were declared disaster areas bringing the total to 22 
divers on monday began probing rubble on the bottom of the river 
near the mouths of the wegee and pipe creeks as well as floating 
debris that accumulated at the hannibal ohio lock and dam about 
25 miles south of shadyside 
automobiles had been pushed down the creek valleys and into the 
river by a 25foothigh wall of water that surged from the 
highlands wiping out homes bridges trees and utility poles 
officials said 
floating debris such as tree limbs furniture natural gas tanks 
and toys began to clog the locks and dam and the army corps of 
engineers was asked to help remove it said capt jim boling of the 
ohio national guard 
federal officials were trying to assess whether river barge 
traffic was impeded by the debris he said 
at least 18 divers from west virginia arrived monday to help 
ohio divers search for additional bodies 
nine horseback officers were brought in from coshocton county in 
eastcentral ohio in the search for the first time according to 
belmont county sheriff tom mccort the horses allow officers search 
more of the rugged terrain more quickly he said 
federal emergency management agency officials said a preliminary 
estimate showed that 700 homes in belmont and neighboring jefferson 
and harrison counties were destroyed or damaged from the deluge 5 
inches of rain within 3 hours 
people whose homes and belongings were swept away say they will 
have to begin putting their lives back together largely without the 
benefit of insurance 
few residents in this eastern ohio coalmining and steelmaking 
area along the wegee and pipe creeks felt the need to carry flood 
insurance and homeowners insurance will not cover damage 
residents and local insurers said 
we didnt think we needed to have flood insurance for what 
that creek never flooded then this everybody just got wiped 
out said julia kulazenka 62

2dayold ceasefire broke down monday 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told parliament that 
security forces killed 600 fighters of the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam in three days of battles he gave no information on 
government casualties 
an additional 378 people including 137 disarmed policemen 
massacred by the tigers are reported to have been killed since 
june 11 when the rebels ended a 13monthold truce the death toll 
was compiled from reports by witnesses military officials and 
tiger sources 
tamil rebels took up arms against the sinhalesedominated 
government in 1983 in a quest for a separate homeland for the 
countrys tamil minority more than 11000 people have died in the 
insurrection 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
have long accused the sinhalese majority of discriminating against 
them 
the ceasefire which started at sundown saturday had been 
marred by minor attacks over the weekend by midday monday both 
sides reported exchanges of fire along the east coast and in the 
north 
a spokesman for the tamil tigers contacted by telephone in the 
eastern town of batticaloa said we continue our retreat into the 
jungles we will fight from there 
batticaloa 136 miles from colombo on the east coast and 
jaffna 186 miles northeast of the capital have been the major 
flashpoints in the fighting 
a defense ministry statement said since the ceasefire has 
been violated by the ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam

police station they captured a week ago and streamed out of town 
toward the jungle in at least 100 jeeps vans and small trucks a 
local journalist said 
in reaction wijeratne said unless they stop this nonsense we 
wont talk to them we will push them all into the indian ocean

saturday told parliament his efforts to bring peace have failed 
my genuine efforts to bring about an end to this carnage have 
failed i appeal to everybody to help restore sanity in this 
country hameed said

police stations

a gunman loaded for war monday 
stalked through an auto loan company that had repossessed his car 
firing at customers shooting under desks at hiding employees and 
leaving eight dead before killing himself 
five others victims were listed in critical but stable condition 
after the late morning shootings by semiautomatic gunfire at the 
general motors acceptance corp office south of downtown 
the gunman also killed two people on the streets near his 
jacksonville home sunday authorities said 
richard langille a gmac employee said office workers dived 
under desks when the first of about 50 shots rang out in mondays 
attack 
and then we realized the guy was pointing his gun underneath 
peoples desks and killing them one by one said langille i 
just saw the bottom of the carpet and just prayed 
some of the wounded were shot seven or eight times each 
hospital spokesmen said 
the suspect apparently went in the front door and shot a 
couple of customers said sheriff james mcmillan then he went 
right through the office indiscriminately shooting employees then 
turned the weapon on himself 
the gunman james edward pough 42 a day laborer from 
jacksonville had recently had a vehicle repossessed by gmac the 
sheriff said mcmillan said it was not known if that was the sole 
motive the company said the car was a 1988 pontiac grand am 
repossessed in january 
pough began firing almost as soon as he walked through the door 
mcmillan said 
after shooting two customers one fatally he methodically went 
from desk to desk firing his rifle witnesses said 
the gunman used a 30caliber clipfed semiautomatic rifle for 
most of the shooting but also had a 38caliber revolver 
authorities said police found several rifle clips some empty and 
some full inside the office 
theres numerous magazines plus numerous rounds in his 
pockets said deputy ken bozeman he was loaded for war 
a 9mm semiautomatic pistol was found in poughs car parked 
outside of the building mcmillan said he also had a 357caliber 
magnum registered to his name but no information was given on that 
weapons location 
the 38caliber revolver used in the shootings was registered 
june 4 1979 mcmillan said agents from the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms were checking whether the rifle was 
registered 
pough was arrested in 1971 in duval county on a charge of 
homicide but was never convicted in july 1971 he was given five 
years probation on a charge of aggravated assault according to 
florida department of corrections records 
the 1971 court records show that adjudication would be withheld 
after his probation period meaning that pough would not have a 
record in that case if he obeyed the terms of probation that would 
mean he could legally possess a gun 
the sheriff said that pough also was arrested in 1968 for 
dangerously displaying a weapon 
mcmillan said pough has also been positively identified by 
witnesses as the killer of a man and woman in separate shootings 
early sunday 
louis carl bacon 39 and doretta drake 30 were walking 
through a northwest section of jacksonville near where pough 
lived and were killed with the same 30caliber rifle used in the 
monday massacre mcmillan said 
mcmillan said at least one of the sunday shootings stemmed from 
arguments over services of a prostitute he did not elaborate 
records show that pough was married but neighbors told 
reporters they had not seen his wife for some time 
at the gmac five employees a customer and the gunman died at 
the scene at the baymeadows office complex said john andrews a 
company spokesman in detroit two other employees died at hospitals 
the wounded were airlifted or taken by ambulance to university 
hospital baptist medical center and st lukes hospital where 
they were in critical but stable condition 
jay edelberg of baptist medical said the three wounded brought 
there had been shot repeatedly 
one man had gunshot wounds on both sides of his chest and in his 
abdomen edelberg said a woman was shot eight times including 
both sides of her chest and her abdomen 
the third one who is the most stable probably had the worst 
injuries because she got hit about seven times hitting her arms 
her legs shattering bones and severing nerves and arteries the 
baptist spokesman said 
a special crisis team was at the shooting scene and police set 
up a counseling center in a building next door 
investigators were trying to interview witnesses but mcmillan 
said the are all in a state of shock understandably 
pough was arrested in 1971 in duval county on a charge of 
homicide but was never convicted in july 1971 he was given 
probation on a charge of aggravated assault according to florida 
department of corrections records 
in addition to pough the dead were identified as drew woods 
denise highfill janice david sharon louise hall barbara duckwall 
holland julia white burgess lee simonton and cynthia perry 
the wounded were ron ecchevaria jewel belote nancy dill 
phyllis griggs and david hendrix 
the death total matched the worst singleday episode in florida 
a 1982 massacre at a miami machine shop where nine died and three 
were wounded

us ambassador to britain henry catto wrote to 
the mayor of new york on monday to express shock that the city 
named a street corner after an ira member convicted of killing a 
british soldier 
mayor david dinkins approved the honor friday for joseph 
doherty who was convicted in the 1980 killing of a british soldier 
in belfast northern ireland 
the proposal to name the corner after doherty was championed by 
his supporters some of whom are politically influential in new 
york when dinkins signed the bill he pointed out that doherty has 
not been charged with any crime in the united states 
mr doherty is no hero catto said in a letter to dinkins 
released to the news media the ira is a gang of murderers which 
deserves new york citys condemnation not its commemoration 
terrorism is contemptible regardless of any claimed 
justification catto wrote the ira is a terrorist organization 
whose latest victims have included women infants and tourists 
the outlawed organization in its latest offensive has been 
aiming mainly at british targets outside northern ireland seven 
people have been killed in those attacks the past few weeks 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant province 
with the 95 percent catholic irish republic 
about 900 members of the british security forces have been 
killed in ira attacks since sectarian and political fighting 
erupted in northern ireland in 1969 several hundred civilians have 
also died in ira attacks over the same period 
doherty escaped from prison in 1983 and fled to the united 
states where he has spent seven years behind bars awaiting an 
appeal against extradition 
in new york a spokeswoman for dinkins office said the bill 
proposing the renaming of the street corner after doherty was put 
forward by two city council members and backed by 13 others 
as part of the process we ask people to speak in favor and 
against a bill she said nobody spoke against this one 
about 1500 of dohertys supporters rallied in manhattan on 
saturday to demand his freedom 
the demonstrators marched past park row and pearl streets where 
a green sign now marks joe doherty corner the metropolitan 
correction center at the corner is where doherty is held

a cloud of irritating vapor escaped from a 
chemical plant early monday forcing the sixhour evacuation of 
about 1500 people and sending 29 to a hospital for treatment no 
one was seriously hurt 
authorities sounded sirens and knocked on doors in three small 
towns and in part of this western missouri city to alert people to 
the emergency at the alcolac inc chemical plant at about 2 am 
at about 8 am officials determined the leak from a 
10000gallon tank of allyl methacrylate no longer posed health 
risks and allowed residents to return home 
the chemical is used in coatings for electronic printed circuit 
boards in vapor form it can irritate the skin nose throat and 
lungs officials said 
its got a very low odor threshold so youd smell it a lot 
sooner than it would have any health effects said richard 
faulkner plant manager at alcolac which makes soap cleaning 
materials and specialty chemicals 
fire chief mike ditzfeld said the vapor release was caused by a 
chemical reaction in a storage tank

hundreds of former resistance fighters joined 
political and church leaders monday at a tribute to charles de 
gaulle on the 50th anniversary of his historic radio appeal for 
armed struggle against the nazis 
notre dame cathedral was filled with an audience that included 
premier michel rocard paris mayor jacques chirac and british 
ambassador sir ewen fergusson de gaulles son philippe also was 
there 
roman catholic cardinal jeanmarie lustiger of paris praised de 
gaulles crucial role in the struggle for the dignity of all men 
aganst inhuman and totalitarian ambition 
later many dignitaries and resistance veterans looked on as 
president francois mitterrand unveiled a plaque at the arc de 
triomphe inscribed with the text of de gaulles appeal church 
bells throughout france chimed to mark the occasion 
thousands of tourists and parisians flocked monday to the place 
de la concorde where a 115foothigh replica of a 1940s radio 
rebroadcast the june 18 call from london and other wellknown de 
gaulle speeches 
few of de gaulles countrymen actually heard his dramatic 
appeal in a voice edged with tension has the last word been 
said must we abandon all hope is our defeat final no france 
is not alone the flame of the resistance must not and shall not 
die 
many of those who did manage to tune in the bbc to hear it knew 
little about the general claiming to represent france instead 
they preferred the grandfatherly reassurances of philippe petain a 
world war i field marshal who urged surrender to the germans 
petain became the head of the collaborationist vichy regime 
de gaulles fervent fourminute speech helped change the course 
of french history 
the resistance movement played a critical role in the allied 
victory after the war de gaulle founded a political party and 
served as president from 1959 to 1969 he died a year later 
daylong celebrations of de gaulles broadcast culminated monday 
night with a sound and light extravaganza on the seine river 
more than 100000 spectators crowded onto river banks and 
bridges to watch as scores of barges floated down the seine 
carrying torches flags and hundreds of performers in period 
costume reenacting the german invasion of france de gaulles 
flight to london dday and the liberation 
the show included simulations of the bombings raids that 
terrified civilians when france fell at that time threefifths of 
the population took to the roads in cars wagons bicycles and even 
wheelbarrows to escape the german onslaught 
the show which also celebrates the centenary of de gaulles 
birth cost 57 million raised from private sources by de gaulle 
centenary association 
early monday vandals demaged and defaced de gaulle memorials in 
three communities on the northern outskirts of paris police said 
no arrests were reported

a federal jury on monday convicted two men and a 
woman of conspiring to supply the irish republican army with 
sophisticated antihelicopter missiles and other weapons 
us district judge david a mazzone scheduled an aug 20 
sentencing for richard c johnson 41 of nashua nh martin 
quigley 27 of dundalk ireland and christina l reid 25 a 
computer technician from sunnyvale calif 
the trio was convicted on a range of charges including 
conspiracy to violate the federal arms export act and to injure or 
destroy property belonging to the united kingdom possessing 
property to aid foreign insurgents and aiding an insurgent group 
in violation of us laws said mazzones clerk deborah whitney 
a fourth defendant gerald hoy of easton pa pleaded guilty 
last week a fifth peter e maguire is a fugitive believed to be 
in ireland 
johnson faces a maximum sentence of 28 years quigley 18 years 
and reid and hoy 8 years apiece 
the trial which began may 1 featured testimony by irish 
nationalist bernadette devlin mcaliskey a former member of the 
british parliament 
prosecutors introduced secretly taped conversations in which the 
defendants allegedly discussed developing a system to shoot down 
lowflying helicopters 
the fbi began watching johnson in 1983 when the radar 
specialist bought detonator switches 
i just got some diodes and im going to start experimenting 
and see what kind of range i can get out of them johnson 
told quigley as they sat in a mcdonalds parking lot according to 
the government 
fbi agents arrested the group in july after johnson an engineer 
with topsecret security clearance at the mitre corp surprised 
federal agents placing a bug in his car as it was parked in the 
bedford companys lot 
johnson allegedly used his parents basement on cape cod as an 
experimental laboratory in which he made explosive fuses for 
antihelicopter missiles 
defense attorneys dismissed such claims and claimed their 
clients merely shared an interest in hightechnology electronics 
quigleys lawyer richard bachman told the jurors the case was 
like 16 of you getting together and building a nuclear submarine 
in somebodys cellar 
mcaliskey who appeared in court wednesday as the last defense 
witness testified the ira could not be considered an insurgent 
group because it seeks to overthrow a government imposed by force 
not by democratic vote

president samuel doe in a bid to bring 
antigovernment rebels into the political system lifted a ban on 
opposition parties monday and declared an amnesty for all his 
regimes opponents 
doe said he hoped rebel forces who have been observing an 
informal ceasefire with government soldiers would accept the 
amnesty and form a political party 
there was no immediate response from rebels who have waged a war 
since late december to topple doe but rebel leader charles taylor 
refused similar offers from doe earlier this month 
opposition parties say doe with his back to the wall and an 
army too weak to defeat the rebels is offering too little too 
late 
the president said monday he was granting a general and 
unconditional amnesty to all members of the rebels national 
patriotic front as well as all others living at home and abroad 
who have been implicated in antigovernment activities since 1980 
a statement from does executive mansion said he was lifting 
bans on the liberian unification party and the liberian peoples 
party in a further move to heal wounds restore peace and 
ensure the full participation of all liberians in the political 
process 
the move was a further demonstration of the seriousness 
government attaches to the ongoing peace process it said 
rebels and government troops confronting each other near a 
usmanaged firestone rubber plantation 35 miles from monrovia 
have held off fighting since peace talks opens a week ago in 
freetown sierra leone 
the two sides adjourned talks saturday for a week after they 
were able to agree only to exercise restraint in the fighting 
the insurgency began with a rebel invasion from the neighboring 
west african nation of ivory coast and has since escalated into a 
tribal conflict both groups have murdered thousands of civilians 
in attacks on suspected supporters of the other side 
rebels accuse doe of corruption and rights abuses they say he 
should resign internal and external government opponents back the 
rebel call 
the liberian leader announced two weeks ago he would not stand 
for reelection but he has refused to resign immediately saying 
it would leave a dangerous power vacuum in this west african 
country during the conflict 
doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted descendants of 
the freed american slaves who founded liberia in 1847 they 
historically monopolized power and discriminated against indigenous 
liberians in this country of 25 million residents 
it was not clear whether does amnesty includes hundreds of 
government soldiers from the gio and mano tribes detained in 
monrovia for more than a week the government has refused to 
comment on reports that some of them have been killed 
most rebels come from the two tribes

state and federal officials filed a lawsuit 
monday against eight firms that allegedly dumped cancercausing ddt 
and pcb along the southern california coast since the 1950s 
the unprecedented suit filed in us district court is an 
attempt to enforce federal provisions requiring polluting companies 
to restore damaged marine environments state controller gray davis 
said 
damages are estimated to range from 50 to 100 million said 
michael r valentine an attorney for the state lands commission 
cease and desist orders are no longer enough mere cleanup 
will no longer be enough polluters must now restore the marine 
life and habitat they have contaminated davis said at a news 
conference in his los angeles office 
state and federal governments agencies claim the toxic dumping 
and discharges have caused serious damage to reproductive health of 
the bald eagle peregrine falcon and sea lion recreational and 
commercial fisheries have also been harmed the suit claims 
in the past the state recovered funds for cleanup of ocean 
dumping but theres never been an attempt to collect money to 
restore the marine habitat valentine said 
the targets of the lawsuit were montrose chemical corp atkemix 
37 inc stauffer management co ici american holdings inc 
chriscraft industries inc westinghouse electric corp potlatch 
corp and simpson paper co 
i have no knowledge on this suit said maureen frisch a 
spokeswoman at simpsons headquarters in san francisco 
unidentified officials at potlatch in pomona referred calls to 
their san francisco headquarters where no one was available in a 
call made after business hours 
officials for the other firms named in the suit could not be 
reached in calls made to the east coast after business hours 
the suit was filed by the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration a federal agency that oversees research services 
that monitor the nations atmosphere and seas 
the suit seeks restoration of offshore environments along an 
approximately 20mile stretch of coast from the northern tip santa 
monica bay south to palos verdes 
the action alleges the companies discharged ddt polychlorinated 
biphenyls and other toxic chemicals into the southern california 
coastal marine environment during the last 40 years 
the insecticide ddt and the pcbs used in electrical 
transformers are associated with skin diseases and genetic 
abnormalities including diminished reproduction capacity 
the noaa is joined by the state lands commission department of 
fish and game and the department of parks and recreation 
the complaint cites the companies for natural resource damages 
under a provision in the 1980 superfund law under this law the 
government must first conduct a study to assess the full extent of 
environmental damage before they can present their case in court 
there are regulations set up by the noaa to come up with these 
dollar figures we have set up a combined agency task force to 
assess those damages valentine said 
under the reagan administration the superfund law was 
restricted to human health concerns and officials were barred 
from invoking it in resourcedamage cases 
the bush administration has restored 25 million cut from the 
budget during the reagan administration to pursue litigation that 
would force polluters to restore land and wildlife 
we all pay when the environment is damaged we should all be 
likewise concerned in trying to restore the national marine 
habitat davis said

police said witnesses also identified pough as the person who 
killed a man and a woman in separate shootings early sunday near 
poughs home here police said the sunday killings were done with 
the same rifle as that used monday 
in 1971 pough was charged with manslaughter in the shooting 
death of a man he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was 
sentenced to five years probation court records show 
the court records show that if pough obeyed the terms of his 
probation he would not have a criminal record in that case 
mcmillan also said pough had been arrested in 1968 for 
dangerously displaying a weapon 
besides the rifle pough an unskilled construction laborer 
also fired a 38caliber revolver at least once in the monday 
killings 
we also found a 9mm pistol in his car and he has other weapons 
that are registered in his name mcmillan told reporters 
asked where and how pough got his guns the sheriff said 
were trying to find the answer to that right now and its 
somewhat ironic since he is a convicted felon 
records show that pough was married but neighbors said they had 
not seen his wife for some time 
he was a nice person he came in his house minded his own 
business said lonnie webster who lives nearby 
another neighbor who refused to give her name said pough was a 
nice guy there were no misunderstandings no trouble 
police searched poughs apartment and emerged with a brown bag 
but refused to say what it contained or whether other weapons were 
found 
pough had several rifle clips and ammunition for the handgun in 
his pockets when he walked into the gmac office just before 11 
am police said 
gmac had repossessed poughs 1988 pontiac grand am in january 
the sheriff said the repossession may not have been the sole motive 
for the monday shootings but offered no further suggestions 
the sunday shootings took place near poughs apartment in the 
northwest section of the city 
louis carl bacon 39 was shot twice in the chest as he stood on 
a corner at 1250 am the gunman approached on foot fired two 
shots and fled said police spokesman steve weintraub 
doretta drake 30 was shot in the head as she walked along a 
street at about 1 am weintrub said the gunman drove by fired a 
shot from his car and drove off 
the sheriff said at least one of the sunday shootings stemmed 
from arguments over services of a prostitute but he did not 
elaborate

federal safety investigators said monday 
current inspection methods might not detect a crack in a jet engine 
part like the one that caused last summers air crash in iowa that 
killed 112 people 
the national transportation safety board in formal 
recommendations to the federal aviation administration called for 
the faa and the engine manufacturer general electric co to 
develop new inspection methods to detect cracks before they reach 
dangerous size 
the middle tailmounted engine of a united air lines dc10 
exploded in flight on july 19 1989 cutting all hydraulic lines of 
the aircraft control system the pilots tried to make an emergency 
landing at sioux city iowa but the plane crashed during the 
attempt killing 111 or 296 people on board one of the injured 
later died 
according to the board the engine exploded because a crack in 
the inner bore of the firststage rotor disk grew so large that the 
rapidly spinning 270pound disk broke apart spewing shrapnellike 
pieces throughout the tail area of the aircraft the disk carries 
the 38 blades of the fan on the ge cf66 engine 
the flaw that led to the crack could have been detected if the 
final surface inspection by chemical etching had been done on the 
rotor in its final shape rather than an intermediate shape as was 
done the board concluded it recommended that the faa require this 
etching inspection on the final part shape of all rotating parts 
made of titanium 
the faa has 90 days to respond to the boards recommendations 
following the accident the faa ordered the six remaining disks 
made from the same ingot of titanium removed from service leaving 
55 made from the same raw material and 165 made before the 
manufacturing process was changed in 1971 
ultrasonic inspections were ordered for the remaining disks 
including those made by the new process 
but computer models developed by ge show that a surface crack in 
the forward area of the inner bore of the rotor disk could 
propagate from a size just below the level of detectability to a 
critical size in significantly fewer that 500 flights using one 
ultrasonic inspection method and the second method ordered to be 
used may not be any more capable of catching those cracks the 
board said 
the manufacturer calls on users to inspect rotor surfaces under 
ultraviolet light after a special wash whenever engines are taken 
apart the board said it was concerned that uniteds engine passed 
such an inspection 760 flight before the accident and was 
concerned that there are no requirements for such inspections at 
intervals based on expected crack growth rates 
the board has not determined why the crack was not discovered at 
the ultraviolet inspection 
the board said it concluded that the faas postcrash orders 
taken alone are inadequate to detect these potentially critical 
cracks it called on the faa to require an alternate inspection 
method such as the use of electrical eddy currents in the part 
being inspected 
the board also called on the faa to adopt for engines the 
assumption now used for aircraft structures when calculating 
inspection intervals not that the part is flawless originally 
but that it contains a flaw just below the level of detectability

southeast arkansas with one of his lawyers and his spiritual 
adviser monsignor james odonnell of the immaculate conception 
church in north little rock 
after the execution odonnell read a statement from swindler 
i have no animosity toward anyone no grudges i appreciate 
the care and love others have shown me and other people on death 
row i hope this brings to light the injustice of capital 
punishment and the need to abolish it 
swindler was the 130th inmate put to death in the united states 
since 1976 when the us supreme court let states resume capital 
punishment 
arkansas became the 14th state to carry out an execution since

fort smith police officer randy basnett who was shot to death at a 
filling station when he recognized swindler a fugitive from a 
double murder in south carolina 
all i can say is justice has been done said shanon howard 
daughter of basnetts widow cindy as far as im concerned its 
over and done and let it lie at that 
swindler sentenced before arkansas changed its method of 
execution from electrocution to injection left the choice of 
method to prison officials who opted for the means originally 
specified in his sentence electrocution 
at the time of basnetts death swindler was wanted for killing 
a teenage couple in south carolina three days after his release 
from the federal prison at leavenworth kan 
while awaiting execution in arkansas he was convicted of those 
killings and sentenced to four life terms 
arkansas plans another execution soon ronald gene simmons is 
scheduled to die by injection on june 25 for the 1987 killings of

the measure which was passed unanimously by the supreme soviet 
legislature also gives any citizen the right to start a media 
outlet

bluntly and censorship of the mass media is forbidden 
after president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 and 
introduced the policy of glasnost or openness political pressure 
on the soviet media began to lighten but there was still no legal 
protection from interference 
technically freedom of the press is guaranteed by a declaration 
in the soviet constitution but the new measure was the first law 
laying out detailed guarantees of press freedoms the tass news 
agency reported 
the law establishes procedures for creating media outlets and 
specifies journalists rights they include the right to attend 
meetings and be present at the scene of disasters the right to 
refuse to prepare reports that go against personal convictions and 
the right to hold interviews with officials 
the provision giving any individual the right to establish a 
media outlet created the sharpest debate in the supreme soviet 
tass reported 
the new law forbids publication of state secrets but tass said 
penalties would be imposed on the official who leaked them rather 
than the journalist who reported them 
it also forbids slander and use of the mass media to interfere 
in citizens private lives infringement on their honor and

kansas citys new evening newspaper 
is making money after only a month of publication and will begin 
limited home delivery in the suburbs the tabloids owner said june 
14 
the kansas city evening news published monday through friday 
is selling an average of about 15000 copies at 50 cents each said 
owner steve rose 
thats about what i had projected for circulation i would 
have been very disappointed if we hadnt made money off of that 
said rose president of sun publications a familyowned string of 
suburban weekly newspapers 
he did not disclose how much money the newspaper was making 
when he launched the tabloid may 14 with startup costs he said 
were just 1 million rose estimated that a combination of small 
staff relatively small circulation and no home delivery would keep 
costs low 
but he said june 14 he will start limited home delivery in two 
suburbs overland park and leawood kan 
city ordinances prevent the evening news from being sold on 
street corners in those towns he said rather than go to court he 
decided to begin home delivery there later this month 
in other parts of the kansas city area the evening news will 
continue to be sold only at street corners newsracks and stores 
said rose who spoke in a telephone interview from san antonio 
where he was attending a newspaper conference 
analysts had predicted the paper would have a difficult time in 
a city dominated by a morning paper the kansas city star with 
circulation of about 300000 last march the kansas city times was 
merged with the kansas city star because of declining circulation 
rose said low costs would help him survive 
we could still sell down to as little as 10000 copies and 
make a profit he said of course i hope we dont do that 
the paper which averages about 32 pages a day contains mostly 
wire service reports on national and international news and sports 
it has four editorial employees and shares a building printing 
press and advertising and circulation staff with sun publications

ways to provide 1992 presidential candidates and the major 
political parties free air time beyond the normal news coverage to

producer the markle study recommends that pbs offer free air time 
in blocks ranging from 2 minutes to 15 minutes to the presidential 
candidates or the political parties 
perlmutter who has worked for pbs and nbc recommended creating 
a voters channel production company to prepare expanded 
political programming for pbs stations that also would include 
character and competence profiles of presidential candidates 
and an exploration of their debates 
regularly scheduled onehour programs would be broadcast during 
september and october 1992 with halfhour programs airing daily

a hoaxer tricked the news media into running 
a bogus story about elizabeth taylor on june 10 by gaining access 
to messages left with a public relations companys answering 
service 
the story distributed worldwide by the associated press and 
united press international said miss taylor was romantically 
involved with a 23yearold man and had just undergone surgery 
it is a hoax said miss taylors publicist chen sam i 
have contacted miss taylors attorneys and we are going to conduct 
an investigation it is apparently somebody using my telephone 
service 
ms sams new york city public relations firm was the sole media 
link during miss taylors nineweek hospitalization for pneumonia 
at st johns hospital and health center in santa monica 
the sam organization discouraged reporters from calling st 
johns about miss taylor and instructed the hospitals public 
relations staff not to answer reporters questions under 
california privacy law hospitals must abide by the wishes of 
patients who dont want information released about them 
the ap office in los angeles had placed calls to the hospital 
and to chen sam and associates after receiving a message sunday 
from an ap affiliate in england the press association editors at 
the british domestic news agency had heard miss taylor had 
undergone another operation and wanted a story 
the hoaxer said miss taylor underwent an abdominal biopsy and 
was expected to be released from the hospital within two weeks on 
the arm of julian lee hobbs of lake orion mich described as miss 
taylors boyfriend 
the hospital spokeswoman was unavailable for comment when the 
reporter called new york he was connected to ms sams answering 
service and left a message 
a short time later a woman returned the call saying she was 
lisa flowers from chen sam and associates she then gave the 
reporter the bogus information about miss taylors romantic 
involvement and the surgery 
the hoaxer also provided the same story to upi and city news 
service a metropolitan los angeles wire service 
the ap reporter in an effort to verify the authenticity of the 
source later placed a second call to ms sams answering service 
leaving a message for lisa flowers the answering service operator 
accepted that message without question 
later an ap reporter placed a third call to ms sams answering 
service a woman identifying herself as ms sam returned that call 
and verified the identity of ms flowers and the story she had 
told 
ms sam said no one from her organization had talked to 
reporters she said a woman involved in the hoax had telephoned her 
answering service and was given the publicists messages after 
somehow providing proper coded identification to the switchboard 
it was all very cleverly done ms sam said it was done 
on a sunday when we werent around i cant understand how they got 
the code ive had to change the entire system here

the venerable times of london has revised its 
victorianera style guide to include such brash and contemporary 
language as the title ms 
editor simon jenkins tried to break the news gently to readers 
of the 205yearold newspaper who tend to regard its 
eccentricities as a national treasure on the order of big ben 
the mirror that a newspaper holds up to the world is 
constantly smudged with jargon bad usage and verbosity jenkins 
wrote june 12 a style guide is a periodic cleansing of that 
mirror 
the times style guide introduced at the turn of the century 
was last revamped in the mid1960s 
there were regular updates but the guide remained terribly 
restrictive and quite victorian said literary editor philip 
howard who helped write the new one 
the old style guide was replete with arcane treasures such as 
the times singular spelling of mikhail s gorbachov its 
rendering of the soviet leaders name was based on its 
transliteration of the cyrillic letters 
our russian specialists know that our spelling is better but 
if the rest of the world spells it another way ours looks very 
odd howard said were right but were wrong 
so from now on its gorbachev 
under the old style the times referred to leonardo da vincis 
masterpiece as the monna lisa to show it was derived from 
madonna it will now be mona lisa 
from now on ms will be automatically used in times news 
columns for american women and for others if they request it 
the times is also dropping courtesy titles on first reference 
something certain to disappoint readers who enjoyed such prim 
designations as mr ringo starr 
on subsequent reference most people continue to get a title 
except criminals artists athletes and the long dead 
the new guide also has a blacklist words that slip into 
journalese as a form of obfuscation and circumlocution and 
gobbledygook howard said 
these include problem provision very issue accommodate 
crisis interesting and situation especially crisis 
situation and probe 
words like probe should be confined to stories about 
surgeons he said

media lawyers told maines highest court 
june 14 that the release of unaired portions of a videotaped 
interview would threaten news gathering 
a prosecutor who wants the tape said she is not trying to 
restrict press freedom 
the maine supreme judicial court heard arguments on an appeal by 
wcshtv of portland which is challenging an order to surrender 
tapes of its 12minute interview last february with biddeford 
police commissioner denis letellier 
only about 2 minutes of the tape was broadcast york county 
district attorney mary tousignant wants to present the remaining 
footage to the grand jury that panel is looking into complaints 
that letellier used his position to try to get a motor vehicle 
charge against his son reduced 
attorney john paterson representing the station argued that 
the superior court erred when it refused to quash the subpoena 
without considering the constitutional issues those included fears 
that release of the tapes could inhibit potential news sources and 
have a chilling effect on the way news is gathered and edited 
the news gathering process itself is a part of the very 
freedom of the press that the first amendment protects said 
paterson he asserted there was a qualified privilege 
protecting unpublished material 
tousignant said there was no basis to withhold the tapes because 
letelliers statement was made in public and without any claim to 
confidentiality

the chicago suntimes announced june 12 it was 
dropping a californiabased columnist on aging because portions of 
two columns were taken almost verbatim from articles in the new 
york times 
in a bylined page 3 article headlined an apology to our 
readers suntimes editor dennis a britton wrote that he had the 
embarrassing and sad duty of disclosing that portions of two 
weekly age wave columns by ken dychtwald had not been original 
in a statement that appeared in the same edition dychtwald said 
the material was used accidentally 
i deeply regret these two errors and am appreciative of your 
calling them to my attention so that i might publicly offer these 
apologies and corrections dychtwald wrote 
a portion of his feb 11 column was subtitled growing old 
happily and contained eight paragraphs taken almost verbatim from 
a jan 16 article in the new york times by daniel goleman headlined 
men at 65 new findings on wellbeing britton said 
the second questioned column was published in the sunday 
suntimes on april 22 and was headlined wrongful life lawsuit 
raises painful complex questions britton wrote that substantial 
portions of the fiveparagraph item appeared march 1 in the new 
york times in an article by david margolick that frontpage story 
ran under the headline patients lawsuit says saving life ruined 
it according to britton 
dychtwald wrote that in the feb 11 column he mistakenly 
believed it was appropriate to cite only the original source of 
publicly circulated information included in the new york times 
article 
dychtwald said he was on leave after the birth of his son when 
his staff inadvertently failed to credit the new york times as 
the primary source for some of the material in the april 22 
column 
the suntimes investigation was prompted by a reader who noticed 
the similarities between the april 22 dychtwald column and the 
margolick piece britton said adding that a library search 
revealed the other problem 
the suntimes purchased the column directly from age wave inc 
emeryville calif said penny williamsmartin brittons secretary 
hearst entertainment king features syndicate also distributes a 
column under the age wave name but it is not the same column 
supplied to the suntimes said merry clark director of editorial 
projects for the new yorkbased syndicate 
the kingdistributed column is produced by a ghost writer under 
dychtwalds byline clark said the column dychtwald has long 
written for the suntimes was too chicagooriented for a national

maurice white is thinking a lot about the past 
these days he has someone checking out his family tree he knows 
his greatgrandmother lived in new orleans and he wants to go back 
further much further 
musically its the same story earth wind amp fires new album 
heritage is another kind of family tree the tone set by 
takin chances and its refrain of no risk no gain 
sly stone is on it so is mc hammer and tributes are paid to 
fats waller and charlie parker the music features jazz funk 
rhythm and blues and rap with time out for one of philip baileys 
sweet ballads 
the album was a germ in my mind white the bands founder 
and producer said in a telephone interview from los angeles 
its very interesting watching it evolve and come to fruition it 
starts as an idea and all of a sudden its a giant thing 
i was thinking first of all musical heritage the things we 
had drawn from and we wanted to bring to our fans attention 
things to appreciate things to be proud of 
the lp has 17 songs and runs for an over an hour the title 
track features rappers the boys hammer whose album please 
hammer dont hurt em has topped the charts gives raps on two 
songs wanna be the man and for the love of you 
stone contributes his best james brown shout to good time 
and the brief instrumental interlude bird features a saxophone 
solo influenced by parker 
the things that really thrill me about the record was having 
the opportunity to work with other artists who i had admired from a 
distance sly stone i really had only met casually he was one of 
my early influences he and ray charles white said 
my son kibran listens to mc all the time besides being 
hip to whats going on in the streets mc has a positive message 
for young people so it was a way of bringing back two eras 
together and getting back on the cutting edge 
this is actually the second edition of earth wind amp fire 
white a former session musician at chess records formed the first 
one in the late 1960s it soon broke up so white gave it another 
try same name new members 
i made sure that they understood it was going to be a long 
rocky road recalled white who recruited bailey brother verdine 
white on bass and six others i was looking for people who had 
dedication and integrity to the music growth takes a long time i 
still have growing pains 
originally a little known jazz group earth wind amp fire didnt 
click until 1975 and their sixth album thats the way of the 
world the fastpaced chant shining star was a no 1 single 
its story of every mans uniqueness an update of stones 
everybody is a star it appealed to just about all audiences 
earth wind amp fire has since had six double platinum albums and 
won seven grammys but white isnt satisfied with the bands 
reputation as a crossover act listen to him and you wonder 
about the chorus of the new albums title song just be proud of 
your land where your blood comes from 
european audiences are more challenging than american ones he 
says in the states they just want to hear the hits including 
boogie wonderland september and lets groove while 
europeans respond to whites more ambitious outlook 
i think in a lot of cases we have been logged as being a black 
group musically and thats it they look at their faces and say 
theyre black and therefore they do this kind of music 
in europe theyre more open to the music and more open to the 
culture theyre inquisitive they dont understand anything about 
the culture and so they try to investigate and have an open mind 
white and the band push on surviving a temporary split in 1984 
and adjusting to a music scene that never stops changing well 
go on till we drop he says a recent visit to the berlin wall 
reminds him how much there is to write about and thoughts of their 
world tour make him anxious to get back on the front line 
the tour will be about musical heritage artistic heritage 
racial heritage we have something now which i think the whole 
globe is gravitating to and that is the world beat he said 
with the opening up of all these different countries in 
eastern europe we have a lot more people to reach what were 
gearing up towards is a great world community

when there is a candidate to sell and 30 
seconds to do it the emotional case for a constitutional amendment 
against flag burning fits the format thats likely to make it a 
highintensity issue at least until the fireworks season is over 
it may turn out to be too hot not to cool down before the 
congressional and state elections on nov 6 this is the second 
time around and the fervor doesnt seem quite so intense as a year 
ago when the supreme courts decision to overrule state laws 
against flag burning took the political establishment by surprise 
still the issue is back after the high court last week struck 
down a federal flag burning statute it could be significant in a 
close race in which an incumbent house member or senator votes 
against the flag amendment the political risk is on that side of 
the issue nobody ever lost an election by waving the american flag 
and the flag burning vote is made to order for 30second 
campaign ads on television the shorthand in which candidates make 
their case nowadays that side of the issue can be depicted 
visually with pictures planting the idea that a candidate opposed 
to amending the constitution sides with the demonstrators who burn 
flags 
the other side of the argument is a matter of words and 
explanation it takes some time to tell 
thats why candidates are nervous 
when sen bob dole rkan the minority leader was asked 
whether he would try to make the amendment vote a question of 
patriotism he said no but i might make it a 30second spot 
nobody in congress favors flag burning but a republican 
campaign official demonstrated the way the issue can be cast that 
way in a campaign 
if your opponent is for flag burning hes got to go through a 
very sophisticated explanation of why he is said ed rollins of 
the republican congressional campaign committee 
president bush pushing the amendment he has advocated for a 
year said it was an american not a partisan issue i hope it 
will be out of the way by the time of the election he said as he 
urged approval of the amendment before the fourth of july 
but republican campaigners will be using the roll call votes on 
the flag amendment against democrats who vote no bush will be 
campaigning for republican candidates this summer and fall 
and hes had ample practice with the flag issue he used it 
adroitly against massachusetts gov michael dukakis in the 1988 
presidential campaign over the governors veto of a bill requiring 
that teachers lead the pledge of allegiance in their classrooms 
were going to go out and tell the american people this is how 
people voted on this issue said dole he also said explanations 
of a vote against the amendment would fare better at bar 
association meetings than with real people 
it is not a partyline issue but bush and the republicans are 
the main force for an amendment while democratic leaders of the 
senate and house are opposed there are dissenters on both sides 
sen george j mitchell of maine the majority leader said the 
issue is not the flag but whether the bill of rights should be 
amended house speaker thomas s foley of washington said there 
should be no tampering with the first amendment the freespeech 
guarantee that was the basis of both court decisions against laws 
that banned flag burning 
those are intellectual arguments and they take time to express 
the argument for the amendment is short and simple almost a 
slogan protect the flag 
i think most americans the real people out there are on our 
side dole said we might lose with some of the academicians 
and maybe some of the constitutional lawyers and some of the 
liberal politicians 
the early house and senate head counts are said to point to 
close votes because it will take the approval of twothirds of 
those voting in each branch to approve the amendment and send it on 
to the state legislatures three fourths of the states would have 
to approve to a flagburning ban into the constitution 
after the first court ruling on june 21 1989 the estimates 
were that an amendment would have cleared congress easily 
democratic leaders contained the issue and the political anger 
behind it by drafting a statute to ban flag desecration that put 
a flag vote on the record without a constitutional amendment 
theres no such option now that the supreme court has overturned 
that law 
opponents of a constitutional amendment are proposing a 
resolution condemning flag burning and declaring support for the 
bill of rights while it is has no binding effect it would offer a 
way to vote for the flag but not the amendment 
but thats not much political shelter on the real vote its 
yes or no and members of congress who plan to vote no already can 
envision the campaign commercials that will accuse them of catering 
to flagburning radicals

generations the groundbreaking nbc daytime 
drama that made blacks an integral part of its stories faces a 
soap opera situation of its own it might have only six months to 
live 
since generations began in march 1989 with much hoopla and 
critical acclaim it has progressed to the bottom of the daytime 
ratings 
tvs newest soap ranks 12th among the 12 daytime dramas despite 
daring to undertake plot lines with more than a whiff of whimsy 
in one of the latest plot lines wicked old aunt mary diguised 
herself as a nun and smuggled a moosehead stuffed with 60 million 
in diamonds out of chicago by airplane she was determined to foil 
her pursuers by parachuting into iowa with the moosehead 
its kinky its a campy change of pace said sally sussman 
the shows creator executive producer and head writer we just 
finished a very heavy emotional series now we want to pay her 
off 
will aunt mary survive 
will the moosehead 
will generations 
at the nbc affiliates meeting earlier this month network 
president pier mapes said the show had six months to get out of the 
cellar the show is not making money at this point nbc 
spokesman gene walsh acknowledged 
generations senior executive jorn h winther is very much 
aware his show is under the gun were certainly not downhearted 
about it he said it motivates you 
generations is about two chicago families one white and 
affluent one black and affluent whose lives have been 
intertwined for three generations we dont just play things from 
a black point of view winther said we try to cross over black 
and white story lines its realistic 
the show has lost one of its two black writers but is 
interviewing others we also want to get black directors involved 
with the show winther said 
the 18member cast includes some of the most distinguished black 
performers on television including richard roundtree remembered 
for his title role as shaft taurean blaque who played 
detective neal washington on hill street blues and debbi 
morgan the first black actress to win a daytime emmy award for 
her work on all my children 
i think our production is very good winther said we get 
great critical reviews its very difficult not to see a good 
writeup of us 
so why is the show in trouble 
for the week of june 410 generations had a 25 rating and 
a 9 share meaning it was seen in 23 million households by 9 
percent of the available audience by contrast cbs toprated 
the young and the restless had 75 million viewers and 31 
percent of the time periods audience 
the sad truth is that nbc no 1 in prime time ratings is no 3 
in daytime television much of the trouble for generations 
winther and walsh contend derives from its wellestablished 
competition 
when the show went on in a lot of areas it went on against 
the second halfhour of the young and the restless or 
5thranked the bold and the beautiful winther said 
weve got critical support but were up against the no 1 
show walsh said its like going up against the cosby show

strains of mozart from the solisti 
new york chamber orchestra whistled across the rolling osage hills 
beneath a lodge where oilman frank phillips and humorist will 
rogers once spit tobacco juice on the front porch 
the outdoor concert at woolaroc wildlife preserve attracted a 
sellout crowd as it does every year more than 3000 people 
arrived two hours early to claim the best slaterock seats or to 
set up lawn chairs and blankets for a meal of buffalo burgers and 
beer 
we like to clash as long as everything is authentic and done 
in the best quality says nan buhlinger executive director of 
the ok mozart international festival 
quality is not questioned during the nineday festival which 
has grown so fast people are killing for tickets says ransom 
wilson a renowned flutist and artist director of the festival 
the solisti new york is complemented by robin sutherland 
pianist for the san francisco symphony frenchborn conductor 
catherine comet the boston chamber music society and several other 
nationally acclaimed artists from around the nation 
all of them set aside two weeks in june to come to this northern 
oklahoma town known more as the headquarters for phillips petroleum 
co than for aficionados of fine arts 
all you have to do is come once said sutherland who has 
been to every festival since it began in 1985 i feel sorry for 
those who cant come here or wont come here the high point of my 
year is to come here and collaborate with these people 
the festival could be considered unique because of the outdoor 
concert at woolaroc where artists don black and pink tshirts and 
concertgoers smell more of bug spray than perfumes 
but the concert hall in the bartlesville community center holds 
the key to the festival it was there in 1982 that wilson 
directed a symphony and fell in love with the acoustics 
sutherland who has known wilson since they attended the 
juilliard school in new york city said wilson asked him to come 
for the first ok mozart festival 
the first year was hard sutherland said i knew nothing 
about this place ransom said it was the coolest hall we know of 
so how does a city of 35000 come up with a concert hall that 
artists from boston new york and san francisco rave about 
its a matter of luck sutherland says there are 
accoustians who claim that different scientific factors determine 
the quality but if it comes down to science why are there so many 
rotten walls 
buhlinger said this years festival drew about 30000 from 31 
states because bartlesville doesnt have the activity of a 
metropolitan city she developed the festival showcase a gamut of 
displays and events that blend mozart with the heritage of oklahoma 
the showcase involves local residents something wilson said was 
instrumental in the rapid growth and national recognition the 
festival has achieved 
what makes this unique is there are two festivals at the same 
time wilson said its not just the concerts its the 
showcase events every day you get a real oklahoma flavor and the 
everyones participation is the key to the success 
if nothing else buhlinger said the mozart festival goes a long 
way in dispelling myths of oklahoma built on the days of cowboys 
and indians and the dust bowl 
i think most people are absolutely surprised she said 
everybody doesnt walk around here with straws in their teeth i 
think some people come here and expect to see wild horses running 
through the streets 
sutherland said all he needed was dinner in one residents home 
to remind him that bartlesville has plenty of culture 
these people may speak with a drawl but theyve got antiques 
in their homes from japan belgium he said phillips is a 
worldwide company its not like theyve never left their homes 
the charm of the smalltown mixed with an international 
corporation leads wilson to claim that all the smart people are 
here 
theres not another town like it that i have come across in 
the united states wilson said its got a population of 
35000 yet it has its own cultural institution they are educated 
people from all over the world and they demand culture 
and says string bassist carolyn davis of the solisti new york 
they cling to it 
its unique to have a town where everyone jumps on the 
bandwagon and is so enthusiastic said davis you dont need 
that much knowledge to understand the music and enjoy it 
i prefer playing for audiences with enthusiasm some sit on 
their hands and you dont get feedback so its not as special 
theres a certain camaraderie here

editors note at a time of growing uneasiness over japans

in america the gentleman from japan pursuing sogo shoku 
the career path to the executive suite is confronted with two 
conflicting challenges in the course of a long long day 
how to be a good corporate citizen in a host country where the 
polls and his own foreign minister assert that people feel more 
threatened by japans economic power than by the military might of 
the soviet union 
and how to maintain japanese culture within his own family 
circle constantly encircled by american lifestyles and values and 
the incomprehensible kids english that his children speak 
it is a puzzlement which could lead to ensei weariness of 
life because the day indeed is long 
in the new york metropolitan area where the japanese community 
is estimated at 60000 and the 736 commuter train out of hartsdale 
is known as the orient express a typical japanese executive 
will be at his desk by 830 am he stays at least until 730 pm 
which is the best time for phone calls from the shoguns at tokyo 
headquarters 
at noon in keeping with the new goodneighbor policy he may 
address a rotary club attend a united way meeting or teach a 
business course at a community college he may even join the 
serving line at an innercity soup kitchen 
when he arrives at his home in the suburbs late in the evening 
he may find his wife stuffing envelopes for the american heart 
association or teaching origami the ancient art of folding paper 
into fanciful animals to a group of neighbors 
before hitting the futon his sleeping mat he tries to coax the 
kids away from tv long enough to discuss japanese culture and maybe 
help them compose a haiku or two those exquisite snowflakes of 
poems written in three lines of 17 syllables 
on weekends he may umpire a little league game a most 
humbling experience good for the soul as a nippon steel 
executive admitted or join his son on a camping trip play in a 
company softball game or go on a chartered bus to the concord a 
jewish resort in the catskills for a round of golf which is so 
expensive in japan 
he worries about koroshi death from overwork sometimes 
diagnosed as harikari at the water cooler 
but these days he worries most about being a good corporate 
citizen in america 
at a time when japans 50 billion annual trade imbalance is 
increasing friction with the united states and a fortune magazine 
cover story warns that for too many americans the japanese have 
become the people its ok to hate the growing japanese 
expatriate community is anxiously stressing volunteerism as the 
key to understanding and friendship 
volunteerism is a significant element of life in the united 
states that we in the japanese community both as individuals and 
corporations must come to terms with urged hisao kondo 
president of mitsui usa in his preface to joining in a 
howto book on community involvement issued by the japanese chamber 
of commerce and industry in new york 
british investors actually control more of america but the 
japanese seem to be everywhere and into everything from 7eleven 
stores and mama leones restaurant to rockefeller center columbia 
pictures and cbs records 
it was the smiling elaborately courteous gentlemen from japan 
who plunked down 82 million for van goghs portrait of dr 
gachet then two days later 78 million for renoirs at the 
moulin de la galette 
they control eight of the worlds 10 largest banks own much of 
waikiki beach anne klein fashions tiffanys the arco plaza and

hotels as the algonquin the stanhope and the essex house they are

golf the old scottish game invented by the dutch and embraced 
so enthusiastically in the americas now holds the japanese in 
thrall 
the overseas japanese in particular crave it like chopped sushi 
hardly a week goes by without news of japanese investors 
negotiating to buy up another american golf course la costa at 
carlsbad calif valencia malibu and the riviera club all in the 
los angeles area the country club of louisiana in baton rouge and 
a number of golf resorts from hawaii to florida 
daiichi has acquired the lakeover course in upper westchester 
county ny mitsui recently purchased 240 acres of lincoln hall 
an institution for troubled juveniles to build an 18hole course 
in new yorks putnam county 
the corporate membership board in the lobby of the canyon club 
at armonk ny reads like a tokyo business directory bank of 
tokyo fujitsu honda mitsubishi nissan sony tokio marine amp 
fire insurance 
the 220 members of the venerable tamarack club in greenwich 
conn recently made headlines in the opposite direction by voting 
down a 50 million offer from japanese buyers the sale would have 
brought each member nearly a quartermillion dollars before taxes 
and playing rights for another year 
the japanese passion for the game is more than just the pursuit 
of happiness the golf cart closely follows the career track 
in japan explains konosuke shimizo manager of sony 
america golf is the sport of high society a cultural symbol for 
successful people 
but the ancient game is terribly expensive in japan says 
teruhiko maruyama senior vice president of tokio marine amp fire 
insurance membership in a prestigious tokyo club could cost 
upward of a million dollars green fees on a weekend might be 
something like 250 
newly developed courses in the countryside are cheaper but 
you would have to travel four hours to get there at home it is 
possible to play once a month or less while here golf is very 
convenient 
in japan adds karie goto a connecticut realtor with a steady 
japanese clientele you must make reservations even at a driving 
range 
those fivetiered floodlit 24hour driving ranges often 
pictured in golf magazines point up both the japanese ardor for the 
game and the high cost of land there 
in a nation where a highway rightofway recently cost the 
government 1 million a yard a golf course would call for 
financing worthy of a skyscraper commercial property goes for an 
average 210000 a square yard 
small wonder that on many japanese courses the caddies mostly 
girls carry baskets of grass seed to repair divots and scuff marks 
in the worlds most expensive turf 
or that japanese players bow reverently on the first tee and 
have a reputation for slow play as if treasuring each moment on 
the fairways and greens 
those afflicted with golfkichigai golfing madness find it 
more economical to take charter flights to scotland or hawaii 
several times a year for a total immersion 36holesaday 
vacation than belong to a local club 
a japanese conglomerate has bought land in the soviet union for 
a links course along the sea of japan at nakhodka just over an 
hours flight from tokyo 
besides their love of the game japanese investors have in the 
last decade switched from lowreturn real estate investments to 
high risk but high return resort development they realize that 
the us population like their own is graying statistically and 
increased leisure time means increased business opportunities

peggy adams is an expert in raising children 
and pulling together ends that dont quite meet hunger is no 
stranger in her household 
i have seen my childrens bodies stop growing like they 
should and i pray its not their brains as well mrs adams said 
earlier this year at a senate budget committee hearing on federal 
food and nutrition programs 
it was an emotional moment 
these senators were glued to their chairs and listening to 
every word intently jeff coleman a senior income analyst for 
the committee said later you could see on the spot that people 
were being affected the questions they asked were very very 
thoughtful 
capitol hill hearings are often characterized by the relentless 
recitation of government statistics the polite drone of think tank 
researchers the familiar arguments of professional lobbyists 
even the most sensitive lawmakers can become numbed thats when 
its time to bring on the victims 
theyre the people who have lost jobs and homes gone hungry and 
suffered illness endured beatings and lived with disabilities 
theyve been scarred by foster care harassed at the office and 
traumatized by illegal abortions 
theyre very useful because theyre real they take all the 
studies and statistics and make them personal says rep george 
miller dcalif whose select committee on children youth and 
families showcases victims of everything from domestic violence to 
gang warfare 
though some may relive their agonies and humiliations to no 
avail the consensus is that any cause is strengthened by the 
testimony of an ordinary person with no ax to grind 
advocacy and research groups certainly have a place and a 
role says judith lichtman president of the womens legal 
defense fund but very often realworld hardships are more 
persuasive 
lichtmans group is working for a bill that would guarantee 
unpaid jobprotected leave for employees needed at home 
the house recently passed the jobleave bill after three years 
of hearings and a parade of people forced out of their jobs by 
births adoptions or medical emergencies 
one man testified was assigned to a night shift at a doughnut 
bakery although he had told his boss he had to drive his infant 
daughter to a washington hospital that night she was scheduled for 
heart surgery the next day i am no hero said david wilt of 
york pa i am just a working man who was fired because he loved 
his kids 
a woman from charleston sc claimed she was assured she could 
return to her job at a retail store after a doctorordered medical 
leave during a difficult pregnancy but when she returned six weeks 
after having the baby she said she was told no jobs were 
available it hurt said liberia johnson my family needed 
the income 
dexter manley linebacker for the washington redskins was asked 
last year to discuss his learning disability at a hearing when he 
realized he could not read his prepared statement he broke down 
and cried before a battery of television cameras 
at hearings on a bill expanding federal child care programs a 
bereaved couple haltingly recalled the death of their child in 
unlicensed day care and a police officer told of finding two 
children left alone by a mother desperate to hold onto her job 
dead inside a dryer 
senators heard unusually graphic testimony this year at a 
hearing on an abortionrights bill one member of the audience 
fainted as witnesses described their illegal abortions and 
selfinduced miscarriages 
aides who orchestrate these hearings say politicians find it 
difficult to be argumentative or ideological when a victim is 
sitting in front of them 
if a woman says she thwarted the law and risked her health to 
get an illegal abortion that decisionmaking process is 
something thats hard to secondguess said kelly signs an aide 
to sen howard metzenbaum dohio

diane shust a miller aide said one house member tried to take 
on a witness at a hearing on the sandwich generation people 
who have to raise kids and care for ailing parents at the same time 
and got nowhere 
she just fired back at him she slashed his theories to 
shreds shust recalled there was no way he could counter 
there was the expert sitting in front of him 
the perfect victim someone who is genuine articulate and 
sympathetic often surfaces in a newspaper story a letter to a 
lawmaker or a list kept by an advocacy group 
signs who organized the senate abortionrights hearing said 
all the witnesses who told personal stories had already done so at 
least once before in a public forum she said it is hard to find 
women willing to talk about longago abortions 
they were not legal and were done under secretive conditions 
there may be members of their family who dont know about it 
signs said 
most advocacy groups can readily point congressional aides 
toward people who have experienced the problem they want to 
illuminate and some go even further the maryland food committee 
of baltimore has developed a talent pool of sorts a stable of 
eloquent poor people regularly dispatched to press conferences 
meetings and hearings 
coleman said the baltimore group came up with six or seven 
possible witnesses for the senate hunger hearing in february the 
two chosen were adams a white woman with nine children and mary 
tamper a black woman with two children 
adams said her family lost its income when she separated from 
her husband who made 55000 a year as an engineer he was jailed 
on child abuse charges tampers husband whose annual salary was 
30000 died of leukemia she said she had to give up her 
teachers aide job and move the family in with her mother 
coleman said the two women forced to rely on a variety of 
federal programs to feed their kids were picked with an eye toward 
breaking stereotypes 
both had been middle class he said we felt that was a 
strong message there are so many myths about who poor people are 
minorities with lots and lots of kids on welfare and food stamps 
for years we felt it was important not to perpetuate those myths 
from colemans viewpoint the hearing was a success he said its 
major recommendations to expand food stamps and a nutrition 
program for mothers and children won the support of both chairman 
jim sasser dtenn and sen pete domenici rnm the senior gop 
member of the panel the extra money may be added to the 1990 farm 
bill 
lichtman said victim witnesses also helped secure passage of a 
1988 fair housing law 
when women described being denied housing because they had kids 
that helped make the case about why we needed to prohibit 
discrimination against families with children said lichtman 
she said the same dynamics were at work when the voting rights 
act was extended in 1982 people were brought in from alabama and 
georgia and talked about what it was like to be disenfranchised or 
never enfranchised lichtman said that helped get the law 
reauthorized 
lawmakers sympathized with witnesses who said theyd been fired 
for taking a couple of weeks off while their children were 
hospitalized or dying and that may be part of the reason the house 
recently passed a jobleave bill but the bill is facing tough 
opposition in the senate and at the white house 
parents who testified about the shortcomings of day care also 
made an impression but a compromise childcare bill now in the 
works probably wont resolve all of the problems they raised 
regarding quality price and availability 
and foster children continue to suffer neglect and abuse despite 
a little boys poignant testimony in 1987 
marcia lowry the aclu attorney who accompanied the boy to that 
hearing said at the time that agencies were not meeting federal 
requirements to monitor foster kids find permanent homes for them 
or provide services to preserve their families she also alleged an 
almost complete lack of federal supervision 
what has happened since then 
things have gotten worse said lowry director of the aclus 
childrens rights project

editors note with the approach of the fourth of july holiday 
a reporter set out to explore a family legend kinship with a 
signer of the declaration of independence he found his ancestral 
roots were tangled but in the untangling he learned a lot about 
two different families in colonial america at the time of the

yorktown va the search for peggy nelson led to this charming 
colonial town on the bluffs of the york river to the redoubts and 
trenches where the continental army won americas independence 
it was a genealogical wrong turn the kind i had been warned 
about a textbook example of the pitfalls encountered in pursuing 
ones pedigree you cant always accept what your elders tell you 
as fact 
peggy nelson you see was my greatgreatgreatgrandmother the 
wife of one matthew langford an adventuresome south carolinian who 
was forever pushing on to new frontiers 
in the early years of the 19th century according to family 
tradition matt and peggy followed old indian trails across the 
south traveling by ox cart and on foot young kids in tow their 
moves every few years took them from the backwoods of western south 
carolina to southern illinois to tennessee to alabama to 
mississippi and finally to arkansas 
so what was i doing in this beautifully restored virginia 
village a shrine to colonial america the site of the decisive 
battle of the revolutionary war 
family tradition passed on in letters to my father held that 
peggy nelson was a niece of gen thomas nelson jr of yorktown a 
signer of the declaration of independence the governor of virginia 
during the revolution and commander of the virginia militia during 
the siege of yorktown in 1781 
born into a wealthy family of planters and merchants thomas 
nelson jr was educated in england he was named for his 
grandfather scotch tom nelson an immigrant from england who 
became one of yorktowns most prominent citizens his father 
william nelson served for years as president of the kings council 
a rotund man who suffered asthma thomas nelson was a delegate 
to the continental congress in 1775 and was among the first of the 
patriots to sound the call for independence 
during the revolutionary war he helped bankroll the virginia 
militia by borrowing heavily on his own considerable assets as a 
consequence thomas nelson jr died a pauper in hanover county 
va in 1789 he was buried without a tombstone at the foot of his 
fathers grave at grace episcopal church in yorktown not until 
this century was a stone marker provided 
quite a guy thomas nelson was and quite a handsome ornament in 
ones family tree if it could be proven 
a few months ago i started to get serious about tracing family 
roots i started spending a lot of time in libraries thumbing 
through indexes of censuses deeds wills military records family 
histories i joined the national genealogical society 
it can become addictive a colleague had warned 
i bought a home computer and computer software from the church 
of jesus christ of latterday saints which has perhaps the worlds 
largest store of genealogical information while family history is 
an important part of the mormon religion they welcome an exchange 
of information from nonmembers as well 
in instructions for beginners in genealogy the ngs had 
warned invariably you will come across the belief that the 
founders of a particular family were three brothers who came here 
at an early date 
strike those three brothers from england in my fathers 
notes 
the ngs booklet also warned against association with a famous 
person or event 
stories like this may have some foundation the booklet 
said but often they are impossible to verify 
i pushed on looking for the yorktown link anyway 
my fathers notes identified peggy nelsons parents as dr 
robert nelson and his wife rebecca presumably from virginia 
in the library of the new york genealogical society in 
manhattan i found a yellowed and fragile copy of the genealogy 
of the page family in virginia published in 1893 the pages and 
the nelsons committed considerable matrimony together in those 
days 
according to the page document thomas nelson did indeed have a 
brother named robert but neither of robert nelsons two wives was 
named rebecca none of his children was named peggy and there was 
no dr before his name 
so who was peggys daddy 
i came on to yorktown hoping perhaps to find some old records 
at grace episcopal church to prove the page genealogy inaccurate or 
incomplete besides the ngs instructions had warned against 
believing everything you read 
i toured the beautiful old homes of yorktown including that of 
thomas c nelson jr which is supposed to have a couple of cannon 
balls lodged in its walls but i couldnt find any

<TEXT>
its part of the family tradition upheld by some historians 
that nelson ordered artillery fire on his own estate because the 
british commander lord charles cornwallis was holed up there 
cornwallis it is said then took refuge in a cave down on the 
river bank below the town the cave is still there the entrance 
guarded by iron bars 
i toured the battlefield where gen george washington and the 
continental army with no little help from the marquis de lafayette 
and the french fleet on oct 19 1781 forced the trapped british 
and hessian armies to surrender 8300 troops in all it was the 
last major battle of the revolutionary war 
i saw the surrender field and the restored moore house where the 
terms of the surrender were negotiated 
but i found no records linking my family with all of this rich 
history 
since there are no libraries in yorktown my next stop was the 
library of the national genealogical society in arlington va 
when i suggested that my lost ancestor must have been of age to 
serve in the revolutionary war the head librarian susan canby 
suggested looking through some rosters 
sure enough in john h gwathneys historical register of 
virginians in the revolution 17751783 there were two robert 
nelsons 
the first was described as an adjutant in gen nelsons corps 
light dragoons the other was identified as a corporal in the 9th 
virginia regiment continental line 
then from back in the stacks ms canby called out did he 
have a wife named rebecca 
bingo 
the dars got him she said looking up from the dar 
patriot index that meant that one or more women had shown 
ancestral links with this same robert nelson to qualify for 
membership in the daughters of the american revolution 
at the dars imposing library near the white house in 
washington i was allowed for a 5 fee to look at microfilm of 
three of those applications 
another bingo 
not only did this robert have a wife named rebecca but he had a 
dr before his name he served in the 9th virginia regiment 
commanded by col george matthews from january 1777 to february 
1778 attaining the rank of corporal but why just corporal if he 
was a doctor 
and there was a third clue while this robert nelson lived in 
stafford county va during the war he later moved to greenville 
county sc 
enter matthew langford 
matthew langford born in 1775 was the eldest son of eli 
langford sr and his wife sarah eli langford shown in the 1790 
federal census as having three sons three daughters and one slave 
obtained four land grants in western south carolina between 1786 
and 1802 mainly in the 96 and pendleton districts he also bought 
several hundred acres on the broad river in nearby franklin county 
ga 
by 1802 matthew langford now married to peggy nelson was 
living in greenville county sc one transaction recorded that 
year shows him buying 50 acres on south tyger creek in marietta 
sc from one robert nelson sr 
five years later shortly after the birth of their fifth child 
matthew and peggy put their show on the road first to southern 
illinois where matthews brother eli jr had a boat landing and 
ferry on the mississippi river 
then for several years they moved through tennessee to overton 
county and lincoln county in 1822 they showed up in marion county 
ala where they apparently lived until moving to choctaw county 
miss in 1836 they appear in the 1850 census as residents of 
holmes county miss 
family tradition holds that they wound up in white county ark 
where they died 
as churchgoing methodists they gave their seven children 
biblical names eli rebecca elijah anne elisha and john they 
named my greatgreatgrandfather lorenzo dow for the famous 
circuitriding preacher the one who invented camp meetings 
lorenzo dow langford would become a circuit rider himself 
appointed a preacheratlarge by the methodist conference in 
natchez miss in 1837 he was a preacher for 60 years working 
territory along the natchez trace and eventually holding pastorates 
in french camp louisville coffeeville and fletchers chapel 
miss and greensboro ala 
three of lorenzo dow langfords sons peggy nelsons grandsons 
would fight on the confederate side in the civil war 
for them there would be no glorious victories for them the 
fourth of july would not be celebrated it would be remembered as 
the day vicksburg fell to the yankees

nearly always the victims and their killers are black 
despite 350 years of blackwhite racial divisions one of the 
ironies of life in south africa is that thousands of blacks die 
each year fighting other blacks instead of apartheid 
at a time when president fw de klerk is moving to end 
whiteminority rule blackagainstblack violence is spinning out 
of control some analysts say a culture of violence is becoming 
part of south african life they say threatening hopes of building 
a peaceful democratic society 
the independent south african institute of race relations 
estimates 4000 people will die in blackagainstblack violence 
this year about 1400 blacks died in factional fighting in 1989 
according to the institute 
victims are often hacked to death with knives or spears the 
mutilated bodies burned dozens have been killed by necklacing 
with gasolinesoaked tires placed around their necks and set afire 
some leaders see the threat of a civil war with south africa 
becoming another lebanon 
the appalling numbers of people who are dying it is 
absolutely shocking antiapartheid leader rev allan boesak said 
in an interview with the associated press that is the kind of 
situation that can lead to the lebanization of south africa 
some black leaders worry that the growing rivalry among warring 
black factions is the prelude to a struggle for power once white 
rule ends itumeleng mosala president of the azanian peoples 
organization foresees increasing violence between blacks if 
apartheid ends 
its going to continue because violence has a way of repeating 
itself he says so i would say that we are going to see a 
situation of near civil war in this country 
white supporters of apartheid cite black violence when defending 
whiteminority rule they claim blackmajority rule would signal a 
massive bloodbath 
white settlers in kenya and rhodesia before it became zimbabwe 
used the same argument in opposing the approach of black rule in 
those countries but while rival black groups struggled briefly for 
power after independence there was little killing and whites were 
not singled out for revenge 
kenya and zimbabwe however did not experience the massive 
blackonblack violence now sweeping south africa 
the causes of black violence in south africa are many and 
complex reasons include apartheid poverty antigovernment 
struggle school boycotts political and ideological rivalry the 
collapse of authority gangs and corruption 
the bloodshed is compounded by old tribal and clan rivalries 
stretching back over generations 
in the squalid black townships violence has become a daily part 
of life for the millions of blacks forced to compete desperately 
for survival say boesak and others caught by hopeless poverty and 
apartheid laws violence is one of the few ways for blacks to vent 
their anger they say 
one would have to say that the basic problem here is 
apartheid that it has created circumstances in which violence 
became not only the norm but the almost natural action and 
reaction boesak says 
in the early 1980s the african national congress the main 
black opposition group called for a program of destabilization to 
make the country ungovernable and undermine the white 
government young blacks became the spearhead demonstrating 
attacking police and boycotting schools 
local administration and control was undermined in many black 
townships blacks seen as government collaborators including 
black township councilors and black police were frequently 
attacked and killed 
but often the antigovernment struggle is little more than 
mob violence by youth gangs says mohammed valli moosa an 
antiapartheid leader in some black townships there is now 
virtually no authority and rival groups try to wrest control 
some black leaders concede these tactics helped create a lost 
generation young blacks raised in poverty with virtually no 
education and a burning hatred for authority black and white 
many of these youths missed out on education and are 
unemployed and unemployable says political analyst david breier 
they are the generation of no education before liberation 
but the lawlessness has spread to almost every level involving 
businesses workers and schoolchildren a recent war between 
rival taxi companies in a johannesburg township left more than 20 
dead 
criminal gangs have exploited the unrest sparking wars with 
radical young blacks groups of vigilantes some linked to police 
have warred with rival comrades from the anc and other 
political groups 
nelson mandela the anc leader recently released from prison 
and others have attempted to halt the violence by appealing to 
youths to return to school but the appeals have been spurned by 
many who reject negotiation with the government 
the problem is that many of the youngsters are not really 
interested in negotiation in fact they have become a little bit 
angry said senior anc leader walter sisulu 
the violence has been exacerbated by increasingly bitter 
disputes between rival black political groups while all are 
opposed to apartheid various factions are competing for support 
with conflicting visions for south africas future 
in natal province some 5000 blacks have been killed in recent 
years in vicious fighting between the conservative inkatha 
political movement and allies of the anc the struggle pits a 
traditional group with strong tribal roots against urban forces 
seeking a modern ethnically integrated society analysts say 
the anc favors confrontational methods such as its guerrilla 
campaign sanctions and boycotts and rejects black homeland 
governments as part of the apartheid system inkatha supports the 
homeland system saying blacks must run their own affairs as an 
interim step on the road to black majority rule 
the struggle has tribal overtones with inkatha relying on 
traditional zulu followers while the ancallied united democratic 
front combines urbanized zulus and other tribes analysts say 
the anc regarded as the largest and most powerful black group 
also faces strong opposition from more militant organizations such 
as the pan african congress and groups linked to the black 
consciousness movement 
the pac broke away from the anc because of its multiracial 
foundation the pac is an africanist group that campaigns for 
africans to control all aspects of life and rejects western 
influences 
political tolerance is sadly not a strong feature of our 
country says alf stadler a political science professor at the 
university of the witwatersrand in south africas goldmining and 
industrial region

editors note on aug 4 the grenadier guards will march past 
the london home of her majesty the queen mum playing happy 
birthday culminating four months of festivities in honor of 
britains favorite granny queen mother elizabeth is turning 90 
but she shows no signs of slackening her crowded schedule of public 
appearances 
</TEXT>

she likes fast cars cricket and betting on 
horses she always wears pearls even when salmon fishing in 
scotland and her saintly smile is so popular that she uses a 
seethrough umbrella 
shes queen mother elizabeth diminutive matriarch of the royal 
family favorite granny of the nation turning 90 this year with a 
fourmonth birthday party 
festivities kicked off april 25 with a reception at cardiff 
castle where viscount tonypandy former speaker of the house of 
commons predicted a tremendous wave of public affection around 
the whole country 
wellwishers waited five deep on the streets outside the castle 
including 91yearold tryphena price who walked a mile to see the 
queen mother 
she certainly does not look 90 enthused mrs price and i 
should know 
they were rewarded by a sight as familiar as big ben or the 
white cliffs of dover her majesty the queen mum in trademark hat 
three strings of pearls and frothy pastel dress 
as she bestowed graceful waves and smiles on her loyal fans it 
was hard to imagine that the mother of queen elizabeth ii is as old 
as the century but she shows no signs of slackening her crowded 
schedule of public appearances 
this year is especially busy with receptions dinners and garden 
parties and a gala performance in her honor featuring opera stars 
dame kiri te kanawa and placido domingo the royal ballet sir john 
gielgud dame peggy ashcroft and dame vera lynn 
the 27 military units and the 300 organizations over which she 
presides will mass on londons horse guards parade for a 
spectacular ceremonial tribute commemorative coins and stamps will 
feature the royal nonagenarian along with the inevitable slew of 
unauthorized queen mother mugs and tea towels for the tourists 
on aug 1 she will pay a poignant visit to londons east end 
where she and her late husband king george vi brought comfort 
during the dark days of the blitz during the war the east end was 
a working class neighborhood that included the london docks on the 
thames river vital to shipping at the time 
the party culminates on her birthday three days later with the 
grenadier guards marching past her london home playing happy 
birthday 
the queen mother is the oldest member of the royal family ever 
to hold the title conferred on a kings widow 
she was born lady elizabeth angela marguerite boweslyon on aug 
4 1900 the ninth child of the earl and countess of strathmore 
whose family home was glamis castle legendary home of 
shakespeares macbeth in northeast scotland 
her family periodically entertained king george v and queen mary 
and their children when elizabeth married their second son 
albert in 1923 after twice refusing she was the first nonroyal 
bride in centuries to marry so close to the throne 
no one then dreamed that king edward viii would abdicate in 1936 
to marry american divorcee wallis simpson and that his younger 
brother bashful stuttering albert would become king george vi 
it was a reign neither albert nor elizabeth had sought 
when finally it was known that her husband was to become king 
and she queen she was in bed with the flu says tom corby 
author of a new book about the queen mother she said to a member 
of the household well weve just got to make the best of it 
and make the best of it she did 
she is credited with restoring stability to the royal family 
badly shaken by the abdication and transforming her shy husband 
into a peoples king 
harold brooksbaker of burkes peerage a guide to the 
aristocracy says he doubts the royal family would have permitted 
alberts marriage to a commoner had it guessed he might become 
king george vi 
brooksbaker said in an interview that the queen mothers 
enduring popularity is rooted in the way she and her husband rose 
to the task of reigning and made themselves so visible in london 
during world war ii 
they never flinched he said 
elizabeth rejected winston churchills advice to move to canada 
and after bombs hit buckingham palace the monarchs london 
residence in september 1940 she said im glad weve been 
bombed it makes me feel i can look the east end in the face 
george died of lung cancer in 1952 leaving her a widow at age 
51 and she went into seclusion until churchill cajoled her into 
returning to public life 
she still refers to her husband as the king and declines 
public appearances on the anniversaries of his birth marriage and 
death most biographers say she believes the strain of being king 
hastened his death and that she never fully forgave wallis simpson 
for her part in the abdication 
today her image combines angelic virtue with funloving 
earthiness 
alone among a generally abstemious family the queen mother 
enjoys an occasional pint of beer or gin and tonic shes a deft 
hand with card tricks shes mad about the races and breeds her own 
horses 
a television documentary marking her 85th birthday disclosed 
that clarence house her london home is the only private residence 
in britain known to have a blower the service providing 
betting shops with race results and running commentaries on horse 
races 
thriller writer dick francis who was her jockey from 1953 to 
1956 said in an interview she puts everyone she meets at their 
ease straight away and shes so knowledgeable about the things 
shes interested in like racing 
although the queen mother appears to be in robust health a 1986 
leg injury stubbornly refused to heal and she was hospitalized that 
year with a throat spasm suffered during a fish dinner four years 
earlier surgeons had to remove a fish bone from her throat 
corby attributes her good health and longevity to the fact she 
cant accept illness and she regards aspirin almost as a dangerous 
drug 
if she gave up and sort of retired i think that would have a 
bad affect on her he said she just keeps going you see her 
walking around on heels which are only slightly less high than ones 
she wore when she was a girl 
her routine rarely varies breakfast and newspapers in bed as a 
piper parades outside her window up at 9 am and on the telephone 
to her daughter down the street at buckingham palace 
its a call relished by palace switchboard operators who get to 
say your majesty i have her majesty on the line your majesty

editors note for years russell chatham held the professional 
art world in contempt dismissing most dealers as shysters he 
lived modestly in a rented montana ranch house painting his 
landscapes but refusing to promote his work but look at russell 
chatham now thirty years worth of his paintings are on display at 
the museum of the rockies and a chatham canvas can command a price 
in six figures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
without even a handshake between them a 
painter and a museum director batted around the idea and came to an 
agreement together they would stage the biggest oneman show by a 
living artist in the history of montana the deal was struck the 
deed was done 
then the museum director quit and moved away 
but this is the american west where a mans word is still 
supposed to count so the painter painted and the idea stayed alive 
this summer in the multimilliondollar new wing of the museum 
of the rockies on the grounds of montana state university 30 years 
worth of russell chathams paintings including 12 major new works 
and a companion exhibit fill more than 9000 square feet the huge 
show opened june 9 and runs through oct 7 
on every wall in two of the museums three galleries chathams 
works are on display in the third display area there are pictures 
sculpture and pottery by chathams relatives and friends which 
have inspired the 51yearold painter since he first took up a 
brush at the age of 8 
chatham a landscape artist who grew up around san francisco 
found his artistic vision in the paradise valley and environs of 
montana headquartered in a frontiervintage building in 
livingston he has become wellknown and moderately wellfixed 
collectors wait two or three years for a new acquisition that could 
cost up to six figures 
a modest fellow of downhome bent chatham can however become 
cantankerous when discussing modern art trends he hates most of 
them and holds nearly all museum curators and art gallery owners 
in contempt 
therefore when mick hager the museums former director who now 
heads the virginia museum of natural history in martinsville first 
broached the idea of a major museum show chatham was leery 
the way the socalled professional art world has operated is a 
sham chatham was fond of telling friends and collectors 
dealers are mostly shysters hyping bad art to people in museums 
which are filled with absolute trash 
that attitude had turned chatham inward just as it had turned 
off overtures from prominent dealers and art curators 
dismissing notions that his art would be in the mainstream or 
bring him any money chatham for years swore off selfpromotion and 
marketing of his work and became absorbed in creating it he held 
scores of oneman shows in small spaces but refused to participate 
in what he called everything but the kitchen sink art shows 
then about the time hager gave him his first oneman museum 
show in 1983 chatham got discovered and got solvent all at the 
same time 
today only the artist seems surprised by the recognition 
i think russell is tremendous as an artist hager says 
from the beginning i knew we had to have a major chatham in the 
new facility and i designed a space for it when russell first saw 
it he got excited and frightened at the same time and said my 
god you can see that wall for 70 feet 
but from the beginning we were clicking and from the idea of 
having one painting the project evolved into a major retrospective 
with the museum purchasing the one huge centerpiece painting and 
russell donating the other 11 in the series 
although the two men agreed on 100000 for the canvas the 
museum would purchase there was no money to pay for it during the 
entire year chatham worked on the project 
then just two weeks before the show opened the owner of brand 
s a livingston lumber company donated 50000 toward the 
painting steven jackson curator of art and photography who took 
over arranging the show after hager departed said the museum will 
apply for a matching grant from the national endowment for the arts 
im not concerned about the money said chatham who never 
has been 
he still keeps his home in the 75amonth ranch house he rented 
when he arrived in the paradise valley in 1972 he got there in a 
49 chevy pickup with five l bills in his pocket and in fact 
still has the pickup though its engine is terminally ill 
entering the museum the visitor sees that huge 10by12foot 
painting hager dreamed of the same one that gave chatham 
nightmares from inception to installation 
entitled the headwaters of the missouri river in april it 
is the heart of the dozen new canvasses that will remain in the 
museums permanent collection those paintings compose the 
seasons suite one representing each month in the region formed 
by the gallatin madison and jefferson rivers that create the 
missouri river 
chathams retrospective is 100 paintings executed from 1959 
through 1989 they range from tiny early oils of northern 
california and fledgling visions of the yellowstone country that he 
bartered away for babysitting services afghans and firewood when 
he was broke to large pieces commanding thousands of dollars from 
the rich andor famous such as actors peter fonda margot kidder 
harry dean stanton and jack nicholson 
the third gallery on the mezzanine above the museum entrance 
features 30 paintings by chathams grandfather gottardo piazzoni 
who executed the 14 murals in the san francisco library and has 
been his grandsons inspiration there will also be paintings by 
his greatuncle maurice del mue and other relatives and friends 
this show is a big risk for us because it takes up all the 
changing exhibition space said curator jackson russell has a 
large loyal following but it is not made up of historians 
curators or gallery owners because he has intentionally chosen to 
shun that world 
critic don berry writing in southwest art magazine said of 
chatham 
his painting concedes nothing whatever to the intellectual 
fads that have dominated the fine arts in the past 40 years his 
style remains solidly consistent with a palette that has been 
compared to a diverse group of artists including gauguin cezanne 
and monet 
in us art magazine critic chris waddington wrote his 
images seem to come from somewhere inside him commanding 
technique brings him success on all levels 
donna forbes director of the yellowstone art center wrote that 
chathams work evokes the soft exquisite manipulation of hues 
and values that time works upon one special place

want fast relief from the slambang blastemdead summer 
movies then you might consider a pleasant little comedyfantasy 
ghost dad 
a large part of its charm lies in its very lack of pretension 
no cast of thousands no huge sets the only extravagance is in the 
special effect of a spectral body floating on the ceiling and 
slipping through floors and walls 
bill cosby and sidney poitier stage a welcome reunion with 
ghost dad probably no director knows cosbys comedy potential 
better than his old friend poitier also knows the secrets of 
concise storytelling there is no waste in a poitier film 
as with his television counterpart cosby plays the father this 
time with three children a boycrazy teenager kimberly russell 
a wiseeyed boy salim grant and a bright 5yearold brooke 
fontaine hes a widower whose fatherly duties sometimes take a 
back seat to his demanding career in the financial world 
cosby is obviously doomed after all its called ghost dad 
poitier plays with his audience planting a roller skate at the top 
of the stairs showing elevator cables snapping but cosbys end 
doesnt come with anything so prosaic he takes a ride with a 
crazed taxi driver a funny bit by the whimsically named raynor 
scheine 
of course cosby doesnt go straight to heaven or the other 
place he lands in the library of an english gent ian bannen who 
tries to straighten his intermediate status he returns to his 
children who somehow adjust to a father you can see through its 
more difficult for his girlfriend denise nicholas when he falls 
through her bed 
cosby faces another crisis his children will be penniless 
unless he swings a deal for his bombastic boss barry corbin 
since cosby is visible only in the dark its not easy 
special effects aside ghost dad has the homey feel of an 
andy hardy movie cosby is allowed more schtick than in his tv 
series and he delivers wonderfully poitier integrates the flying 
scenes with seamless artistry and manages to make the happy ending 
believable he also draws endearing performances from the 
offspring kimberly russell head of the class 23 even makes 
a convincing teenager 
the screenplay of the universal pictures release is credited to 
chris reese and brent maddock amp ss wilson the ampersand denotes 
a writing team the producer terry wilson the rating is safely 
pg with seemingly little to prevent enjoyment for the whole 
family running time a compact 84 minutes

shedevil orion home video vhsbeta 8998 rated pg13 
 
shedevil is an example of dont fix it if aint broke 
in this case hollywood filmmakers decided they could do a 
better job than the bbc did with faye weldons darkly humorous and 
frightening tale the life and loves of a shedevil the bbc 
miniseries which ran on pbs was an awesome study of revenge and 
kinkiness it won critical raves and attracted a good following 
susan seidelmans hollywood romp with meryl streep and roseanne 
barr has nothing in common with the life and loves of a 
shedevil except the names of the central characters it is a 
tasteless brew of watereddown pablum 
ruth barr is a fat housewife whose husband bob ed begley 
jr falls in lust with a beautiful romance writer named mary 
fisher streep ruth decides to get even springing the kind of 
pranks that make it big on television sitcoms 
seidelman plays for laughs and they are few she also plays 
for froth there is much forget substance 
in fact forget this video altogether instead go fetch the pbs 
version this one will give you all the guts seidelman threw down 
the drain 
in the pbs version which closely follows weldons book ruth is 
a giant of a woman and truly ugly after her husband runs off with 
the petite and pretty mary she burns down their house dumps their 
unruly kids on the two lovers springs marys incontinent mother 
from a nursing home so she can further complicate marys life and 
sends her husband to jail 
ruth embarks on a life of strange and kinky crimes and starts 
her own employment agency hiring women like herself who no one 
else will touch her goal is to raise enough money for her ultimate 
plan which is to have cosmetic surgery on her entire body so she 
will look like mary fisher 
the performances are a marvel and the story will definitely put 
a scare into all philanderers

odes by henry purcell archiv the english concert and choir 
directed by trevor pinnock 
 
trevor pinnocks tasty rendition of henry purcells festival 
odes is among those compelling recordings that sing buy me 
when played in a record shop 
the precision and vigor of the perfomances and the clarity and 
immediacy of the recording are instantly impressive surely 
however this owes something to the composers skills 
the first and best known of the odes come ye sons of art 
was prepared for the birthday of queen mary ii in 1694 welcome 
to all the pleasures was written in honor of the patron of music 
for st cecilias day in 1683 while of old when heroes thought 
it base was composed for some municipal bash in yorkshire in 1690 
the music has all the gravity splendor and gaiety of a royal 
court thought the words be as empty as many a crowned head 
consider this from the first ode 
strike the viol touch the lute 
wake the harp inspire the flute 
sing your patronesses praise 
in cheerful and harmonious lays 
purcell turns this doggerel into a moving aria for countertenor 
over a dialogue between strings and woodwinds 
mere childs play really compared with the last ode which 
ends with a chamber of commercestyle screech long flourish the 
city and county of york 
purcell makes it a triumph

a friend once told peter weller that he was 
really overqualified for this kind of thing referring to the 
actors most noted role as robocop 
what do you mean asked weller 
well you come from the theater actors studio drama 
teacher uta hagen shakespeare and whathaveyou why do you 
always have a pistol in your hand why dont you recreate some 
strong human dilemma 
ill let the chips fall where they may weller replied if 
i read a good script and i like it i dont look at the label on 
it 
weller recounted the exchange during an interview to promote 
robocop 2 he makes no excuses to his theater pals who 
deprecate his portrayal of a oncedeceased cop who returns in an 
armored automated body to avenge himself against the detroit 
underworld 
the first robocop was the best script id ever read he 
declared plus which i was a huge fan of dutch director paul 
verhoeven i had written his name down some years before on a list 
of people i wanted to work with i really really wanted to do it 
verhoeven was not convinced he insisted that weller make a test 
on videotape weller insisted that he would not i am absolutely 
lousy in auditions he pleaded no amount of dutch persuasion 
could change his mind finally the director cast him no test 
was he reluctant to attempt a sequel 
sure sure you want to think that it would be good but 
theres an apprehension about being stuck in a form with no content 
stuck in the same can of beans with none of the charge that 
turned you on to the first one 
what convinced him was a great script in robocop 2 
which was directed by irvin kershner weller is fighting not only 
the crime barons but his own obsolescence omni consumer products 
which created the original machine has devised a new model without 
a human inside and it is programmed to wipe out its predecessor 
at least in the first film weller had early scenes as patrolman 
alex j murphy in the new one he is inside the robocop suit 
acting only with his eyes and voice 
i didnt give that much thought he said i figured if i 
was doing the right thing people would get it if i didnt they 
wouldnt 
nancy allen who portrays his expartner anne lewis agrees 
that weller did the right thing 
peter made my job a lot easier because he is very convincing 
the costume is very convincing theres just that tiny little strip 
that im constantly trying to see searching for him in his eyes 
it really works well and makes it that much more believable 
weller had an evermoving childhood the son of an army 
helicopter pilot he was born in wisconsin and was repeatedly 
uprooted as his father changed stations 
im sure its a good background for an actor makes you pretty 
resilient said the slim tall 43yearold actor whose bland 
face is dominated by intense blue eyes 
albert camus said the only real existentialist is either the 
traveler or the actor because they are constantly superimposing 
their existence momentbymoment on other existences maybe theyre 
handinhand the traveler and the actor i dont think theres a 
lot of security in either our notion of security in the zen 
sense its probably the most secure of all 
moving from place to place was a drag man just a drag it 
was a drag leaving people too it was sad but the good news was 
that i learned to deal with loss and the moment of change with a 
little more facility than other people i know 
wellers travels stopped briefly while he attended north texas 
state university where he majored in playing trumpet in jazz 
bands he also dabbled in acting and left for a scholarship at the 
american academy of dramatic arts in new york just before 
graduating he drew his first professional acting job playing the 
son in david rabes vietnam play sticks and bones for joe 
papps company hell return next year for a revival of the play 
this time as the father 
his film debut came in 1979 with butch and sundance the early 
years after other undistinguished films he finally registered 
in the adventures of buckaroo banzai across the 8th dimension 
the eccentric fantasy that attracted a flock of cultists 
wellers film and stage assignments continue the pattern of his 
youth man i havent stayed in one place yet i got an airline 
ticket in my hand right now i used to like it that way now i 
dont at this very moment in time i dont maybe tomorrow i will 
id like to have a family children be in one place or be 
grounded in a series of places some day

the worlds three top tenors jose carreras 
placido domingo and luciano pavarotti will sing in concert 
together at the baths of caracalla in rome 
wow 
thats what everybody says beams carreras me too 
the july 7 concert will be filmed and recorded 
each of us are going to sing arias and songs by ourselves 
carreras says then at the end we prepare a medley of popular 
pieces like o solo mio and maria from west side story or 
because well trade singing a few bars each of us and maybe at 
the end we finish together with pavarotti the highest of course 
i hope for people all over the world the live broadcast is 
going to be fun for sure nobody is going to have more fun than we 
are going to have in the meetings we had already weve had a lot 
of fun 
carreras who plans to donate his part of the proceeds to the 
jose carreras international foundation for leukemia research was 
interviewed shortly before his june 7 carnegie hall recital to 
benefit the foundation ticket prices ranged from 20 to 600 
the tenor who was diagnosed with leukemia in july 1987 started 
the foundation in his native spain in july 1988 after hed been 
successfully treated 
some 6 million has been raised the money is used primarily for 
scientific research were so arrogant we even gave money to the 
united states carreras said with a laugh two grants of 
25000 each to the american society of hematology 
money also is going to a cooperative bone marrowtransplant 
project between a barcelona hospital and the fred hutchinson 
hospital in seattle where carreras bone marrow was removed 
treated and replaced 
now he feels good and is back to a normal private and performing 
life except that some 15 of his concerts over the last two years 
have been benefits im out of any treatment or restriction from 
the doctors he says i have a blood test every eight weeks 
for control his hair has returned with a slightly higher 
forehead 
during his bone marrow removal and replacement domingo 
traveled to seattle to spend some hours with me and luciano kept 
calling me being so funny as he can be sending messages of moral 
support 
carreras whose first postleukemia performance was in barcelona 
in july 1988 sang here last summer and was reviewed favorably at 
first he was frightened to try singing i was so scared i 
decided to do it in my bathroom there the sound is always a little 
bit better because of the resonance 
the doctor said dont do it how can a singer avoid this 
temptation when you start to feel better at last and you can walk 
and talk and youre able to take a shower youre in there and 
now lets see 
slowly i started singing for myself at first only 10 or 15 
minutes a day then with my pianist until the moment i was able to 
sing from beginning to end the first aria in aida if a tenor can 
sing that he can sing anything else 
carreras has two new recordings out one of songs by italian 
opera composers and one of andrew lloyd webber songs he also has 
recorded tosca with eva marton and conductor michael tilson 
thomas and samson and dalila with agnes balsa and conductor sir 
colin davis 
when he returned to performing it was in recitals then he 
added operas singing in medee by cherubini at an outdoor 
amphitheater in merida spain where the jet set of roman 
society 2000 years ago used to retire a kind of miami 
he sang in carmen in tokyo and vienna and the premiere of 
leonardo baladas cristobal colon in barcelona his first 
contemporary music there are plans for carreras to sing that title 
role again in washington columbus ohio san antonio and 
california 
after he recorded samson carreras decided to sing the part 
for the first time on stage this summer in barcelona i think i 
have the voice he says the only dramatic moment musically is 
the second act duet with dalila the density of the orchestra is 
great the second act prayer has sadness and desperation in the 
voice but nothing to do with a dramatic orchestra 
there is a cliche samson has to be 190 pounds says 
carreras who is more slight than that i think samson is a 
character you can play thinking about his mysticism he is the 
leader of these people because of his spiritual strength and 
religious belief 
in july carreras will sing in massenets herodiade in 
merida next season hell sing in pagliacci in barcelona 
samson in london la boheme and carmen in vienna in 
1992 at la scala hell sing in fedora which he has recorded 
with marton but not sung on stage 
after his recital here carreras went to san francisco to film 
missa creolas in a mission i have an appointment with 
somebody from the opera i want to go back to san francisco even 
if i know that it doesnt pay to come to the united states to sing 
opera this is not the most important thing 
he lives in barcelona has a wife and a son 17 and daughter 
11 they both study music but dont show any special talent he 
says theyre going to be normal people 
carreras did not lose religious faith while he was so sick i 
think my faith grew after that i have to be honest 
at the beginning after you recover you think your life is 
going to change dramatically slowly slowly slowly you go back 
to the same mistakes what was your plan for a fantastic new life 
you keep your word for only 20 percent 
but this 20 percent is a big change in many things you 
probably see things from a more relaxing quiet peaceful way you 
have time to think about certain things before they were there 
but you didnt notice it maybe 
after such an extreme moment of your life you become more 
mature for the important things in life what is wonderful is that 
after such a bad period many of the conclusions are very positive 
so that if life was wonderful before now it is 100 percent 
wonderful in so many aspects i think im richer inside

this really is a scary town just ask new kids 
on the block they felt safe in their midtown hotel confident 
their fans had camped out elsewhere and even considered slipping 
out for pizza 
but it wasnt safe fourteen girls had staked out the right 
hotel jennifer i know theyre in there right now one girl 
said urgently to her comrades as they camped on the street 
be brave kids dont panic in a few years those girls wont 
even remember your names 
by the time tonight is over theyll catch on where we are and 
therell be 100 girls out here says jonathan knight 21 
weve had girls dress up as maids to try to sneak into our 
hotel rooms once in atlanta i was on the 25th floor of a hotel 
lying in bed hearing girls screaming 
i couldnt understand where it was coming from i looked out 
they had paid construction workers to take them up in a building 
being built across the street so they could look in our windows i 
waved and shut my curtains i think the police had to come 
jordan knight and donnie wahlberg both 20 and jonathan knight 
agreed to an interview while joe mcintyre 17 slept and danny 
wood 20 worked out at a gym jordan and donnie arrived almost two 
hours late ready to drop from the tight tour schedule 
today we hosted mtv and saturday night videos and did a lot of 
ids for different radio stations across america and for a lot of 
video outlets said jordan it was a busy day tomorrow morning 
we fly to london they performed in four german cities seven 
british cities and did promotional events in madrid milan 
amsterdam paris and rome 
new kids on the block is the biggestselling band in the land 
with a new record and video and another leg of a seemingly endless 
tour columbia records shipped a new single step by step on 
may 9 it sold more than 1 million copies in less than a week 
the companys initial release of the step by step album on 
june 5 was more than 2 million a 50minute video also was released 
june 5 the biggest initial release in cbs video history breaking 
the record of hangin tough live new kids on the blocks last 
longform video which has sold more than 11 million copies 
the tiny tots who love to scream along with new kids tunes will 
have plenty of time to learn the lyrics because the group will be 
touring stadiums through sept 15 
the bucks are pouring in for the testtube band theyre paid 
125000 per concert and sell equally as much offstage in 
souvenirs merchandise licensed to 25 manufacturers can be found in 
stores the group also will make commercials for cocacola will 
launch new kids dolls in august debut in a saturday morning 
cartoon series in september and star in a movie in the fall 
the cartoon people came out on the road with us for a month 
and learned our personalities and habits so that the cartoon is 
going to be a strong reflection of our personal lives jonathan 
said 
new kids on the block the idea of bostonbased music 
entrepreneur maurice starr who also started new edition is 
discounted by some as a made group and derided by others as 
another example of white people taking black music and making the 
big money from it 
despite all the acclaim and fame if theyre too busy for 
television then tv talk types will interview their mothers and 
money wahlberg is bugged by the group getting what he considers a 
bum rap they work hard always have theyve been on the road for 
most of the last four years before they were famous they toured 
as an opening act for tiffany they dont play instruments but 
dance and do their own singing the groups top management people 
are black so are onstage musicians presenting visible racial 
harmony 
wahlberg eats oysters he has ordered from room service and 
launches into a lengthy monologue as i find myself growing up i 
find myself focusing more on trying to speak out and fight more for 
things i believe in i like to show older people im not just a 
brainless little puppet of maurice starr 
i think the media has turned our image into the image of milk 
and cookies im not necessarily about milk and cookies im about 
positivity i talk to writers who turn around and write articles of 
only criticisms about our young fans and how much money were 
supposed to be making and selling a lot of merchandise and getting 
a lot of exposure and were cleancut guys whove been marketed to 
suit whoevers needs and nothing about the positivity of the group 
i havent been contrived brainwashed or molded by anyone but 
my parents im nobodys puppet 
i think a lot of critics see us as maurice starrs brainchild 
and any success we have is not due to us he writes songs i 
wrote two songs on the album ive written on every album jordan 
and myself produced two songs on tommy pages album i feel like i 
shouldnt have to sit here and bring these things up and say ive 
done this and that to get critics respect if i dont write and 
produce every song why does that irk people so much most actors 
dont write and direct their movies 
if they say these kids have no talent thats totally 
untrue we have maurice starr but every group has a mentor and 
started from an idea u2 was somebodys idea starr isnt on stage 
every night we work to take so much heat and flack sometimes it 
annoys me 
i read reviews of the show and the first line says those 
annoying girls 
wahlberg who says he reads newspapers every day wants it known 
that hes interested in important things the issue i find myself 
dealing with most is racism america isnt a racist society the way 
it used to be but racism is still flourishing in our society the 
most important thing anyone can do today is try to be openminded 
and try to educate themselves on things like racism

new kids often receive the same criticism as elvis presley who 
sang black performers songs and became far more famous than those 
who first performed them such as big mama thornton and hound 
dog but he paid to cut his first record in the style he liked 
to sing as a present for his mother 
wahlberg says the new kids grew up listening to black radio 
stations in boston i respect the roots of the music i perform 
he said i feel like im not stealing it the music i do is music 
i grew up listening to 
adolescent girls loved elvis in the 1950s the beatles in the 
60s and the rolling stones in the 70s now they adore the new 
kids 
but times have changed drugs and promiscuity are no longer in 
the new kids sing about romance lasting love and selfreliance 
wahlberg says from the stage thank you for staying drug free 
three books about the band are on paperback bestseller lists 
and fans salivate for every nugget about the quintets personal 
lives wahlberg isnt in love at the moment jonathan knight has 
the same girlfriend he had before the group started 
the story of new kids on the block dates back to 1985 in boston 
where maurice starr worked he was a man of ideas as well as a 
facile songwriter and had put together groups before none meeting 
with wild success first he thought he and his brothers could be 
another jackson 5 then he heard four young singers called the new 
edition signed them and shepherded them through their first album 
they sued him for their release and won on the basis that they 
were minors when they signed 
starr put together a trio and managed a funk quartet next he 
had the idea that a white group singing music like the new 
edition with choreography like the motown groups in their heyday 
could appeal to white as well as the new editions black listeners 
he found four boys in boston high schools none of them aiming 
toward a show business career he found 12yearold joe mcintyre 
last younger and smaller than the rest the michael jackson of the 
latterday jackson 5 idea he never abandoned 
new kids wasnt an overnight success its first record was 
marketed by columbia records to black radio which wasnt crazy 
about it a station in tampa fla aimed at white listeners picked 
up on please dont go girl from the second album hangin 
tough in march 1988 and the group took off 
starr however isnt resting on his laurels he put together a 
trio perfect gentlemen which opened new kids shows in the winter 
tour theyre 12 11 and 13 knight says just having them 
around brings back a lot of memories stuff theyre going through 
now that we went through their fans are younger than ours we have 
fans from 4 to grandmothers but predominately its 13 to 18 
on this summers tour perfect gentlemen will open again along 
with tommy page who cowrote his single ill be your 
everything with two of the new kids and the latest protege 
16yearold rick wes whom starr thinks can become another elvis 
new kids on the block are prisoners of their own fame when 
theyre on the road but jonathan knight says he doesnt mind we 
cant leave the hotel because its so crazy outside we usually 
sleep most of the day wake up around 2 and get dressed and lounge 
around the sound check is usually around 4 after the show well 
all party pretty much all night eating and watching a movie it 
depends sometimes well go crash in somebody elses room or in our 
own 
if the next concert is in a different town theyll sometimes 
get on the bus and travel all night 
we sightsee out the window thats about it jonathan said 
we have our own buses custom built for us with beds and tvs and 
bathrooms and microwaves we buy microwave pizzas and premade 
stuff 
everywhere we go girls are out in front we have jealous 
boyfriends pull up in front of our houses at 3 in the morning 
screaming at the top of their lungs we learn to live with it the 
good things far outweigh the bad things 
when the first album didnt sell hugely jonathan said our 
manager starr was telling us we have to wait our turn as long as 
we keep working hard and doing the best we can do our dreams will 
come true hes always positive about everything 
during the twoweek vacation before going to europe wahlberg 
worked on producing two new groups the west side boys and marky 
mark and the funky bunch the latter his 18yearold brother mark 
who was in new kids for six months then dropped out because he was 
more interested in basketball wahlberg also has three sisters and 
four brothers older than himself 
during those two weeks jonathan worked in his yard until 4 am 
ive got those nightowl eyes he says i was out there 
putting in a pond planting bushes getting the yard ready me and 
jordan just bought a house for our family they have two sisters 
and two more brothers at home theyre not jealous they know god 
carved out my life to do what im doing and they have their special 
place in life to fulfill their dreams 
we all still live with our families we want to have our 
families benefit from what weve accomplished i helped one sister 
buy a car donnie bought a house and danny i believe bought his 
parents house from them and redid it for them joe still lives in 
an apartment building with his mom 
joe mcintyre who has one more year of high school travels with 
a tutor who also gives classes to anyone who wants them knight 
studied computers and wood studied nutrition

sue miller admits she made a huge false 
start on her new novel for hundreds of pages she wrote about a 
subject she knew would bore herself and readers as well a happy 
family 
it could have been a very happy book where the mother stays at 
home and is very happy with the three children miller said of 
family pictures 1995 harper and row in which a familys 
life is disrupted by the birth of an autistic child 
if the child had not been born autistic i wouldnt have 
written about the family people dont write books about happy 
families it is true that fiction focuses on hardship 
i think in some way or another writers are just interested in 
watching how people change or dont grow in hardship thats 
usually a premise in every single book said miller author of 
the bestselling the good mother 
so heres a novel about a family unique in the way that all 
unhappy families are unique david and lainey eberhardt live in 
chicago with their two children mack and liddie theyre 
wonderfully undramatically happy 
but their third child randall is autistic its the 1950s a 
time when little was understood about that condition david a 
psychiatrist blames lainey though they have three more children 
nina mary and sarah the marriage falls apart 
i feel the particular time and place the particular set of 
values the psychiatric wisdom of the time has an unbelieveable 
impact on the family its absolutely of this world of its time 
said miller who grew up in chicago in the 50s and 60s and was 
the second of four children 
david has the attitude that orthodox psychiatry had about 
autism and he would have been less likely to sustain those beliefs 
in another time she said referring to his attitude that the 
autism was caused by the mothers behavior 
i think also the very life of that family the father who 
works the mother whose life is her children is very much that 
particular period also the father who is the authoritative figure 
who understands the world who analyzes the world while women were 
supposedly incapacitated by their emotions 
family pictures tells of action and reflection the chapters 
arranged in time like the pages of a family album miller shows her 
characters lying awake in bed rehashing events at bars dousing 
themselves with beer or stealing away from parties to be alone 
with their thoughts 
the novel begins with nina recalling macks 14th birthday 
during which randall amazingly utters happy birthday dear 
mackie at least thats how nina remembers it her mother 
insists it never happened that randall stopped speaking when he 
was 4 and liddie is sure shes the one who should be telling the 
story 
but thats the way it is in a family isnt it miller 
writes the stories get passed around polished embellished 
liddies version or macks version changes as it becomes my 
version 
family pictures is millers version stories are borrowed 
from her own life and others she writes about family outings 
baseball games a chicago college house and the casual cruelty of 
teenage boys 
i do think that its probably easier for women now to imagine 
being male than it was 25 or 35 years ago the way women are now 
raised to think about their sexuality has really shifted 
enormously miller said 
i think that more and more we at least understand and are 
familiar with the other sex women live more like men they have 
much more freedom it possibly has made a women fiction writers 
life easier 
miller a single parent for 12 years now living with her second 
husband rejects the idea that men are more capable of writing 
about the real world the workplace and wars while women are 
better off with the inner world of family novels 
she observes that classic 19thcentury novels such as anna 
karenina and madame bovary were only about families yet 
so rooted in a place and time they defined a whole society as well 
it seems to me the family novel can raise rather large social 
issues as well as rather large philosophical issues in the 19th 
century the people who wrote were often gentlemen so they didnt 
have the rough tough world to write about 
they didnt write about the office they tended to write about 
dinner parties they tended to write about adulteries its a shame 
that its so divided now its seen as this radical feminist 
thing 
in the good mother a woman divorces her lawyer husband and 
begins a passionate affair with an artist when her exhusband 
accuses her lover of sexual irregularities a bitter custody 
battle ensues for their 4yearold daughter the title becomes 
ironic can a woman be a good mother and still enjoy full 
sexual freedom 
family pictures is ironic too the story delivering little 
of the cozy warmth promised by the title like finding graffiti on 
the back of an old framed portrait 
in both novels miller concentrates on the uneasy partnership of 
public and private moving from office rooms to bedrooms tracing 
the confusing intricate paths of the legal and medical professions 
and showing how they can alter the fine print of the human heart 
i feel very connected to particular social issues miller 
said im very interested in the way the law interacts with human 
life the emotional life of human beings and i think its almost 
criminal the particular stance psychiatry took on autism this was 
an error 
for every writer theres the question of what will people 
struggle with what will be the hard thing that happens that people 
will have to grow around or be defeated by in family pictures i 
wanted it to happen over a long period of time i wanted the way 
they thought about it to shift and change

travis tritt figures living off canned 
vienna sausages for a few years was worth it while he tried to get 
his country music career going 
today hes one of several fresh faces on the countrywestern 
scene who are supplanting the old guard like waylon jennings and 
johnny cash at the top of the popularity charts 
tritts help me hold on was a no 1 country music single in 
may his debut album country club could be a gold lp sales 
of onehalf million by fall 
the album has reached higher on the country music charts than 
the highly promoted highwayman 2 lp by country kings willie 
nelson kris kristofferson jennings and cash 
these are guys ive idolized tritt 27 said in an 
interview during a frenzied 16hour work day its almost 
mindboggling its like youve cheated nature 
six years ago tritt quit his 400aweek job as an assistant 
manager for a marietta ga company that distributes heating and 
airconditioning equipment 
he yearned to sing professionally a beckoning that began at 
age 8 when he taught himself to play guitar so he gave up job 
security to sing at night in american legion halls for pay that 
would hardly cover necessities 
i would go to the grocery store once a week and buy canned 
vienna sausage a head of lettuce a jar of mayonnaise a loaf of 
bread and two or three cans of soup he recalled this was 
breakfast lunch and dinner for the entire week its all i could 
afford 
several times he nearly gave up singing in order to return to a 
more normal job with better benefits and pay 
you almost have to have as much patience as you do talent 
tritt recalled 
he finally hooked up with warner bros records and gained 
recognition this year as one of country musics rising stars 
his album contains mainly blue collar anthems celebrating a 
carefree southern lifestyle characterized by relentless drinking 
the joy of driving pickup trucks and the relaxation of shooting 
pool his lyrical themes are much like those of another dixie 
firebrand hank williams jr 
but his no 1 record had a tender touch a plea to his lover 
not to leave him 
his next single release im gonna be somebody documents 
the struggle of a singer who becomes successful after 10 years and 
the subsequent envy of someone just like him 
his style is hardcore country music with fiddles steel guitars 
and a harmonica 
i do music that turns me on said the bearded mustachioed 
tritt i figure if it does it will turn others on too i think 
weve struck a nerve with a part of middle america that really is 
looking for honesty in music weve struck a chord with a younger 
audience as well 
the music deals with real situations real people everyday 
ordinary life you dont have to be a poetry major or literature 
student to understand country music 
tritt has bought a touring bus owned previously by a succession 
of country stars including randy travis merle haggard and conway 
twitty

the nations savings and loan disaster finally 
exploded on capitol hill as a political issue after a freshman 
republican lawmaker provided the spark 
congress has been wrestling with the problem since the sampl 
industrys governmentbacked insurance fund went belly up at the 
end of the reagan administration tens of billions of dollars are 
being spent to bail out close down and sell off thrift 
institutions 
though costly it seemed for the longest time that president 
bushs effort to keep the issue quiet was the best strategy 
oh sure its expensive the white house said but lets keep it 
off the books not count it against our deficitreduction efforts 
remember that a lot of it is just working capital 
congress unable to find a good alternative went along 
although trouble flared up sporadically for some lawmakers 
a handful of senators the socalled keating five are under 
investigation because of their extraordinary efforts on behalf of 
one spectacularly failed thrift some house members seeking 
reelection his year are under attack for their ties to financial 
institutions 
but for the most part lawmakers who werent personally involved 
in the issue appeared to be standing back 
then this spring something changed and the issue seemed to 
reach critical mass 
perhaps it was the nearness of the elections theres a chance 
it was the cumulative effect of neverending bad news and 
escalating costs 
and just maybe the public began to catch on that whatever the 
bookkeeping tricks more of their federal tax dollars would be 
going to bail out inept or crooked thrift operations than say to 
education 
enter peter smith a firstterm republican congressman from 
vermont who reached the house in a threeway race where the 
democrat and a socialist split the majority of the vote 
i basically blew my stack smith says 
two weeks ago smith introduced a resolution in the house calling 
for the appointment of a special prosecutor known officially as an 
independent counsel to go after the savings and loans 
the measure would have no binding effect and in some ways is 
flawed an independent counsel can be requested simply by a 
majority of either the republicans or the democrats on the 
congressional judiciary committees 
but a freshman doesnt move the committee structure smith 
said 
and the purpose of the law is to address conflicts of interest 
the justice department would have investigating the bush 
administration not to balkanize federal enforcement efforts for 
every issue that comes along 
when youre talking about congress and highranking government 
officials i think the conflict exists smith said 
his resolution immediately touched off lawmakers starving for a 
way to look tough on the issue by late last week more than 170 
house members were cosponsoring his resolution 
even though the resolution could rightly be seen as a vote of no 
confidence in the administration and especially attorney general 
dick thornburgh republicans were embracing smith as a hero 
my sense is the justice department has moved slowly if my 
resolution has something to do with prodding those people then i 
think its a good thing smith said im just sorry it took so 
long 
when smith scheduled a news conference on his resolution last 
week he expected three colleagues to join him instead 17 showed 
up among them house minority whip newt gingrich rga a top 
backer of the reagan administrations sampl deregulation that 
democrats say led to the financial disaster 
whether or not a special prosecutor is appointed it now appears 
clear that congress will take some sort of action this year 
savings and loan operators now are rivaling drug dealers as 
congress glamour criminals 
top democrats and republicans on the house banking committee 
last week introduced legislation to bolster justice department 
enforcement and give the federal government new powers to chase 
down some of the money embezzled from the savings institutions 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel 
announced a crackdown bill of his own and attacked the 
administration for cutting back the fbis budget request for 
hundreds of new agents for the crisis 
i have succeeded beyond my wildest dreams smith said

interlink electronics a young company with 
a hightech sense of touch has its fingers in everything from 
aerospace to computers music and sports 
interlinks biggest problem in fact might be developing all 
the potential uses of its patented force sensing resistors 
which translate touch into electronic signals 
one of the things thats a plague to us as a small company is 
the sensors fit in so many markets that people dont know what to 
make of us said kathryn stewart vice president of sales and 
marketing of the 5yearold santa barbarabased company 
nicknamed the electronic gas pedal a force sensing resistor 
is a tactile sensor that responds with variable resistance the 
harder this thick polymer film is pressed the more its resistance 
drops 
interlink on friday introduced its first highvolume consumer 
product an electronic keyboard footpedal that is part of the 
miracle piano teaching system the system combines a cartridge 
for the nintendo entertainment system with a keyboard and home 
television to create gamelike video piano lessons 
that modest step into consumer electronics is only a hint of 
interlinks future the privately held company also is targetting 
aerospace where its sensors are used to determine whether the 
various layers of airplane composite materials are being joined 
evenly 
among the aerospace companies experimenting with the devices are 
boeing co northrop corp and mcdonnell douglas corp 
that business represents about onefifth of interlinks expected 
27 million in sales this year said president e michael thoben 
iii 
three other key markets for interlink are computer input 
devices such as a stationary mouse for apple computer incs 
macintosh portable sensing components on electronic drums and 
musical keyboards and rugged keypads for automatic teller machines 
thoben told the companys shareholders at an annual meeting 
thursday that interlink will concentrate on those four markets to 
build up revenue over the next few years 
were in transition from a research and development concern to 
one driven by the market said thoben 
interlink also makes a touch interpreting sensor for a robot a 
device that fits under the grip of a golf club to analyze a 
players swing footplates for medical analysis of podiatry 
problems and bed or wheelchair position monitors 
but even that array of products just hints at the applications 
that have been pursued by interlink which is backed by the funding 
of grace ventures corp a unit of wr grace amp co 
imagine an electronic tennis referee so accurate it could shut 
up john mcenroe interlink began work on a system proposed by a 
customer which got good reviews from the us tennis association 
but the project is on hold until the customer can raise enough 
money to fund further research 
the biomedical industry is interested in interlink sensors to 
provide feedback for dispensing diagnostic and rehabilitative 
functions the sensors also can be applied to the automotive 
industry in window mirror and audio controls as well as tire 
brake and fuel level sensors 
the company which has only 50 us employees grew out of an 
idea developed by inventor franklin eventoff in the 1970s eventoff 
was trying to make a musical toy for his daughter when he created a 
way to generate an electronic response when varying degrees of 
pressure were applied to a sensor 
eventoff patented the invention and formed a company then sold 
off most of the company he remains a major shareholder 
interlink has refined and improved the sensors and now holds 33 
patents in 10 countries

in a potential setback for a union group seeking 
to buy ual corps united airlines a group of noncontract 
employees says time is running out for the buyout group to accept 
their proposals 
the noncontract employees said in a news release sunday they 
had developed a package of wage concessions benefit modifications 
and other elements under which they could support the buyout plan 
but the united employee acquisition corp the entity formed by 
the unions to handle the proposed 454 billion buyout has not 
agreed to the package a news release from system roundtable said 
system roundtable is the top rung of a series of groups of 
noncontract employees which effectively has become the 
noncontract employees bargaining agent in the buyout effort 
their support is not essential to the proposed deal but the 
opposition of noncontract employees could complicate the unions 
attempts to raise financing 
the buyout groups contract to buy ual will lapse if financing 
is not obtained by aug 10 if financing is secured the group 
would have until the end of the year to close the deal 
under the agreement approved april 6 by uals board uniteds 
pilots would own 379 percent of the companys stock machinists 
would own 357 percent noncontract employees would get 143 
percent and united flight attendants would own 12 percent 
in the news release system roundtable said we are very 
disappointed we think it is particularly disturbing that ueac has 
not yet been able to resolve the issues relating to the 
noncontract employees 
it is also surprising that agreement on this package which is 
a test of ueacs check and balance governance system has not yet 
been finalized the release said 
if this package is not agreed to very shortly by ueac it does 
not bode well for ueacs ability to make the business judgments 
that it will certainly face in trying to finance the proposed 
leveraged buyout and if that transaction is completed in running 
the airline the release said 
hank krakowski a spokesman for the ueac declined to comment on 
system roundtables stance and said he was not familiar with the 
package of terms 
noncontract workers comprise over onethird of uals total work 
force of about 71500 people they include reservations and ticket 
agents professional and technical staffers and management and 
supervisors excluding chairman stephen wolf and other top officers 
the union group includes the air line pilots association 
machinists and the association of flight attendants 
the union group has proposed overall employee wage and benefit 
cuts totaling 2 billion over five years to offset buyout costs 
at ual corps annual meeting april 26 daryl thorogood a 
united reservations agent from san francisco said the exclusion of 
salaried and management employees from buyout negotiations was 
rude illegal and undemocratic 
ms thorogood said the noncontract employees have had no voice 
in deciding how much they will give up

opec president sadek boussena has warned 
the cartel that oil prices will collapse if the organizations 
members do not adhere to a production cutback agreement the middle 
east economic survey reported monday 
the oil industry newsletter published in nicosia said that 
boussena stressed in a june 11 letter to the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 13 members that if current 
overproduction was not curbed things may soon get out of 
control 
boussena algerias mines minister stressed that the current 
price slide stemming from overproduction could lead to a serious 
price collapse akin to the one experienced in 1986 with its full 
consequences on member countries revenues and economic prospects 
oil prices nosedived to below 10 a barrel in 1986 causing 
major economic convulsions for opec and other major producers 
the cartel currently is seeking to maintain prices at around 18 
a barrel but prices on world markets have fallen to about 15 a 
barrel 
opec members agreed in geneva on may 2 to trim production to 
221226 million barrels a day from the april daily level of 2398 
million barrels far in excess of the ceiling agreed in december 
but overall opec production last month was estimated at 2368 
million barrels a day because several members particularly kuwait 
and the united arab emirates were continuing to produce well above 
their quotas 
the newsletter quoted boussena as saying that the main driving 
factor behind the recent downturn in prices is undoubtedly the 
deeprooted feeling of the market that the agreement reached in 
geneva is not being implemented by opec 
he said that this is fueling the extreme downward pressure on 
prices and is now substantiated by the publication of the major 
secondary sources figures on opec production for may thus 
highlighting the fact that reduction pledges have not been 
effectively implemented at least to the extent necessary for the 
market to build confidence in the agreement 
he cautioned that if action was not taken swiftly to reduce 
production things may soon get out of control with all the 
damaging consequences on opec cohesion and credibility and our 
member countries ability to continue working together for the 
benefit of all 
according to the newsletter boussena plans to visit all opec 
members soon to take soundings on the prospect of working out a 
durable agreement on production and prices at the july conference 
the weekly newsletter noted that despite considerable 
disquiet in opec about the production violations there was no 
chance of an emergency opec meeting before the scheduled july 25 
conference in geneva 
the survey reported last week that despite the overproduction 
in may output was expected to drop considerably in june

donald trumps tentative debt restructuring 
arrangement which is needed to boltser his troubled real estate 
and casino empire is being jeopardized by ongoing disputes among 
small and large creditor banks a report published today said 
the new york times said negotiatons fell apart saturday when the 
big lenders argued over the proposed terms of the loan package 
reached earlier this month at the center of the dispute is how 
much each bank should contribute and the collateral to be used the 
newspaper said quoting unidentified sources 
trumps financial problems grew more precarious on friday after 
he missed the payment on an estimated 31 million in interest and 
principal on bonds used to finance his trumps castle hotelcasino 
in atlantic city 
trump was given a 10day grace period on friday if he doesnt 
come up with the money before the grace period expires he could be 
in default and that might place trump in jeopardy of losing his 
new jersey casino licenses 
banking sources familiar with the talks said last week that 
trumps four major bank lenders citibank bank trust new york 
corp chase manhattan and manufactueres hanover agreed to 
provide an additional 60 million in loans and to temporarily 
suspend interest payments 
the sources had said citicorp and bankers trust would provide 
about twothirds of the new loan 
the big banks have been trying to persuade some of the smaller 
creditors including some japanese banks to go along with the 
proposed restructuring but some of those institutions have been 
opposed to the plan first fidelity bancorp of newark nj and 
midlantic banks inc of edison nj reportedly were the main 
holdouts 
the ongoing negotiations also have raised speculation that 
bankers want more authority over operation of trumps properties 
the wall street journal reported today that the banks have been 
demanding that trump appoint two top executives a chief executive 
officer and a chief financial officer to control the daily 
operations of the trump organization dan klores a spokesman for 
trump refused to comment on the negotiations or the reports 
he said the banks resumed talks today after their meeting broke 
off on saturday banks also have refused official comment 
at his 44th birthday celebration at his taj mahal casino resort 
on saturday trump told throngs of employees that he was confident 
he would rise above his financial problems 
over the years ive surprised a lot of people the largest 
surprise is yet to come he said 
the purpose behind the proposed debt restructuring plan was to 
give trump time to wait for his assets to rise in value 
trump has been beset by a slumping real estate market in new 
york and disappointing results from his three atlantic city 
casinos and the trump shuttle airline 
his real estate holdings which also include new yorks plaza 
hotel and trump tower were built largely with the funds from bank 
loans and borrowed from junk bonds trump owes banks an estimated 
2 billion and bondholders another 1 billion

not been decided officials said

determined officials of the exchanges said at the press 
conferences which were linked via television the cboe would build 
and operate the main computer for the system and reuters would 
build the network that provides traders access to the markets 
computer 
other exchanges specifically the new york stock exchange and 
the tokyo exchange have been invited to join the system officials 
said 
although the three exchanges will be cooperating in the 
electronic system james r jones chairman and chief executive of

of each listed stock each stock would trade once at each auction 
with trades combined at a single price

most american workers will see their dreams 
slip away unless society invests far more in improving their 
skills in school and on the job a commission led by two former 
labor secretaries warned today 
the united states also will lose the economic race with other 
countries unless business schools and government take radical 
steps to boost worker skills concluded the report 
most workers receive no education or training beyond high 
school the report said adding that existing state and federal 
training programs are haphazard incoherent and bureaucratic 
what we are facing is an economic cliff of sorts and the 
front line working people of america are about to fall off it 
the report said 
frontline workers include clerks secretaries machinists 
drivers farm hands and others who are not usually college educated 
the report offered a blueprint for changing the way schools 
business and government prepare workers for an increasingly complex 
economy 
among its recommendations a requirement that us companies 
devote at least 1 percent of payroll to skills training and a 
mandate that no one under 18 be allowed to hold a job until earning 
a certificate proving mastery of basic academic skills and work 
qualities 
it also recommended that states with federal assistance create 
local youth centers for ensuring that all dropouts ages 1421 
earn mastery certificates the report estimated such centers would 
cost 82 billion a year 
teacher union leaders praised the commissions findings at a 
news conference today american federation of teachers president 
albert shanker called the report the most significant in the 
whole reform movement in terms of substance 
commission member john sculley chairman of apple computer 
inc added his support and told reporters i believe america 
today is faced with a workforce crisis 
the report warned that many with limited skills face the loss of 
jobs as us businesses struggle to cut labor costs to stay 
competitive with foreign companies 
higher skills means the jobs stay at home the report said 
seventy percent of us workers will see their dreams slip 
away unless society increases the commitment to improved skills 
the report said 
the study was produced by the 34member commission on the skills 
of the american work force the panel included top business 
education and labor executives its chairmen were former us labor 
secretaries bill brock and ray marshall and ira magaziner an 
international business authority 
the report was based on about 2000 interviews conducted at over 
550 companies and agencies since last july in the united states 
germany sweden denmark ireland japan and singapore 
while us businesses spend some 30 billion training workers 
only onethird is spent on noncollege educated employees about 
15000 companies less than 1 percent of the total provide over 90 
percent of corporatebased training in the us the study said 
by contrast the report found foreign education systems far more 
committed than us schools to preparing all students for 
successful careers not just the collegebound 
and the approximately 100 foreign corporations in the study were 
generally more inclined to avoid layoffs and provide worker 
training than us companies 
the study was funded with 500000 in grants from the carnegie 
corporation of new york new york state and towers perrin a new 
yorkbased consulting firm 
the commission was created by the national center on education 
and the economy a rochester nybased group whose president 
marc tucker was another principal author 
the reports central theme was that us schools and businesses 
should strive to professionalize frontline workers and bolster 
skills so they will need less supervision in turn companies will 
become more efficient sell more expand and employ more people at 
higher wages 
in an interview last week magaziner expressed optimism that the 
recommendations would be realized especially when americans 
realize that other industrial nations have already adopted many of 
the steps 
i think americans are ultimately very pragmatic once they 
realize a problem exists we operate on fads when an idea gets 
momentum i think we move pretty quickly he said

sixteen years ago the chairman tried to tame 
inflation once and for all with a whip as a member of president 
fords administration he helped launch a campaign to whip 
inflation now 
now critics say he is using the same rope in another way to 
tie up the economy 
to a very limited extent in the 1970s it might be claimed the 
chairman succeeded whereas consumer prices had risen 11 percent in 
1974 the increase had dropped to as low as 58 percent in 1976 
not everyone then was willing to credit the chairman with having 
succeeded because the campaign was atrociously planned it was 
launched as the economy was plunging into a recession that would 
relieve pressure on prices 
and critics today are wondering again if something of the sort 
might be occurring once again the enemy is inflation or the 
threat of it the goal is to destroy it and the risk is a descent 
into recession 
as before the chairman is the same in 1974 alan greenspan was 
chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers in 1990 
he is chairman of the federal reserve board which seeks to control 
the money supply 
greenspan has a firm almost unrelenting grip on it and perhaps 
as a direct result you cant buy and spend if you havent got 
access to funds there is growing evidence of an economy 
progressively weakening 
consumer demand has shrunk real estate sales and building have 
almost stopped in some areas small businesses especially those 
related in any way to real estate have trouble borrowing 
corporate profits are on the skids 
the evidence shows up all over plans for investment in new 
plants and equipment have ceased to grow and privatesector 
employment shows signs of shriveling even when temporary census 
bureau jobs are included 
money is the raw material that powers economic activity and 
when the fed tightens the spigot the wheels of commerce slows 
keep the spigot closed long enough and some of the wheels stop 
eventually recession threatens 
some economists think that recession is closing in and that 
statistics released over the next month might even show it but 
there seems to be no letup in the chairmans resolve to lick this 
monster called inflation 
whether he has the right notion or is destined to badly damage 
the economy is up for debate greenspan has his supporters even 
among business people who say the nation can never embark on a 
real expansion until the job is done 
that job of course is to bury inflation so deeply it cannot 
arise again for years 
the chairmans first effort failed after a few years after 
dropping to 58 percent in 1976 the consumer price index reached 
double digits in 1979 and helped bring on the deep recession of 
1981 and 1982 
recovery followed helped a great deal by a loosening of the 
money spigot as most people know because they benefited from it 
the economy began a long expansion right through 1989 an expansion 
that might be about to end 
beginning late in the 1980s the fed once again began closing 
the spigot not abruptly or completely but enough to reduce the 
growth of bank reserves which govern lending and then to bring 
about an actual contraction 
now the signs of a economy on the edge are showing up 
everywhere and from everywhere the cries for easier money will be 
heard not just from business either but from elected officials 
who fear for their jobs 
greenspans supporters and probably the chairman himself seem 
to think however that slow growth or even a recession might be 
the price to pay to bury inflation for years to come

us trade representative carla hills who 
would like to be included in the us delegation to next months 
economic summit got support monday from an influential democratic 
senator 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas chairman of the senate finance 
committee urged president bush to reconsider his decision 
excluding hills from the summit of the worlds seven largest 
industrial countries scheduled for july 911 in houston 
traditionally the only members of the presidents cabinet who 
attend the annual economic summits are the secretary of state and 
the treasury secretary but hills has made no secret of the fact 
that she would like to make an exception to that rule this year 
bentsen said hills presence was especially important this year 
because of the many unresolved issues in the current uruguay round 
of global free trade talks being held under the auspices of the 
96nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
most of the issues of greatest importance to the united states 
investment intellectual property services trade have not been 
resolved bentsen wrote in a letter to bush 
given ambassador hills critical role in the negotiations i 
believe that she should be part of the team that accompanies you to 
the summit bentsen said 
hills has said she hopes bush and the leaders of japan west 
germany britain france italy and canada will use the summit to 
search for common ground to break the stalemate in the trade talks 
the summit will come only a few weeks before a critical 
negotiating session in geneva 
the bush administration has made achieving a new agreement its 
top trade priority this year however it has been unable to 
overcome resistance to a key plank in the us proposal that would 
eliminate expensive tradedistorting farm subsidies over the next 
decade 
torie clarke hills press secretary said that hills 
certainly appreciated chairman bentsens input but now if she 
does get invited it wont be because of her own charm and 
persuasiveness

grain and soybean futures prices rallied monday 
on the chicago board of trade ending a threeday decline amid 
short covering prompted in part by concerns about flood damage to 
corn and soybean crops 
analysts said most of the buying reflected profittaking by 
traders who sold futures contracts last week establishing short 
positions and were now buying back contracts at lower prices 
further buying was prompted by reports that heavy weekend rains 
damaged newly planted corn and soybeans in lowlying areas of 
central iowa central illinois and southern ohio 
wheat futures were supported by reports that china was bidding 
for 500000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices under a 
previously announced agriculture department offer 
wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 330 a bushel corn was 3 cents 
to 6 cents higher with july at 286 a bushel oats were 2 cents 
to 3 cents higher with july at 142 cents a bushel and 
soybeans were 8 cents to 11 cents higher with july at 596 a 
bushel

the supreme court agreed monday to resolve 
conflicting rulings over unions legal duty to cooperate with 
candidates for union office who want to distribute campaign 
literature 
the justices said they will decide whether a maritime industry 
union violated federal labor law when in 1988 it refused to give a 
membership mailing list to a candidate for the unions presidency 
labor law gives candidates for union office a right to have 
campaign literature distributed by the union the court must decide 
whether that right is conditioned by the reasonableness of the 
request for distribution or the reasonableness of a union rule 
restricting such requests 
a decision is expected sometime next year 
the appeal acted on today was filed by the international 
organization of masters mates and pilots a 7500 national union 
representing ship officers pilots and other merchant marine 
workers 
the union based in baltimore holds elections every four years 
prior to the nominating convention for the 1988 election 
presidential candidate timothy a brown a ship captain from tampa 
fla asked the union for mailing labels containing the names and 
addresses of all voting union members 
brown wished to distribute literature at his own expense before 
the nominating convention 
he said he sought to attract support from other members before 
they were likely to have committed their votes to other candidates 
the early mailing also would help offset the advantage held by 
incumbent union officers who might seek reelection 
elwood kyser a union officer turned down browns request 
because the unions constitution does not authorize distribution of 
campaign literature until after a nominating convention 
brown sued and a federal judge in baltimore ordered the union 
to furnish the mailing labels so that browns campaign literature 
could be distributed 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the order last nov 
17 by an 82 vote 
we believe the test to be not whether the unions rule was 
reasonable but whether the candidates request was reasonable 
the apeals court said 
another federal appeals court ruled otherwise 
asked for their views bush administration lawyers said the 4th 
circuit courts ruling is correct but urged the high court to use 
the case to resolve the conflicting decisions 
the case is international organization of masters mates amp 
pilots vs brown 891330

the nations chief federal bank 
regulator watching credit across the northeast dry up amid rising 
loan losses tried to reassure jittery bankers and their customers 
monday that the industry is sound 
comptroller of the currency robert clarke told a group of 
providence executives that the federal government has not toughened 
its regulations or its audits of banks what it has done he said 
is reacted to changes in the economy and in the process has 
uncovered bad loans at many institutions 
were trying to make sure you have a safe and sound banking 
system and at the same time not choke off the availability of 
credit he said 
clarke conceded that a wave of examination of real 
estaterelated bank credit have made it tougher get a loan 
although examiners ordered many of the northeasts largest banks to 
increase their reserves to cover potentially bad loans regulators 
did not advise against continuing to lend money he said 
im concerned about the misconceptions and misperceptions 
about what bank supervisors and the office of the comptroller of 
the currency are doing he said there is no doubt confusion 
in the minds of bankers about what were doing 
the comptroller is focusing much of his attention on new 
england where some business leaders say a regional economic 
slowdown is being compounded by their inability to get loans 
small businesses especially feel they are the victims of 
stricter bank lending policies said james hagan president of the 
greater providence chamber of commerce 
they are experiencing a great deal more of difficulty in 
gaining access to capital than they were a year or two ago hagan 
said 
walter mclaughlin president of mclaughlin automotive stores in 
providence said although he had repaid his loans more quickly than 
required he was being hurt by the credit crunch 
now they want to charge me more money he said 
mclaughlin said he was especially perturbed because he 
anticipated the economic slowdown and cut back more than two years 
ago 
why wasnt the occ advising bankers to do the same thing he 
asked clarke if a little guy like me saw it coming why didnt 
you 
clarke said regulators also saw that the economy especially in 
the robust northeast could not sustain the strong growth of the 
mid1980s 
if anyone suggests that the occ has just gotten religion 
thats just plain wrong he said weve been on this problem 
since 1987 
nevertheless politicians are demanding electionyear 
explanations for the regulators tough examinations 
rep claudine schneider rri asked the general accounting 
office on monday to investigate whether federal regulators 
deliberately are trying to stifle lending 
sen claiborne pell dri whom ms schneider is challenging 
in the fall election told a meeting of the rhode island bankers 
association on monday that clarke needs to be made more aware of 
what is happening in rhode island and the rest of new england 
 
clarke said he was familiar with the situation but said lending 
changes likely were just a reflection of the slowing economy 
there is understandably a constriction in the amount of credit 
and there understandably is a tightening of the terms and 
conditions on that credit he said but in the long run he 
added that should be good because in many cases those terms and 
conditions were pretty loose

foreign ministers of the european community 
agreed monday some economic sanctions against south africa could be 
lifted before the government abolishes entirely its racial policy 
of apartheid 
but the ministers of the 12nation trading bloc did not announce 
the immediate easing of any bans imposed against the whiteled 
government 
there was not a majority in favor of the lifting of the 
sanctions said irish foreign minister gerry collins whose 
government has opposed any change in the measures ireland 
currently holds the rotating presidency of the trading bloc 
but he said the ministers did agree that something very 
important is happening in south africa 
in an effort to pressure the government to end its policy of 
racial segregation the community decided in 1986 to halt imports 
of south african iron steel and gold coins and to ban new 
investment in that country it had previously prohibited the sales 
of military equipment 
britain has been pressing the community to ease the sanctions 
because of recent reform measures by south african president fw 
de klerk in february britain unilaterally lifted the ban on new 
investment 
black leader nelson mandela has urged the community to continue 
pressuring de klerks government 
douglas hurd britains foreign secretary said all the 
community nations now have backed a stepbystep strategy under 
which the sanctions could be lifted gradually as progress was made 
on scrapping apartheid 
he said the communitys view was you do not have to wait for 
apartheid to end before you begin to relax the pressures on the 
south african government 
no one argued that the sanctions should remain until the 
complete dismantlement of apartheid agreed a dutch source who 
demanded anonymity 
but hurd said there was no consensus on when the first step 
should be taken 
sources say only ireland and denmark have argued against any 
change in the sanctions 
hurd said some countries want to send a signal of encouragement 
to de klerk perhaps by lifting one of the bans next month 
he said the logical first step would be to relax the 
prohibition on new investment in south africa 
but he said other countries were not so clear about that and 
were not really ready to go that far 
there is a spectrum of opinion on that subject he said 
collins noted that de klerk had lifted the governments state of 
emergency in three of south africas four provinces the decree had 
been in effect for four years 
he said not all the countrys political prisoners have been 
freed from prison although the prospects seem to be good that 
they will be 
the leaders of the trading bloc nations will discuss the issue 
when they gather next week in dublin for their summer summit 
community members are belgium britain west germany ireland 
france the netherlands luxembourg denmark spain portugal 
italy and greece

the supreme court on monday allowed the 
commodity futures trading commission to regulate a type of stock 
market investment called an index participation 
the court without comment left intact an appeals court ruling 
that gives the cftc rather than the securities and exchange 
commission such regulatory power 
an index participation is a contract of indefinite duration 
based on the value of a group of securities the contract resembles 
a basket of stocks because its value is tied to a broad 
stockmarket index such as the standard amp poors 500 index 
the appeals court held that such products come under the cftcs 
supervision if they have any element of a futures contract 
the sec generally regulates securities and the cftc has 
jurisdiction over futures contracts 
the chicagobased 7th us circuit court of appeals said last 
year an index participation has elements of both a security and a 
futures contract but the appeals court said the cftc has exclusive 
jurisdiction over the investment instrument 
the appeals court ruling was challenged by the american stock 
exchange the chicago board options exchange the philadelphia 
stock exchange and the options clearing corp the american and the 
latter organization issues options that are traded on the exchanges 
the president of the philadelphia exchange nicholas a 
giordano called the supreme court action a major step backward 
in the regulation and development of innovative new products 
the real loser here is the individual investor for whom index 
participations were originally designed he said in a statement 
lost in the debate over legislative authority on these products 
was the elemental fact that far fewer brokers are qualified to 
trade futures than are to trade securities 
bob shabazian a spokesman for the american stock exchange said 
the amex had no comment on the courts action but added that the 
exchange supported a bill before congress that would shift 
regulation of all stock index futures from the cftc to the sec 
the bush administration which had urged the supreme court not 
to disturb the 7th circuit court ruling also supports the bill 
but the proposal has received a cool reception on capitol hill 
where some critics say the proposal could hinder passage of other 
measures designed to give the sec more power to curb wall street 
volatility 
the plan to reduce the cftcs power was prompted by rulings by 
the 7th circuit and other courts that give the cftc exclusive 
regulatory authority over any financial product with even the 
slightest aspect of a futures contract 
sec and treasury department officials have complained those 
rulings have led to long legal battles over jurisdiction while 
innovative financial products are being developed or copied in 
overseas markets 
index participations for example are available only on the 
toronto stock exchange and not on any us exchange 
the cases are investment company institute vs sec 891484 
american stock exchange vs chicago mercantile exchange 891502 
philadelphia stock exchange vs chicago mercantile exchange

representatives of ual corps nonunion 
employees met monday with the chief of the union group trying to 
buy the airline company in hopes of avoiding a setback in the 
buyout effort 
the meeting in chicago between gerald greenwald and leaders of 
the noncontract group was their second within a week said stephen 
fraidin a lawyer for the nonunion workers 
it followed a stinging statement sunday by the 26000 
noncontract workers expressing disappointment that the union group 
had not accepted proposed wage concessions and benefit 
modifications under which the noncontract workers could support 
the buyout plan 
the unions do not consider the nonunion groups support 
essential to the proposed 454 billion deal for the parent of 
united airlines but opposition by the noncontract group which 
accounts for more than onethird of uals 71500 employees could 
complicate the unions attempts to raise financing 
the buyout groups contract to buy ual will lapse if financing 
is not obtained by aug 10 if financing is secured the group 
would have until the end of the year to close the deal 
we continue to be hopeful that an agreement can be reached 
fraidin said in a telephone interview 
greenwald formerly vice chairman of chrysler corp agreed 
earlier this month to head the buyout group composed of uniteds 
pilots flight attendants and machinists unions 
if they are successful greenwald would become chairman and 
chief executive of ual which is based near chicago in elk grove 
village 
the noncontract employees said in a news release sunday they 
had developed a package of wage concessions benefit modifications 
and governance agreements during discussions with the united 
employee acquisition corp the entity formed by the unions to 
handle the proposed buyout 
but the acquisition firm has not agreed to the package a news 
release from system roundtable said 
system roundtable is an organization of representatives from the 
different groups of noncontract employees it effectively has 
become the noncontract employees bargaining agent in the buyout 
plan 
if this package is not agreed to very shortly by ueac it does 
not bode well for ueacs ability to make the business judgments 
that it will certainly face in trying to finance the proposed 
leveraged buyout and if that transaction is completed in running 
the airline the release said 
among other things the noncontract workers are looking for 
improved pensions and assurance that the agreement with the unions 
would be binding and not subject to change by a new ual managment 
the noncontract group includes reservations and ticket agents 
professional and technical staffers and management and supervisors 
excluding chairman stephen wolf and other top officers

an agreement among several major banks to loan 
60 million to developer donald trump was in limbo monday as the 
institutions once close to a deal continued haggling over its 
terms 
the deal aimed at helping the developer continue making 
payments to bankers while his 3 billion in bank and bond debts are 
restructured was nearing completion late last week 
but over the weekend the deal fell into disarray as several 
banks jockeyed for a better position and no agreement could be 
reached 
meanwhile the clock ticked away on the grace period for a 
roughly 43 million junk bond payment trump missed on friday the 
payment was due on bonds used to finance the purchase of trumps 
castle one of the developers three atlantic city hotelcasinos 
trump also did not make a 30 million payment due manufacturers 
hanover corp 
a trump spokesman dan klores said talks among the banks and 
the trump organization continued monday but he refused to comment 
further and would not say whether the parties were close to a new 
agreement 
klores also refused to discuss any plans by trump to make the 
missed payment 
spokesmen for the major banks citicorp manufacturers hanover 
chase manhattan corp and bankers trust co either refused to 
comment on the talks or did not return a reporters repeated phone 
calls monday 
but investors who have bid down the price of the trump casino 
bonds on the news about his financial problems did not appear 
unnerved by the latest development 
traders reported the bonds were little changed in extremely 
light volume monday the trump castle bonds were trading at about 
56 per 100 face amount down about 2 from friday in late 
afternoon transactions 
the debt restructuring plan was aimed at helping trump to keep 
making his debt payments while waiting for his assets to rise in 
value so some eventually could be sold 
trumps assets which include hotels and office and apartment 
buildings in new york have fallen in value due to the slumping 
real estate and casino markets the casinos have been affected by 
the slowing atlantic city resort market 
the developer also owns the trump shuttle the northeastern air 
service bought last year from eastern airlines 
the new york times quoting unnamed sources said negotiations 
fell apart over the weekend when the big lenders argued over the 
proposed terms of the loan package reached earlier this month at 
the center of the dispute is how much each bank should contribute 
and the collateral to be used the newspaper said 
banking sources familiar with the talks said last week the four 
major banks agreed to provide an additional 60 million in loans 
and to temporarily suspend interest payments 
the sources had said citicorp and bankers trust would provide 
about twothirds of the new loan 
the negotiations also have raised speculation that bankers want 
more authority over operation of trumps properties 
the wall street journal reported monday that the banks have been 
demanding trump appoint two top executives a chief executive 
officer and a chief financial officer to control the daily 
operations of the trump organization although the payment missed 
on the trump castle bonds placed the developer in technical 
default he had a 10day grace period that started friday during 
which he can still come up with the money 
if trump is unable to make the payment bondholders could claim 
the property or trump castle could be forced into bankruptcy said 
michael mulvaney an analyst with moodys investors service 
however he said it was more likely that further negotiations 
would be held before the situation became that extreme 
if trump went into full default he could run afoul of new 
jersey gaming regulators and could lose his licenses to operate the 
casinos which also include trump plaza and the taj mahal

grain and soybean futures rallied monday on the chicago board of 
trade ending a threeday slide amid buying prompted in part by 
concerns about flood damage to corn and soybean crops 
on other commodity markets oil futures fell steeply pork 
bellies extended their recent sharp losses while livestock futures 
were mixed orange juice futures plunged again copper futures 
rose and precious metals were mixed 
wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher in

oats were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 142 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 11 cents higher with july at 596 a 
bushel 
most of the buying in the corn and soybean markets represented 
profittaking by traders who sold contracts last week establishing 
short positions and bought them back monday at lower prices 
analysts said 
further buying after the mostly lower opening was prompted by 
reports that heavy weekend rains damaged newly planted corn and 
soybeans in lowlying areas of central iowa central illinois and 
southern ohio 
wheat futures were supported by reports that china was bidding 
for 500000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices under a 
previously announced agriculture department offer 
but gerald zusel manager of floor operations at the exchange 
for balfour maclaine corp dismissed the prospective sale of wheat 
to china as expected business no big deal 
after the close the agriculture department released its weekly 
cropcondition reports 
the usda said corn planting was 97 percent complete as of sunday 
compared with the fiveyear average of 99 percent for that date 
soybean planting was 79 percent finished compared with the 
average of 88 percent 
the usda said 18 percent of the winter wheat crop was harvested 
as of sunday compared with the average of 20 percent the usda 
rated 78 percent of the crop fair to good with 15 percent rated in 
excellent condition 
crude oil futures dropped below 16 a barrel for the first time

nearterm delivery tumbled the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a 
pound for the third straight day 
hog futures settled mixed after falling sharply in the two 
previous sessions cattle futures advanced 
the recent drop in pork futures reflects a pronounced decline in 
demand for pork products among retailers whose pork profit margins 
were eroded by last months nearrecordhigh hog prices said 
charles levitt senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
cattle futures rose amid expectations that tuesdays monthly

for just 5 million you can have the new 
business building at the university of iowa named after you 
nobodys been asked to give that much said george daly 
dean of the college of business administration but somebody will 
be 
for 1 million companies or individuals could put their names 
on the computer lab or a 400seat auditorium for 25000 the 
names could go on a study alcove 
the iowa legislature has approved 25 million for the building 
but daly is looking to raise 8 million to 10 million over the 
next three years to ensure the college gets the 34 million 
building it wants 
hes also seeking gifts to buy computers carpet and furniture 
to go in it daly doesnt look at it as selling parts of the 
building

you will daly said 
sales have been brisk for some rooms 
if you want to support an executive mba classroom daly 
said im sorry but youre too late

sen timothy wirth dcolo wrote letters of 
support for the former chairman of the failed silverado thrift when 
the banking executive sought a federal position according to 
copies of the documents 
in a letter dated aug 9 1984 wirth called michael r wise 
extremely able and said he would be an excellent 
appointment to the federal reserve board consumer advisory 
council 
at the time wise was chairman of the silverado banking savings 
and loan association of denver wirth was then a house member from 
colorado but he was not a member of the house banking committee 
in 1985 wise gave wirth a 750 campaign contribution for a 
senate race he won the next year according to the federal election 
commission wise also gave to republicans in 19851986 including a 
total of 1000 to wirths 1986 opponent ken kramer 
the house banking committee is scheduled to hear testimony from 
wise tuesday at its third session investigating silverado the 
collapse of the thrift in december 1988 is expected to cost 
taxpayers 1 billion 
the committee staff said one theme of the hearing will be why 
regulators didnt act to clean up the thrift until december 1988 
even though there were serious problems at the institution in early 
1986 neil bush president bushs son served three years on the 
silverado board of directors 
wirth who is a member of the senate banking committee played 
down the significance of the letter and blamed its release on 
political backbiting 
he said in a statement that the letter was one of hundreds of 
letters that i write each year on behalf of my constituents 
wirth added this is the second time in recent months that 
documents have been leaked to the press with the obvious intent of 
causing political embarrassment to me 
wirth recently cosponsored legislation to create a separate 
justice department division charged with investigating and 
prosecuting illegal activity in the savings and loan industry 
we must send a strong message to those in the financial 
services industry who violate the law that their actions will be 
punished he said last week 
both letters wirth wrote in support of wise were addressed to 
paul volcker then chairman of the board of directors of the 
federal reserve board the letters were obtained by the associated 
press by sources in the house 
in one letter wirth said wise was not only qualified but his 
experience with the thrift industry and housing will add valuable 
perspective to the councils deliberations on consumer and 
community affairs 
the other letter was handwritten by wirth to volcker he is 
extremely able and would be an excellent appointment wirth said 
of wise 
wise was not named to the feds consumer advisory council but 
he was put on the feds thrift institutions advisory council in 
1985 he served on the citizens advisory group for three years 
culminating as the president in 1987 
the group meets four times a year with the feds board of 
governors to discuss developments in the thrift industry

the commerce department said monday it is 
dropping the requirements for export licenses on about 30 billion 
worth of trade in computers telecommunications equipment and other 
high technology goods 
undersecretary dennis kloske said the liberalized requirements 
which will take effect in early july will eliminate the need for 
about 20000 export licenses a year 
the new requirements cover products shipped to us allies in 
the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls the 
17nation group known as cocom polices hightechnology exports in 
an effort to keep militarily sensitive products from being diverted 
to communist countries 
with the toppling of communist governments throughout eastern 
europe the united states has been under heavy pressure from its 
allies to relax export restrictions 
this new regulation is one of the most significant steps to 
relax strategic trade controls with our cocom allies in the 
postwar era kloske said it means giving us businesses an 
even better chance to compete in the international marketplace 
the department said it will continue to require licenses for 
shipments of some sensitive hightechnology items such as 
supercomputers the 20000 export licenses being eliminated are 
among 85000 total export licenses issued each year by the us 
government 
still the relaxed requirement the outcome of three years of 
negotiations will bring the us and its allies closer to a 
licensefree zone within their borders 
the announcement monday will provide for additional streamlining 
of controls beyond changes that were approved at a cocom meeting 
earlier this month in paris the paris meeting dealt with 
restrictions on the types of products which could be sold to former 
communist bloc countries in eastern europe

japan and the united states have a long way to 
go to improve trade relations but some us companies are 
succeeding in the japanese marketplace us trade representative 
carla a hills said monday 
japan is not a completely closed society and the united states 
isnt a collection of uncompetitive failing industries hills 
said at the annual dinner of the japan society 
hills said us exports to japan last year were greater than our 
exports to west germany france and italy combined since 1986 she 
said japan has increased its imports from all nations 64 percent 
however she said the problem is that japan should be doing 
more the united states should be doing more 
our entrepreneurs must be permitted to trade and invest in 
japan as freely as japanese entrepreneurs are able to trade and 
invest here in the united states she said 
the american people will not be satisfied until all american 
businesses can offer their goods and services in japan in free and 
open competition 
she said us companies face obstacles in trying to market 
products in japan in the areas of digital computer networks 
telecommunications auto parts semiconductors and construction 
mrs hills noted that a us company motorola two weeks ago 
beat out seven companies from japan the united states and europe 
in a contest to set standards for japans next generation of 
digital cellular telephones 
unfortunately she said under the rules of the competition 
motorola must publish the design of its winning system and must 
license other companies in japan free of charge the united 
states wants assurances that motorola will be allowed to market its 
system and win a piece of the digital cellular market in japan 
the dinner was given in honor of japans influential film maker 
akira kurosawa who won the 1990 japan society award for increasing 
appreciation and understanding of japanese society and culture 
the japan society is a private nonprofit organization devoted 
to cultural educational and public affairs and improving 
usjapan relations

motorola inc said a federal judge 
indicated monday he would require the company to pull a key 
computer chip off the market until a lawsuit over the chips patent 
is resolved 
but motorola engaged in a legal fight over trade secrets with 
former partner hitachi ltd said it would appeal the decision 
immediately after it is reported by us district judge lucius 
bunton of midland 
in a statement from its schaumburg ill headquarters motorola 
said such a decision might temporarily halt the sale of its 
marketleading 68030 microprocessor which is made in austin 
but motorola said it expected the decision would be stayed on 
appeal and that it is confident it would continue to provide an 
uninterrupted supply of the microprocessor to customers 
buntons order was to be released through the federal district 
clerks office in austin according to his office but the ruling 
was unavailable by the time the office closed monday at 5 pm 
said deputy us district clerk bob williams 
motorola said bunton had disclosed his intent to sign the order 
but had not yet signed it 
tokyobased hitachi filed the motion with bunton to temporarily 
halt the sale of the motorola microprocessor an attorney for 
hitachi in chicago jerry solovy had no immediate comment 
bunton banned the sale of the chip on march 29 and fined both 
companies saying they violated each others patents 
but the prohibition was reversed a day later after motorola 
argued that the chip sales ban could devastate outside computer 
makers that depend on its microprocessors to run their machines 
on monday motorola said bunton indicated he would lift his stay 
on the injunction thereby preventing motorola from selling its 
microprocessor and hitachi from selling its own dubbed the h8532 
tim kellogg spokesman for motorola said the company would file 
its appeal with the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
following buntons decision the court is a special appeals court 
for patents and customs in washington 
we are confident that the cafc will promptly stay the lower 
courts decision pending appeal motorola said in a statement 
it added we are dismayed that judge bunton made this decision 
knowing full well that the two parties have been engaged in earnest 
attempts to settle this matter
