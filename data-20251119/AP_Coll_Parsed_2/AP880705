iowas governor said tuesday he might declare a statewide 
drought emergency and an indiana official warned of possible power 
shortages as generating plants ran low on cooling water 
farmers in the southeast celebrated rain and high prices because 
of the midwests problems and a new heat wave spread water 
restrictions and brushfires into the northeast 
a dispute over diversion of lake michigan water continued to 
cause friction between great lakes and mississippi valley states as 
one of the mississippi rivers shipping channels shrank to a depth 
of only 7 feet 
iowa gov terry branstad said he may issue an emergency 
declaration unless rainfall is widespread this week even though 
federal officials say its too early to assess drought damage 
its early enough to know its a real disaster said 
branstad who is carrying his case for emergency aid to washington 
this week we dont want to see a lot of farm families forced 
back into bankruptcy 
but south carolina farmers were optimistic that record yields 
would combine with higher prices although rain in the southeast 
helped push corn and soybean prices down on the chicago commodities 
exchange 
were looking at another billion dollar year said state 
agriculture commissioner d leslie tindal 
sen dave durenberger rminn said tuesday that the drought 
will save the federal government 53 billion to 1085 billion in 
reduced farm subsidies and the entire amount should be allocated to 
rural america 
the good lord in effect made the money available by 
devastasting a lot of farmers said durenburger who is in a 
heated reelection campaign 
meanwhile a coalition of mainly liberal farm groups called for 
an investigation of the federal governments grain reserve program 
the iowa farm unity coalition said export subsidies created 
profits for grain companies and drained reserves just when they 
were needed by small livestock producers 
whats on the line in this drought is the future of the family 
farm system said coalition spokesman dixon terry 
a spokeswoman for conagra an omaha neb grain company 
dismissed the coalitions claim saying the company tends to 
prosper when farmers do well 
we have seen no big new profits in grain merchandising because 
of the drought said spokeswoman lynn phares 
she said her company tends to do well when farmers do well not 
when times are tough in agriculture 
side effects continued to spread with bug experts saying 
conditions are ideal for grasshoppers and golfers celebrating as 
balls bounced farther down hard dry fairways 
wisconsin gov tommy thompson who fears temporary diversions to 
the mississippi would become permanent and lower lake levels said 
illinois actually wanted lake michigan water to flush out chicagos 
sewage chicago officials said the drought had had no effect on 
sewage 
more than 2000 barges were backed up tuesday by shallow water 
at natchez and greenville miss where a dredge was deepening the 
channel from 7 to 15 feet some towboat operators were working in 
convoy so they could help each other off sandbars 
robert d glazier of the indiana utility regulatory commission 
said a prolonged drought would leave some power plants with less 
cooling water and might create environmental problems if too much 
hot water was pumped back into low streams 
further downriver officials said the tip of a wedge of salt 
water moving up from the gulf of mexico may reach new orleans water 
intakes wednesday they was trying to determine how much salt water 
the processing system can handle 
dry conditions and july fourth fireworks encouraged fires across 
the nation but most were under control tuesday 
hunting restrictions on waterfowl were being considered because 
normal breeding areas had dried out but the same conditions also 
prevented mosquitoes from reproducing fish faced a mixed blessing 
less water to swim in fewer fishermen to dodge 
its not aesthetically pleasing to sit out in the sun and cook 
your brains out said ted crowell of kentuckys department of 
fish and wildlife resources 
dry weather has spread to the northeast in recent weeks causing 
fires in connecticut new york and new jersey and leading to water 
restrictions and warnings to campers in some areas 
we havent had any appreciable rain in the region since june 
17 said capt ray wood a new york state park ranger 
southwestern virginia has begun suffering drought conditions 
and officials concerned that it was spreading scheduled a meeting 
wednesday 
connecticut dairy and poultry farmers were hurting because the 
price of feed grain has risen astronomically according to gabe 
moquin spokesman for the connecticut department of agriculture 
the drought is also posing a threat to the least tern an 
endangered species that nests on sand islands in the mississippi 
said jim czarnezki a biologist with the missouri department of 
conservation 
the islands are now attached to the mainland and the nests 
are being destroyed by land predators he said and now the 
islands also are accessible by allterrain vehicles 
emma yates of lexington ky found an inventive way to comply 
with water restrictions by catching airconditioner drip to water 
her roses 
with the national weather service predicting hot weather and no 
rain in sight truck farmers and gardeners in the northeast were 
trying to cope 
we only got half a dozen rows of cauliflower and those didnt 
have much of a head they were real small some not big enough to 
cut said fred vollmer who arms 80 acres of vegetables north of 
syracuse ny 
and its been a slow summer for george yund who operates a 
lawnmowing business in albany ny 
we cant mow because the grass doesnt grow yund said

a lightningsparked fire in utahs zion national park spread out 
of control to 1100 acres tuesday but rain helped firefighters 
hold the line on a 2000acre forest fire in montana and two other 
major fires in wyoming 
gusty winds spread a third wyoming fire over 400 acres of the 
bridgerteton national forest and forced the evacuation of a 
campground and summer cabins on freemont lake a half mile from the 
blaze 
a fire that scorched 1130 acres in and around the hiawatha 
national forest in michigan was linked to a vehicle exhaust pipe 
hundreds of small grass and brush fires were reported over the 
july 4 weekend some caused by fireworks in various parts of the 
country 
the fourth of july holiday really contributed to the 
problem said capt ray wood regional ranger for the new york 
department of environmental conservation in the hudson valley 
fireworks were touching off fires all over the place last night 
it sounded like every fire alarm in the area was going off 
in california a fireworkscaused blaze that swept over 2200 
acres near yosemite national park was declared contained at dawn 
tuesday 
we have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket 
said mary hale a spokeswoman for the california department of 
forestry 
by monday 384000 had been spent to combat the fire she said 
authorities will try to recover that money said pat kaunert of the 
us forest service 
more than 670 firefighters from federal state and local 
agencies cut trails in the rugged terrain by hand and used 
airplanes to drop fire retardant officials said 
kentuckys division of forestry reported 85 fires burned 1267 
acres in the first four days of july compared to an average of 18 
fires and 165 acres for the whole month spokesman richard green 
said about 40 weekend timber fires were attributed to fireworks 
but dwight barnett a spokesman for the tennessee division of 
forestry said there were 26 wildland fires on the fourth of july 
which burned just 113 acres 
we were very relieved to get through the weekend in such good 
shape he said citing partly the care taken by people playing 
with fireworks 
in utah chief ranger bob andrew said the zion blaze was ignited 
by lightning june 19 it was allowed to burn in a small area but 
on sunday wind to 60 mph spread the flames and the fire nearly 
doubled in size from early tuesday to midday 
no injuries or property damage was reported 
the montana fire burned in the absarokabeartooth wilderness 
area in the southcentral part of the state weekend rain helped 
keep it from spreading outside the wilderness boundary said fire 
information officer jo barnier in billings and a helicopter was 
dropping water on the fire tuesday afternoon 
the fire has been burning since at least june 19 in the custer 
national forest phil jaquith beartooth district ranger for the 
forest said forest service policy is to allow wilderness fires to 
burn unless they threaten trails or structures or are about to 
spread outside the wilderness boundary 
a day after rain beat down the flames of a 1650acre fire in 
the shoshone national forest in northwest wyoming firefighters 
were able to reinforce fire lines around the blaze in the absence 
of strong winds the lightningsparked fire has been burning for 
almost two weeks 
rain monday night also calmed three fires in yellowstone 
national park in the states northwest corner 
park spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said the fan fire in the 
parks northwest corner had held at 1800 acres while two other 
fires in the southern section of the park continued to burn over 
about 90 acres because all three fires are in the backcountry no 
efforts were being made to douse the flames she said 
the evacuation in the bridgerteton forest was a precaution and 
the fire started to die down somewhat as temperatures dropped at 
nighttime forest spokesman fred kingwill said 
the blaze apparently was sparked by fireworks over the holiday 
weekend kingwill said 
in michigan authorities concluded a hot exhaust pipe or exhaust 
particles triggered the upper peninsula fire said mary mumford 
spokeswoman for hiawatha national forest the fire was declared 
under control monday 
firefighters also battled two smaller fires that broke out on 
the upper peninsula tuesday burning 220 acres department of 
natural resources spokesman bob heyd said 
in california about 190 firefighters battled a wildfire that 
burned 350 acres of brush tuesday across steep terrain in an area 
of los padres national forest untouched by fire in 64 years said 
earl clayton of the us forest service 
rising humidity and cooler temperatures were checking the fires 
spread he said there were no injuries in the fire which was 
reported tuesday afternoon

noname plainlabel generic products that 
attracted costconscious consumers a decade ago when inflation was 
surging are all but disappearing from most supermarkets 
with inflation held to moderate levels todays shoppers are 
opting in many instances for store brands which cost a little more 
than generics but are touted as being a step up in quality 
generics definitely have declined very rapidly in popularity 
over the last several years they came on strong in the late 1970s 
when inflation was very high said mike rourke a spokesman for 
the great atlantic and pacific tea co of montvale nj people 
were trading down trying to get their food dollar to go farther 
paul bernish of the cincinnatibased kroger co agreed that 
generics peaked in the years corresponding to high inflation and 
unemployment as the economy has improved their appeal has 
waned 
yet at some markets where generics are still given special 
emphasis they continue to sell well 
mona doyle a philadelphiabased market analyst identified the 
pathmark chain in the northeast as one at which generics continue 
to sell well if the store is willing to stand behind it in a big 
way the consumer is still willing to give it a shot she said 
would generics return to popularity if inflation began taking a 
bigger bite out of the american pocketbook 
oscar katov of the food marketing institute doubts it consumers 
who have gone back to name brands have done so because they prefer 
those products he said where the difference is only a few 
pennies theyre unlikely to return to the generics 
consumers still complain about prices and seek value doyle 
said but with many stores offering doublecoupon values shoppers 
often can buy national brands for competitive prices 
in addition doyle reported in her shopper report newsletter 
for the supermarket industry that the image of storebrand products 
is improving among consumers 
retailers have gotten the message that store brands dont have 
to be an alsoran she said 
pathmarks robert wunderle explains the downfall of generics at 
other stores this way 
typically he said one chain initiated generics and remained 
serious about them while others offered the products on a me 
too basis and havent stuck with them 
like pathmark lucky stores based in dublin calif continues 
to report strong generic sales 
we maintain a low price image so we try to offer consumers a 
selection to choose from we carry generics private labels and 
name brand products said spokeswoman judy decker 
she said lucky stores still have as many as 200 generic items 
although that is down slightly from past years 
pathmark still carries about 350 items under its no frills 
label wunderle said and 53 generics are the no 1 selling items 
in their product categories he said 
for example pathmark sells more 2liter bottles of no frills 
cola than any other cola the same is true for spaghetti grape 
jelly and peanut butter wunderle said 
elsewhere the generics that have remained most popular appear 
to be nonfood items krogers bernish agreed that sales of that 
companys genericpriced cost cutter line remain strongest in 
nonfood items such as paper products 
doyle also noted a change in the overall supermarket product 
lineup in recent years 
in the past national brands have been the top of the line 
followed by store brands and then generics now there is a new top 
layer the socalled boutique offerings of fresh salads 
specialty cheeses deli sections and gourmet items 
a food marketing institute shopper survey in january found that 
only 41 percent considered the presence of generics important in a 
market by contrast 76 percent rated the presence of a deli 
bakery or fresh food area as important 
at one time generics got up to 7 percent of sales but now 
they have waned dramatically said rourke whose company operates 
under such trade names as aampp compass foods kohls and super 
fresh generics are now a very minor part of grocery sales down 
around 2 percent or less 
gary smith of safeway inc based in oakland calif said his 
chain still carries a few generic products but for the most part 
concentrates on its own scotch buy label 
today he said shoppers seem more interested in house brands 
and socalled valueadded brands which offer better quality without 
the marketing costs associated with national brands

when questions of character came up last 
year with revelations about thendemocratic presidential candidates 
gary hart and joseph biden the joke around the massachusetts 
statehouse was that gov michael dukakis planned a major 
disclosure he once bought a suit retail 
nope nope not true replied dukakis sometimes known to be 
tightfisted when an aide told him of the joke ive bought them 
upstairs not in the discount basement but always on sale 
the incident provided one of the few glimpses that anyone gets 
into dukakis life away from politics the democratic nomineetobe 
prefers to keep details of his home life private and his campaign 
office is hardpressed to provide any material on the subject 
the office has a mountain of clippings on dukakis as governor 
it doesnt keep a file on the 54yearold husband and father 
there are a few details that are common knowledge however 
dukakis enjoys growing tomatoes in the front yard of his house and 
every year plants a rose bush for his mother euterpe he likes to 
prepare sunday breakfast and usually washes the dishes and he 
loathes large parties 
mike likes small groups hes in so many big ones at work 
said richard giesser a longtime dukakis friend and political ally 
he enjoys the family he likes to putter he likes to grow 
things its fun just to stand and chat with him while he prunes 
the bushes 
dukakis whose net worth is at least 500000 lives in a duplex 
he bought less than 20 years ago for 25000 drives a 5yearold 
dodge and generally vacations at the homes of friends or family 
on one vacation dukakis took along a book on swedish landuse 
planning 
a nonsmoker and a drinker of white wine only on rare occasions 
dukakis is more likely to take a walk to the ice cream store than 
attend a brookline bash according to giesser 
the presidential candidate is also not much of a television 
watcher or moviegoer although when his son john appeared on 
several episodes of the television series family ties dukakis 
and his wife kitty tuned in 
in his younger days dukakis was a regular jogger but recently 
he has taken up power walking with hand weights a routine he 
keeps up faithfully on the campaign trail he also has played the 
trumpet a few times on the trail to the delight of photographers 
covering the candidate 
ira jackson a former dukakis cabinet member and family friend 
for 25 years said the candidates jogging tomatogrowing cooking 
and cleaning indicates a man ahead of his time 
he was jogging way before it was fashionable he was gardening 
long before it became a yuppie pursuit he moved closer to the city 
at a time when others were moving away hes always cooked 
breakfast and done the dishes long before womens liberation 
dictated that husbands should do this jackson said 
family is a key concern for dukakis who put off secret service 
protection for months to avoid possible disruptions 
hes got a world within his family that hes largely shielded 
from the public that reveals part of michael dukakis that i find 
encouraging jackson said 
before his son john by kittys previous marriage and his 
daughters kara and andrea went off to college dukakis would be 
home for dinner regularly he would frequently return to work 
afterward but was faithful about attending dinner and he expected 
the rest of the family to be there 
john dukakis called the dinners at home a compressed hour of 
political discussion and debate 
if dukakis wins the presidency there will be no first family 
in the white house just dukakis and kitty andrea is interested 
in publishing and kara has three years of college to complete at 
brown university 
john has taken an intense interest in politics running dukakis 
southern campaign and is political director in california 
my father always thought that i would eventually return to 
politics said john who was pursuing an acting career when he 
went to work for sen john kerry dmass he says he is mulling a 
run for political office in brookline 
the story of dukakis private life has its unhappy moments 
dukakis brother stelian attempted suicide in 1951 and was killed 
by a hitandrun driver in 1973 as he rode his bicycle through 
brookline the two brothers relationship was sometimes stormy 
kitty was addicted to diet pills for 26 years a habit she 
kicked and acknowledged publicly last year as dukakis presidential 
campaign got under way 
the campaign has forced the couple to make some emotional 
adjustments according to kitty 
we were very lonely during the first six months of the 
campaign we were often 40 miles away in different hotels 
now she said they are just happy to get some private time 
we dont go to restaurants anymore we dont go to movies even 
if we have the time we had some time at cape cod recently 
we did a lot of walking and just being together

a 25 billionayear child care expansion 
bill is finally beginning to inch its way through the congressional 
maze seven months after it was introduced as the answer to working 
families daycare woes 
but the chances of a child care solution emerging from the 100th 
congress are dimming as the end of the session nears with no sign 
that lawmakers have mustered the political resolve to work out a 
bipartisan approach 
im not certain theres as much interest in passing a bill as 
in creating a political issue said rep tom tauke riowa head 
of a gop task force on child care 
some of the dozens of interest groups backing the 25 billion 
act for better child care or abc are anxious to transform 
electionyear interest and rhetoric into a vetoproof child care 
bill before congress adjourns this fall but others are urging 
lawmakers to resist electionyear compromises 
given the upcoming election tauke said the easiest course 
right now for many members is to coast along respond favorably to 
the groups not offend anyone 
more than 100 child care bills are pending in congress 
reflecting a high level of public concern over daycare 
availability quality and cost 
proposed federal policies range from tax credits for every 
family with young children pushed primarily by conservatives to 
the abc bill championed by democrats and over 100 groups 
representing children women labor medical personnel and others 
the abc bill would make money available only to providers that 
meet minimum national standards on health safety staff size and 
training threequarters of the money would help pay day care 
expenses for families making under 115 percent of a states median 
income the rest would go for capital improvements staff training 
and salaries 
sen orrin hatch rutah the leading conservative proponent of 
new federal action has introduced a bill giving states 250 
million to improve or expand child care 100 million for liability 
pools and 25 million for capital improvements states would have 
to develop and adopt their own standards 
democratic sponsors of the abc bill bucking the american civil 
liberties union are rewriting the bill to make sure daycare 
programs run by religious groups will be eligible for the new 
federal money the changes were sought by conservatives and church 
groups 
but on other points of conflict mandatory national daycare 
standards the relatively highincome families eligible for federal 
assistance the wide age range of the children states are permitted 
to serve well into the teens key democrats have indicated they 
are inclined to stand firm 
im not going to compromise the basic principles of the abc 
bill sen christopher dodd dconn senate sponsor of the 
measure told a group of magazine writers last week 
republicans maintain any child care bill will need bipartisan 
backing whether this year or next and a consensus is within reach 
if only the democrats will deal 
it is frustrating to have to sit and wait until the next 
congress until we get past the next election because we could be 
doing it building a consensus right now said a gop senate aide 
familiar with the proposals 
if a bill had been passed this spring as we had hoped it 
might be we could be appropriating funds right now instead 
were sitting around waiting for people to decide they want a bill 
as opposed to an issue said the aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the house education and labor subcommittee on human resources 
approved the abc bill by voice vote last thursday after rejecting a 
series of republican amendments a full committee work session is 
expected at the end of the month 
subcommittee chairman dale kildee dmich said he would like 
to see the house to pass the abc bill this year but he predicted 
the window of opportunity will still be open next year perhaps 
even wider than it is now 
whoever is president next year will probably provide a better 
climate for child care said kildee you cant fall off the 
floor 
a labor department report concluded there is no daycare crisis 
in america but said there are spot shortages in parts of the 
country president reagan has not formally endorsed any bill and 
education secretary william bennett said in april that 
administration officials were still debating various approaches

three hours of steady rain monday afternoon provided a 
muchneeded edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared 
1650 acres in shoshone national forest in wyoming and rainfall in 
neighboring yellowstone national park calmed three smaller fires 
there 
meanwhile illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze 
that raged across 2200 acres near yosemite national park in 
california over the weekend and firefighters brought a fourday 
fire in michigans hiawatha national forest under control monday 
after the blaze consumed more than 1100 acres 
about a quarterinch of rain helped to keep the lightningcaused 
shoshone fires growth to about 200 acres overnight said fire 
information officer dave damron but the nearly quarterinch of 
rain that fell monday held it to 1650 acres he said 
the rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100man patrol 
planned for monday night 
the forecast for the next two or three days is dry with lower 
humidities and conditions more favorable to burning said damron 
but this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforce 
the lines and complete lines that we dont have yet 
four 20person firefighting crews from colorado utah and south 
dakota were expected to arrive at the fire by monday night putting 
the total number of firefighters at about 430 
crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air 
damron said as four helicopters and three air tankers dropped 
chemical retardant and water on the spreading flames on the ground 
firefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers 
meanwhile at yellowstone park spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said 
that because the three fires there all were in the backcountry no 
firefighters were trying to douse the flames 
because of the fires park officials sunday had closed off some 
areas but vanderbilt said monday the rain had allowed the 
reopening of the areas to hiking and camping 
the cause of the fire near stanislaus national forest near 
yosemite was a bottle rocket said the forests spokeswoman 
mary hale 
firefighters aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity 
reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained monday afternoon and 
hoped to have a line surrounding the fire early tuesday morning 
hale said 
the fire was the largest so far this year in the forest which 
was the scene of huge wildfires last summer 
at least 60 forest service firefighters brought the hiawatha 
forest fire under control monday spokesman dale bluedorn said from 
the national forests headquarters in escanaba mich 
were going to start releasing crews from this fire 
bluedorn said well continue to patrol the area to make sure we 
didnt miss any hot spots 
bluedorn said continued hot dry weather means it could be weeks 
before the fire is extinguished 
it may not be declared out until theres a threeday rain 
he said 
the fourth of july was no holiday for firefighters from national 
forests in wisconsin minnesota idaho and other states who were 
shipped to michigans central upper peninsula to battle the 
hiawatha blaze bluedorn said 
forest service officials meanwhile began assessing damage to 
the 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlands 
burned after the fire broke out friday afternoon bluedorn said 
investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause

us commanders in the persian gulf operate 
under rules of engagement written in the pentagon and designed to 
prevent unexpected attacks on american warships such the one on 
the uss stark last year that killed 37 servicemen 
the no 1 obligation of the commanding officer of a ship or 
units is the protection of his own people said the chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe who argued that the 
uss vincennes did not overreact sunday when it shot down an iranian 
jetliner carrying 290 people 
the imperative for selfdefense combined with the heavy 
traffic in the gulf the introduction there of advanced weapons 
that allow adversaries to kill quickly from a great distance and 
the large number of onagain offagain combatants have produced 
an explosive situation 
pentagon officials refuse to spell out publicly the rules of 
engagement the standing orders under which commanders are 
authorized to open fire 
but the commander of the vincennes capt will c rogers iii is 
convinced he followed them pentagon sources say 
rogers sent a fourpage message up the chain of command to crowe 
saying that if anything he waited too long to fire at the 
airliner and would repeat his decision if faced again with the same 
situation 
events and statements over the past 14 months give a fairly 
detailed outline of when american forces are permitted to shoot 
we can go on what is known as hostile intent that is to say 
if a fellow has a weapons system aimed at us and we have a pretty 
high assurance that he going to shoot at us we can take it out 
the commander of us forces in the region marine corps gen 
george b crist told reporters last thursday 
crowe said us commanders do not have to be shot at before 
responding a condition that was made known in a notice to all 
nations and parties involved in the gulf including commercial air 
carriers 
since the us navy increased its presence in the persian gulf 
in the spring of 1987 and began to escort reflagged kuwaiti 
tankers last summer crowe said we are of course constantly 
surveying and reviewing not only the circumstances under which we 
operate but also the rules of engagement 
until sunday the greatest loss of life in a single incident 
involving the us navy in the gulf came from what was later 
described as a mistaken attack by an iraqi fighter which fired two 
exocet missiles into the unsuspecting cruiser uss stark on may 17 
1987 
the explosions and fire killed 37 american seaman and ended the 
careers of the starks commander capt glenn r brindel and other 
senior officers who were severely criticized and forced to retire 
on sunday one of the starks former officers defended rogers 
saying the vincennes had no choice but to fend off what appeared to 
be a attacking warplane 
if the plane was unfortunate enough to be flying toward the 
vincennes while the vincennes was engaging iranian patrol boats 
im not surprised this kind of thing would happen said basil e 
moncrief 
according to crowe rogers followed what appeared to be 
carefully laid out procedures the sophisticated aegis radar and 
tracking system aboard the vincennes one of the most advanced 
ships in the navy detected an aircraft approaching from iranian 
airspace at 1047 am local time 247 edt officials said 
at the time the vincennes was exchanging fire with three 
iranian boghammer gunboats 43footlong vessels that iran has used 
to attack tankers they said 
one of the most difficult problems is from a radar blip 
particularly from a headon target to identify the type of 
aircraft said crowe 
if the vincennes had a side view of the plane or had more time 
it might not have mistaken the airbus which is 177 feet long for 
an f14 which is 62 feet long pentagon officials said 
the vincennes broadcast three warnings on a civilian emergency 
network which airliners normally monitor and four warnings on a 
frequency normally monitored by warplanes crowe said 
the approaching aircraft appeared to descend and accelerate as 
would a warplane preparing to launch an antiship missile he said 
it was declared hostile four minutes after it was spotted by 
radar three minutes later when the plane was about nine miles 
away the american warship fired 
one complication in the gulf said crist is knowing who is 
going to attack when since a naval battle last april in which the 
united states sank one iranian frigate and knocked another out of 
action iran has been most circumspect 
theyve been very careful not to antagonize us he said 
we had an iranian f4 come out the other day and our ships 
challenged him and he said im on my way to engage an iraqi

investigators in the pentagon bribery probe 
are looking closely at how the navy awarded contracts for its aegis 
shipdefense system the type used by the uss vincennes to shoot 
down an iranian passenger jet 
pentagon officials now find themselves defending the systems 
capabilities in addition to facing questions about the role of 
private consultants in determining which defense contractors won 
the multibilliondollar aegis production contracts 
the vincennes relied on its aegis nerve system to track and 
destroy an incoming aircraft on sunday during hostilities with 
iran the aircraft mistaken for an iranian f14 attack plane 
turned out to be an iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard 
aegis named for the shield of the greek god zeus combines 
computers radar and weapons in a protective net around navy ships 
like the vincennes 
reps jim florio dnj and h james saxton rnj have 
called on the defense department to determine whether the aegis 
contracts are tainted by disclosures in the ongoing pentagon 
purchasing investigation 
a chief target of the bribery probe is melvyn paisley a former 
assistant navy secretary who oversaw division of the aegis work 
paisley left the navy in 1987 to become a consultant to among 
others a company that got aegis work paisley though his 
attorney has denied any wrongdoing 
aegis systems had been built for 15 years at rcas moorestown 
nj division when in 1985 the navy sought production changes 
despite the systems thenstellar reputation 
unisys corp of detroit eventually was awarded a contract to 
begin work on a key radar component 
unisys spokesman william beckham confirmed that paisley was 
hired by the company as a consultant after he left the navy but 
said he did not offer advice directly on aegis 
beckham said another unisys consultant william galvin 
monitored the aegis proposals 
investigators reportedly are looking at links between paisley 
and galvin and federal records show that paisleys wife had a 
50000 ownership share in a company associated with galvin 
thennavy secretary john lehman had a simple explanation for his 
order to secondsource some of the work congress had told him 
to do so congress had required second sources on military work in 
an effort to spark competition 
i have yet to meet a second source i didnt like lehman 
scribbled at the bottom of a may 1985 letter defending the shift 
but despite the goal of increasing competition the navy 
announced that it would transfer the radar work without competitive 
bidding to the sperry corp of great neck ny now part of 
unisys 
new jersey legislators rallied to protect some 600 jobs at rca 
and as many as 5000 related positions saxton wrote to colleagues 
at the time that rca has been on time below cost and has 
exceeded all performance goals 
the new jersey group suspected that rep joseph addabbo dny 
chairman of the house defense appropriations subcommittee was 
behind the plans trying to get the aegis work for his home state 
addabbo died in 1986 
they clearly muscled their way in through joe addabbo said 
rep jim courter rnj 
as originally proposed the aegis competition was to include 
dividing both the work on developing and making the systems nearly 
900 major components as well as the delicate task of putting the 
parts together 
aegis 6 million parts and 4900 cables are weaved together at 
rcas 141 million cruiser of the cornfields a mock warship in 
a rural area along the new jersey turnpike 
the new jersey delegation eventually collected enough 
congressional muscle to fend off part of the navys plans lehmans 
successor james webb announced the aegis assembly work would 
remain at rca 
but plans to split work on aegis components continued paisley 
in june 1986 ordered subordinates to implement the changes within 
four months 
the trade journal defense news reported monday that rca 
executives complained bitterly to paisley and that he told them 
they could expect a quidproquo share of a separate 24 billion 
submarine electronics system 
defense news quoted an rca spokesman and paisleys lawyer as 
denying the report which it attributed to sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
in october 1987 seven months after paisley had left the navy 
the service informed the armed services panel that unisys now one 
of paisleys clients was the sole bidder to compete with rca 
in january 1988 house armed services committee chairman les 
aspin withdrew his objections to splitting the aegis component work 
between rca and unisys with that congressional resistance 
crumbled

soviet inspectors prepared to head home after completing their

nuclear arms treaty 
the head of a soviet team that inspected a defense plant in san 
diego hailed the cooperative effort as unprecedented and 
congratulated americans celebrating the anniversary of their 
countrys independence 
the soviets sent teams to make baseline inspections at five 
missile storage sites in four states over the fourth of july 
weekend while soviet inspectors were in california colorado utah 
and arizona american teams visited soviet missile facilities in 
warsaw pact nations for the onsite inpections agency under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the inspections are designed to verify the exact number of 
missiles and related components to be destroyed within the next 
three years 
vyacheslav kharlamov led a 10member soviet team that completed 
a grueling 24hour inspection monday of san diegos general 
dynamics plant which until last december made cruise missile 
launchers 
together with representatives of the osia and with cooperation 
of representatives of the plant the first unprecedented action was 
fulfilled in verification of the compliance with the obligation 
under the treaty between the ussr and the us kharlamov said 
through an interpreter we will take note of the us authorities 
to ensure the fulfillment of the inspection according to the 
provisions of the inf treaty 
after reviewing their findings with a 10member group of 
americans that escorted them the soviets boarded an air force 
c141 transport plane and departed for travis air force base near 
san francisco 
today on the national day of your country we go back to san 
francisco and after a short rest we will return to moscow 
kharlamov said we like to extend our congratulations on your 
national day 
in pueblo colo 10 soviet inspectors inventoried us pershing 
missiles at an army depot 
depot spokeswoman mary wilson said the soviets were very 
friendly but said she couldnt comment on their observations or 
the inspection itself 
wilson said the pueblo site was the only one subject to 
unlimited inspection by the soviets under the pact implemented this 
year 
she said hightechnology machines and weapons at the pueblo 
depot remained under wraps but the soviet team was entitled to 
look under the covers to see if they were hiding missile parts 
at dugway proving ground a remote army installation in the 
western utah desert 10 soviet treaty inspectors completed their 
visit wrote reports and changed clothes before departing for 
travis air force base monday said spokeswoman kathy whittaker 
under the treaty the soviets could return to san francisco or 
move to another site open to inspection they were not required to 
say what they would do before boarding the departure aircraft 
from our end of it we were able to provide them with the 
opportunity to see what they wanted to and inspect all inspectable 
areas on the post whittaker said 
soviet teams departed monday after concluding inspections of two 
arizona military bases facilities for groundlaunched cruise 
missiles 
an air force transport picked up one 10man team of soviets at 
the armys fort huachuca in sierra vista then picked up another 
8member soviet team at davismonthan air force base in tucson 
some 70 soviet inspectors arrived at travis late friday before 
fanning out to sites eligible for inspections under the treaty 
a group of 22 inspectors who headed to the hercules aerospace 
co missile plant in magna utah will be the only permanently 
based soviets and can stay up to 13 years under the treaty the 
other 48 inspectors were to leave at midday tuesday

as washington scandals go the furor of the 
summer of 1890 was small potatoes or perhaps small oats 
the scandal broke in the aftermath of the attempt by sen isham 
green harris a tennessee democrat to create a new position on the 
senate staff superintendent of the senate stables 
as senate republican leader bob dole of kansas told the story 
last week harriss move was successfully blocked by sen eugene 
hale a maine republican 
hale contended the senate stables already had three employees 
for each horse and did not need another 
but that did not end the matter dole told the senate 
an enterprising newspaper reporter decided to investigate 
inspecting the stables the reporter found nine official senate 
horses 
five were used to pull senate wagons 
four were for the use of the socalled riding pages who carried 
senators messages around capitol hill 
but those were not the only horses in the senate stables the 
stables boarded 13 other equines as well 
six were the personal steeds of us senators 
two belonged to members of the house of representatives 
five were owned by various congressional officials 
membership in the senate stables it turned out had its 
benefits 
the reporter acknowledged that the owners of the nonsenate 
horses did pay 12 a month for their feed 
but he discovered there was no charge for the other 
necessities of a horses life 
the brushes currycombs cloths and labor are all taken care 
of on the senate payroll he declared 
the reporter did a cost survey of the capitals public stables 
and discovered that a nonsenatorial citizen would pay an average 
20 a month for all the currying and pampering given to horses 
boarded in the senate stables 
it is perfectly plain the reporter wrote that the man 
who is privileged to keep his horses in this stable can save the 
price of a pretty good horse say 100 in a year 
the investigation continued and the reporter dug out the names 
of the officeholders boarding personal horses in the senate 
stables partially at public expense 
leading the list was a familiar name sen isham harris who 
had proposed appointing a superintendent to manage the senate 
stables in the first place 
ninety eight years later the senate has neither horses nor a 
stable to keep them in 
but it is not without transportation 
a rank of shiny black latemodel executive automobiles is 
parked each day near the foot of the senate steps ready to whisk 
the current set of senators around the capital city

an explosion of fireworks on the ground 
monday night started several small fires at a downtown park on lake 
superior forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people 
attending a fourth of july display 
one spectator was burned slightly and was taken to a hospital 
said police officer kevin mckenna 
everything went flying any which way the officer said 
the incident occurred about 10 pm about onethird of the way 
through the show mckenna said 
the explosion started several small fires at bayfront park on 
lake superior a nearby warehouse being used by a construction 
company also caught fire mckenna said 
a charge failed to lift one of the fireworks out of its 
canister setting off a chan reaction that blew up 20 minutes worth 
of fireworks within two minutes said guy gustafson of arrowhead

removing power plant and factory emissions 
causing the greenhouse effect that is warming the earth is 
technically possible but it could double the production cost of 
electricity in some areas according to one study 
coal accounts for a large share of the greenhouse warming 
because it forms carbon dioxide when burned all fossil fuels 
containing carbon do coal more than others 
carbon dioxide in turn accounts for half of the manmade gases 
that scientists say have warmed the earth by one degree fahrenheit 
over the past century will make 1988 the warmest year on record 
and could add as much as another eight degrees by late in the next 
century such a development would make droughts and heat waves much 
more frequent in the american midwest and south 
during a june 23 senate energy committee hearing a panel of 
scientists reported that the warming has started the report 
especially disturbed coalstate lawmakers such as sen wendell 
ford dky who said im trying to find a way to use a resource 
we have 
coal accounts for 80 percent of the fossil fuel used to generate 
electricity in the united states that generation accounts for 30 
percent of the nations carbon dioxide emissions and the united 
states in turn contributes about 30 percent of world carbon dioxide 
no clean burning technology can avoid the formation of 
carbon dioxide from fossil fuels burning is simply the reaction of 
carbon with oxygen that transforms both to carbon dioxide 
but carbon dioxide can be scrubbed from smokestacks where 
it forms about 9 percent to 13 percent of gases from a fossilfuel 
power plant 
the higher the concentration the easier the scrubbing a fact 
that washington consultant leon green jr made use of in proposing 
in general terms using heat from nuclear fuel to gassify coal and 
collect carbon dioxide 
the easily recovered co2 could be used in greenhouses to 
enhance crop growth and to make fertilizers according to a 
proposal green sketched at the february meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science however green could 
not yet say whether his carbon dioxide recovery system would be 
feasible 
one system that has been analyzed more extensively was developed 
by chemical engineers hsing c cheng and meyer steinberg of the 
energy departments brookhaven ny national laboratory they 
designed a system using a solvent to dissolve 90 percent of the 
carbon dioxide out of a plants exhaust gases 
their plan calls for use of the plants waste heat energy to 
remove carbon dioxide from the solvent and liquify it 
cheng and steinberg envisioned a network of pipelines to carry 
liquid carbon dioxide from power plants to the ocean or to 
abandoned oil and gas wells and salt caverns in the ocean the 
liquid would either rest on the ocean floor or be dissolved in the 
water depending on the system selected in some areas the oil 
industry might buy the carbon dioxide to inject into oil fields to 
keep up well pressures 
power required to run the system would amount to 11 percent to 
16 percent of the generating capacity of the nation but the system 
could reduce the annual amount of carbon dioxide added to the 
atmosphere worldwide by 10 percent if the united states used it and 
30 percent if all nations did 
however the cost is significant when evaluated in light 
of its benefit cheng and steinberg said in a 1986 paper 
overall the co2 control system could essentially increase the 
capital investment of power plants by 70 percent to 150 percent 
and increase the production cost of electricity by 56 percent to 
100 percent depending on the location of the plant 
using 1980 data cheng and steinberg calculated that the control 
system could cost 284 billion dollars which could be 330 
billion at 1987 prices 
the percentages would not change very much cheng said in a 
telephone interview 
this seems not feasible in the light of energy efficiencies 
that are possible cheng said i still think the best way to 
reduce the greenhouse effect is through energy efficiencies though 
its very difficult to single out which economic sector should be 
tackled first 
although energy efficiency has been improving by 25 percent per 
year for more than a decade the united states still takes twice as 
much energy to produce a dollars worth of economic activity as 
germany and japan do

us missions and overseas companies tightened security and 
toned down fourth of july celebrations in response to the downing 
of an iranian jetliner by a us warship london airport 
authorities removed american flags 
governments around the world deplored the deaths of the 290 
people who were aboard the plane and said the disaster should 
intensify efforts to end to the 8yearold iraniraq war 
the united states said us navy officers thought the iran air 
jetliner was a fighter that ignored seven warnings when they shot 
it down sunday during a skirmish in the persian gulf 
iran called for allout war in retaliation 
the united states government believes that the risk of iranian 
terrorist actions directed against us diplomatic military and 
commercial facilities as well as us airlines and merchant ships 
has increased appreciably said a statement telexed from the us 
embassy in brussels to american firms around belgium 
it is further believed that these actions will be deliberately 
designed to cause us fatalities or spectacular destructions 
of us official or commercial facilities 
at heathrow airport outside london police armed with submachine 
guns patrolled the terminals baggage loaded onto american airlines 
came under close scrutiny because of fears of iranian reprisals 
authorities removed american flags put up in honor of the fourth 
of july in a terminal that services most us flights an airport 
statement said it was a mark of respect for those who died 
in stockholm sweden additional guards were deployed at arlanda 
airport near the service counters of us air carriers 
americans in the gulf region observed independence day by going 
to work as usual except for embassy staffs who had the day off 
the 20000 us citizens in the gulf arab states were advised to 
maintain low profiles and navy officials canceled leaves and shore 
passes for us servicemen as a precaution against possible 
terrorist acts 
in jutland denmark the annual americandanish friendship 
festival on independence day drew only 9000 people compared to 
double that number in previous years 
gennady gerasimov spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry 
said the attack shows american naval officers were not very 
competent or to use an american phrase triggerhappy 
he said the incident proved that american actions in the region 
were dangerous and demanded us naval forces must immediately 
leave the waters of the persian gulf 
on sept 1 1983 soviet fighters shot down a korean jetliner 
and all 269 people aboard were killed gerasimov said the korean 
plane was over a strategically sensitive area of the soviet far 
east while the iranian jet was flying only over its own territory 
and territorial waters 
the soviet union denounces sundays attack but will not follow 
the bad example of wild american criticism after the 1983 
event he said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel expressed sorrow about 
the loss of life but said the incident is one of the side effects 
of hostile actions there is no room for condemning anyone 
zeev schiff a respected israeli military analyst said on 
israel radio that the incident should raise questions among the 
americans about their criticism of others in similar 
circumstances 
the british government supported the us explanation for the 
attack but conservative lawmaker robert adley called the americans 
triggerhappy 
they are burdened with this massive firepower but they still 
have not learned the lessons of the vietnam war he said 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua accused the reagan 
administration of committing a true genocide 
this crime joins those committed against the nicaraguan 
people evidence of the total scorn for international law and 
betrayal of the ideals of those who fought and died for the 
independence of the united states ortega said 
vatican radio called it an absurd tragedy in which innocent 
people paid the price of a neverending conflict that has already 
sowed so much death and destruction the possibility of tragic 
errors that add themselves to the destructive iniquities of war 
is particulary worrisome 
japan which gets slightly more than half its oil from the 
persian gulf appealed for an early and peaceful end to the war 
our country considers it extremely regrettable that 
valuable lives were lost and express our heartfelt condolences to 
the victims and their bereaved family members government 
spokesman keizo obuchi said 
japan air lines said its twiceweekly flight from tokyo to 
athens greece would alter its route over the gulf to avoid the 
area where the shooting took place 
in hong kong cathay pacific airways said the daily hong kong to 
london flight also would alter its route over the gulf

for the first time in 2 years a 
space shuttle is on a launch pad here and engineers and 
technicians are grooming it for an engine test crucial to the 
ships return to space in early september 
preparations for the engine firing began shortly after discovery 
reached the launch pad monday and workers had hooked up electrical 
environmental control and other connections 
the july 24 test is to subject the three main liquid fuel 
engines to a 194second ignition while discovery is bolted firmly 
on its launch mounts the exercise will check scores of engine 
modifications and provide the launch team with countdown practice 
discovery rolled to launch pad 39b on a fourth of july filled 
with emotional outpourings from officials thousands of space 
workers and one of the astronauts who will fly on the first shuttle 
mission since the challenger disaster in january 1986 
america the dream is still alive astronaut dave hilmers 
told about 2000 kennedy space center workers who cheered as the 
spaceship moved out of an assembly hangar to start the 42mile 
trip to the pad 
its been a long 2 years since challenger and im very 
pleased with the progress weve made during that time center 
director forrest s mccartney told the crowd its been a team 
effort this is a proud day 
mccartney presented hilmers with a book containing the 
signatures of more than 15000 center personnel who have labored to 
return the shuttle to flight the book will be carried into space 
aboard discovery 
shortly after the shuttle reached the launch pad center gates 
were opened to permit space workers to bring their families out on 
the holiday for a drive by the launch pad and a close look 
more than 4000 cars with an average of four people in each 
passed through creating a huge traffic jam with lines stretching 
to 18 miles at times for some the drive to the pad took nearly 
two hours but no one seemed to mind once they saw the shuttle 
standing majestically in the sunlight 
wonderful its great were back in business were 
among the comments as drivers slowed to allow their passengers to 
take photographs 
the launchpad firing of discoverys engines is the next major 
milestone along the route to orbit 
the next day july 25 the shuttles other propulsion system 
the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket will undergo its final 
preflight test at the morton thiokol plant in utah 
both tests are considered essential to the shuttles return to 
space 
a faulty booster rocket joint led to the explosion of challenger 
and loss of its seven crew members on jan 28 1986 
the move to the launch pad ends several months of frustration 
for the national aeronautics and space administrations shuttle 
program four launch dates starting with last february have been 
set and then postponed with the space agency announcing the latest 
delay last week a slip from late august to early september 
astronaut rick hauck will command an allveteran crew of shuttle 
fliers on the fourday discovery mission whose main tasks will be 
deployment of a communications satellite and checking more than 200 
orbiter modifications the other crew members are pilot dick covey 
and mission specialists mike lounge george nelson and hilmers

vice president george bush calls the navys 
destruction of an iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard an 
unhappy incident but says it wont lead to changes in us 
policy 
life goes on bush said monday our mission goes on and 
the world keeps turning 
bush said a more thorough study of the tragedy is needed before 
deciding if us reparations to families of the deceased will be 
offered 
speaking with reporters on air force ii as he returned from july 
4th campaign appearances in three midwestern cities bush voiced 
concern about possible iranian retaliation 
i dont know what theyll do he said but we cant be 
deterred by threats 
asked whether he was concerned that rising antiamerican 
sentiment in the area over the incident might further endanger 
hostages held in lebanon bush said i worry about the hostages 
being held in the first place 
those people took revenge on society by taking the hostages in 
the first places he said 
the vice president said he planned to meet today with president 
reagan on the episode he had no public appearances scheduled 
at an independence day celebration on the banks of the 
mississippi river in st louis on monday bush was applauded when 
he said that the captain of the navy warship vincennes did what 
he had to do 
later during an air show as military jets swooped overhead 
bush told reporters that he felt the people who applauded were 
mainly displaying patriotism 
i think people respond to that they understand that and 
theyre right as a matter of fact he said 
its just an unhappy incident we expressed our proper 
regrets it appears that the captain acted appropriately were 
not going to change our policy because of this unfortunate 
incident 
on the issue of possible financial compensation to families of 
the dead bush said i dont know lets look into the whole 
thing understand it more fully before reaching any conclusions of 
that nature 
he told a festival crowd in elmwood park ill a chicago 
suburb that i probably speak for all when i say we regret the 
loss of innocent life in the gulf 
but as i listen to the description of the chief of naval 
operations about what happened there i can identify with the 
dilemma faced by the captain of the uss vincennes 
bush said the captain did not want to put his crew more in 
harms way he gave seven times warning and its regrettable that 
life was lost but he was doing what he had to do

the governing nationalist party convenes a 
crucial congress thursday that is expected to elevate a new 
generation of leaders and determine the pace for more social and 
political liberalization 
the 13th party congress is seen as a watershed in taiwans 
political development government initiative has virtually halted 
pending its outcome 
everything has stopped except the pollution and the traffic 
leading political journalist antonio chiang joked in a recent 
interview 
the congress will differ greatly from past gatherings dominated 
by strongmen from the chiang kaishek family whose unquestioned 
supremacy in the nationalist party dates back six decades 
the last congress seven years ago was run by the late 
president chiang chingkuo eldest son of the world war ii leader 
though chiang chingkuo died in january his legacy will be very 
much alive at the congress as delegates consider how fast and how 
far to go with the political and social change he began 
in his final years chiang ended 38 years of martial law 
allowed the formation of opposition parties and opened the door to 
unofficial contact with archenemy china many media taboos that 
prevented critical reporting of government leaders and policies 
also have disappeared 
taiwanese have staged more than 1500 demonstrations in the past 
year most of them peaceful to protest a wide variety of 
government policies the number of protests has declined however 
since police cracked down on a may 20 riot and detained nearly 100 
people 
some observers believe the protests indicate that expectations 
for change have increased and social unrest could result if the 
nationalists do not maintain a quick pace of liberalization 
the opposition democratic progressive party wants to scrap the 
political system that ensures the legislature and electoral college 
remain controlled by aging nationalists who do not face elections 
the government has promised to open more seats to elections but 
has yet to announce details 
many taiwanese also want changes in economic and financial 
policies they claim favor big business 
the congress is expected to retire some oldguard party 
conservatives from the nationalist leadership clique that fled to 
taiwan in 1949 with chiang kaishek after losing a civil war to the 
communists on the chinese mainland 
the whole power structure will be much younger predicted 
chang chungtung professor of history at the national taiwan 
university 
elderly nationalists from the chinese mainland still dominate 
the partys 31member policymaking central standing committee but 
as many as half are expected to step down 
native taiwanese who comprise about 85 percent of the islands 
nearly 20 million people hold about onethird of committee seats 
but that proportion should increase 
the new committee could determine how much leeway president lee 
tenghui the first taiwanborn leader of the nationalist 
government will have to push forward his own programs for change 
lee 65 who was named acting party chairman two weeks after 
chiangs death is expected to be confirmed chairman at the 
congress 
the 24 millionmember nationalist party or kuomintang was 
founded on mainland china in 1894 by sun yatsen regarded as the 
father of modern china for his role in toppling the manchu qing 
dynasty in 1911 
power in the kuomintang which in structure resembles the 
chinese communist party traditionally has flowed from the top 
down the party was dominated first by sun then by chiang kaishek 
and most recently by chiang chingkuo 
this years party congress not only lacks a strongman 
personality but for the first time will include delegates not 
handpicked by nationalist officials 
premier yu kuohwa and other top government officials for the 
first time in their careers have had to campaign across the island 
to drum up support for their toplevel positions 
in recent newspaper interviews yu vowed to push for 
privatization of public banks and some staterun companies and 
promised to recruit younger cabinet members 
expected to play a vocal role at the congress are the socalled 
young turk legislators who won elections held in 1986 for the 
legislative yuan taiwans lawmaking body 
forty of the taiwanelected lawmakers issued a statement june 24 
urging the party to map out a positive and forwardlooking 
policy toward china and to adopt a realistic attitude to promote 
more exchanges and contacts 
they demanded the 1209 voting congress delegates decide the 
partys china policy instead of rubberstamping a resolution handed 
down by the central standing committee

alley said 
ours are no more than big dogs alley said recently 
everyone says dogs are mans best friend a donkey would have to 
be second 
they like to be loved mrs alley said they drink iced 
tea we bring them in the house and they mind real good theyre 
jealous if one gets more love than the other one weve had more 
company than weve ever had in our life people come from all over 
to make their picture 
they just care so much for you theyll put their head in your 
lap like a dog mrs alley said 
the retired church hill couple was looking for a barnyard pet 
last year after they got out of the cattle business and leased most 
of their 64acre farm they decided on a burro and began to look 
for one when they contacted a west virginia woman who breeds the 
miniature donkeys 
the tidbit donkeys are a big hit with the neighbors and make 
regular appearances in parades dressed in costumes the couple also 
takes them to nursing homes and schools including a school for the 
blind 
one blind boy just fell in love alley said he walked

here are thumbnail sketches of figures in the 
burgeoning probe into allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military personnel bribed 
pentagon officials for contracting details to help win lucrative 
military contracts 
</TEXT>

paisley is described as a major target in the probe and the 
highestranking former pentagon official implicated he is a former 
boeing corp executive who was assistant secretary of the navy for 
research engineering and systems before leaving the government in 
1987 to become a consultant to major defense contractors 
at the pentagon paisley fought hard for increases in the navy 
budget that would help build the fleet to 600 ships working 
closely with navy secretary john lehman jr paisley supervised 
procurement specializing in acquisition of aircraft and combat

a new government study shows that home equity 
loans are enjoying a boom in popularity because of changes in the 
tax law with more than 3 million homeowners choosing the loans 
over second mortgages 
the federal reserve conducting its first comprehensive look at 
the new consumer credit lines found that threefourths of all 
existing loans were taken out in the past two years and that they 
now account for more than 75 billion in total consumer debt 
in fact the fed found that the most prevalent use of the home 
equity loans reported by 53 percent of all borrowers surveyed was 
to pay off other debt mainly credit card debt or auto loans 
the fed survey found that the average interest charged on a home 
equity loan in 1987 was 102 percent that compared to an average 
of 179 percent interest on credit card debt 142 percent for a 
24month personal loan and 105 percent average interest on a 
48month new car loan 
while second mortgages are extended for a specified period of 
time and require repayment of principal and interest in equal 
monthly installments home equity accounts allow the borrower 
flexibility in the size and timing of payments

if drought keeps driving feed costs up and cow 
prices down dairy farmers may see earnings reduced by as much as 
70 percent by 1989 according to a study by the national milk 
producers federation 
jim barr chief executive officer of the federation said the 
rising costs of grain concentrates are at the heart of the grim 
outlook 
at current milk and feed prices a 15 percent increase in feed 
costs equates to an effective reduction to the farmer of 50 cents 
for each 100 pounds of milk marketed he said in a report sent to 
members this week 
spokeswoman doni dondero said the federations analysts computed 
that there is a potential for a drop in the net cash income of 
dairy producers of between 50 percent and 70 percent 
for example she said in a telephone interview if prices of 
dairy concentrates rise 30 percent forage costs go up 10 percent 
and the market prices of culled cows sent to slaughter decline by 
15 percent net cash income could be around 133 per each 100 
pounds of milk sold 
dondero said the figures were projected for a 12month period 
july through june 1989 income includes proceeds from the sale of 
animals culled from dairy herds in addition to milk marketed 
before the drought send feed costs higher the agriculture 
department reported its price index for feed grains and hay rose 20 
percent last month the federation had expected dairy net cash 
income to average 251 per hundredweight of milk sold this year 
still another factor will be government actions to reduce milk 
price supports again next year dondero said 
if feed costs keep rising market prices of culled cows keep 
dropping and the current support of 1060 per hundredweight is 
reduced further on jan 1 1989 by 50 cents net cash income of 
producers could fall to as low as 99 cents per hundredweight 
dondero said 
under 1985 farm law the usda is required to reduce milk price 
supports when government purchases are expected to rise above 5 
billion pounds of milk equivalent during the year 
milk price supports have undergone a succession of cuts since 
rising to a peak of 1310 per hundredweight in 1983 the 
reductions were undertaken to help discourage surplus production 
and to whittle down federal costs 
as it looks now to usda economists dairy purchases will exceed 
the 5 billion pounds set by law as the trigger for further cuts in 
the support 
some dairy state members of congress have urged agriculture 
secretary richard e lyng to forestall the next reduction because 
of the hardship imposed by the drought lyng however has said the 
law gives him no choice 
but last week rep sherwood boehlert rny said the drought 
and rising feed costs have prompted a reassessment of the 
situation regarding another 50cent cut in milk supports next 
year 
boehlert also said that rep charles stenholm dtexas chairman 
of the house agriculture subcommittee on dairy livestock and 
poultry had predicted its 99 percent sure that the jan 1 
1989 reduction will not take place 
joined by several colleagues including rep jim jeffords 
rvt boehlert introduced a bill last week giving the secretary of 
agriculture the authority to halt the jan 1 cut in milk supports 
the bill also would give usda the authority to increase supports 
by 50 cents per hundredweight for each 15 percent increase in feed 
costs 
meanwhile dairy farmers began stepping up production again this 
year at least before the drought became rampant and forced feed 
costs up based on the earlier indications usda economist figured 
1988 milk output would rise 2 percent to 3 percent from last years 
1425 billion pounds 
milk output decline last year from the 1986 record level of 
1434 billion pounds as producers cut back herds under the usdas 
dairy termination program or wholeherd buyout designed to trim 
surplus production

president miguel de la madrid promised 
wednesdays general elections will be fraudfree while the leading 
opposition presidential candidate said politics were behind the 
weekend killings of two of his aides 
we mexicans are committed to have a clean legal and peaceful 
election on wednesday de la madrid said 
today i confirm to you it is a commitment of the government of 
the republic to comply strictly with the law there will be respect 
for the will expressed in the ballot boxes he said during a 
brief televised address to the nation monday night 
francisco javier ovando 45 the national coordinator and a 
congressional candidate of the leftist national democratic front 
coalition and roman gil heraldez a 28yearold aide were shot to 
death saturday night in a car in downtown mexico city 
i feel rage over these political crimes committed by 
professionals groups of assassins led by reactionaries said 
cuauhtemoc cardenas the fronts presidential candidate 
he did not elaborate on who he thought was responsible 
polls indicate cardenas could finish second on wednesday to 
carlos salinas de gortari candidate of the governing institutional 
revolutionary party or pri the pri has not lost a presidential 
election since its creation in 1929 
ovando and gil helped create the effective suffrage assembly a 
citizens watchdog group to expose any fraud in the elections 
ovando also served as cardenas private secretary 
a lengthy statement issued by the attorney general monday night 
said ovando and gil died instantly from 22caliber bullets fired 
at pointblank range ovando with four bullets in the head and gil 
with one in the temple 
it offered no leads or a possible motive and said there were no 
witnesses to the slayings reported to police by an anonymous 
caller at 1130 pm saturday 
luis sanchez aguilar a senior official of both the front and 
the watchdog group charged the killings were politically motivated 
he said ovando was carrying confidential documents about the 
opposition effort to detect election fraud at the time he was 
killed the documents were not found inside the car sanchez 
aguilar said 
cardenas has appointed a front official to participate in the 
police investigation the attorney generals statement said 
and in an open letter he urged de la madrid and the mexico 
city attorney general to bring those responsible to swift justice 
it would be very serious if the government and official 
elements have answered the democratic actions of the opposition 
with terrorism and illegality said the letter published in 
mondays editions of the newspaper la jornada 
de la madrid did not mention the shootings in his address but 
expressed his recognition and respect to all the parties and 
candidates that have competed in this electoral contest 
salinas de gortari expressed the most vigorous condemnation 
of the slayings and called on authorities to give the greatest 
speed to clarify this lamentable deed in a statement released 
late monday night 
the pris national executive committee also condemned the 
shootings in a statement released monday night it urged party 
activists not to oppose provocations stemming from the incident 
and at all times to avail themselves of the resources of the 
law 
cardenas led a reform movement within the pri before leaving the 
party last year to head his own presidential candidacy with the 
endorsement of the socialist party this spring the national 
democratic front has mounted the strongest challenge yet to the 
pris hold on the presidency

the fourth of july was even quieter that 
usual among americans in the persian gulf this year because of the 
us attack on an iranian jetliner 
those who had not gone on vacation to escape the searing heat 
observed independence day by going to work as usual except for 
embassy staffs who had the day off 
the missile cruiser uss vincennes shot down the iran air airbus 
on sunday after mistaking it for an f14 fighter and warning it 
seven times iran said all 290 people aboard were killed 
all of the approximately 20000 us citizens in the gulf arab 
states were advised to maintain low profiles and us embassies 
around the world issued warnings to americans to exercise 
discretion in their activities 
americans around the gulf paid special heed because some of the 
arab countries have large populations of shiite moslems the 
dominant sect in iran 
navy officials canceled leaves and shore passes for american 
servicemen as another precaution against possible terrorist acts 
against the sailors 
us sources say the american population of the gulf has 
dwindled in recent years and includes about 15000 in saudi arabia 
1200 in bahrain and fewer than 1000 each in kuwait the united 
arab emirates qatar and oman 
in addition about 20000 american military personnel are in the 
region most aboard ships 
a few us diplomatic missions including the fortresslike 
embassy in downtown kuwait had small july 4th parties for staff 
members and a few guests 
security concerns have reduced the size of official independence 
day celebrations the us embassy in bahrain even held one in 
february built around presidents day marking the birthdays of 
george washington and abraham lincoln 
officials said the date was chosen because more people were on 
hand at that time than in the heat of july 
at the small us navy shore facility hidden away near 
bahrains main port just 40 sailors were present for the 
ceremonial raising of the stars and stripes that occurs only july 4 
an american officer said many more usually would attend the 
flagraising and an outdoor cookout but plans to bring about 200 
sailors ashore for the day were canceled 
a bus awaiting a bomb check at the gate carried only about 15 
men 
no american sailors were at their few intown haunts hotel 
lobbies with international telephone booths coffee shops the 
sheraton complex shopping mall and the arab market district

georgia tech researchers have constructed 
collapsing stairs and are paying volunteers to tumble down them 
wearing crash helmets neck braces and padded mittens all in the 
name of science 
stairs are the second most dangerous consumer product right 
after automobiles but the one thing we really dont know is what 
happens in the instant of a fall said researcher deborah hyde of 
georgia institute of technologys school of architecture 
researchers have constructed a pneumatic stairway that can 
collapse in any of five different ways to prompt a scientific 
pratfall volunteers are paid 15 dollars for falling on that 
aircushioned flight each subjects flailing arms and legs are 
frozen by strobe lights and highspeed cameras for later analysis 
designers are looking for new insights into how to make a safer 
flight of stairs results already have disspelled some 
misconceptions about when and how people stumble 
for example although people generally fear falling down a 
flight of stairs research shows they are more likely to stumble on 
the way up 
during the experiment each volunteer is trussed in a green 
flight suit neck brace crash helmet and padded mittens and slung 
from a red parachute harness that automatically arrests each fall 
at a predetermined point we turn on an electric beam that 
goes across the front edge of the stair we want them to fall on 
ms hyde said they break the beam and that acts as the trigger 
to collapse the stair 
so far the researchers have entered 1400 images from 50 
recorded falls into a computer to recreate a complete electronic 
composite of a bad fall 
the computer simulation will tell us what position they would 
have landed in what they would have hit first ms hyde said 
we need to learn what kind of forces people generate when they 
fall 
as many as 26 million people every year are injured in stairway 
falls an undeveloped or deteriorating sense of balance make the 
danger acute for children or the elderly 
the georgia tech team has a twoyear 125000 grant from the 
national science foundation to develop energyabsorbing foams that 
could replace the wood metal and stone of traditional stairways 
with stairs you are always going to have accidents you cant 
pad people ms hyde said so you have to come up with some way 
to attenuate the forces that build up in a fall

president fidel castro has enhanced his image on 
human rights by releasing hundreds of political prisoners but 
dissidents say thousands more remain in jail or are ostracized for 
opposing the regime 
communist authorities have nearly halved the dissident 
population in cuban prisons since cardinal john oconnor of new 
york asked castro to release 433 people charged with political 
crimes said bienvenido avierno a foreign ministry official 
oconnor visited cuba in april 
former political prisoners are among the 300 or so cubans 
leaving havana each month aboard charter flights that depart four 
times a week for miami 
asked if the releases benefit the government by letting it purge 
dissidents avierno said sure we are maintaining these guys 
one dissident here says the government has only become more 
sophisticated in curbing its domestic opposition 
everything is repressive here ricardo bofill president of 
the banned cuban human rights committee said in a recent interview 
at his oneroom apartment in the havana suburb of guanabacoa 
their tactics have changed now they use mobs and press 
campaigns 
bofill a communist party member before castro came to power in 
1959 has been jailed several times for speaking out against the 
government he has stayed at home for the past four months saying 
he fears for his life 
there are death threats i have been identified in cuba as the 
head of the counterrevolutionaries the no 1 enemy bofill said 
sitting in a rocking chair in his room 
the communist party newspaper granma devoted several pages in 
april to discrediting bofill he is totally twisted and imbued 
with doubledealing lies faking deception and especially a 
monstrous ego and unquenchable thirst for fame and notoriety it 
said 
bofills group compiles and distributes reports of government 
abuses he showed a reporter a handwritten prison pamphlet called 
dawn which detailed systematic cruelty 
he said cuba has 10000 political prisoners amnesty 
international the londonbased human rights group put the number 
at 450 in its 1987 annual report 
the castro government tolerates bofill often citing his 
criticisms as proof cuba has freedom of expression 
avierno flatly denies there are any rights abuses in cuba the 
people for the first time in their lives have the arms if they 
didnt like the system they could use them 
bofill said he does not oppose the government but rather its 
tactics this is not a fight against the system it is against an 
unjust order the basic rights the right to life is not 
guaranteed 
in cuba only staterun news media are allowed to operate and 
the government decides who can leave the country and who can return 
bofill displayed his identification card a booklet resembling a 
passport and showed the government stamp that indicates he has 
applied for permission to leave the country 
he said the stamp identifies him and thousands of others as 
malcontents 
roberto bermudez 32 a painter said his opposition to the 
government has meant he cant exhibit his paintings 
sebastian arcos a former professor of dentistry and 
expolitical prisoner said thousands of cubans depicted as social 
outcasts are unable to find work 
cubas socialist policies mean free and often model health care 
and education the government says its provision of these social 
services constitutes a human right 
this is a country where we have education health a country 
where drugs especially hard drugs are unheard of no child needs 
to leave his studies to help his family violence is practically 
unknown these are human rights jose ramon fernandez vice 
president of the council of state said in an interview 
castro this year permitted the international red cross to 
examine cuban prisons for the first time a confidential report is 
being prepared 
in addition a united nations human rights group is expected to 
inspect the prisons by september 
the united states maintains no formal diplomatic relations with 
cuba but the us interests section in havana receives thousands 
upon thousands of letters from cubans requesting political asylum 
in the united states spokeman jerry scott said 
an agreement renewed last year will allow 3000 cubans to travel 
to the united states as refugees 
avierno said the cuban government agreed to free most of the 
prisoners requested by oconnor if the united states guarantees 
they can go there 
about 40 of that group will not be released because they are 
very dangerous people and they must fulfill their sentences 
avierno said the maximum prison term is 30 years

the soviet unions various reactions to the us

smooth sovietus relations while satisfying some allies desires 
for a harsh response 
moscow radio said monday that the navy committed deliberate 
mass murder but kremlin reaction was milder and defense 
officials did not even bring it up with an american visitor 
the united states said the crew of the uss vincennes shot down 
the iran air jetliner over the persian gulf on sunday when they 
mistook it for an f14 fighter and it failed to heed warnings iran 
said all 290 aboard were killed 
in china official newspapers today joined in condemning the 
attack and said major powers must cease meddling in the gulf 
the kremlins first statement about the incident contrasted with 
angry pronouncements by president reagan and other us officials 
after soviet fighters shot down a south korean airliner with 269 
aboard 
reagan spoke at the time of the barbarity of the soviet 
government in shooting down an unarmed plane 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov told a news 
briefing that the soviet union did not intend to follow the bad 
example of wild american criticism after kal flight 007 was 
shot down sept 1 1983 
he said the us explanation that us sailors could not tell 
the difference on radar screens between the airbus 300 and a f14 
jet fighter appeared to be strange 
it shows american naval officers were not very competent or 
to use an american phrase triggerhappy gerasimov declared 
he noted that kal flight 007 was over a strategically 
sensitive area of the soviet far east while the iranian jet was 
flying over its own territory and territorial waters 
the spokesman also said the profile of the kal jet was similar 
to that of american spy planes while the profile of an airbus and 
an iranian fighter are distinct he said the south korean plane was 
shot down at night and the iranian jet in daylight 
gerasimov said the shooting was an outgrowth of american policy 
in the persian gulf where iran and iraq have been at war since 
september 1980 and proved us actions there were dangerous 
us naval forces must immediately leave the waters of the 
persian gulf he said 
moscow radios reaction was far stronger its englishlanguage 
service called the attack deliberate mass murder in cold blood 
and asked 
what was the american cruiser defending itself from was is 
threatened by the 66 children and 52 women who were among the 
nearly 300 passengers of the airplane 
it called the vincennes a brazen intruder in an alien land 
there is a difference between a true act of selfdefense 
protection of a nations borders and deliberate cruel murder 
it said claiming the kal flight was on a spy mission and received 
warnings 
neither gerasimov nor official media accounts mentioned us 
contentions that the airbus had flown into a war zone the radio 
quoting irans official islamic republic news agency said the jet 
was in a corridor reserved for civilian aviation 
aides to air force secretary edward c aldridge had feared the 
event would make his current visit to moscow difficult a us 
official said it was not mentioned in meetings aldridge had monday 
with the soviet air force chief marshal alexander n yefimov and 
defense minister dmitri t yazov 
the china daily said it was hard to believe that the vincennes 
could not distinguish a widebodied commercial airliner from a 
twoseat fighter jet 
the fatal incident of the airbus crash has once again 
underlined the urgency for the removal of big powers military 
meddling in the region and for the peaceful settlement between the 
warring nations it said

two controversial movies about poor peasants that 
won prizes abroad tied for best picture in the 1988 golden rooster 
competition chinas academy awards official reports said today 
the old well and red sorghum also shared best picture 
honors with a third movie prairie in an annual public opinion 
contest called the hundred flowers awards the official xinhua news 
agency said 
the golden rooster prizes are awarded by a panel of experts from 
the movie industry 
controversy has become a staple of the golden rooster awards in 
the past few years as chinas filmmakers become increasingly 
sophisticated in their styles and themes 
this year was no exception but the debate did not delay the 
awards as it did in 1987 and 1986 last years prizes were not 
given until january because of behindthescenes wrangling 
critics said the old well and red sorghum both made by 
the relatively avantgarde xian film studio focused on the 
backwardness and poverty of china instead of seeking to inspire 
both depict poor villagers in arid northwestern china and both 
treat sexuality with relative frankness 
the shanghai newspaper wen hui bao said the xian film studio 
received letters saying the movies were hateful productions that 
sell the ugliness of chinese in a bid to invite the appreciation of 
foreigners 
delegates to the national peoples congress chinas 
legislature demanded at their annual meeting in april to know what 
the movies were trying to accomplish the paper said 
the old well won top prize at the tokyo grand prix last year 
and a special prize at the hawaii international film festival 
red sorghum was named top film at the west berlin film festival 
in february 
wu tianming head of the xian studio and director of the old 
well told the associated press in an interview this year that 
his goal is to depict the realities of life in modern china even 
if these realities offend government censors with feudal and 
ultraleft ideas 
in the old well a young couple the besteducated in their 
poor village devote all their energies to finding a water supply 
for the village but are prevented from marrying by the young mans 
father 
the movie depicts the tension between an older generation 
comfortable with its backward life and a younger generation trying 
to better the village and make its own choices in love 
red sorghum was directed by wus protege zhang yimou who 
also starred in the old well and won best actor honors in both 
the golden rooster and hundred flowers contests 
red sorghum set in the 1930s shows the relatively 
uninhibited life style of a band of sorghum winemakers and ends 
with several being killed by the invading japanese 
ironically chinese films are breaking away from longimposed 
ideological constraints and experimenting with more sophisticated 
techniques at a time when theater attendance is falling sharply and 
studios are sinking deeper and deeper into debt 
the official guangming daily said today that urgent measures are 
needed to halt the decline it said onefourth of chinese films 
have lost money in recent years blaming too much government 
interference in film distribution 
the paper recommended that studios be given control of marketing 
and exporting their films and that ticket prices be raised 
in cities movie tickets range from less than 1 cent to 24 
cents while in the countryside village governments often arrange 
to show movies free 
urban movie theaters tend to be crowded noisy places and many 
people prefer to stay home and watch television

the head of the anglican church said the 
priesthood in england can only gain by ordaining women but 
opponents within the church said they based their case on tradition 
and the bible 
i have come to the judgment that the ordination of women to 
the priesthood would actually be an enlargement of the catholic 
universal priesthood an opening up of priesthood rather than 
its overturning archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said 
monday 
runcie the churchs spiritual head and leader of the worlds 70 
million anglicans made his comments before the policymaking 
general synod of 574 bishops clergy and laity as it opened its 
regular threeday summer session 
an allday debate on allowing women into the priesthood was 
planned today 
the church still bars women priests although anglican churches 
in other countries have ordained about 1000 women according to 
englands movement for the ordination of women ordaining churches 
include the us episcopalians and anglicans in canada new 
zealand hong kong brazil kenya and uganda 
runcie said that in an age when women took part in leadership 
the priesthood actually may be weakened by being solely male 
opponents say there is nothing in the bible to support women 
priests that jesus christ who founded christianity had only male 
apostles and for nearly 2000 years the church ordained only men 
the debate on womens ordination has lasted more than 20 years 
new proposals in the debate include giving a bishop who opposes 
women priests the right to bar them in his diocese and to pay up to 
51000 compensation to priests who leave the church over the issue 
on grounds of conscience 
the anglican state church has seemed to be moving slowly toward 
ordaining women but even if the proposals are endorsed there is 
still a long way to go 
the legislation will be referred to revision committees and then 
to all 44 diocesan synods it will return to the general synod for 
final approval but it must then be approved by parliament 
the church cannot legislate alone on matters of doctrine because 
it is an established church meaning it is established by laws made 
by parliament and has the monarch as its temporal head 
if all stages are passed without delay the church of englands 
first woman priest may be ordained in 1992 or 1993 
a majority of the 53 diocesan and deputy bishops are in favor of 
women priests but some like bishop of london graham leonard the 
thirdranking prelate are strongly against sections of the 
clergy and laity are also opposed 
speakers in favor of women priests at mondays debate 
outnumbered opponents by four to one 
bishop of durham david jenkins said he found the arguments for a 
male god wholly incredible 
this portrayal of god attempts to retain the power of men in 
the church is an affront to the full vital and immensely needed 
humanity of women and is a denial of the mystery of god he said 
but sir john stokes a conservative party legislator asked 
have we the power to make such a fundamental change without 
consulting the rest of christendom when we are clearly not of one 
mind

members of the backtonature rainbow 
family ended their 17th annual gathering of the tribes with 
mudbaths in an east texas national forest and prayers for peace and 
harmony 
women in beverly hills pay 300 for this and we get it for 
free said a woman who identified herself only as marcia from 
arizona one of those clad only in mud who said it cleansed the 
skin 
the loosely knit group which had predicted as many as 20000 
people would attend drew 4392 participants according to federal 
marshals stationed in the angelina national forest about 125 miles 
northeast of houston 
the presence of officials wearing official clothing made it 
intimidating said one rainbow member who called herself alita 
many of the participants sat indianstyle backtoback in 
various states of dress and undress some wore only mud 
participants had been dogged by repeated court challenges from 
the us forest service which insisted the rainbow family comply 
with regulations covering use of the forest area 
us district judge william wayne justice finally ruled that up 
to 5000 people could gather at each of three designated 
campgrounds although most of the people selected one site known as 
mud flats 
the judge also ordered that the group each day buy 15000 
gallons of fresh water to be trucked to the campground 
forest service and health officials sought to prevent a 
recurrence of dysentery that struck some 6000 people from 29 
states after they attended last years rainbow gathering in north 
carolina nearly 13000 attended there 
on monday a rainbow appeared in the sky overhead and thunder 
and lightning crackled as the familys meeting culminated with a 
prayer vigil on the shores of lake sam rayburn 
some of the people who had been arriving in the forest since 
last week reached the prayer site at dawn monday and sat in 
silence meditating around two banners as temperatures climbed to 
near 100 degrees 
one of the banners emblazoned with a rainbow read silent 
vigil for world peace 
back to front yin to yang a chain is built a chain that 
binds in love and peace said a rainbow member who identified 
himself as wu qi he continuously circled the gathering wearing 
only a coat of mud that hardened on him as the sun baked him 
forest service officials said this years gathering was 
significant in that legal questions were addressed that will affect 
future such gatherings 
public health and safety for example carl gidlund a 
forest service spokesman said now we have the public health 
service in to ensure its clean its a technical point but now 
people have some protection and for the first time its a 
controlled gathering

an object in about 800 feet of water 
outside the mouth of pearl harbor might be a japanese submarine 
believed sunk hours before the attack on dec 7 1941 authorities 
said 
it could be anything said bill dickinson superintendent of 
the uss arizona memorial park even a bunch of oil drums in a 
line but it looks promising 
sonar pings produced a shape that matches what is known about 
midget submarines involved in the japanese attack dickinson said 
adding that it was in a high probably area for the midget sub 
its going to take a lot more to confirm whats down there 
he said first we have to locate the resources to pay for a 
search and then convince the university of hawaii or national 
geographic or somebody else with deepdiving equipment to go down 
and take a look 
thats the only way the mystery will be solved he said 
in the predawn hours before the japanese launched their surprise 
air assault on pearl harbor and other military bases on the island 
of oahu the destroyer uss ward spotted something odd in the water 
leading to the harbor entrance 
it was one of five midget subs involved in the attack and was 
trying to slip into the harbor each sub had a twoman crew and two 
torpedoes 
the ward fired shells at the intruder apparently hitting the 
conning tower and then blanketed the area with depth charges 
nothing more was seen of the sub and it remains the only one of 
the five unaccounted for 
the underwater object was detected friday during a survey of 
pearl harbor and surrounding waters as a cooperative effort of the 
navy and the national parks service with funds from the arizona 
memorial museum 
it is being done to fulfill a federal requirement that historic 
artifacts in a national historic landmark be catalogued

after six years of trying to convince 
companies their computer data is as good as gold secured data 
services inc finally can see light at the end of its tunnel 
in this case the tunnel is a half mile through limestone to a 
twoacre site 80 feet underground near lewisburg in southwest ohio 
behind motion detectors video cameras chainlink fences and a 
7inchthick vault door are 20000 computer tapes disks and 
cassettes protected as backups against natural or other disasters 
said steven l wright a consultant 
many belong to fortune 500 companies he said others are from 
area retailers who have found out the hard way that in these days 
of computerized checkout and inventory an employee error or 
sabotage can make backup tapes a lifeblood transfusion 
secured data wont name its clients for security reasons 
likewise there is no name on the entrance to its cave 
a growing number of such highsecurity vaults including one in 
an old railroad tunnel under new york citys world trade center 
are catering to companies which realize that a computer without 
secure backup data is a sitting duck for disaster and possible 
financial ruin 
the market is just now beginning to open up companies are 
just now starting to store their records in a coherent fashion 
said charles c johnson secured datas vice president and general 
manager 
johnson 30 a former procter amp gamble co analytical chemist 
who was in charge of one of the companys computer systems joined 
secured data three years ago when the company was having trouble 
getting its message across 
today sales are doubling every 10 months and are approaching 1 
million he said secured data charges clients from less than 50 
per month to more than 8000 depending on the number of tapes and 
frequency of access 
the company is aiming at a market within a 120mile radius that 
it can serve with fourhour delivery johnson said 
disaster preparedness at the moment is getting to be a 
buzzword we love accountants who are pushing for it wright said 
recent disasters such as the first interstate bank building 
fire in los angeles are advertising for the company he said 
yet data security services still can be hard to sell wright 
said 
there are still those companies which believe the only backup 
protection they need is to have an employee take the tapes home in 
the car trunk 
competition also is getting tougher partly from public 
warehouses converting to offer records storage wright said 
secured data was founded in 1982 by james m valentine who also 
owned a foundry and is a cofounder of cincinnati microwave 
valentine who still has the title of president has said he got 
the idea to use part of the 250acre mine after visiting a similar 
facility in montreal 
it took about 300000 in modifications including leveling 
floors enclosing a 3500squarefoot vault and a 7600squarefoot 
cold room that is prewired for a company to bring in its own 
backup computer 
the temperature is a constant 55 degrees although heat from the 
lights and people meant there had to be air conditioning wright 
said there also is electrostatic dust protection dust can be as 
much an enemy to tapes as heat 
the vault is lined with halon fire extinguishers 
tape librarian barbara clark said once there was a small 
earthquake in the area and we didnt even know it happened down 
here if i worry about anything happening down here its the 
electricity going out she said 
it has once or twice but with no major problems wright said

house speaker jim wright said today that president 
reagan should be more apologetic for the us navys shooting down 
of an iranian passenger jet over the persian gulf 
wright also said congress would favor compensating iran for the 
tragedy 
he said americans are deeply grateful to prime minister 
margaret thatcher for saying she understood the navys reason for 
shooting at the plane 
iran said all 290 people aboard the iran air jetliner were 
killed when the uss vincennes shot the plane out of the sky on 
sunday the united states said the ships crew thought the plane 
was a fighter and warned it seven times 
asked in a british broadcasting corp radio interview if the 
united states should offer monetary compensation to iran wright 
said yes if that would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved 
party surely we could do that congress would support that if 
it were requested 
but the texas democrat said he doubted whether the offer of 
money would be just retribution for the loss of human life 
wright said reagan had expressed regret for the loss of innocent 
lives but is not given to profuse apologies in any event asked 
if he ought to be wright replied yes he should be 
we close ranks so please dont ask me to try to correct the 
language of the president wright said im just stating as a 
matter of fact that mr reagan is not given to acknowledging error 
its a personal trait hes gone as far as ive ever heard him go 
and he has expressed his deep regret as president of the united 
states 
wright called the attack a tragic error 
we have not been able to invent with all our genius a machine 
or a radar screen that can detect the intentions of the pilot 
flying an aircraft he said 
but wright said he believes iran bears much of the 
responsibility because iranian gunboats had our vessel under 
attack at that time under unprovoked attack 
surely they iran should have understood that flying 
commercial aircraft in a war zone in which their military attack 
boats launched an attack on our personnel and area would put 
lives in danger he said 
wright met monday with mrs thatcher and foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe during a longplanned fiveday trip to london 
mrs thatchers government issued a statement sunday night 
saying it deeply regretted the disaster but backed the us navys 
right to defend itself 
i dont suppose we could have asked for a more understanding 
attitude on the part of the british government wright said 
all of us are deeply grateful of course in our time of anguish 
that our friends would stand beside us and offer a degree of 
understanding

hai nguyen a city mechanical engineer 
laughed selfconsciously as he unrolled toilet paper while visitors 
watched a test flush of the porcelain privy he had rigged 
nguyen pushed a button and a pressurized tank in the water 
closet inc fixture discharged a shot of water into the toilet 
bowl which then emptied in nine seconds 
this is the wave of the future said an impressed rj 
martin the citys chief plumbing inspector 
welcome to the citys toilet test lab where the next generation 
of hightech toilets which use a mere 1 gallons per flush are 
being put through their paces no commode can be sold until it has 
passed the code 
the los angeles labs flush requirements are set by the american 
national standard institute which specifies that the toilet paper 
field test shall be comprised of an appropriate number of 
sixsheet strips of singleply roll toilet paper each crumpled 
into a loose ball measuring 2 to 3 inches in diameter 
latex cylinders pingpong balls and other materials are also 
specified by ansi for certain tests another standard determines if 
a toilet can rinse off a line drawn inside the rim with a 
watersoluble marker 
i think los angeles is one of the few if not the only 
municipality in the country with a test lab to make sure toilets 
are in compliance said james s nishimoto whose mechanical 
engineering division oversees the lab operated by the city 
department of building and safety 
within a stones throw of the los angeles river city engineers 
at the laboratory ensure that toilets from designer thrones by ifo 
of sweden to the american standard models meet the same 
requirements for flushing scouring and rinsing 
for some critics the labs certification of lowflush toilets 
is taking too much time and hampering water conservation efforts in 
a drought year 
a new measure passed by the los angeles city council in april 
seeks to conserve water and ease the strain on the citys aging and 
overwhelmed sewer system 
among other things the measure requires installation of 
lowflush toilets for new construction the toilets use just 1 
gallons per flush compared to the usual 3 to 6 gallons 
about 10 lowflush models have been developed but only one has 
been certified for use in los angeles said lab manager yogen r 
thakar 
its just another example of a bureaucracy going around in 
circles to me said larry farwell water conservation coordinator 
for the goleta water district in santa barbara county 
certification is pending for the wci unit which was tested 
recently thakar said it takes from eight to 10 hours to test a 
privy but three to four months to certify each model its a 
bureaucratic process he explained 
critics also complain that the citys lab charges a minimum 500 
to test each model and 300 each year afterward to renew its 
certification 
its totally unnecessary said tom scheller of dea bathroom 
machineries a plumbing importer and distributor based in murphys 
calif the city is just using it as a means of generating 
revenue 
the fees charged by the lab pay for most of its 600000 
operating budget nishimoto said the lab also tests gardenhose 
pesticide sprayers commercial washing machines dishwashers ice 
machines and just about anything else that is connected to the 
citys potable water supply 
i do feel that it serves an important function nishimoto 
said its an area thats in public health and i really dont 
think any other lab gives it the same kind of attention that we 
do

the chief of this british 
provinces mostly protestant police force has ordered an internal 
disciplinary hearing for 20 officers in the 1982 killings of six 
unarmed roman catholics 
chief constable sir john hermon of the royal ulster constabulary 
ordered the hearing on monday critics have charged that police had 
a shoottokill policy and that a subsequent coverup 
undermined efforts to persuade the catholic minority to accept 
police authority 
prime minister charles haugheys government across the border in 
the irish republic said that substituting an internal police 
hearing for prosecutions in the courts will not allay public 
concern 
the officers at the closeddoor internal hearing could face 
penalties ranging from cautions and reprimands to fines loss of 
pension rights demotions and dismissal from the police force 
hermon said a chief constable from the british mainland will be 
appointed to preside over the hearing he did not name the 20 
officers give details of the precise charges against them or say 
when the hearing will be held 
but press reports said it is expected to be held in belfast and 
that the 20 officers range from constable the lowest rank in the 
police force to middleranked chief superintendent 
haugheys government catholic politicians civil libertarians 
and the human rights group amnesty international say the killings 
were illegal 
in a threeweek period at the end of 1982 police shot to death 
five acknowledged guerrillas all unarmed and an innocent 
teenager in three incidents two at police roadblocks and one in a 
barn 
two years later a senior mainland detective was called in to 
investigate after it emerged in court that officers had perjured 
themselves covering up the circumstances of the killings 
the detective john stalker has written a book that says he was 
forced off the case because he was close to proving police 
conspired to bypass legal procedures and shoot to kill guerrilla 
suspects 
his inquiry was completed by colin sampson another senior 
mainland officer sampsons conclusions led to an announcement by 
prime minister margaret thatchers government that while evidence 
indicated that officers perverted justice there would be no 
prosecutions 
acting on sampsons report the police authority decided no 
disciplinary action was required against hermon or his two deputies 
meanwhile a parallel investigation was conducted into the 
conduct of lowerranking officers and this led to mondays 
announcement of an internal disciplinary hearing 
seamus mallon deputy leader of the social democratic and labor 
party the provinces largest catholic party said he was 
dissatisfied 
it is both unfair and unjust for 20 men of lower rank to take 
the rap when those with real responsibility remain protected by and 
shrouded in mystery regarding their own conduct he said 
meanwhile the monthly meeting of belfast city council was 
abandoned monday night after fist fights broke out between 
protestant and catholic members 
the fighting involved about 20 people members of the 
provinces two protestant unionist parties and members of sinn 
fein legal political arm of the outlawed mainly catholic irish 
republican army 
five of those involved were treated in hospital for minor 
injuries said a press officer at belfast police headquarters 
the ira is fighting to push the british out of this 
protestantdominated province join it with the republic of ireland 
and set up an allireland socialist state

faulty wiring triggered an explosion that 
consumed 20 minutes worth of fireworks in two minutes forcing the 
evacuation of tens of thousands of people from a downtown park on

its widely said in the us navy that 
any warship sooner or later takes on the character of its skipper 
but theres little about capt will c rogers iii to suggest he 
commands what he calls the most sophisticated ship in the world 
bar none 
the ship the missile cruiser uss vincennes and its skipper a 
softspoken graying man in his mid40s are at the center of the 
storm over the shooting down of an iranian jetliner over the 
persian gulf on sunday 
it was rogers from his console in the ships darkened command 
information center who ultimately gave the shoot order that 
sent two sm2 standard missiles roaring off their deck launcher to 
blast the plane from the sky 
only later did the united states admit that what the vincennes 
officers had identified as an iranian f14 fighter diving on their 
ship was in fact an iran air a300 airbus with 290 people aboard 
the captain and his tactical action officers will be called to 
answer questions under oath before a team of top military and 
technical experts arriving in the gulf today to investigate the 
incident 
in rogers they will find a man who as one navy officer said 
has probably aged ten years in the last two days 
you cannot help but feel for the man said another the 
first priority is protecting the ship and it was his decision 
once you fire them you cant get em back the officers spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
rogers a native of fort worth texas has a dry wit and so much 
of the american southwest in his manner and voice that he spends a 
lot of time denying hes related to the famous oklahoma cowboy 
humorist will rogers 
i dont know how that rumor got started but it isnt true 
even my mother says so he said recently when reporters visiting 
his ship asked 
the assumption is so widespread that some other officers were 
surprised at the denial 
rogers has commanded the vincennes for nearly two years and is 
the 9600ton warships second skipper he and his wife sharon 
also fort worthborn live in san diego calif where the cruiser 
is based 
they have a son will c rogers iv 
rogers is a career navy man a graduate of the navys officer 
candidate school who has served aboard a variety of vessels from 
mine sweepers to the aircraft carrier independence 
his first command in the early 1970s was the tiny 
woodenhulled mine sweeper exploit after later tours at the 
pentagon and navy staff college plus other sea duty he served as 
skipper of the destroyer cushing in 198184 
the vincennes launched at the ingalls shipyard in pascagoula 
miss three years ago wednesday is the third of the navys 
billiondollar aegistype missile cruisers designed to defend 
an american battle fleet from air and missile attack 
its computerlinked surveillance and missile system is built 
around phasedarray radar which can simultaneously identify 
and evaluate the threat if any from dozens of targets 
in the command information center the targets appear not on the 
usual round screens swept by a lighted wand but as fixed blips on 
huge blue video screens where display features can be expanded or 
reduced in size to provide a variety of instantaneous data 
as if to anticipate a visitors comment that the setting is an 
electronic version of the wizard of oz theres a sign on the 
desk where rogers sits that says hell toto this aint kansas 
the vincennes geewhiz merchandise as rogers calls it is 
tailored for multiple functions at the same time its powerful 
radar system can help plan a battle or head off aerial threats 
developing hundreds of miles away 
but rogers said no technology is foolproof or impervious to 
failure he said that if an attacker were to disable his ships 
computerized system were basically back to rocks and stones 
the vincennes arrived in the gulf on may 27 as the first 
aegistype cruiser assigned to the waterway sailed into it rogers 
had difficulty in explaining for reporters why such a potent 
warship is needed here 
finally he said that putting this ship with its radar into 
the gulf will put a lot of battle management on the scene maybe we 
will be able to reduce the force level in the gulf and back away 
from recent tensions in the gulf 
of the iranian threat he said lets face it its a 
lowlevel threat we dont consider the iranians an enemy were 
not at war with them 
as the sixman team headed here to investigate the iran air 
disaster sources in washington quoted rogers as telling superiors 
he had followed procedures and that if he again faced the same 
situation he would take the same action 
this is a burden that i will carry the rest of my life but i 
took this action to defend my ship and my crew i alone am 
responsible he was reported as saying

the communist party conference approved mikhail s 
gorbachevs call for an overhaul of the legislature but did not 
endorse his proposal for a strong presidency according to a 
resolution published today 
in his speech last week opening the national conference he had 
called gorbachev said the president of the ussr supreme 
soviet should be granted sufficiently broad state authority powers 
specifically the president could exercise overall guidance in 
the drafting of legislation and of major socioeconomic programs 
decide on the key issues of foreign policy defense and national 
security chair the defense council and name the prime minister 
he said 
that would have made the presidency now a largely ceremonial 
post the locus of soviet power most authority now rests with the 
party general secretary gorbachev and the partys ruling 
politburo 
the resolutions adopted by the 5000 delegates as published 
today by soviet newspapers were silent on the question of 
presidential authority 
the resolution on political reform did propose creation of a new 
elective body to be known as the congress of peoples deputies 
which would meet annually to set general policy and elect members 
of a smaller fulltime legislative council the supreme soviet 
the supreme soviet now has 1500 members who meet twice a year 
to give rubberstamp approval to party policy 
the resolution also would limit officials to two fiveyear terms 
in the same party or government office eliminating the common 
practice of what amounts to lifetime tenure for many officials 
the congress also would elect by secret ballot the president 
of the supreme soviet the document said but it was silent on 
what that officers duties would be 
andrei a gromyko the longtime soviet foreign minister and 
politburo member was elevated to the presidency of the supreme 
soviet by gorbachev but he performs the largely ceremonial 
functions of head of state while gorbachev wields power as head of 
the politburo and the defense council 
it was not immediately clear whether the 13member politburo had 
moved to block gorbachevs plan 
a senior party spokesman told reporters friday night just after 
the conference ended that the delegates had approved gorbachevs 
proposal when they adopted seven resolutions in the final hours of 
the fourday session 
the spokesman central committee secretary alexander lukyanov 
said the party meeting the first in 47 years had agreed to the 
proposal to give the powers gorbachev requested to the president 
he said the body also approved the general secretarys more 
controversial plan to have the party leader at every level local 
regional republic and national stand for election to head his or 
her governmental council or soviet that would consolidate party 
and government power in one person who would have to be elected 
not only by the party organization but by the lawmakers as well 
gorbachev did not specifically say the party general secretary 
should seek the presidency but lukyanov said the conference made 
the recommendation to apply to all levels setting the stage for 
gorbachev to seek election to the new presidency next year 
the texts of the resolutions were not made public until the day 
after a special meeting of the ruling politburo which ordered 
party and government bodies to act without delay in implementing 
the conference directives 
the politburo also said a meeting of the policymaking central 
committee would be held later this month to discuss how to 
implement the proposed reforms 
another resolution says every soviet citizen has an 
inalienable right to any information on public affairs but 
state and military secrets 
the delegates also said any citizen attacked in the press should 
have the right to respond in the same newspaper and that the press 
must not publish unobjective information injurious to a citizens 
honor and dignity 
another resolution attached prime importance to improving 
drastically food supplies to the population the shortest route 
to that goal the conference said is for bureaucrats to stop 
meddling in the operations of collective and state farms

palestinians shut down shops and transportation 
in the occupied lands today in a ploordered general strike and 
underground leaders of the uprising urged arabs to step up civil 
disobedience against israeli rule 
israeli troops shot and wounded a 17yearold arab in the chest 
today during a clash in the west bank city of nablus said an 
official at the citys al ittihad hospital 
an army spokesman said the soldiers opened fire after a group of 
youths hurled rocks at them from a rooftop in the citys 
marketplace the hospital official identified the youth as hatem 
kilani 
since the unrest began dec 8 against israels 21year 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 215 palestinians and 
four israelis have been killed 
the army demolished two homes belonging to arabs suspected of 
staging firebomb attacks in the west bank city of bethlehem israel 
army radio and arab witnesses said 
we shall reach anyone every place where a firebomb is thrown 
where a man has thrown a firebomb in cold blood intending to 
kill everyone here brig gen gabi ofir a west bank commander 
said on the radio 
the violence came hours before the strike turned six arab cities 
in the west bank and the gaza strip nablus gaza city hebron 
jenin ramallah and bethlehem into virtual ghost towns 
most of about 120000 palestinians employed in israel also 
stayed away from their jobs as part of a general strike ordered in 
a leaflet last month by uprising leaders affliated with the 
palestine liberation organization arab news reports said 
about 800 arab schools in the west bank were shut today as part 
of a threeday closing ordered by the army on monday in an an 
attempt to prevent further violence 
the school shutdown also came in response to instructions by 
uprising leaders to rename all institutions and schools not 
bearing palestinian names today 
brig gen shaike erez who heads the west bank military 
government said monday the he hoped the closings would bring 
home to students and parents that the current level of disturbances 
is unacceptable 
palestinians were also urged today to boycott military 
government offices but arabs complied only partially after the 
military summoned many to appear at its offices apparently as a 
countermeasure israel radio reported 
in bethlehem hundreds of men and women were seen lining up in 
front of the israeli authorities headquarters to obtain various 
documents 
but in the seaside gaza strip a total strike was reported an 
arab reporter in gaza said he saw soldiers trying to order workers 
to board buses to israel in the jabaliya refugee camp but the men 
refused jabaliya a frequent trouble spot is home to about 60000 
palestinians 
two new leaflets distributed today urged arabs to stage more 
daylong general strikes throughout july to mark seven months of the 
rebellion 
the leaflets gave conflicting dates for the strikes and it was 
not immediately known whether they were distributed by rival 
factions of the underground leadership

iran air airbus 300 by the uss vincennes 
 
in the gulf 
in beirut sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah the spiritual 
guide for iranianbacked guerrillas holding foreign captives was 
quoted as saying the hostages should not suffer because of the 
attack an anonymous caller claiming to speak for islamic jihad 
which holds americans terry anderson and thomas sutherland 
threatened to kill one of them in revenge for sundays attack 
iranian divers searched the persian gulf for bodies from the 
airbus a300 that was destroyed by a us navy missile the bodies 
of more than half the 290 people reported aboard were recovered 
a team of navy investigators left for the gulf to begin 
reconstructing the incident the navy says the airbus was mistaken 
for an iranian f14 jet fighter 
capt will c rogers iii commander of the vincennes told his 
superiors he had followed proper procedures and would make the same 
decisions in the same situation again 
 
in iran 
iranian leaders demanded revenge and threatened war scenes of 
protest demonstrations appeared on television and mass funerals

unanswered questions 
how could the vincennes mistake a large civilian plane the 
airbus for a small highly maneuverable jet fighter like the f14 
was the iranian plane inside or outside a recognized 
commercial air corridor 
was the airplane descending from 9000 feet in what seemed to 
be an attack as the navy says or climbing from 7500 feet after

the defense ministry said today 
nicaraguan rebels ambushed a military jeep and a truck carrying

ceasefire pact was signed in march 
seven civilians and five military men were killed in the raid 
monday in buenos aires a village about 100 miles east of managua 
said a military spokeswoman speaking on condition of anonymity 
the spokeswoman said 10 other people two civilians and eight 
soldiers were injured when the usbacked rebels known as 
contras attacked the vehicles with an antitank mine rifle fire 
and rocketpropelled grenades 
contra spokesman jorge rosales said he did not have any 
information on the attack but added our units have instructions 
not to attack but to defend themselves i am seriously concerned 
about this campaign to create incidents to justify whatever action 
against our units 
rosales noted that defense minister humberto ortega threatened 
the contra leaders if they failed to sign a treaty during the last 
round of talks in june and said the latest report reflects those 
threats 
it was the deadliest attack since the leftist sandinistas and 
the rebels agreed march 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the 
war more than 26000 people have died since the insurgency began 
in 1981 
the government and the rebels have reported sporadic violations

agreement no new talks were scheduled

a man who wrote to an employee of his 
love for her and once massaged her neck and shoulder at work did 
not commit sexual harassment the minnesota court of appeals has 
ruled 
the 21 opinion which was to be filed today upheld the 
minnesota department of jobs and trainings award of unemployment 
benefits to richard l gradine who worked at the college of st 
scholastica 
the agency decided gradines conduct constituted misguided 
infatuation rather than sexual harassment which would have made 
him ineligible for jobless benefits the appeals court agreed 
gradine 43 was an assistant plant supervisor at the college 
from march 1987 until july 23 when he was fired immediately after 
the employee a student complained 
according to court documents gradine for a time supervised the 
student but she was transferred after other student workers 
complained she was receiving preferential treatment 
after the transfer gradine wrote her a letter saying he had 
strong personal feelings of affection and love for her according 
to court records 
gradine came to the students work place and massaged her neck 
and shoulder court records state when the woman told him to stop 
he did according to documents 
later that day a note the woman had written the day before was 
delivered to gradine in which she told him she wanted no further 
contact with him court documents state 
a referee for the jobs and training department determined that 
gradine was discharged for misconduct and therefore disqualified 
from receiving unemployment benefits 
but the jobs and training commissioner reversed that decision 
the commissioner refused to characterize gradines conduct as 
sexual harassment because the student had not clearly rejected 
gradines overtures and because gradine was not aware that his 
touching was unwelcome the court said 
in the court opinion judge thomas forsberg noted that 
definitions of sexual harassment in the unemployment compensation 
and human rights statutes require that a perpetrators actions be 
unwelcome 
judge daniel foley sharply disagreed writing the majority 
would have us believe this is nothing serious it is just something 
that happens in the workplace who established the standard that 
women employees must accept this kind of conduct and who 
established the standard that the employers compensation fund must 
be charged for that conduct

negotiators for striking writers say a 
proposed interim agreement is the best hope for resuming 
production but the chief of paramount studios said the plan would 
extend the 18weekold strike 
the latest interim agreement promulgated by the writers guild 
of america indicates a strikeprolonging retrenchment at a time 
when they should be seeking a solution frank mancuso said in a 
statement monday 
mancuso spokesman for the executive committee of the alliance 
of motion picture and television producers is the first major 
studio head to speak out against the strike that has paralyzed much 
of the film and television industry 
his statement came two days before 9000 guild members are to 
vote on an interim agreement already approved by the union 
leadership that allows script writers to sign deals with 
independent producers 
theres a vote coming up wednesday and he wants the writers to 
take stock of where they are alliance spokesman herb steinberg 
said and he also wants the independent producers to understand 
that this interim agreement has some fishhooks in it 
steinberg said his group warned independent producers that the 
interim agreement would cost them more in residual payments than 
the alliance offer now on the table 
the proposed agreement would also allow writers to buy back 
scripts that are not used for film production steinberg said 
two settlement proposals offered by the alliance have been 
rejected by the writers 
so far 118 independent companies have signed deals with writers 
guild members under both the old contract and the proposed interim 
agreement 
guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said the interim proposal would 
allow many production companies to resume work 
we are unfortunately trying to negotiate with a leadership of 
the companies that has chosen to spend more money to stay on strike 
than it would cost to settle ms rhoden said

jesse jackson laid out a detailed case today for 
why he should be offered the vice presidential spot on the 
democratic ticket and dismissed others under consideration as 
unknown quantities 
he refused to say whether he would accept the position if it is 
offered however 
no one else has had to pass the same tests jackson told 
reporters the morning after his fourth of july meeting with 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who is in the process of 
selecting a running mate 
i bring the sense of creativity a new history jackson said 
he refused to say whether he pushed himself for the vice 
presidential nomination during his dinner meeting with dukakis and 
also refused as he has for two weeks to make public whether he 
would accept the no 2 spot 
but he listed numerous attributes he said made him uniquely 
qualified among the handful of people being considered to share the 
ticket with dukakis principally his participation in the lengthy 
primary season during which he attracted nearly 7 million votes 
the others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond 
their districts and beyond their home states jackson said 
he was departing for new york this morning but left behind top 
aides who were to meet with dukakis campaign aides to discuss 
convention issues 
jackson spoke to reporters today after giving an 
uncharacteristic no comment when asked monday night if the vice 
presidency was a topic of his discussions with dukakis 
jackson and his wife jacqueline had dinner with dukakis and his 
wife kitty and the two couples attended a boston pops concert and 
watched a fireworks display 
on monday before flying to boston for his meeting with dukakis 
jackson said the reagan administration should examine its failed 
and vague policy in the persian gulf following the us navys 
downing of an iranian airliner 
warning that the lives of american hostages in lebanon are in 
danger jackson appealed monday to president reagan to go on 
television to apologize for the incident and offer reparations to 
the victims families to ease some of their pain 
reagan on monday repeated his sorrow over the lives lost but 
said he would await the results of a pentagon investigation before 
making decisions on matters such as reparations 
i am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill 
immediately so as to protect the lives of americans who are in the 
region specifically the americans who are held hostage there 
jackson said in chicago 
jackson made his remarks during a brief news conference at his 
chicago home 
jackson said the shooting incident complicates the situation in 
the gulf at a time when there are indications that forces in iran 
favoring negotiations are gaining strength

the public ranks the quality of education as 
the no 1 issue in this years presidential campaign according to 
a gallup poll being released today 
asked to rate 13 foreign and domestic policy issues on a scale 
of 15 with 5 representing a most important issue 77 percent 
rated public education at least a 4 
sixtysix percent of the 2113 americans surveyed by telephone 
between march 31 and april 20 said they would be more likely to 
support a candidate who favored increased federal aid to public 
schools 
but only 43 percent of those polled favored increasing teachers 
salaries if that means higher taxes 
those were among the findings of an annual survey of public 
attitudes about school issues commissioned by the national 
education association the 19 millionmember teacher union holding 
its annual convention here this week 
the american people understand the need for change and they 
clearly indicate in this poll that they want to make education a 
national priority nea executive director don cameron said at a 
news conference today 
in san francisco on monday delegates to the american federation 
of teachers annual convention reelected albert shanker unopposed 
to his eighth twoyear term as president of the 677000member 
union 
the 3000 delegates were to end their fourday meeting today 
after listening to a talk via satellite from boston by michael 
dukakis the certain democratic presidential nominee 
in the poll drugs ranked second in importance behind education 
with 75 percent rating drugs 4 or 5 sixtynine percent rated us 
ability to compete economically and technologically as a critical 
issue 
the federal deficit and homelessness each were cited as most 
important by 67 percent and aids by 66 percent 
twentynine percent said politicians and public officials not 
doing enough to provide necessary funding is the chief obstacle 
to school reform school administrators who cant decide on the 
right way to achieve the goals of reform were blamed by 25 
percent only 16 percent blamed teachers or teacher unions 
seventyone percent felt schools are having trouble attracting 
new teachers but 68 percent opposed lowering standards by allowing 
college graduates with no formal teacher training to work in public 
schools 
the poll had a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 2 
percentage points 
it was released a day after 8227 nea delegates overwhelmingly 
endorsed nea president mary hatwood futrells pet proposal that 
urged the naming of at least one school district per state as 
learning laboratories where teachers or anyone else with good 
ideas could freely experiment and take the lead in creating better 
schools 
aft delegates ratified a similar program of school 
experimentation calling for establishment of thousands of 
schools within schools where groups of six or more teachers 
could try innovative ideas free of bureaucratic meddling 
both proposals drew immediate criticism from assistant us 
secretary of education chester finn 
that they are willing to admit that things arent hunkydory 
in schools that much is good he said in a telephone interview 
but the bad part is that they seem to suggest that we need to 
have a vast experiment as if we didnt know or have the faintest 
idea of what works in schools 
even some teachers expressed doubts about the nea reform 
proposal 
im a little afraid that it may be just another experiment it 
could be limited to districts that are already innovating said 
kathleen conklin who teaches english at malcolm x shabazz high 
school in madison wis 
the nea gathering hit an emotional peak with an appearance by 
16yearold ryan white the boy with aids who gained national 
attention with his fight to have a normal public school education 
teachers can play an important role in helping an aids student 
be accepted and treated as normal as possible by teaching the 
facts not the myths he said by proper education aids can be 
a disease not a dirty word

pentagon officials who touted the aegis ship 
defense system as the most sophisticated in the world are 
scrambling to explain why it couldnt tell the difference between a 
large airbus jetliner and a far smaller f14 attack jet 
that will be one of the issues examined by an official 
investigation team headed by rear adm william n fogarty who is 
en route to the persian gulf to find out what happened 
the cruiser vincennes shot down iran air flight 655 in the 
mistaken belief that it was an attacking iranian f14 according to 
adm william j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
the incident came shortly after the vincennes had fired at 
iranian patrol boats that us officers believed had attacked the 
ships helicopter which was flying patrols in the strait of hormuz 
it was unclear whether the airbus was descending in a 
threatening manner as the vincennes skipper apparently believed 
or whether the jet actually was climbing when it was shot down 
the washington post today quoted pentagon sources whom it did 
not identify as saying that a report filed monday by another us 
navy ship the frigate sides said the iranian plane was climbing 
as iran has claimed the post said officials did not know whether 
the report from the sides or other from the vincennes saying the 
iranian plane was descending toward the ship in a pattern similar 
to one an attacking plane would make was accurate 
the vincennes is equipped with the aegis system which the navy 
has touted as the worlds most sophisticated and complex electronic 
defense 
in praising aegis naval officials have said it would permit 
navy vessels to track more potential enemy planes at greater 
distances 
the europeanbuilt airbus is far larger than the f14 which the 
united states sold to iran during the reign of the shah the airbus 
is 177 feet long compared to only 62 feet for the f14 
crowe said that difference was less apparent because the iranian 
plane was coming straight at the vincennes one of the most 
difficult problems is from a radar blip particularly from a 
headon target to identify the type of aircraft he said 
its not that surprising a mistake said a congressional 
source monday speaking on condition of anonymity the darkened 
radar screens show only lighted blips not images of planes in 
profile said the source who has witnessed demonstrations of the 
aegis system 
the blips are smaller if the plane is coming headon than they 
would be if the plane were scanned sideways the source said 
a pentagon source who had also seen aegis demonstrated agreed 
you have to know how to read the screens its not spelled out in 
simple black and white particularly if they didnt have the 
transponder on 
the transponder also known as an identification friend or 
foe device or iff sends out continuous electronic signals 
detailing the identity of a plane they are standard on all 
american commercial planes 
crowe has said us officers concluded that they were dealing 
with a military craft in past because of electronic transmissions 
from it cbs news reported monday evening that the iranian plane 
was issuing two sets of signals one civilian and one typically 
used by military craft 
crowe said the vincennes was looking specifically for f14s 
iran only has four or five working f14s but they are the most 
capable warplanes in the iranian inventory and thus are considered 
by the navy to be the most threatening iranian air weapon 
the working f14s were recently moved from northern iranian 
bases to bandar abbas chiefly because iran has suffered ground 
defeats in its war with iraq and they wanted to move the f14s 
down south where they wouldnt fall into iraqi hands said one 
source the airbus took off from bandar abbas 
another factor the sources said is that the vincennes was the 
first aegisclass cruiser to operate inside the gulf itself rather 
than from the neighboring gulf of oman or northern indian ocean 
the ship had only been in the gulf for little more than a week 
they had to be extremely alert perhaps more than they had 
been when they were operating south because they knew what an 
expensive and highvalue target the aegis ship was said one 
source 
in addition the vincennes brief tenure in the gulf meant that 
its crew wasnt used to the enormous amount of commercial traffic 
that coexists there with the military 
its incredibly busy with ships and planes and it takes a 
while to get used to it the vincennes may have been a little green 
and that means they may have been a little fast on the draw one 
official said

himself in jail a sheriffs spokesman said 
jr mcconnell 40 was discovered by a guard in a medical unit 
at the harris county jail before 4 am monday said sheriffs lt 
gl moore 
it appears he had some type of electrical cord and inserted it 
into one of the electric outlets that are of necessity in that 
medical area and inserted the other end into another electrical 
outlet and used himself to complete the circuit moore said 
it was not known how mcconnell obtained the cord but inmates 
usually purchase such items at the jails commissary moore said 
mcconnell had been in the medical ward since he tried to hang 
himself in his cell march 21 mcconnell also had heart problems 
moore added 
moore said that a note believed to be written by mcconnell was 
found on a table next to mcconnells bed 
its somewhat illegible and were attempting to decipher what 
it says but it appears it might possibly be a suicide note 
moore said 
following his march suicide attempt mcconnell said he was 
despondent over delays in his court proceedings he was being held 
on 750000 bond pending trial july 19 
mcconnell surrendered to federal authorities last november when

stress and lack of training in handling 
patient conflicts has led to a high rate of verbal and physical 
abuse of state nursing home patients a study released today says 
it doesnt help us to blame the staff that work in these 
difficult settings nurses and aides are victims of a difficult 
situation as well said university of new hampshire political 
scientist david moore 
moore and and karl pillemer of unhs family research laboratory 
conducted the anonymous survey in 1987 of 577 nurses and nurses 
aides from 32 private notforprofit and county nursing homes 
among the results 
nursing home patients had hit or thrown something at 70 
percent of those surveyed during the previous year 
fortyone percent of the staff reported being pushed grabbed 
pinched or shoved 10 times or more by patients while only 13 
percent said they never had been physically confronted by patients 
eightyone percent of the staff said they had witnessed at 
least one form of psychological patient abuse including insults 
threats of violence or isolating a patient longer than needed 
thirtysix percent of the staff had seen at least one incident 
in which physical force was used including pushing slapping and 
pinching a patient 
ten percent admitted they used negative physical actions 
against patients 6 percent said they excessively restrained a 
patient 
moore and pillemer said the source of the problem is not 
poorquality staff but too few staff high stress and lack of 
training in how to deal with conflicts with patients 
what we found is that staff members are basically 
wellmotivated and they are basically caring for people pillemer 
said but they work under what is considerable stress for 
anybody 
pillemer and moore also found that nursing homes generally deal 
with abuse problems quickly and effectively either by disciplining 
or firing the staff member 
the researchers said improving training and boosting salaries 
would help alleviate the problems

episcopal churches would be forbidden to 
discriminate against persons with aids under a resolution passed 
today by one of two houses of the churchs general convention 
the resolution prohibiting discrimination in the church on the 
basis of aids aidsrelated complex or hiv infection was approved 
unanimously by the 900member house of deputies the 200member 
house of bishops was expected to consider the resolution later 
today 
the resolution was one of seven proposals concerning the disease 
debated by convention committees one would provide 120000 over 
three years for the work of the national episcopal aids coalition 
which carries the slogan our church has aids another would 
require aids education in every episcopal congregation by the end 
of 1989 
we have to talk about condoms hivs said thaddeus bennett 
cochair of the coalition we have to be specific then we can 
evangelize and tell them about jesus if we wait to talk to someone 
on their deathbed we have waited too long 
on monday delegates heard testimony on proposed resolutions 
that would discourage abortion in most cases but support a womans 
right to abort 
many people have forgotten what it was like before legal 
abortions said diane pollard a church deputy from new york 
one resolution before the 69th general convention discourages 
abortion except in extreme cases such as problem pregnancies 
or in cases of rape the other would discourage any legislative or 
other governmental effort to remove womens right to consider 
abortion 
the legislative resolution basically restates the position of 
the general convention of 1976 said the rev neil g lebhar of 
jacksonville fla 
the resolutions were the result of a study ordered in the 1985 
general convention 
the committee adjourned for the day without acting on the 
resolutions if approved in committee the resolutions would be 
sent to the conventions 3000 delegates for action the general 
convention meets every three years to set policy for the 26 
millionmember church the convention runs through july 11 
louisa rucker executive director of the national organization 
of episcopalians for life opposed the resolution addressing 
existing law on the right to abortion saying it violated 
principles of separation of church and state for the church to take 
a stand 
but she backed the resolution supporting women who decide on 
abortion in some cases 
it encourages and calls on the church to provide help and 
support for women caught in untimely and unwanted pregnancies 
rucker said we acknowledge a legal right for women to have an 
abortion but we call on christians to a higher standard

house speaker jim wright today urged the 
reagan administration to apologize directly to iran and pay 
reparations for shooting down a passenger jet carrying 290 people 
as an iranian official said world condemnation of the united states 
might ease talk of military retaliation 
wright speaking less than 24 hours after president reagan vowed 
to keep us forces in the persian gulf despite irans threats of 
reprisals predicted that capitol hill would authorize money for 
reparations 
if that would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved 
party surely we could do that he said in london congress 
would support that if it were requested 
the senior republican on the senate armed services committee 
john warner of virginia also said the united states should pay 
reparations 
in geneva meanwhile sirous nasseri the iranian ambassador to 
the un mission there said so far as the avenge is concerned 
at this stage we really hope there will be public opinion we will 
let the public opinion and the political activities to run its 
course 
and we hope that the matter can ease itself down through a 
proper approach to the matter that is the condemnation of the act 
by the united states nasseri said in an interview on the nbctv 
today show 
irans revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said 
monday that we must all be prepared for a real war and go to the 
war fronts and fight against america and its lackeys 
and today in tehran iranian president ali khamenei said that 
the islamic republic has the right to avenge those who died 
when iran air flight 655 was shot down sunday by missiles fired 
from the us navy cruiser vincennes whose crew thought it was 
shooting at an f14 fighter about to attack the ship 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said that khamenei told 
world leaders in messages that the disaster has roused a wave of 
rage in iran and aversion to the us government 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today he could not 
say whether the united states had apologized directly to iran 
through private communications or other means 
wright interviewed by the british broadcasting corp noted 
that reagan had expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives but 
is not given to profuse apologies in any event asked if he 
ought to be the texas democrat replied yes he should be 
we close ranks so please dont ask me to try to correct the 
language of the president he said im just stating as a 
matter of fact that mr reagan is not given to acknowledging error 
its a personal trait hes gone as far as ive ever heard him go 
and he has expressed his deep regret as president of the united 
states 
warner said on abctvs good morning america today that we 
have compassion for the families of the victims and that he hopes 
this nation acts swiftly to try and compensate the families 
but he said he feels the captain of the vincennes made the 
right decision under the circumstances 
warner said that before sundays incident the vincennes had 
intelligence that khomeini said that iran may take an f14 and 
have a kamikaze attack and crash it into an american ship 
reagan on sunday sidestepped questions about compensation for 
the relatives of those who perished 
fitzwater said theres really nothing that we can do at this 
time the investigation of the accident is being conducted by 
the navy 
reagan also repeated that he regretted the incident which us 
officials said happened when the captain of the uss vincennes 
mistook the iranian a300 civilian jet for a fighter 
but reagan said he will not withdraw us forces from the area 
we want peace in the gulf but we also want the right of 
navigation of international waters he said 
were talking about an incident in which a plane on radar was 
observed coming in the direction of a ship in combat and the plane 
began lowering its altitude he said so i think it was an 
understandable accident to shoot and think that they were under 
attack from that plane 
iran accused the united states of knowingly shooting down the 
unarmed plane and requested an investigation by the montrealbased 
international civil aviation organization 
asked what he thought about that reagan replied you have to 
think about that knowing who they are 
but when asked about the iranian accusation that the navy knew 
it was firing on a passenger jet the president replied well i 
dont go much by what the iranians say ever 
there were these other related developments 
in beirut the spiritual guide for iranianbacked guerrillas 
holding foreign captives in lebanon was quoted as saying today that 
the hostages should not suffer because the us navy shot down an 
iranian jetliner 
but an anonymous caller purporting to speak for islamic jihad 
which holds americans terry anderson and thomas sutherland 
threatened to kill one of them in revenge it was not possible to 
authenticate the call islamic jihad has said it would authenticate 
its statements with photographs of the hostages 
a state department official requesting anonymity said of the 
call 
there is no confirmation that this is a legitimate thing 
an italian naval spokesman said today that an italian frigate 
in the gulf heard the vincennes radioing an approaching aircraft 
requesting identification and change of course however the 
spokesman capt alfredo saitto said the italian ship could not 
determine whether the iranian airliner was flying outside the 
commercial air corridor as italian officials had said monday 
the washington post today quoted pentagon sources whom it did 
not identify as saying that a report filed monday by another us 
navy ship the frigate sides said the iranian plane was climbing 
when it was shot down as iran has claimed the post said officials 
did not know whether the report from the sides or other from the 
vincennes saying the iranian plane was descending toward that ship 
was the accurate version of sundays events 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition they not be further 
identified said monday that the commander of the vincennes capt 
will c rogers iii had sent a message to his superiors stressing 
that he had followed procedures and would make the same decisions 
again if faced with the same situation 
rogers said in the message parts of which were made available 
today by sources that this is a burden i will carry for the rest 
of my life but i took this action to defend my ship and crew 
he added that i and i alone am responsible 
he said that he believed the incoming aircraft was 
operating in direct response to the ongoing surface engagement 
and that he had requested permission to engage at 20 nautical 
miles but held until nine when he fired two sm2 standard 
missiles at the aircraft

three buses carrying 181 poles drove 
straight from the polandaustria border to the main refugee camp 
south of vienna where the passengers asked for political asylum 
the interior ministry reported today 
the poles most of whom are likely to be turned down as 
political refugees arrived monday at the crowded camp officials 
said it was the latest group of east bloc defectors since austria 
loosened visa restrictions with poland and hungary this year 
six to eight buses stopped at traiskirchens main square 
said karl nevole spokesman for interior minister karl blecha 
all passengers of three buses got out and walked to the refugee 
camp to ask for political asylum 
the other buses left for italy but newole said it was not clear 
if they were all pilgrims or would try to defect in italy or 
elsewhere in austria 
according to the interior ministry there are 20000 recognized 
political refugees in austria in addition there are 15000 asylum 
seekers which are also supported by the government 
newole told the associated press that while in the januarymay 
period last year 126 poles asked for political asylum in austria 
the corresponding number of the same period this year was 2271 
the visa free status must not become a oneway street in the 
direction of refugee camps interior minister karl blecha was 
quoted as saying in criticizing mondays arrival of polish refugees 
he said 90 percent of all polish asylum seekers are people 
seeking to resettle in the united states or other overseas 
countries 
the government on may 9 introduced a quicker review of their 
status 
most of the poles and hungarians generally are believed not to 
qualify as refugees because they are unable to prove political 
persecution or other personal hardship in their homelands 
newole said no poles or hungarians have been deported but some 
have been persuaded to return home because they stand no chance to 
emigrate soon to the united states canada or australia

iowa gov terry branstad today said he may declare a statewide 
drought emergency unless widespread rain falls this week that 
could make some farmers eligible for lowinterest disaster loans 
and would increase the governors clout when he goes to washington 
later this week to lobby for more drought aid 
we dont want to see a lot of farm families forced back into 
bankruptcy branstad said 
federal officials have insisted it is too early to assess the 
damage from the drought but branstad said it is clear some farmers 
and crops have been hurt 
independence day traffic on the mississippi was steady with two 
groundings reported in the memphis tenn area coast guard 
spokesman dave schuster said monday 
theyre losing hundreds of thousands of dollars each day i 
guess they figure theyve got to go no matter what he said of 
towboat operators who can move fewer barges because of shallow 
spots caused by the drought 
dredging closed the river near greenville miss and north of 
memphis schuster said 
in wisconsin gov tommy g thompson has threatened to ask the 
us supreme court to halt proposals for increased diversion of 
lake michigan water to replenish the shrinking mississippi 
an aide said the governor fears temporary diversion through 
chicago and down the illinois river in response to the current 
drought might become a permanent practice he said the move is also 
a feint to get more water to disperse river waste in the chicago 
area 
thompson had received reports the army corps of engineers might 
quadruple the diversion at chicago in the next few days to fight 
the lowwater conditions troubling mississippi river barge tows 
said james klauser secretary of the department of administration 
the navigation of sewage down the chicago river is the only 
navigation issue here he said its solely a matter of 
flushing chicago 
illinois gov james r thompson originated the appeal to federal 
authorities to divert more lake michigan water to the mississippi 
watershed 
in louisiana environmental officials said they would monitor 
the mississippi more closely for salt and toxic substances as the 
drought continues to decrease the freshwater flow 
were concerned about the toxics going down the river and are 
seriously taking a look at it now said maureen oneill of the 
department of environmental quality said in baton rouge were 
not seeing the same dilution factor normally present 
levels of toxic substances still are low but the environmental 
agency will increase monthly sampling to weekly oneill said 
communities that get their drinking water from the lower part of 
the mississippi are seeing chloride concentrations rise as salt 
water moves rapidly up the river she said 
in st louis the low level of the mississippi helped the delta 
queen recapture the glory it had lost in recent years by churning 
to victory in an annual riverboat race 
the mississippi queen trailed the delta queen in the halfmile 
race to the gateway arch 
the record river low worked to our advantage because the 
mississippi queen is heavier delta queen captain garland 
shewmaker said

church of england leaders today voted in favor of 
draft legislation to admit women to the priesthood despite 
opposition from their spiritual head archbishop of canterbury 
robert runcie 
the vote at the annual general synod of bishops clergy and 
laity was 299 to 216 
earlier runcie drew loud applause from the 574 participants 
when he warned that the legislation would divide the church and 
many observers believed the proposal would be defeated 
the synod today opened its threeday summer session at church 
house westminster 
during the debate runcie said that although he favored the 
principle of women priests he believed the terms of the proposal 
would cause a kind of legislative schism 
the archbishop said he believed theological arguments now tip 
the balance in favor of women priests but added that the wording 
of the draft legislation would not serve the cause of womens 
ordination or the spiritual health of the church he was 
referring to proposed rules which would allow parishes and dioceses 
to refuse to be ministered to by women priests 
the archbishop is the spiritual head of the anglican state 
church and leader of the worlds 70 million anglicans including 3 
million us episcopalians 
runcie said earlier that the priesthood actually may be weakened 
by being solely male 
i have come to the judgment that the ordination of women to 
the priesthood would actually be an enlargement of the catholic 
universal priesthood an opening up of priesthood rather than 
its overturning he said 
the english church still bars women priests although anglican 
churches in other countries have ordained about 1000 women 
according to englands movement for the ordination of women 
churches ordaining women include the us episcopalians and 
anglicans in canada new zealand hong kong brazil kenya and 
uganda 
opponents say there is nothing in the bible to support women 
priests that jesus christ had only male apostles and for nearly 
2000 years the church ordained only men 
speakers in favor of women priests at todays debate outnumbered 
opponents by four to one a majority of the 53 diocesan and deputy 
bishops are in favor of women priests but some including sections 
of the clergy and laity are opposed 
law lecturer david mcclean in moving the proposals said the 
idea of women priests is not going to go away there is nothing in 
the experience of the anglican communion to support any such 
notion 
mcclean of sheffield university is chairman of the synods 
house of laity and opened the debate in the crowded assembly hall 
new proposals include giving a bishop who opposes women priests 
the right to bar them in his diocese and to pay up to 51000 
compensation to priests who leave the church over the issue on 
grounds of conscience 
the draft legislation will be referred to revision committees 
and then to all 44 diocesan synods it will return to the general 
synod for another vote and must then be approved by parliament 
parliament which by law established the anglican church and 
made the british monarch its temporal head has the final say on 
such legislation and on all other matters of church doctrine 
if all stages are passed without delay the church of englands 
first woman priest may be ordained in 1992 or 1993

financial information according to sources

an asset to the democratic ticket and was more qualified than 
others being considered for the no 2 spot he declined to say 
whether he pushed for the offer during his monday night discussions 
with probable presidential nominee dukakis nor whether he would 
accept such an offer

convinced that my presence would unleash more hope in this country 
regain more people the fact of the matter is i would be an 
asset 
he left for new york afations with the dukakis campaign 
over convention issues 
today jackson still wouldnt say whether he would accept the 
vice presidential nomination but he went to great lengths to 
distinguish himself from others being considered 
the others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond 
their districts or beyond their home states jackson said i 
bring the sense of creativity new history 
on monday both bush and dukakis said they were saddened by the 
shooting down of an iran air airbus over the persian gulf all 290 
aboard were killed iran said 
bush who waited a day before speaking out on the incident said 
monday at a stop in elmwood park ill that he could identify 
with the dilemma faced by the captain of the uss vincennes 
the vessels captain will rogers iii told the pentagon he 
believed his ship was under attack by an iranian warplane 
the vice president who was a world war ii pilot was asked how 
the navy cruisers sophisticated radar equipment could have failed 
to distinguish between the widebodied airliner and a small f14 
fighter which was believed to be the target 
ever been in combat bush snapped combat is quite 
ifferent than the laboratory 
he said he did not expect us policy in the gulf to change as a 
result of the incident life goes on the vice president said 
bush made campaign stops outside detroit and chicago and in st 
louis before heading home to washington monday night he had spent 
the weekend at his summer home in kennebunkport maine 
the vice president was in kennebunkport when word of the gulf 
incident was relayed to washington sunday he spoke with president 
reagan in a conference call that afternoon spokeswoman sheila tate 
said and was meeting with the president today at the white house 
dukakis in a fourth of july speech at the navys oldest 
commissioned warship the uss constitution berthed near boston 
called for an end to the iraniraq war 
i believe that the united states must take the lead to 
stop this war permanently he said dukakis also warned iran that 
this is no time for acts of terror or revenge in response to the 
incident 
jackson reacted to the incident by criticizing reagan 
administration policy in the persian gulf calling it failed and 
vague he urged the president to promptly offer reparations to 
the families of the victims 
reagan said monday he would await the results of a pentagon 
investigation of the incident 
jackson also said there was no evidence that the vincennes 
was under attack at the time of the incident and compared the 
shooting down of the iranian airliner to the soviet downing of a 
korean air lines jetliner in 1983 
both reagan and the pentagon have said such comparisons are 
unfair because sundays incident occurred in a war zone and 
because the navy repeatedly radioed warnings to the approaching 
iranian plane neither was the case in the kal incident 
when the kal was shot down we did not accept those arguments 
as being valid and most people in the world will not accept our 
arguments to this point as being valid jackson said

at least two other mixups with civilian 
planes by us warships occurred in the persian gulf air corridor 
one of the worlds busiest before the uss vincennes shot down an 
iranian airliner american sources said tuesday 
all 290 people on the airbus 300 were killed when the plane was 
hit sunday a sixman team of us experts led by an admiral 
arrived tuesday to begin a confidential investigation 
dozens of aircraft fly over the gulf each day many on 
longdistance flights between europe and asia with stops at dubai 
bahrain or kuwait the iran air jet was on a regularly scheduled 
short hop across the strait of hormuz from bandar abbas to dubai 
us officials have said the vincennes fired two antiaircraft 
missiles at the plane in the mistaken belief it was an iranian f14 
fighter iran says the navy shot the plane down intentionally 
a us officer said privately he knew of an incident about a 
month ago in which an airliner thought an american warship was 
trying to order it to change course when the ship was talking by 
radio to a different plane 
the problem was bleedover from one frequency to another 
which sometimes happens because of harmonics he said the ship 
was trying to determine the position and identity of an aircraft a 
noncommercial plane and this other aircraft heard it and thought 
the ship was talking to it 
he would not reveal the ship involved but said he was unaware 
of any incident involving the vincennes the officer said he did 
not know what airline owned the jet involved 
about 16 us warships are in the gulf at a given time people 
on the bridge of one last month counted the lights of about 20 
highflying aircraft in an hour 
another us military source described an incident in midjune 
in which a us missile frigate making its first trip into the 
gulf through the strait of hormuz briefly locked its weapons radar 
on an airliner but quickly realized the mistake 
the best explanation for something like that is 
inexperience said the informant who also insisted his name not 
be used 
these crews are always nervous when they come into the gulf 
for the first time he said they know its a war zone but 
they dont know exactly what to expect and one thing they dont 
seem to get the word on is how much commercial air traffic there is 
out here 
the washington post said tuesday the vincennes which arrived in 
the gulf may 27 figured in an incident last month in which it 
attempted to redirect a jetliner in a way that caused united 
arab emirates officials to fear a collision of two commercial 
planes 
quoting an air traffic control official in the emirates it did 
not identify the paper said the incident june 8 resulted in an 
official protest to the us embassy in abu dhabi it said the 
embassy declined comment 
the officer who said he had no reports of incidents involving 
the vincennes added if it had happened i would know about it 
us navy spokesmen refused comment on all the reports 
american military sources said the investigating team had an 
initial 15day mandate but would remain as long as it takes to 
find out what happened they said the members would work in total 
secrecy and make no public statements 
theyre going behind closed doors and stay there said a 
us navy spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
leading the investigation is rear adm william m fogarty who 
once commanded the battleship new jersey and now is plans and 
policy director at us central command in tampa fla 
administrative headquarters for us military affairs in 19 
countries of the middle east and north africa 
a lawyer and technical specialists all military officers also 
are on the team one member is an expert on the aegis system of 
computerlinked radar and weapons aboard the vincennes 
navy spokesmen said the itinerary was not yet set up but 
other officials said investigators would visit the vincennes and 
interview capt will c rogers iii and other officers under oath 
rogers who has commanded the vincennes for more than a year 
was reported by pentagon sources to have told his superiors he 
acted to defend my ship and my crew and would do it the same 
again in the same circumstances 
this is a burden that i will carry the rest of my life i 
alone am responsible he said according to the washington 
reports 
airborne observers said ship traffic in the southern gulf 
appeared normal tuesday and a convoy of usflagged tankers was 
sighted off ras alkhaimah in the emirates heading for hormuz 
it included a kuwaiti tanker with us registration the 
81283ton sea isle city the navychartered tanker patriot and the 
missile frigate robert g bradley associated press photographer 
greg english reported eleven kuwaiti tankers have us 
registration and the navy has escorted them since last july 
other traffic included two threeship groups of japanese 
tankers one moving in each direction and a greek tanker sailing 
parallel to the us convoy

irans un ambassador called today for an 
urgent meeting of the security council to condemn the united states 
for shooting down an iranian passenger jet 
ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati also told a news 
conference that contrary to assertions of us officials the 
iranian airbus with 290 people aboard was sending out normal 
signals to all radar that it was a civilian plane 
mahallati said an apology from the united states cannot wash 
away the blood but said the reagan administration should 
apologize withdraw immediately from the persian gulf and take a 
neutral stand in the iraniraq war 
he said he met today with security council president paulo 
nogueirabatista of brazil and requested an urgent meeting of the 
council on sundays attack on the jetliner by the us missile 
cruiser vincennes 
the united states says the ships commander mistakenly believed 
the civilian aircraft was an f14 jet fighter preparing to attack 
his ship president reagan says the united states will not withdraw 
from the gulf 
mahallati said the security council should call on the united 
states to immediately withdraw its forces from the persian gulf 
to terminate this kind of barbarism 
he denounced the disaster as premeditated action by the 
united states and condemned the awkward logic in the us coverup 
story about mistaken identity 
mahallati said iranian military officials told him that the 
plane for 14 minutes was disseminating the normal signals of 
all civilian planes have which proves to any radar that this is a 
civilian plane 
the question is how the most sophisticated american warship in 
the persian gulf could not receive it he said 
the iranian envoy said that the attack on the airliner would not 
affect irans efforts to improve its relations with other 
countries we dont mix our relations with one country and 
another they are independent he said 
earlier today iran formally demanded that the united nations 
condemn the united states for shooting down the iran air jetliner 
in a letter lodging a formal protest with the world body 
foreign minister aliakbar velayati of iran said the united nations 
should condemn this barbaric massacre of innocent civilian 
passengers and take immediate measures to prevent further 
occurrence of such carnage 
the letter dated monday and distributed today said this is 
only possible through compelling the united states to remove its 
expansionist naval forces from the persian gulf 
it said secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar immediately 
should organize an investigation on the extent of this latest 
american atrocity 
on monday perez de cuellar issued a statement in geneva saying 
he cannot but condemn what appears to have been a tragic error 
and called for the greatest restraint in this difficult moment

an old mansion that was once the headquarters 
of the cleveland chapter of the universal negro improvement 
association will be razed unless 300000 can be raised soon to 
save it officials say 
the building is one of the most visible legacies in cleveland of 
marcus garvey the black nationalist who ran an international 
shipping line in the 1920s 
the 106yearold mansion became vacant in 1982 when unia members 
could no longer afford to pay utilities and other expenses 
the cleveland chapter which once had thousands of members now 
draws fewer than 10 members at monthly meetings one reason local 
politicians feel no urgency to help mason a hargrave unias 
national president save the building 
clevelands board of building standards wants to demolish the 
building because it is a safety hazard and an eyesore arsonists 
keep setting it on fire and vandals have hit several times 
hargrave has appealed three rulings from the board of building 
standards placing the mansion on demolition lists each time he has 
won a 120day reprieve to come up with money to renovate the 
building 
the mansion is on the national register of historic places but 
city officials say they cannot wait for clevelands unia chapter to 
raise 300000 needed to restore the mansion 
the building is not scheduled for demolition yet said 
damian borkowski assistant administrator of the city bureau of 
demolition building standards is holding a meeting next week and 
could rule on mr hargraves appeal 
hargrave said he believes cleveland owes unia a commitment to 
save the mansion because of the work the group has done over the 
years including free lunches and tutoring for school children 
both of which were popular unia programs before the organization 
fell on hard times

firefighters in california michigan montana wyoming and utah 
battled holiday weekend fires which blackened more than 6000 acres 
of forest and wilderness areas 
illegal fireworks were blamed for a blaze that swept over 2200 
rugged acres of stanislaus national forest in california 10 miles 
west of yosemite national park the fire which began saturday was 
declared contained this morning 
we have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket 
said mary hale a spokeswoman for the california department of 
forestry 
the fire was the largest in the forest this year stanislaus was 
the scene of huge wildfires last summer 
in southern utahs scenic zion national park firefighters tried 
today to contain a 600acre fire that was ignited by lightning june 
19 but had been allowed to burn in a small area 
however on sunday winds ranging from 30 mph to 60 mph fanned 
the flames out of control chief ranger bob andrew said 
firefighters assisted by watercarrying aircraft expected to have 
the blaze contained by midday no injuries or property damage were 
reported 
a fourday fire in 1100 acres of hiawatha national park in the 
upper peninsula of michigan was also said to be under control 
although continued hot dry weather could mean weeks before the fire 
is extinguished 
its been real quiet out there sgt terry leisening of the 
delta county sheriffs department said today i think theyve got 
it just about out 
us forest service spokesman dale bluedorn agreed but said 
they will continue to keep patrolling it may not be declared out 
until theres a threeday rain he said monday 
a small contingent of firefighters who hiked into the 
absarokabeartooth wilderness on monday in southcentral montana 
contained portions of a 2000acre fire that has been burning there 
since june 19 forest officials said 
forest service policy allows wilderness fires to burn unless 
they threaten trails or structures or threaten to burn outside the 
wilderness boundary 
the firefighters were called in to stop the flames as they 
neared the stillwater river trail inside the wilderness area high 
winds saturday tripled the fires size 
phil jaquith beartooth district ranger for the custer national 
forest said the bulk of the fire on the east banks of the 
stillwater river was not being suppressed 
cooler temperatures and calmer wind played a role in getting the 
blaze contained on the west riverbank which is about two miles 
from the trail jaquith said 
threequarters of an inch of rain on monday helped slow a fire 
on 1650 acres in the shoshone national forest in wyoming and rain 
also damped fires in yellowstone national park 
fire information officer dave damron said water was also being 
pumped out of bogs in the shoshone forest to help contain the fire 
firefighters concentrated on keeping the fire entering the du noir 
special management area a few miles to the north damron said 
meanwhile a fire which burned 8700 acres in the tonto national 
forest north of phoenix ariz was reported extinguished on monday

outofcourt settlements to survivors of 
57 soldiers killed in a 1985 arrow air crash have averaged nearly 
twice the amount paid in major airline crashes from 1970 to 1984 
the courierjournal reported tuesday 
the newspaper examined cases settled since january 1987 and said 
the arrow air cases were settled for an average of 663000 
ranging from 171000 to 15 million 
the litigation arose from a dec 12 1985 crash at gander 
newfoundland that killed all eight crew members and 248 troops on 
board the soldiers members of the 101st airborne division were 
returning to fort campbell after six months in the middle east 
all 130 lawsuits filed in us district court for western 
kentucky have been settled and one case in florida is pending 
for trial 
citing a court order and other reasons arrows insurer has 
declined to disclose the value of settlements but the newspaper 
calculated the size of some accords based on contributions by 
plaintiffs lawyers to a fund that covers litigation expenses 
since jan 12 1987 the lawyers have been required to place 05 
percent of settlements in the fund 
an extrapolation of those figures shows that since that date 
arrows insurer associated aviation underwriters paid 378 
million to settle the 57 cases the newspaper said 
john martin associated aviation underwriters attorney 
confirmed the settlement values calculated by the newspaper 
geneva parris liaison counsel for the plaintiffs also 
confirmed the figures she said the accords struck after january 
1987 were generally higher than those reached before then 
a rand corp study found an average of 362943 was paid for 
passengers killed in major airline crashes from 1970 to 1984 
although that average has risen dramatically in the 1980s the 
arrow settlements still exceed the 500000 figure the national law 
journal has reported was paid from 1980 to 1984 
martin said the arrow settlements are generally in line with 
those negotiated after other recent airline disasters 
but plaintiffs lawyers including richard brown a partner of 
san franciscos melvin belli and secretary of the aviation section 
of the association of trial lawyers of america say the arrow 
awards exceed recent averages 
lee kreindler a leading aviation lawyer said the settlements 
are noteworthy because the arrow passengers were soldiers with 
lower earning potential than many other victims of air disasters 
such as business executives 
members of the plaintiffs team attributed the relatively large 
arrow settlements to the generosity of associated and to a kentucky 
law that allows for liberal recovery of future earnings

us and philippine officials tuesday 
began a review of the labor agreement covering six american bases 
whose closure would directly affect about 68000 filipino workers 
the bases are the secondlargest employer in the philippines 
after the government 
the review of the base labor agreement is to determine the wages 
and rights of filipino workers on the usrun clark air base 
subic bay naval base and four other smaller facilities in the 
philippines 
in april officials from both sides began an overall 
reexamination of the 1947 agreement which allows the united 
states to operate the six military bases in the phillipines and 
expires in 1991 the officials agreed to discuss the labor issue in 
a separate review 
the future of the facilities in the philippines is 
uncertain us ambassador nicholas platt said at opening 
ceremonies to tuesdays session there are many in both 
countries who believe the facilities should be removed this will 
have a direct impact on each worker his family and his 
community 
the panel is expected to demand higher wages the right of 
workers to strike and bargain collectively and the application of 
philippine labor laws to the filipino workers in the bases sources 
at the department of foreign affairs said 
us negotiators are expected to oppose the demands citing a 
provision in the agreement that allows washington unhampered 
operations in the bases 
the united states information service says the six bases employ 
68514 filipinos for a total annual salary of about 96 million 
the manila government receives about 180 million annually in 
military and economic aid from washington in exchange for the use 
of the bases but philippine negotiators are asking the united 
states to increase the aid package for the remaining three years of 
the agreement 
foreign secretary raul manglapus who heads the philippine 
panel said before the talks that 12 billion annually would be a 
realistic increase

a gun club must pay a woman 100 in damages for 
denying her membership application in 1980 and admit her as a full 
member the massachusetts supreme court ruled tuesday 
the concord rod and gun club inc had appealed a massachusetts 
commission against discrimination order affirmed by a lower court 
that donna page was unconstitionally excluded from the allmale 
club 
the club argued that it was not public under the definition 
of state antidiscrimination laws 
membership in the club was limited to 300 people 70 percent of 
whom lived in or around concord applicants had to be at least 21 
years old or have parental permission to join had to be eligible 
for a state sporting license and at least at the time page applied 
for membership had to be male 
however the justices wrote there were no other stated 
restrictions on eligibility and noted a commission conclusion that 
obtaining sponsorship and cosponsorship was easy to do and was 
tantamount to acceptance of an applicant as a member of the club 
every one of the 52 male applicants in 1980 the year page 
applied and 1981 were accepted the court said 
while it is true that several factors tend to show that the 
club is not open to and does not accept the patronage of the 
general public the determinative factor in this case is the 
total absense of genuine selectivity of membership the justices 
said in a unanimous decision by justice francis p oconnor

gov mario cuomo notebook and tape 
recorder in hage one elite welltodo and often associated with 
government officials the other poor and struggling 
this city long regarded as a pioneer for black progress and a 
center for nearly every aspect of black culture and politics is 
faced with a deteroriating relationship between the two classes of 
blacks 
one source of the problem is that blacks do not control the 
economic pursestrings in atlanta even though they hold top 
political offices according to lyndon wade executive director of 
the atlanta urban league 
you cannot run a city with politics alone you must have an 
economic base to make it go thats why theres a lot of pressure 
in the older black community said wade 
tensions between the two classes begin early according to 
morehouse college sociologist anna grant in school poor children 
start to understand that some of their black classmates enjoy 
material advantages inaccessible to them since the citys elected 
black officials usually are among the elite the poor come to view 
government and the elite as one 
poor blacks feel especially betrayed at slights from a black 
administration said mrs grant and in may their mistrust showed 
at the ballot box when voters overwhelmingly defeated a 308 
million proposal for improving roads schools police protection 
and other major services 
elected black leaders who had heavily promoted the bond issue in 
their own circles denounced the vote at a blacktie victory 
party however another group of black officials who had pushed 
for rejection in the citys poorer areas celebrated with 
cornbread pig neckbones and sprite 
this is a new political day in atlanta shouted maverick 
city councilman hosea williams this is the death of black elite 
control of atlanta 
atlanta homeowners already chafed by a sudden reassessment that 
raised property taxes for thousands said they voted against the 
plan because they werent told exactly where the 308 million would 
go 
the election was a slap in the face to members of the black 
elite long accustomed to controlling the black vote according to 
mrs grant who said the message was they cant assume that they 
speak for all blacks 
atlantas black leadership had put forth a united front in 1972 
to support maynard jacksons successful bid to become the citys 
first black mayor two years later disputes began to divide the 
old guard of business and civic leaders and a newer class of young 
professionals 
jacksons administration weathered a police cheating scandal 
the serial murders of young blacks and a crime rate that soared 
each year giving the city a national reputation for lawlessness 
these problems ravaged the black community and by the end of the 
jackson administration poorer communities were accusing him of not 
seeking solutions 
history has repeated itself 
the young professionals of the 1970s are now being lumped with 
the old elite by young professionals of the 1980s most of whom 
migrated from other areas to create their own brand of atlantan 
said mrs grant who advised jackson on annexation issues 
those of the new group who live in the city now chide mayor 
andrew young about his globetrotting and lack of attention to 
municipal issues 
his administration has endured a grand jury probe of the way 
police handled charges of cocaine use among prominent blacks a 
series of police shootings of poor blacks and the extortion 
convictions of two black fulton county commissioners now the poor 
accuse young of a lack of concern for the disadvantaged 
they were handed the same promises before blacks came to 
power but they expected blacks to keep their promises mrs 
grant said theres a struggle for greater accountability its 
making people ask are we better off because we have blacks in 
power positions or are we no better off 
wade of the urban league said the citys blacks arent helped 
when suburban financial interests that wield economic control tout 
the city as one with good race relations and a thriving black 
community 
atlantas glowing reputation as a new south capital brought 
346000 new jobs 15 billion in new investments and 78000 people 
to the metropolitan area in 1987 
however newly arrived blacks find a confusing blend of atlanta 
the metro area where 1980 census figures show 25 percent of 21 
million residents are black and the city itself where the census 
showed 67 percent of 430500 residents are black and 275 percent 
of residents live below the poverty line 
its not the case that all atlanta blacks live good wade 
said atlanta is very deceptive name three buildings over two 
stories high that are owned by blacks yes atlanta has a long 
history of blacks being involved in the core life of the city but 
when you talk about are we truly truly making the kind of progress 
that one would expect then i would have to say the answer is no 
still he said a lot of people get caught up in the potential 
for change and the potential for great things that keeps everybody 
here

an agreement opening japan to more american 
beef and citrus was signed tuesday by officials of the two 
countries 
us trade representative clayton yeutter called it a great 
day for american agriculture a great day for japanese consumers 
nobuo matsunaga japans ambassador to the united states said 
the pact marked an end to the decadelong trade issue between the 
two governments 
the agreement which was reached last month during negotiations 
in tokyo will open the door gradually over the next few years to 
more us beef and citrus and move away from the restrictive quota 
system that has been in effect 
earlier demands that japan allow sales of us rice were dropped 
in reaching the settlement on beef and citrus 
yeutter said he hoped japan would relent on allowing rice 
imports but that such discussions would be more appropriate in the 
current uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
matsunaga said japan has made it clear that we will not refuse 
to discuss the matter of rice in gatt negotiations on condition 
that other participating countries are prepared to discuss their 
own agricultural policies 
the commerce department has estimated that annual us beef 
exports to japan could grow to around 1 billion a year from about 
550 million now sales of oranges and juice now less than 100 
million could rise to more than 150 million it says 
yeutter said in a statement that the signing was a historic 
development for both countries 
it settles one of our most controversial bilateral disputes 
he said just as important it demonstrates that japan is 
accepting even more responsibility as a major trading nation 
yeutter noted that the agreement not only commits japan to 
increase access and eliminate nontariff barriers to trade in beef 
oranges and orange juice but reducess tariffs on a variety of other 
products including lemons grapefruit and nuts 
in a formal exchange of letters dated july 5 matsunaga said the 
government of japan intends to implement marketopening 
measures as indicated by the agreement and will be prepared to 
hold consultations annually with the united states to discuss how 
the arrangement is faring 
yeutter said in his letter that gatt officials have been 
notified of the withdrawal of a us complaint regarding japanese 
import restrictions on beef fresh oranges and orange juice the 
florida citrus industry also has withdrawn a petition calling for a 
us investigation of japanese restrictions on fresh oranges and 
juice he said 
sen max baucus dmont called the agreement a big win for 
beef producers and japanese consumers but cautioned that the 
united states must ensure the agreement is carried out properly 
this is but the first step in what must be a sustained effort 
to increase beef exports baucus said in a statement constant 
pressure on japan by congress the administration and private 
groups finally paid off

world chess champion garri kasparov said 
tuesday he was troubled by the ethnic problems in his home republic 
of azerbaijan and that they have been simmering under the surface 
there for 20 years 
kasparov also said mikhail s gorbachev has played 
brilliantly in setting his reform programs in motion and said 
that if chess terms were applied to politicians the soviet leader 
would be rated a grandmaster 
kasparov who is half armenian but lives in baku the capital of 
azerbaijan says he is always trying to find a compromise an 
acceptable solution for both sides in the dispute between 
armenians and azerbaijanis 
armenians are predominantly christian and have clashed with 
azerbaijanis who are mostly shiite moslem the armenians demand 
that the region of nagornokarabakh in azerbaijan be annexed to 
armenia 
speaking in english the 25yearold chess champion said the 
regional dispute was a real problem for 20 years but had been 
kept underground until recently 
he suggested one acceptable solution might be to give the 
biggest posible autonomy for nagornokabarakh within azerbaijan 
he said allowing the region to secede could be seen by soviet 
authorities as too dangerous since similar problems exist in soviet 
central asia the baltic republics and western ukraine 
kasparov in an interview with the associated press following 
his victory in the world cup chess tournament that ended monday 
said he kept up with events from the national communist party 
conference in moscow by telephoning the capital and listening over 
the receiver to speeches from the meeting that were broadcast on 
soviet tv 
kasparov said many people in moscow are illinformed about the 
the southern republics 
its another world he said how can you understand people 
in rio de janeiro when you are living in new york 
kasparov denounced the violence committed by azerbaijani mobs 
against armenians in the coastal city of sumgait on feb 28 at 
least 32 people were killed mostly armenians one rioter was 
sentenced on may 16 to 15 years in prison and others are expected 
to be tried on charges stemming from the riots 
sumgait was a big criminal event maybe one of the biggest in 
our history kasparov said adding that he supported the 
punishment of those involved in the violence 
gorbachev in a speech at the beginning of the conference 
denounced demands for border changes in armenia and azerbaijan

an atheist who was convicted of drunken 
driving claims that his constitutional rights were violated when he 
was ordered to attend meetings of alcoholics anonymous 
aas reference to a higher spirit and spiritual 
fellowship during meetings is at the heart of the dispute 
john norfolk 47 contends that being forced to attend aa 
meetings violates his rights under the first amendment which says 
that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion or prohbiting the free exercise thereof 
queen annes county district judge john t clark had given 
norfolk the choice of attending aa meetings once a week as part of 
his probation from his conviction or spending 20 days in jail 
the american civil liberties union which is representing 
norfolk maintains the meetings preach religious healing and the 
state cant force anyone to to attend a religious gathering the 
group has asked clark to review the sentence 
ellen luff norfolks attorney said we are not attacking aa 
at all what were saying is that the state has no right to send 
someone who is an atheist to a theist meeting 
they dont talk about drinking they talk about god 50 percent 
of the time said norfolk i might as well be going to church 
on sundays or listening to jimmy swaggart 
however myrna mccusker clinical supervisor at the alcohol 
services division of the county health department said the program 
is not religious having gone through the program herself she 
said aa is what works best for most people i tried everything 
else but nothing worked 
mccusker said she complained about the reference to god at aa 
meetings 15 years ago when she went for treatment and it allowed 
me to keep on drinking 
stuart comstockgay aclu director in maryland said there have 
been a few cases in maryland where the aa treatment program has 
been challenged in lower courts and the judge has ordered the 
driver to attend an alternative program thats what were hoping

two rival leaflets signed by the same 
clandestine arab leaders were distributed in the occupied 
territories tuesday and some palestinians said the conflicting 
directives were an attempt to plunge the arab uprising into 
disarray 
the leaflets both signed by the plolinked united national 
leadership of the uprising sparked confusion among palestinians 
but it was not known if the contradictory orders signaled a rift 
among leaders of the nearly 7monthold rebellion 
israeli troops meanwhile shot and wounded a 17yearold arab 
in the chest in the west bank city of nablus officials of the 
citys al ittihad hospital said 
the army confirmed the casualty and said the soldiers opened 
fire after arab youths hurled rocks at them from a rooftop in the 
nablus marketplace 
since the uprising began dec 8 against israels 21year 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 215 palestinians and 
four israelis have been killed 
also tuesday arabs observed a ploordered general strike that 
shut down shops halted public transportation and turned cities in 
the occupied territories and arab east jerusalem into virtual ghost 
towns 
most of about 120000 palestinians who work in israel also 
stayed away from their jobs arab radio reports said 
some palestinians told the associated press the conflicting 
leaflets were aimed at plunging the arab uprising into disarray by 
creating confusion among palestinians over which directive to obey 
they speculated that one of the leaflets was planted by israeli 
security officials to spark dissension among palestinians and give 
the appearance that underground leaders were divided but they 
disagreed over which one was fake 
army officials declined comment 
the palestinians rejected the possibility that the leaflets were 
a sign of infighting among uprising leaders since the unrest 
began palestinians have repeatedly stressed that they are united 
behind their leadership 
someone is trying his best to make people start questioning 
how many leaderships we have the aim is to create problems said 
mahdi abdul hadi the head of an east jerusalembased group of 
palestinian academics 
who benefits from such problems the israelis they can say 
look at those palestinians disagreeing with each other they dont 
know what they want until now he said 
one leaflet called for a general strike friday and another 
sevenday strike beginning sunday while the other ordered only a 
twoday strike over the weekend 
one leaflet also addressed a rift between the palestine 
liberation organization and more radical palestinian factions over 
whether to endorse peace negotiations with israel 
the leaflet praised a statement by plo deputy abu shariff 
advocating negotiations and the creation of a palestinian state 
alogside israel shariffs statement has prompted sharp criticism 
from radical palestinian leaders 
arab journalist daoud kuttab said raising the abu shariff 
statement was bound to create discord no matter who issued the 
leaflets 
this is like a hot potato so taking any position is a formula 
for internal fighting said kuttab who writes for the 
palestinian daily asinnara which is published in nazareth 
it would indicate a rift in the uprising leadership if the 
leaflet is genuine but it means nothing if the israelis forged it 
my feeling is the aim was to create confusion kuttab said in an 
interview 
also tuesday the army blew up two homes in the biblical town of 
bethlehem the houses belonged to arabs suspected of staging 
firebomb attacks the military command said 
we shall reach any man who has thrown a firebomb in cold 
blood intending to kill everyone here brig gen gabi ofir a 
west bank commander told israel army radio 
economics minister gad yaakobi blamed the uprising for an 
economic slowdown in israel saying it had cost the same amount as 
the countrys real growth or about 3 percent to 35 percent of the 
gross national product of 27 billion the percentage equals about 
900 million 
in may israeli officials said the uprising had cost israel 
about 560 million in lost tourist income uncollected taxes and 
added military expenses

a court on tuesday recessed the 
trial of a lebanese shiite moslem accused in the 1985 hijacking of 
a twa airliner after he refused to take part in the first day of 
proceedings 
mohammed ali hamadi who is charged with murder and air piracy 
cited disputes over his interpreter and his legal representation 
for his refusal to participate 
i dont say anything important until we have an interpreter 
he said in broken german the trial is scheduled to resume thursday 
west german attorney rainer hamm said the parents of us navy 
diver robert stethem of waldorf md who was killed in the 17day 
hijacking were in the courtroom for the first day of the session 
stethem was among 39 americans held hostage when four armed men 
hijacked the twa plane on june 14 1985 on a flight from athens to 
rome and forced it to land in beirut 
hamm who represents 11 americans who have intervened to 
prosecute the case said he hopes richard and patricia stethems 
presence would be seen as a gesture of trust and not of 
mistrust in the german judicial system 
but hamm said the location of the trial in west germany was 
influenced by terrorists in hamadis circles who had taken two 
west germans hostage in lebanon after hamadis arrest in frankfurt 
in 1987 
the crime has been committed but it has not yet ended hamm 
said 
west german businessmen rudolf cordes and alfred schmidt were 
kidnapped in beirut lebanon a few days after hamadi was arrested 
at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 
government officials later admitted concern for the two 
kidnapped men influenced a west german decision not to extradite 
hamadi to the united states to stand trial there 
schmidt was released in september in what his captors said was a 
goodwill gesture but cordes remains a hostage 
hamadis older brother abbas ali hamadi was sentenced in april 
by a duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping schmidt 
and cordes in beirut in a bid to gain freedom for his brother 
the cleanshaven hamadi entered the highsecurity courtroom 
wearing a light blue shirt no tie and blue trousers he previously 
had worn a beard 
several hundred heavily armed policemen were on the scene and 
about 60 spectators and 80 journalists were searched twice before 
entering the courtroom inside preungesheim prison 
during the session interrupted twice to study defense motions 
and another time when hamadi said he had a headache the defendent 
refused to answer when questioned about his birthplace and age 
hamadi in his only statements gave his name and requested the 
defense lawyer and an interpreter who was familiar with his arabic 
dialect the court declined both requests 
the frankfurt juvenile court will first look into the question 
of hamadis age to determine whether he should be tried as a 
juvenile young adult or adult under west german law a juvenile 
is less than age 18 an adult is age 21 and older and a young 
adult is between 18 and 21 
depending on various rulings on age and maturity questions 
hamadi could face anywhere from 15 years to life in prison if 
convicted 
the west german indictment lists hamadis birthdate as june 13 
1964 making him 21 years old at the time of the hijacking hamadi 
also has claimed he was born in 1966

for generations new yorkers have relied on the 
sidewalk newsstand for daily doses of truth blaze kills 5 
firemen beauty beauty secrets from a top model and 
street smarts 
vito gasparo has been dispensing all three from the corner of 
47th street and sixth avenue for 41 years and right now his street 
smarts tell him that mayor edward i koch is crazy in the head 
gasparos concern for the mayors sanity stems from a koch 
administration proposal that could put as many as 80 percent of the 
citys newsstands out of business 
the proposal would change the requirements for newsstands so 
that they would have to be for example at least 25 feet from the 
nearest subway entrance and two feet from a curb manhole parking 
meter or telephone pole 
city planners say the newsstands block pedestrian traffic and 
contribute to congestion on the sidewalks a charge that few would 
dispute 
were concerned if a newsstand blocks the free egress of a 
crosswalk explained victor ross a city transportation 
department spokesman were also concerned if the stand so 
constricts space that people dont have anyplace to walk on the 
sidewalk 
a casual inspection of manhattan newsstands suggests that few 
could comply with the new rules 
the impact would be incredibly disastrous on what is left of 
the newsstand industry in this city said robert s bookman a 
lawyer who represents the new york city newsstand operators 
association 
new yorks 280 or so newsstands dispense more than a sometimes 
staggering selection of newspapers and magazines many also sell 
candy sodas maps baseball caps or cheap jewelry 
newsstand operators give directions to tourists provide a 
comforting beacon of light on dark streets and some people 
believe help deter crime 
once newsstands were the exclusive province of the blind and 
disabled military veterans recently their ranks have been joined 
by immigrants particularly from india pakistan and bangladesh 
whatre they gonna do put these people back on welfare 
asked tom desanto an optician who is a regular customer at a sixth 
avenue newsstand operated by edward lanigan who is blind 
another blind newsstand operator lost his stand in brooklyn last 
week when city sanitation crews mistakenly razed it although koch 
publicly apologized and the man was given a replacement the case 
helped focus attention on the citys newsstand campaign 
the more cynical of kochs critics see political motives in the 
plan 
i am particularly outraged that these new and onerous 
regulations come at a time when the complexion of those who own 
the newsstands in this city is changing said wilbert tatum 
publisher of the citys largest black newspaper the amsterdam 
news tatum said the elimination of newsstands would decimate 
his profits which are heavily based on street sales 
the freestanding sidewalk stands which range from shabby to 
seedily ornate represent only a fraction of the news outlets in 
the city stan getleson circulation manager of the new york post 
said tuesday that there are about 4500 sellers including stands 
in the subways cubbyholes in buildings lobby newsstands and 
bookstores 
still the newsstands have adamant defenders 
the only legal thing on the streets seems to be the 
newsstands so it is naturally the newsstands that the city is 
attempting to curb wrote new york daily news columnist gail 
collins 
city officials seem slightly taken aback 
the mayor has by no means accepted the regulations mayoral 
spokesman larry simonberg said adding that koch had no intention 
of eliminating newsstands 
they might have to move simonberg insisted but we are 
not seeking to oust anybody 
and if as bookman suggested the regulations would outlaw 80 
percent of the citys newsstands 
i dont believe any such thing would be acceptable 
simonberg said

the president of westfield state college 
has reportedly repaid the school 1259 for meals with educators 
who dont recall dining with him dinners with professors who dont 
exist and other expenses 
state records obtained by the unionnews newspaper of 
springfield indicate that irving buchen also billed the school at 
least 1200 in travel expenses for his wife devy saying she 
often participated in conferences he attends 
the records however showed no registration fees for mrs 
buchen an opera singer according to the account published tuesday 
buchen said through his secretary tuesday that he would have no 
comment on the report but he told the newspaper i never 
deliberately misled anyone 
a spokesman for the state board of regents which hired buchen 
to replace a president who resigned in a scandal said chairman 
edward lash and chancellor franklyn jenifer would be in touch 
with the trustees of the college 
he added that the regents have no legal authority over how 
public college presidents spend school trust funds under state 
law the presidents are free to draw on the funds for any purpose 
that promotes the school 
clearly were concerned about this issue said regents 
spokesman terry zoulas 
the head of westfield states board of trustees jane berry was 
at meetings tuesday and her secretary said she could not be reached 
for comment ms berry has said however that trustees had 
questions about whether some of dr buchens expenses were 
legitimate 
buchen 57 earns 77000 yearly and receives 1000 monthly in 
living expenses he became president 15 months ago replacing 
francis j pilecki who resigned after being indicted in 1986 on 
sexual assault charges pilecki was found innocent in one case 
brought by a male student and charges were dropped in another case 
after settlement of a civil suit 
among the questionable expenses cited was a 26 business meal 
with helen popovitch president of florida atlantic university who 
told the newspaper she never dined with buchen he later said he 
had made a bookkeeping error 
two other college presidents listed on meal vouchers totaling 
76 harold eichoff of trenton state college in new jersey and 
john van de wetering of the state university of new york at 
brockport also didnt recall dining with buchen 
buchen said the bills were actually for dinners with his wife 
that he considered legitimate business expenses 
buchen was praised in a preliminary report issued last month by 
the new england association of schools and colleges for helping 
westfield state recover from the trauma suffered by the pilecki 
allegations but he has also come under fire for using 16000 in 
trust funds to renovate his office 
in january he acknowledged that he waived the colleges 
entrance requirements to allow his 16yearold daughter to enroll 
as a student but later took her out of the school and apologized 
to trustees

a teacher fired nine years ago because 
she had tuberculosis has been ordered reinstated by a federal judge 
who found that she was a victim of discrimination her attorney 
said tuesday 
the lawsuit of gene arline 45 became a landmark case when the 
us supreme court on march 3 1987 ruled 72 that 
antidiscrimination laws cover people suffering from aids and other 
contagious illnesses 
the high court ordered a new factfinding trial for mrs arline 
which was held here in may before us district judge john moore 
moore in an order filed friday found that mrs arline was a 
victim of discrimination and ordered her reinstated with four years 
back pay totaling more than 100000 said patricia fields 
anderson mrs arlines attorney 
we are ecstatic ms anderson said tuesday it has been a 
long nine years 
the judge said the nassau county school board must either 
reinstate mrs arline or pay an additional 768000 in front 
pay to take her up to retirement ms anderson said the boards 
attorney indicated tuesday that the district will rehire her the 
attorney said 
she is going to be hopefully back on the payroll and 
teaching by midaugust said ms anderson shes ready to go 
shes rarin to go 
craig marsh superintendent of schools for nassau county said 
tuesday he had not yet seen the decision and could not comment but 
understood that the county would have to provide the back pay the 
board he said would discuss the case next week 
the supreme court ordered the may trial after it found mrs 
arlines tb fit the definition of disabilities included in a 1973 
federal law forbidding discrimination against the handicapped 
mrs arline was fired in february 1979 from her job as a 
thirdgrade teacher because she had contracted the disease 
she filed suit but a federal judge threw the case out in 1983 
then in 1985 the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
reinstated the case saying a judge must determine whether her 
firing was the result of medical necessity or unfounded hysteria 
about the disease 
nassau county appealed the case to the supreme court it argued 
that a ruling in her favor would effectively make it impossible to 
fire anyone with a contagious disease 
moore limited the back pay to four years because he found that 
after 1983 mrs arline had not made sufficient effort to find other 
work or tried to qualify herself for teaching higher grades which 
the district would have allowed

church of england leaders voted tuesday in favor 
of proposals to admit women to the priesthood despite opposition 
from their spiritual head archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
who warned it could split the church 
the general synod of bishops clergy and laity voted 299216 for 
draft legislation allowing the ordination of women each group 
voted separately the bishops voted 2821 in favor the clergy 
voted 137102 and the laity voted 13493 there was one abstention 
but a lengthy process must be followed before the anglican state 
church might get its first woman priest in 1992 or 1993 
the legislation will be debated and voted upon by all 44 of the 
churchs dioceses it then goes back to the general synod for final 
approval and must then by approved by parliament 
runcie had no comment after the fourhour debate at church house 
opponents of women priests estimate that at least 1000 of the 
10660 clergy will leave the church if women are ordained the 
draft legislation allows for them to be paid up to 51000 if they 
quit on grounds of conscience 
the legislation also allows bishops the right to refuse to 
ordain women or have them in their dioceses 
runcie referred to the proposals as a legislative schism he 
said there was no consensus in the church for the historic step 
although the theological balance was now in favor 
one prelate who voted for the proposals bishop of peterborough 
william westwood said later he thought the vote signaled the 
kiss of death for womens ordination 
when it comes back to the synod in four years time it will 
need a twothirds majority because it will be at a decisive stage 
it certainly didnt get that today and i detected a clear change of 
mood among the bishops voting westwood said 
up to now they have been very much in favor but their mood is 
definitely changing because the church is getting tired of this 
perpetual debate 
the issue was first debated 37 years ago but the first decisive 
step was taken in 1975 when the synod said there were no 
fundamental objections to women priests 
since then anglican churches in other countries which are 
selfgoverning but look to the archbishop of canterbury for 
guidance have ordained about 1000 women priests most of them in 
the us episcopalian church 
runcie said he would continue to recognize women priests 
ordained outside england and he would like to see them allowed to 
exercise their ministry in england under special conditions 
which he did not specify 
speakers in the debate were carefully selected to give equal 
time to supporters and opponents 
archdeacon of the royal navy noel jones said i appeal to the 
synod not to take on board an issue which is so totally divisive 
many people see us as a church limping along aimlessly are we now 
hellbent on shooting ourselves in the foot as well 
but the churchs secondranking prelate archbishop of york john 
habgood said we should allow the church at large a chance to 
discuss this issue without giving a signal to the nation that we 
are irrevocably committed to it

the iranian airliner shot down by a us navy 
missile was transmitting information on two radio channels 
including one identified with f14s flown by the iranian air 
force the pentagon said today 
the fact the planes transponder was using a military channel 
helped lead to the conclusion aboard the cruiser vincennes that the 
ship was about to be attacked said pentagon spokesman dan howard 
that knowledge howard said was a substantial factor in 
capt will c rogers iiis decision to launch two missiles toward 
the jet 
the signals that the vincennes were receiving were signals 
previously identified with f14s howard said 
he said he was releasing the information about the transmission 
on a military channel to support the statements of adm william j 
crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that the 
vincennes fired its missiles because it throught it was attacking a 
military target 
indeed sen john warner of virginia senior republican on the 
senate armed services committee told a capitol hill news 
conference that giving a civilian plane a military transponder code 
defies all reasonable understanding 
however irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati told 
a news conference in new york today that contrary to assertions of 
us officials the iranian airbus was sending out normal signals 
to all radar that it was a civilian plane 
howard told reporters that there are still a large number of 
unanswered questions about sundays incident in which the iranian 
airbus a300 was shot down over the strait of hormuz 
the iranian plane with 290 persons aboard had just taken off 
from bandar abbas an airfield also used by iranian military 
planes howard noted 
as the iranian jetliner flew toward the vincennes the planes 
transponder was sending out signals through two channels howard 
said he identified them as mode 3 and mode 2 
according to howard mode 3 is a commonly used commercial 
channel which is also sometimes used by military planes howard 
said he did not specifically know what information the jetliner was 
transmitting on mode 3 
but mode 2 according to howard is peculiar to military 
aircraft he said no commercial airlines use mode 2 
the mode 2 transmitting device is a specific piece of 
equipment that has to put on a plane howard said 
the signals received by the vincennes through mode 2 had 
been identified with iranian f14s in the past year howard said 
iran has a handful of usbuilt f14s that it purchased during 
the reign of the shah some of the remaining f14s were moved to 
the bandar abbas airbase in recent days according to pentagon 
officials 
howard also said there are conflicting reports about the 
altitude and path of the iranian plane before it was struck 
crowe had said the iranian plane was at about 7000 feet and was 
descending directly toward the vincennes when the order was given 
to fire the ships missiles 
but the uss sides a frigate operating in the area at the same 
time reported that the airliner was above 12000 feet asked if 
the sides afteraction report showed whether the plane was 
descending or ascending howard said the report didnt indicate

the uss vincennes the first cruiser of 
the hightech aegis type to serve in the persian gulf is a lot of 
ship for what an american skipper once called a lake in a 
desert 
it was ordered here with such speed that some officers seemed to 
have only a hazy idea of its mission when the billiondollar 
warship entered the persian gulf on may 27 however the nighttime 
passage through the narrow strait of hormuz left its 385 crewmen in 
no doubt they were in a war zone 
off oman salvage tugs battled fire on a norwegian ammonia 
tanker attacked by iranian gunboats the day before on the iranian 
side flames licked at ships still burning from an iraqi air raid 
on two weeks earlier on irans big larak island oil terminal 
the assignment began in midapril with a rush departure from 
home port in san diego 
it is scheduled to last about three months but the vincennes 
could be withdrawn earlier as a gesture to reduce tensions caused 
by its shooting down of an iranian airliner sunday us officials 
say the airbus a300 was mistaken for an iranian f14 fighter 
members of a pentagon news pool taken aboard the ship before it 
entered the gulf found some officers and crew somewhat puzzled over 
the orders that brought them 13000 miles in 32 days on a million 
gallons of fuel 
some officers noted it was the first tour in the narrow confines 
of the gulf by one of the navys aegis cruisers which have 
computerlinked radar and missile systems designed for fleet 
defense in open sea 
the shallow waterway 600 miles long and no more than 120 miles 
across for commercial shipping purposes was described last year by 
the captain of an older cruiser as a lake in a desert with many 
threats all close at hand 
one officer of the vincennes was asked what he thought the gulf 
mission would be for a ship whose phasedarray spy radar and 
weapons are designed to fight an enemy hundreds of miles away he 
replied you tell me 
even capt will c rogers iii the skipper seemed to have 
trouble with the question suggesting the multiple functions of his 
supership might enable the navy to reduce the strength of its gulf 
force that has not happened 
rogers told reporters the next day the vincennes would provide 
a lot of battle management and maybe we will be able to 
reduce the force level in the gulf and back away from the recent 
tensions in the area 
gen george b crist told reporters in manama on june 1 the 
cruisers air defense radar could cover the entire gulf and called 
it a quantum leap forward in detering a new iranian antiship 
missile site nearing completion in the strait the fourstar marine 
genral heads the us central command in tampa fla which is 
responsible for the gulf 
this is the fourth navy ship named for the 1779 revolutionary 
war battle at what is now vincennes ind a university town on the 
wabash river the first sailed around the world and a voyage in 
1839 established that antarctica was a land mass the second and 
third were world war ii cruisers 
the current vincennes launched at the ingalls shipyard in 
pascagoula miss three years ago wednesday is the third of 10 
aegis cruisers planned for the navy 
it originally was to be the uss valley forge but the name was 
changed after a lobbying campaign by the vincennes association 
made up of veterans who served on the world war ii cruisers 
indiana politicians and vincennes civic leaders 
cruiser no 49 became the vincennes and no 50 got the name 
valley forge 
since its arrival the 567foot warship has operated almost 
exclusively in the soutehrn gulf where air and surface activity is 
most concentrated

the food and drug administration cautioned 
consumers tuesday against indiscriminate use of the prescription 
acne drug retina to reduce wrinkles 
while urging consumers to be prudent in obtaining the drug from 
their dermatologists the agency announced a crackdown on 
unlicensed manufacturers it said have started to advertise and 
distribute bogus drugs identified as retina 
use of all these products amounts to an expensive therapeutic 
gamble fda commissioner frank e young said in a statement 
retina manufactured by ortho pharmaceutical corp of raritan 
nj has long been approved to treated acne and normally is 
applied to small areas of the skin for limited periods of time 
however the drug received nationwide attention earlier this 
year when a research article published in a mainstream medical 
journal suggested it could reduce or reverse wrinkling due to aging 
and sun damage 
within days dermatologists across the nation reported being 
deluged by patients wanting to obtain the drug for wrinkle 
reduction 
unfortunately consumers have apparently accepted the reports 
of this one small study as gospel and are willing to gamble with 
retina and imitation products sold through the mail or in 
clinics young said 
even some dermatologists are jumping on the bandwagon by 
offering own label products to their patients at exhorbitant 
prices he said 
the fda said it is actively investigating several companies 
promoting and selling antiwrinkle formulas and is initiating 
regulatory action when warranted 
the fda said it is working with state authorities and the us 
customs service postal service and the federal trade commission to 
curb the proliferation of illegal versions of retina 
as to physicians prescribing retina for patients who want to 
use it for wrinkle treatment there is little the fda can do at 
this point except urge caution 
if the agency determined such use was getting out of hand it 
could begin steps to change the labeling of the drug to 
specifically warn against that kind of use and as a last resort 
move to have it withdrawn from the market 
however there was no indication any such actions are 
contemplated 
instead young emphasized in the statement that retina has been 
approved only for treating acne and that there is no conclusive 
evidence it reduces wrinkles 
longterm animal studies and wellcontrolled clinical trials 
involving larger numbers of patients in various age groups are 
needed to assess the risks and benefits of retina as a wrinkle 
reducer young said

the sister of an american held hostage in 
lebanon since 1985 said tuesday she had been optimistic until the 
us navy shot down an iranian jetliner prompting an unconfirmed 
death threat against him 
peggy say said she previously had been told that her brother 
terry anderson might be released over the fourth of july weekend 
but those hopes were dashed by sundays attack in the persian gulf 
i had really high hopes when we came down here last week that 
it would be over before anything like this could happen she said 
by telephone from her new home in western kentucky 
her concern tuesday however was over an unconfirmed threat 
that anderson who was abducted march 16 1985 in beirut lebanon 
might be executed in revenge for the us attack sunday on the 
jetliner carrying 290 people there were no survivors 
im trying to take some comfort in the fact that islamic jihad 
has told us repeatedly that if a photograph does not accompany the 
communication then its not official mrs say said 
but she added i am of course concerned 
anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press has been held the longest of 18 foreign captives in lebanon 
an anonymous caller purporting to speak for islamic jihad which 
holds anderson and american thomas sutherland threatened to kill 
one of them in retaliation for the attack 
the caller did not elaborate and it was not possible to 
authenticate the call 
mrs say said she had mainly been thinking about two things 
since the us guided missile cruiser vincennes destroyed the 
jetliner 
the grief the families of the victims are going through and 
terry i keep thinking about how terribly frightened he may be 
she said

ussupported contra rebels mounted their biggest attack since 
signing a ceasefire with the government three months ago five 
soldiers and seven civilians died in the ambush the ministry said 
but contra spokesman jorge rosales said he could not confirm or 
deny report 
i am seriously concerned about this campaign to create 
incidents to justify whatever action against our units he said 
in an interview from his miami office he added that the rebels 
have been ordered to fire only in selfdefense 
the leftist sandinista government and contra leaders on march 21 
agreed to a truce and to seek a negotiated settlement to the nearly 
7yearold war

monday ambushed a sovietmade jeep and a military truck full of 
government troops and civilians 
the reports said the rebels using antitank mines rifles and 
grenade launchers attacked the vehicles in the village of buenos 
aires in central chontales province about 100 miles east of the 
managua 
the defense ministry said 10 people two civilians and eight 
soldiers also were wounded in the attack 
a series of peace talks between highlevel representatives of 
the two sides broke off june 9 no new meetings have been scheduled 
both sides have extended the ceasefire which ended june 30

war and the government estimates damages at 36 billion 
the sandinistas came to power in july 1979 in a revolutionary 
war that ended 42 years of rule by the rightist proamerican 
somoza family the contra rebels claim the government leaders want 
to install marxism in their central american nation 
the congress which last approved us aid to the rebels in 
1986 in february rejected president reagans request for

president reagan urging americans to do a 
little comparison shopping in the presidential race praised 
george bush on tuesday while accusing michael dukakis and the 
democrats of hiding liberalism behind political trench coats and 
sunglasses 
in his strongest pitch yet for his vice president reagan called 
bush the kind of man i want to follow me 
the president in an address to a group of conservatives at the 
old executive office building portrayed the november elections as 
crucial for his conservative legacy 
all weve achieved could be lost in just a few months 
he said 
referring to the likely democratic presidential nominee only as 
a governor reagan derided dukakis as an outandout 
liberal who has no interest in controlling government spending 
and instead raises taxes 
in contrast reagan lauded bush as his standardbearer for 
conservative antitax antiabortion and tough lawandorder 
policies 
less than two weeks before the democrats gather in atlanta for 
their convention reagan accused the party of putting together a 
campaign that is subtle and clever 
the american people understand what liberalism means and dont 
like it so our opponents plan to go to the voters incognito 
theyre putting on political trenchcoats and sunglasses reagan 
said 
evoking laughter from his audience reagan quipped the democrats 
will never even in the lowest whisper mumble the l word again 
how other than liberal would you characterize a governor who 
in the last five years increased his states spending twice as fast 
as the federal governments and more than a third faster than the 
average for all the other states reagan asked 
and what do you call a governor who raises taxes 115 million 
and declares it a victory an outandout liberal reagan said 
yes all that the american people need to do is a little 
comparison shopping to see the truth he added 
reagan said that while dukakis has fought for weekend 
furloughs for dangerous convicts including drug dealers bush 
has led the fight against drug smugglers 
their candidate has opposed requiring the pledge of allegiance 
and allowing prayer in schools our candidate well he and i both 
find it hard to believe that anyone could take these positions 
reagan said 
the president credited bush with converting european 
governmental officials who had opposed natos deployment of a new 
generation of mediumrange nuclear missiles the missiles that 
have been ordered removed under the ussoviet arms treaty signed 
by reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
after bushs 1983 london speech advocating deployment reagan 
contended the tide in europe shifted and thanks to him 
deployment went forward 
the bulk of reagans 15minute address was devoted to extolling 
bushs virtues 
its no secret who i believe should pick up the lease around 
here in january again and again these past eight years ive 
admired george bushs strength again and again his leadership has 
been a key to our successes reagan said 
yes this is the kind of man i want to follow me someone who 
will take our battle forward who will speak our gospel truly and 
will do the work that is yet to be done reagan said

most folks dont know about my vegetarianism harris said 
recently when they hear about it some even doubt that a

cheese and relish on it and eat that so people will think im 
eating hot dogs but actually im not 
his vegetarian beliefs began in 1971 when he was in the fifth 
grade 
i was a very religious little person he said the church 
i was going to said there are clean and unclean types of meat so i 
thought id be better off not trying any of them ive been a 
vegetarian ever since 
he said he has never tried his own hot dogs or chili and said 
his employees test the food for him

a navy officer who could face 
the death penalty goes on military trial wednesday on charges he 
fatally shot a ship paymaster and stole the 94000 payroll 
a navy judge tuesday cleared the way for trial by rejecting 
defense challenges to search warrants in the case 
the warrants for three bank safetydeposit boxes were 
properly issued despite wrong dates and other erroneous 
information supplied to the issuing judge by naval investigators 
judge john a studer ruled 
the selection of a courtmartial jury of at least five navy 
officers was scheduled wednesday and opening statements were 
expected thursday in the trial of petty officer 1st class ruben 
colon 34 of vega baja puerto rico 
colon is accused of killing lt jg ratish prasad 24 
disbursing officer aboard the destroyer john hancock while it was 
docked at mayport last march 15 he is charged with murder 
kidnapping robbery and receiving stolen property 
according to court records prasad was taken at gunpoint from 
his office to a lower deck where he was bound shot dead and 
stuffed in a locker 
the judge had earlier refused to rule out the death penalty as a 
possible punishment for the murder charge but the navy has not 
executed anyone since a mutiny in 1849 
colons lawyer lt matthew j michels argued tuesday that the 
affidavit in support of a request for the search warrants was 
carelessly prepared and then negligently reviewed by 
federal magistrate harvey schlesinger 
but schlesinger testified that conflicting dates about the 
criminal activity and resulting investigation dont mean 
anything because they had no bearing on the crime itself or 
colons alleged role in it 
the prosecutor lt daniel j glary contended the errors and 
inconsistencies had no bearing on probable cause of guilt and 
the justification for a search of colons safety deposit boxes 
the judge agreed 
the break in the case came when the bank that rented colon the 
largest safety deposit box available tipped off investigators 
the courtmartial is being held in a windowless classroom at the 
fleet trainer center at mayport about 10 members of the 
destroyers crew have been flown from the middle east to testify

organized labor declining this year to repeat 
its early presidential endorsement of 1984 will have nearly one of 
every four delegates at the democratic national convention in 
atlanta 
preliminary totals from the 90union aflcio and the independent 
national education association show a record 1003 or 24 percent of 
the conventions 4161 delegates coming from the ranks of the labor 
movement 
in 1984 the two groups which represent about 17 million 
workers had 901 or 229 percent of the 3933 delegates at the 
democratic convention in san francisco 
as of tuesday the aflcio said it has 723 union members or 
officials on the roster of delegates for this years convention 
including 42 super delegates who hold seats on the 392member 
democratic national committee 
were expecting maybe five more said lorrie mchugh a 
spokeswomen for the federation 
four years ago when its early endorsement of walter mondale 
earned labor the tag special interest from mondales primary 
opponents the federation had a total of 642 delegates at the san 
francisco convention 
when exit polls from the november election showed that between 
43 percent and 47 percent of voters from union households cast 
their ballots for ronald reagan critics contended that labor 
leaders were out of touch with their members 
determined to avoid a repeat of that criticism and in response 
to pleas from democratic leaders the aflcio agreed to forgo an 
endorsement until after the primaries this year or when internal 
union polls showed one candidate emerging with at least twothirds 
support 
a breakdown of the delegates shows that twothirds consensus has 
yet to emerge 
despite having already wrapped up the nomination massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis has only 564 percent of the aflcio delegates 
to the convention jesse jackson has 266 percent 
the others are divided among former candidates sen albert 
gore of tennessee rep richard gephardt of missouri and sen paul 
simon of illinois or are undecided 
without the early endorsement most union political activists 
had expected to carry fewer delegates into the convention this year 
than in 1984 
there is genuine surprise within labor at how well weve 
done said allen zack a spokesman for the onemillionmember 
united food and commercial workers union which will have 23 
delegates at the convention 
lacking a single candidate to back the aflcio launched a 
democracy at work campaign 14 months ago aimed at getting union 
members to the convention on any candidates slate 
it included submitting questions to the candidates videotaping 
all of them and submitting about 15000 copies of the tape to be 
shown in 57000 local union halls across the country 
in addition the federations committee on political education 
sent teams into those union halls explaining to rankandfile 
workers how to get commitments from the presidential candidates to 
slate them as delegates in the state caucuses and primaries 
the assumption that the labor movement would come out on the 
short end of the stick sans endorsement was wrong all along 
said peter laarman of the united auto workers plus nobody has 
raised that nonsense about us being a special interest this time 
thats another dividend of the process 
laarman said the uaw will have 101 delegates at the atlanta 
convention compared with 82 at san francisco four years ago the 
only union delegations larger are the neas at 280 and the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees with 159 
delegates 
not everyone fared so well the united steel workers for 
example will go to atlanta with just 40 delegates this year 
compared with 61 convention delegates four years ago 
unions believe the point they made with the size of their 
delegation was worth the effort 
the idea was to make clear in a way that was not offensive or 
counterproductive but simply a reflection of reality that labor 
is part of the process said the uaws laarman 
without getting working people and their families back in the 
democratic fold in large numbers laarman said the return of 
the democrats may not take place

how long it would take for the soviet teams in west germany to 
check the two missile sites they were visiting tuesday 
because of time constraints under the treaty it is reasonable 
to expect they will approach their duties in an expeditious 
manner said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
there are rest facilities for them at the sites and a place 
for them to take a nap if they choose there are also private 
meeting rooms where they can discuss their inspection activities 
said the official 
there are four other us sites in west germany that fall under 
the superpower arms treaty the soviets have not yet announced 
whether they will be visiting those sites as well the spokesman 
said 
the inspections in west germany the united states and the 
soviet union are to make sure that items found at the missile sites 
correspond to what has been listed by the superpowers in the treaty

he cant type and his editors rewrote his 
lead but gov mario cuomo said playing cub reporter for a day 
tuesday was fun and taught him its not easy getting all the facts 
the governor to fulfill a promise made during his last 
campaign worked for a day for the jamestown postjournal he was 
assigned to cover lt gov stan lundine presenting a check to help 
build a research center 
heres what cuomo wrote 
a local boy who made good came back to jamestown yesterday and 
demonstrated the economic development skills that earned him and 
the city a national reputation when he was jamestowns mayor from 
1970 to march 1976 
stan lundine now lieutenant governor presented the 
blackstone corp with a symbolic check for 4 million under an 
agreement with blackstone that will keep the 1000 jobs it now 
creates and at least 35 and probably many more 
heres the edited version 
a symbolic 4 million check was given to blackstone yesterday 
to preserve 1000 jobs and create at least 35 more 
cuomo said later the story was hard to humanize because there 
was no sex in this thing 
ill know print press better now the difficulty of it 
cuomo said getting all the salient facts down when people are up 
on that stage talking a mile a minute and you dont have time to 
hear it all back on the recorder 
on a flight from jamestown back to albany cuomo told lundine 
it looks different from down there with the reporters 
after a news conference at blackstone cuomo returned to the 
newspaper and began writing his story as dozens of visiting 
reporters and postjournal employees watched 
it wasnt quite like real life for one thing there was the 
matter of typing for another there was the deadline 
cuomo who doesnt know how to type reviewed his notes and then 
summoned another reporter to type the story while he dictated 
cuomo with reporter manley andersons help needed about 45 
minutes to finish his story to be published under his byline 
wednesday in the postjournal an afternoon newspaper with a 
circulation of 29000 
unlike most reporters covering a latemorning event for an 
afternoon newspaper cuomo was not required to file his story for 
tuesdays editions 
postjournal editor cristie herbst briefly conferred with cuomo 
when he returned to the newsroom 
he came up with the lead himself i maybe had to refine it a 
little herbst said 
anderson said cuomo would be near the top as far as cub 
reporters go 
he seems to have a fair idea of what its all about 
anderson said 
the governor who has published two diaries about his public 
life agreed to work as a reporter after a postjournal columnist 
issued a challenge when cuomo severely criticized coverage of his 
1986 reelection campaign 
its fun cuomo said id like to do more of it i wont 
but id like to do more of it 
during the news conference cuomo attracted most of the 
attention of reporters and television crews 
cuomo quizzed lundine and company executives about a state 
assistance program and whether it would actually help save 1000 
jobs as lundine and the officials claimed 
the grant from the state department of economic development 
which cuomo oversees is designed to help blackstone develop new 
cooling systems for automobiles 
how can you assure us that it wouldnt have happened without 
taxpayer assistance cuomo asked but the mildmannered lundine 
assured his boss that blackstone proved it needed the money to make 
sure it got the project

a task force charged with assessing safety in 
nasa said tuesday that attitudes in the space agency have improved 
but there is still a lack of talent to assure accidentfree 
flights after the first postchallenger shuttle mission in 
september 
the committee in a report issued tuesday said it found no 
significant safety issues to stand in the way of the discovery 
flight but that there still were deficiencies in people skills 
management systems and independent safety oversight functions 
the report card on safety requested by a house subcommittee 
that oversees space flight was made public a day after discovery 
was rolled out to the launch pad at cape canaveral fla 
the new launch decision management system is thorough and 
provides for a healthy redundancy of safety reviews and 
oversights the committee said and by proper use of the new 
systems the safety concerns for the next flight should be 
adequately addressed 
in august last year the same committee composed of people 
within and outside of the national aeronautics and space 
administration was critical of nasa operations saying that 
safety concerns had given way to business as usual and an 
alarming vacillation in safety emphasis and management 
since then says the new study some of the most talented nasa 
engineers and managers have been transferred into top management 
positions in nasas safety organizations many of them the report 
noted will transfer back to their primary jobs after the discovery 
flight 
there is still some concern that the depth of experienced 
skilled and competent people is too shallow the report said 
after the firstline safety organization management there is 
still a lack of talent this should improve with time as employees 
learn by example and from the new managers 
the committee recommended formalized training and rotation of 
people to and from safety organizations and other programs 
it noted that safety issues and identifying hazards and controls 
on the manned space flight program had been given highest priority 
in the activities to return to flight 
but it said the question of how to continue the safety 
effort after the discovery flight worried many nasa managers 
it is certain that the level of effort exihibited in the 
respite between launches cannot be maintained the panel said 
an ongoing system must be set up 
in its 1987 report the committee said the concern for safety 
which peaked shortly after the challenger exploded in january 1986 
appears to be waning 
but now the committee said the present healthy concern for 
safety is in evidence at all organizations there appears to be 
universal personal commitment to providing a safe flight for 
sts26 
when president reagan issued a new national space policy earlier 
this year the report said the commitment to safety was not 
emphasized 
the committee was cochaired by charles w mertz of nasa 
headquarters and joyce a mcdevitt a private consultant

indiana will begin a water locater service 
to help find emergency supplies for farmers whose livestock is 
endangered by the drought a committee of state agency heads was 
told tuesday 
lt gov john m mutz indianas commissioner of agriculture and 
chairman of the drought advisory committee said some farmers in 
southern indiana already must haul water to their livestock because 
their own supplies are exhausted 
state agencies will try to locate water supplies and possibly 
arrange to move the herds to the water which could be less 
expensive than moving the water to the livestock 
the state already has developed a hay locater service to find 
feed for livestock herds last week a shipment of hay was received 
from south carolina and this week hay is expected from virginia 
officials said 
in other activity today the committee was informed that a 
prolonged drought eventually could cut public utilities ability to 
meet demand for electricity 
as the drought continues and temperatures rise the increased 
demand for electricity and the decreased generation capability 
could eventually lead to a shortfall of electricity said robert 
d glazier director of utilities for the utility regulatory 
commission 
glazier said most coalfired electric generating plants use 
water in the cooling process plants on large bodies of water such 
as lake michigan and the ohio river should have few problems but 
generators on smaller waterways might have to cut back if the 
drought persists he said 
he said the problem has two components drought cuts the amount 
of water available and the discharge of heated water from the plant 
could violate environmental standards when the streams or rivers 
receiving the water are low 
our preliminary assessment is that in the shortterm the 
effect of the drought on the generation of electricity will be 
minimal said glazier however the consumer may see higher 
electricity costs due to the purchase of more expensive power or 
the extended use of extensive peaking capacity 
if the drought continues and there are high temperatures 
electricity use may have to be curtailed said glazier

citing suffolk countys new vdt bill new york 
telephone announced tuesday a hiring freeze on vdt jobs in the 
county and said it would close a directory assistance bureau there 
that employs about 125 persons 
thomas calabrese general manager said in a statement that the 
company regrets the decision but that the vdt bill imposes 
unnecessary costs that will eventually be passed on to customers 
he said the vdtequipped babylon directory assistance office 
will close when its lease expires dec 31 and the company will 
review other leases on a casebycase basis babylon employees will 
be reassigned to other locations 
the vdt bill which is the first of its kind in the nation 
requires businesses with 20 or more terminals to meet safety 
standards such as nonglare screens and rest breaks 
the suffolk county legislature passed the law june 14 
overriding a veto of the measure by county executive patrick halpin 
the bill was opposed by local business groups who said they 
feared the county would lose 3000 jobs 
valerie scibilia spokeswoman for the long island association 
which plans to file a suit challenging the law later this week 
said it should really not be a surprise that new york telephone 
did this because they said they would consider doing it if the bill 
became law 
scibilia said its a unique law that singles out suffolk 
county and we feel the legislature has exceeded its authority 
greg blasso who cosponsored the bill said to blame it on the 
vdt bill is to indulge in overreaction the telephone company 
should understand that the bill is reasonable is it a burden to 
provide detachable key boards and proper lighting 
according to blasso the telephone company has nothing to worry 
about until after l990 because the only thing they are required 
to do now is provide eye examinations and pay for 80 percent of the 
cost for corrective glasses if needed 
halpin said in a statement i think it is unfortunate that new 
york telephone co has made this decision because i think suffolk 
workers are among the finest in the region and the major reason why 
businesses and industries of all types have chosen to locate here

the television networks may be content to 
carry a mere two hours of democratic convention coverage a night 
but party officials are betting that local stations will want more 
and theyll happily supply it 
the convention satellite news service will begin 46 hours of 
transmissions july 16 two days before the democrats open their 
parley in atlantas omni arena 
manager paul byers said the material available to any 
television station with a satellite dish will include packaged 
interviews with party officials live coverage of convention 
proceedings both on and off the floor and opportunities for local 
stations to interview area politicians attending the convention 
four mobile crews in atlanta will cover newsworthy events byers 
said he said former cbs newsman ike pappas was hired to conduct 
advance interviews with party chairman paul g kirk and convention 
chairman don fowler 
a plethora of democratic groups the national committee the 
convention committee the house and senate campaign committees 
mayors governors and state chairmen have been allocated 
satellite time and are preparing video packages that range from a 
look at labor issues to an interview with house speaker jim wright 
dtexas 
wright presiding over the convention as a house panel 
investigates some of his financial dealings and other matters was 
interviewed in a segment prepared by the democratic congressional 
campaign committee 
asked whether it is wise under the circumstances for the 
democrats to showcase wright on their satellite byers replied 
wright is playing the leading role in the convention hopefully 
the interview has some teeth in it asks the questions that any 
journalist would ask 
convention satellite news service originally planned to offer 38 
hours of transmissions byers said but added another eight hours 
based on feedback from the stations that they wanted it 
during the fourday convention the service will beam live and 
taped material from 2 pm to midnight all stations including 
about 330 that will be represented in atlanta are being encouraged 
to use it 
cbs and nbc have said they will carry convention coverage from 9 
to 11 pm the first three nights and 8 to 11 pm on the final 
night abc has similar plans 
were not trying to compete with the networks or other news 
coverage were seeking to supplement not supplant byers said 
one of the primary functions of the satellite feed will be to 
enable local news people to interview congressmen senators and 
others for their own audiences stations also will be offered 
footage of the arena for use in advance pieces and live events they 
can excerpt to fit their own needs 
we want them to maintain editorial control thats the 
difference between this and a press release said byers there 
are always risks but you take those risks and hope that the net 
effect is positive

second term tuesday criticizing democratic challenger dick bryan 
for a campaign of deception 
hecht also termed iranians a bunch of religious fanatics 
when asked to comment on the shooting down of an iranian passenger 
jet carrying 290 people 
the incumbent an upset winner six years ago also said he was 
agreeable to debates or debatetype forums with gov bryan and that 
while nothing is scheduled before the end of august im ready if 
something comes up 
in filing for senate last week bryan accused hecht of stalling 
a debate of being ineffective and too far to the political right 
and trying to buy reelection with a warchest of up to 5 million 
hecht said bryan was wrong on the 5 million in campaign funds 
and the amount was closer to 25 million or 3 million about the 
same amount bryan figures on spending he also said bryan was 
getting desperate and swinging wildly 
asked whether the united state should pay damages for the 
shooting down of an iranian passenger jet by a navy warship in the 
persian gulf hecht said he wanted to study the issue first he 
also said he had no second thoughts about his vote earlier this 
year against reparations to us japanese held in camps in this 
country during world war ii 
referring to the iranian situation hecht said were dealing 
with a bunch of religious fanatics over there who feel if they can 
kill an american thats their passport to heaven 
hecht has trailed bryan in several polls taken earlier this year 
and last year but in filing he said a new gop poll shows him 
virtually in a dead heat with bryan and with the lions share 
of voters over 45 years old

cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk said tuesday he supports plans for informal talks 
among the warring factions in his country but sees no easy 
solution to the conflict 
sihanouk told foreign ministers of the association of southeast 
asian nations that the talks scheduled for july 25 in indonesia 
marked a turning point in the search for a peace settlement 
but he pointed to the negative outcome of meetings he held last 
winter with prime minister hun sen head of the vietnambacked 
communist cambodian government 
sihanouk warned dont expect that the informal meeting is 
going to be easy and that it will reach a constructive 
conclusion thai foreign ministry spokesman saroj chavanaviraj 
told reporters 
discussions of the cambodian issue dominated the asean annual 
conference in bangkok which concluded tuesday ministers expressed 
optimism that the informal talks will lead to a peace accord 
between cambodian resistance groups and vietnam which invaded 
cambodia in late 1978 
vietnam on tuesday reaffirmed its support for the informal talks 
a july 29 1987 vietnameseindonesian agreement calls for 
twostage discussions with vietnam laos and the asean members 
stepping in after the cambodian groups have met 
all asean members thailand indonesia malaysia brunei 
singapore and the philippines reportedly have said they will 
attend the meetings 
in a joint statement tuesday the asean ministers called on 
vietnam to withdraw its troops from cambodia and said the 
international community should keep denying vietnam any aid that 
support its occupation 
however several delegates said the bloc has shifted its 
strategy from isolating vietnam to trying to encourage it to take 
part in negotiations 
asean strongly supports the threeparty cambodian resistance 
coalition headed by sihanouk that is battling the vietnamese 
forces vietnam says it now is in the process of withdrawing its 
troops from cambodia it invaded its neighbor after fierce border 
clashes with the radical communist khmer rouge government which 
then ruled cambodia 
tuesdays asean statement also urged other nations to contribute 
to a multilateral aid package for the philippines the most 
troubled economy in asean 
on thursday the ministers will begin three days of talks with 
asean dialogue partners the united states japan australia 
canada new zealand and the european community 
us secretary of state george p shultz and west germanys 
deputy chancellor and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher are 
to attend shultz is expected in bangkok wednesday and will go on 
to visit seven other asian nations 
local newspapers said tuesday that security was tightened at 
bangkoks international airport to block possible terrorist attacks 
against shultz following the downing sunday of an iranian 
passenger jet by us naval forces in the persian gulf 
all appropriate security measures will be in place for 
secretary shultzs visit us embassy spokesman ross petzing 
said 
shultz is expected to get a sympathetic hearing on americas 
middle east stance and general foreign policy but the asean 
ministers signaled in their joint statement that they would exert 
pressure on growing protectionism in industrialized nations 
they also criticized the failure of western nations to 
adequately resettle indochinese refugees who receive initial 
asylum in southeast asian countries and then often languish for 
years in refugee camps awaiting permanent resettlement elsewhere 
but the statement said only vietnam could resolve the problem of 
the flight of its boat people into the region 
the ministers called for cooperation in the battle against 
increased drug trafficking and abuse which they said pose a 
threat to all asean societies

attorney general edwin meese iii on 
tuesday announced that he will resign this summer even though he 
said a 14month investigation into his personal ethics fully 
vindicates me 
this decision is something i made totally on my own and i was 
not pressured by anybody he told reporters here he said he 
submitted his resignation to president reagan early tuesday 
afternoon by telephone 
meese said he expected to leave office at the end of this month 
or early in august and that no successor had been designated one 
of reagans closest confidantes an aide who served reagan in 
california and then as a key member of his white house staff 
meese has had a stormy tenure at the justice department since 
arriving in march 1985 
meese took the step after independent counsel james mckay filed 
his report on the investigation into meeses conduct in office the 
830page report filed with a federal court was not made public 
the report concluded there was no basis for filing a criminal 
indictment 
meese said he had remained in his post until now because he 
refused to allow myself to be hounded out of office by false 
accusations 
the mckay report details meeses ties to the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp an iraqi pipeline project and two other 
enterprises questions of improper conduct will be referred to a 
justice department ethics unit which itself could take months to 
review the case 
meese said false allegations have been put to rest by the 
mckay report but conceded he had not seen it and did not know 
precisely what was in it 
nonetheless in a news conference here where meese had been 
working on an antidrug program the attorney general said with 
the burden of false allegations now lifted he would look ahead to 
return to private life 
meese is a longtime confidant of the president who served during 
reagans first term as white house counselor he succeeded william 
french smith as attorney general after surviving contentious 
confirmation proceedings 
his tenure at justice was marked by more controversy aside from 
the mckay probe he spearheaded two failed supreme court 
nominations and just recently the justice department has been 
criticized for failing to follow up early indications of the 
defense procurement scandal 
mckays office which launched its investigation of meese on may 
11 1987 has been 
examining meeses assistance to wedtech in 1981 and 1982 when 
he was white house counselor 
reviewing his actions in connection with a 1 billion proposed 
iraqi oil pipeline project after meese became attorney general 
delving into the attorney generals meetings with regional bell 
telephone company executives and his favorable recommendation on 
behalf of the firms at a time when he held 14000 in phone 
industry stock 
looking into members of a washington real estate family 
arranging to pay a 40000ayear salary for meeses wife while 
leasing office space to the justice department 
the fact that these allegations have been proved false and 
theres no criminal proceedings fully vindicates me meese said 
adding that anything else in the report concerning his ethical 
behavior constitutes mere commentary and opinion 
he had said previously that he might return to private life once 
the investigation was concluded and he said tuesday he was 
resigning to vigorously pursue his private goals 
he said he might be willing to work with vice president george 
bush should bush be elected president 
in washington patrick korten a justice department spokesman 
said meese made the decision to resign within the past week or 
so and that the attorney general had been considering the timing 
of a resignation for some time 
in his remarks meese said i have informed the president that 
i will be leaving the administration towards the end of july or 
early in august in order to accept new opportunities in the 
private sector 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house 
judiciary committee said in washington that she was very 
surprised and pleased by the resignation 
its very important that we get on with running the agency 
she said hopefully this will help them put some people in to 
bring a little dignity and vigor back 
mrs schroeder chairman of the house civil service 
subcommittee said she found it hard to restore the excitement 
people used to have about public service when the chief law 
enforcement officer was showing how to trim the edges of the law 
rather than how to enforce it with enthusiasm and vigor 
she added i think he was realizing he was a terrific 
liability politically to george bush after this report is 
unsealed the big question was going to be would you keep ed 
meese on that would have become a big issue

presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
tuesday the reagan administration believes there is a growing 
consensus for further humanitarian aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
but fitzwater discussing secretary of state george p shultzs 
trip to four central american countries deflected questions about 
new military assistance to the contra rebels 
fitzwater said the shultz visit to costa rica el salvador 
guatemala and honduras last week was aimed at gaining the general 
views of central american leaders about us policy in the region 
asked whether shultz had found support or acquiescence to a 
resumption of us military aid to the rebels in view of the 
collapse of peace talks with the ruling sandinistas in managua the 
spokesman said well he didnt go down there seeking that kind 
of information 
shultz left tuesday on a 15day tour of several asian countries 
and max kampelman a special ambassador who had accompanied the 
secretary on the central american tour briefed president reagan 
fitzwater said 
reagan and shultz discussed the visit by telephone after the 
secretary returned the spokesman said 
nicaraguan resistance leaders had met with shultz in san jose 
costa rica last thursday as the secretary was winding up his 
trip they said they discussed with him ways to win congressional 
approval of new support for the contras 
the congress has steadfastly refused to approve military aid to 
the rebels although lawmakers did give the ok in late march to a 
48 million package of humanitarian aid to be disbursed during the 
remainder of the current budget year which ends sept 30 
only 17 million of that sum actually was earmarked for the 
rebels another 17 million was designated for children victimized 
by the war while 10 million was set aside for a commission to 
monitor compliance with a peace agreement and about 4 million for 
administrative costs 
rebel leader adolfo calero said that in the san jose meeting 
shultz and contra leaders discussed a 30 million aid package 
including the possibility of setting aside 7 million in an escrow 
account for military assistance if the sandinistas do not meet 
promises for greater democracy 
fitzwater declined to specifically discuss what sort of aid 
package is being bandied about within the administration congress 
and the contra resistance movement 
im certain the secretary expressed our view that we want to 
support the contras to the best of our ability and that we have 
continually supported humanitarian assistance for them he said 
but at this point we have not reached any specific decisions on 
the nature of that support and certainly no decisions on lethal aid 
of any kind

a man purporting to speak for islamic 
jihad claimed tuesday the proiranian faction would kill one of two 
american hostages it was holding but police said the deadline 
passed without incident 
the threat appears to be a hoax said a police spokesman 
the caller told the voice of the nation radio station that 
either americans terry anderson or thomas sutherland would be 
executed to avenge the downing of the iran air jetliner by a us 
navy missile cruiser in the persian gulf on sunday 
the sunni moslem radio quoted the caller as saying the group 
would kill one hostage by 8 pm 1 pm edt and dump the body in 
the syrianpoliced seaside neighborhood of ramlet albaida in west 
beirut but the deadline passed with no developments police said 
we have patrols along the coastal boulevard where the 
kidnappers said they will throw the body but we havent received 
any report about any corpse said the police spokesman who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the caller did not elaborate and it was not possible to 
authenticate the call 
earlier tuesday a proiranian shiite moslem cleric sheik 
mohammed hussein fadlallah said the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon 
should not pay the price for the us navys action in the gulf 
i find no justification for making the hostages account for a 
matter with which they have no link said fadlallah spiritual 
guide of hezbollah or party of god which is believed to be an 
umbrella for the underground factions holding 18 foreign hostages 
the statement was published by the sohofiya news agency a 
newsletter based in west beirut 
the united states said the uss vincennes shot down the iran air 
jetliner on sunday after mistaking it for a jet fighter iran said 
all 290 people aboard were killed and iranian leaders vowed to 
seek revenge 
a state department official in washington speaking on condition 
of anonymity said of the anonymous radio threat there is no 
confirmation there is any connection to hezbollah or that this is a 
legitimate thing 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war has insisted that its 
statements would be typewritten and accompanied by a photograph of 
a hostage to prove its authenticity 
in cadiz ky andersons sister peggy say said she was 
concerned about the unconfirmed threat but tried to take some 
comfort that islamic jihad has told us repeatedly that if a 
photograph does not accompany the communication then its not 
official 
on may 4 an anonymous caller purporting to speak for islamic 
jihad called the christianrun voice of lebanon radio to announce 
that french captives marcel fontaine marcel carton and jeanpaul 
kauffmann would be freed the three who had been held by islamic 
jihad were freed several hours later 
by all accounts the kidnappers and their hostages are penned up 
in a shiite barracks in beiruts southern slums by syrian troops 
who moved in last month to halt fighting between rival palestinian 
militias 
some observers believe that the militants have difficulty moving 
around and may not be able to deliver statements as they used to do 
anderson 40 the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longestheld foreign captive in lebanon 
he was kidnapped in west beirut march 16 1985 
sutherland 57 the acting dean of agriculture at the american 
universitry of beirut was kidnapped june 9 1985 
also tuesday about 2000 hezbollah sympathizers marched through

more than 2000 mississippi river barges 
were backed up by shallow water tuesday at greenville and natchez 
miss as towboat operators tried working in a convoy to pick their 
way to memphis 
the army corps of engineers has pledged to keep the 
droughtdiminished lower mississippi open to commercial traffic 
but a corps spokesman said more barge backups will occur as dredges 
work on shallow areas of the river 
therell be spotty stoppages probably all summer said 
michael logue a corps spokesman from vicksburg miss 
southbound barges were stacking up at docking areas and a 
convoy of four towboats with 12 barges each set out monday from 
cairo ill said cmdr michael donohoe commander of the coast 
guards memphis district 
a second group with three to five towboats was scheduled to 
leave wednesday 
if one boat has a problem the others will help out donohoe 
said 
barges coming into the memphis zone which runs from 
caruthersville mo to greenville are restricted to drafts of 85 
feet but donohoe said the southbound convoys will have barges 
drawing nine feet of water 
by traveling together he said the workboats can pull each 
other off sandbars or team up to push barges through tricky bends 
of the low river 
dredging to deepen the channel from 7 feet began sunday at 
greenville and delayed towboats with about 800 barges while low 
water just south of natchez had about 1200 barges backed up logue 
said 
dredging at both sites was expected to take two to four days he 
said 
the mississippi registering record lows is more than 22 feet 
lower at memphis than it was this time last year

the announcement by attorney general edwin 
meese iii on tuesday that he would resign brought expressions of 
relief from george bushs presidential campaign and a terse 
statement from the vice president himself 
ed did the right thing and i wish him well bush said in 
remarks read over the phone by a staff member 
the vice presidents comment came shortly after meese announced 
in california that he would resign this summer saying a special 
counsels report filed tuesday with a federal court in washington 
had vindicated him the report said there was no basis for a 
criminal indictment of the attorney general 
meeses legal difficulties had been a source of constant concern 
to the bush campaign and two of his advisers had even publicly 
called meese a liability although the vice president himself 
had declined to say whether meese should resign 
in recent weeks bush and other republicans who had spoken on 
his behalf had sought to deflect the criticism by referring to 
possible conflictofinterest allegations concerning house speaker 
jim wright 
still tuesdays announcement came as a welcome surprise to bush 
supporters and campaign workers 
he meese got what he needed not leaving town under the 
cloud that he was guilty on the other hand the question now of 
what are you going to do about ed meese certainly isnt going to be 
asked any more said rep lynn martin rill who is national 
cochairwoman of bushs campaign 
i will disagree that there was a cloud over bush but there 
were questions and this removes them certainly said mrs martin 
bush campaign officials indicated they were caught by surprise 
by meeses announcement made in sacramento calif 
of course we are relieved he did the right thing confidence 
in him meese had eroded said one official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
as to meeses assertion that he might be willing to work with 
bush should bush be elected president the same campaign worker 
broke into laughter no comment said the official 
bush previously has said that he would not reappoint meese as 
attorney general in his administration if elected or any other 
current cabient member for that matter claiming he wanted to have 
a new team 
bush in campaign appearances has stressed the importance of 
ethics of government claiming that he has personally been 
untarnished by conflictofinterest allegations and proposing the 
establishment of a new white house office of ethics 
however while aides suggested privately that bush would be 
relieved if meese would step down the vice president never made 
such a recommendation to either reagan or meese bush campaign 
sources said 
meese and bush met privately in may to discuss the situation 
bush later told reporters that the embattled attorney general had 
promised not to do anything to jeopardize his campaign

the iranian airliner shot down by a us 
warship in the persian gulf stayed within its commercial air 
corridor but was sending radio identification signals on a 
military frequency identified with f14 fighter jets pentagon 
officials said tuesday 
a sixmember investigating team landed tuesday aboard the 
warship the uss vincennes to sort through computer records 
containing conflicting information including a determination by 
another american ship in the persian gulf that the iranian a300 
airbus maintained a steady altitude of 12600 feet rather than 
descending from 9000 feet to 7000 feet as the vincennes had 
reported 
meanwhile house armed services chairman les aspin dwis 
emerging from from a closeddoor intelligence briefing said 
military officials told his panel that the airliner never left a 
commercial air corridor contrary to original pentagon reports but 
the plane did veer on a line towards the vincennes a factor cited 
by the navy as justifying the captains decision to fire in the 
belief he faced imminent attack 
the commercial air corridor from bandar abbas to dubai extends 
55 miles either side of a line between the two cities the iranian 
plane according to the intelligence briefers had strayed to the 
west side of the corridor about four miles from the center line 
and had steered eastward to get back to the center that correction 
put the craft for a time on a direct heading toward the cruiser 
they said 
while it veered off from the center of the commercial corridor 
the plane never actually left the corridor as was first claimed by 
the pentagon aspin said it was in the corridor all the time 
he said 
others present in the briefing said a navy investigating team 
was just arriving in the persian gulf and would begin sifting 
through a large volume of information much of the electronic data 
from the incident was recorded on tape and would be available to 
the investigators they said 
but there still was no clear explanation for why the commercial 
aircraft seemed to be emitting a transponder signal normally 
identified with warplanes 
one theory aspin said was that the plane needed the military 
signature in order to reenter the airport at bandar abbas which 
is a joint civilianmilitary facility we are looking for 
possible explanations aspin said 
dniel howard the pentagon spokesman told reporters that the 
iranian aircraft was broadcasting over a radio transmitter known as 
identify friend or foe iff in two modes it was squawking on 
mode3 a common identifier for both military and civilian 
aircraft used in air traffic control 
it was also sending signals on a military mode mode2 said 
howard and the signals that we were receiving that the 
vincennes was receiving from that aircraft were signals that we 
had previously identified or associated with an f14 that was 
based on historical information in the gulf 
no commercial airliners use mode2 he said 
pentagon officials initially reported sunday that the vincennes 
had shot down an f14 it wasnt until hours after that 
announcement that adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff determined that it was an airliner that had gone down 
that determination was made on the basis of communciations with 
the vincennes howard said 
crowe had said the decision to fire was based on classified 
electronic emanations and gave no details 
at a briefing tuesday howard said this is the first time 
that we have revealed the fact that we could make identifications 
based on other countries mode2 iff signals and certainly those 
from iran 
the mode2 transmission mode is used by military aircraft and 
it identifies the tactical mission of that military aircraft and 
the particular signals that they were receiving were signals that 
there were certain aspects of it that they had identified or 
associated with an f14 previously in the gulf the spokesman 
said 
it is a special piece of equipment which has to be put on the 
aircraft and it can only be set on the ground the military 
coding for mode2 is something that has to be encoded set on the 
ground he said 
he declined to speculate why the airbus was broadcasting in 
mode2 
the spokesman also said investigators had a conflicting 
report on the altitude of the iranian aircraft from radar aboard 
the uss sides an american warship that he said was adjacent to the 
vincennes the sides reported that the aircraft was flying at 
12600 feet rather than the 9000 feet reported by the vincennes 
the sides also reported that the aircraft maintained a steady 
altitude rather than descending to 7000 feet as determined by 
the vincennes officers aboard the vincennes said they based their 
decision to fire in part on a determination that the approaching 
aircraft was descending and accelerating to 450 knots the flight 
pattern of an attacking warplane 
the control tower at dubai the intended destination of the 
iranian airbus reported that the aircraft was at 7800 feet at the 
moment it was hit about the altitude determined by the vincennes 
said howard 
the spokesman said no decision had been made on whether to offer 
compensation to the survivors of the victims on the question of 
compensation i can only say that im sure that our attorneys and 
the legal authorities of the us government will take that 
question under study 
and he countered criticism that the sophisticated aegis radar 
tracking and targeting system aboard the vincennes should have been 
able to tell the difference between the airbus and an f14 
the aegis system on board the cruiser on board the vincennes 
is an extremely sophisticated system that has as its 
primary goal preventing having us ships blown out of the water 
its purpose is to destroy incoming aircraft incoming missiles 
incoming ordnance to protect our task force our fleet 
part of that system is a radar system but that radar 
system can only identify objects based on their course their 
speed and their altitude said howard 
an officer on the vincennes or another aegis cruisers is 
sitting in front of a scope is not looking at a blip hes 
looking at a computergenerated figure on the screen which 
identifies this specific track 
if youre looking at a blip its very very difficult to 
its virtually impossible to distinguish size of aircraft by the 
size of the blip 
so those who speculated that we should have been able to tell 
the difference between an airbus and an f14 simply based on the 
size of the radar blip are mistaken he said

a white fbi agent admitted he wanted to put 
a burr under the saddle of a black fellow agent through a 
campaign of harassment but asserted he meant his colleague no harm 
according to court documents 
the admission made in a 1985 affidavit by the white agent gary 
w miller was filed in us district court here on friday in 
connection with a lawsuit by donald rochon 
rochon a black fbi agent alleges he was the victim of a 
campaign of racial harassment by white colleagues in field offices 
in omaha neb and chicago rochon has said that while living in 
chicago where he was assigned from 1984 to 1986 his familys 
safety was repeatedly threatened in anonymous telephone calls and 
obscene racist letters from white fbi agents 
documents provided to rochons lawyer as part of pretrial 
discovery include millers sworn admission that he forged rochons 
signature on an application for death and dismemberment insurance 
for rochons family rochon has charged that the unsolicited 
insurance policy he received as a result of the mailing amounted to 
a death threat 
miller who was suspended without pay for two weeks as a result 
of that and other incidents aimed at rochon stated in the july 30 
1985 affidavit that he did not intend to send rochon anything 
other than junk mail 
at the time i had no intention of harming rochon by any of 
this he said in the affidavit i did not think there would be 
any repercussion i did not think he would get anything but junk 
mail 
in the affidavit miller said he and agent thomas j dillon 
discussed retribution against rochon for his allegations of 
harassment by agents we discussed having his public utilities 
turned off and sending coupons soliciting magazine subscriptions 
and other items 
in the affidavit miller said he embarked on his campaign 
against rochon as personal revenge for making allegations 
against dillon who worked with rochon in omaha and later in 
chicago 
it was my way of putting a burr under his saddle miller 
said 
miller acknowledged that he followed rochon home one night after 
work in order to discover his address which had been kept secret 
from other agents because of the harassment complaint that rochon 
filed within the agency 
in a separate affidavit dillon said he had heard of many 
incidents that have occurred against rochon but denied 
participating in any harassment 
members of congress have sharply criticized the bureau over the 
rochon case and other discrimination claims more than half the 
fbis hispanic agents have joined in a separate lawsuit against the 
bureau charging discrimination in hiring and promotion 
the justice department and the equal employment opportunity 
commission have already found that rochon was the victim of 
blatant racial harassment in the fbis omaha office in 1983 and 
1984 a federal grand jury is investigating the later incidents in 
chicago which rochon has contended were more serious than those in 
omaha 
the white agents have called rochon a troublemaker who brought 
unfounded charges of racism against other agents in an effort to 
get transferred to his hometown of los angeles

iran said tuesday that the iranian 
airliner shot down by us missile fire had signaled it was a 
civilian plane and called it a premeditated terrorist attack 
iran requested an urgent meeting of the un security council to 
condemn the american action 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati met council 
president paulo nogueirabatista of brazil on tuesday mahallati 
later said he expected the 15member council the highest un 
body to meet early next week 
un officials said consultations on the iranian request were 
under way 
a council meeting would embarrass the united states which says 
the missile cruiser uss vincennes shot down an iranian airbus with 
290 people aboard because the commander believed it to be an f14 
jet fighter on an attack course 
mahallati said iran expects the council to issue an 
unequivocal and direct condemnation of the united states for this 
aggression and to call on the united states to immediately 
withdraw its forces from the persian gulf 
this kind of barbarism a premeditated terrorist attack is 
thanks to the american presence he said 
mahallati also said it is the undeniable obligation of us 
authorities to make an apology but can an apology wash away the 
blood of 290 innocent passengers no 
he told a news conference that contrary to us assertions the 
iranian airbus transponder continuously was disseminating normal 
signals to all radar that it was a civilian plane 
at the pentagon chief spokesman dan howard said tuesday that 
the iranian airliner had been broadcasting a radio identification 
signal on a frequency used only by military aircraft leading the 
skipper of the vincennes to believe he faced attack 
earlier tuesday iran lodged a formal written un protest 
accusing the united states of massacring passengers in cold 
blood and demanding a un condemnation and probe 
in 1983 the united states had requested such a security council 
meeting to condemn the soviet downing of a south korean airliner 
with 269 people aboard but the resolution of condemnation was 
vetoed by the soviet union one of the five permanent council 
members with veto power 
the united states also would be expected to veto a measure 
critical of actions it called necessary selfdefense the five 
permanent council members are the united states the soviet union 
britain china and france 
diplomats said moscow was expected to use the session to call 
for withdrawal of us forces from the gulf and to promote its idea 
of an international naval peacekeeping force under un command to 
replace the american presence 
the united states and some of its allies oppose such a force and 
say the western presence is needed to protect strategic interests 
in the oilrich gulf and freedom of navigation in the waterway 
us officials have said the downing of the iranian airbus will not 
prompt the united states to leave the gulf 
irans foreign minister aliakbar velayati sent a letter 
tuesday to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar condemning 
this undoubtedly premeditated act of aggression he said the 
un chief and security council must condemn the attack and compel 
the united states to remove its expansionist naval forces from 
the gulf 
in geneva perez de cuellar indicated he had faith in the us 
inquiry into the incident and saw no need for a un probe he 
earlier condemned what appears to have been a tragic error and 
called for restraint by all parties 
perez de cuellar has been trying to negotiate with iran and iraq 
and persuade them to accept a ceasefire in their nearly 8yearold 
war the security council demanded such a truce nearly a year ago 
mahalatti told reporters tuesday that iranian air force 
commander brig gen sallari not further identified informed him 
that the plane for 14 minutes was disseminating the 
normal signals of all civilian planes which proves to any radar 
that this is a civilian plane 
the question is how the most sophisticated american warship in 
the persian gulf could not receive it mahallati said 
us naval officials said the vincennes sent seven radio signals 
to the jetliner before firing but received no reply

court did not spell out any rehabilitation requirements 
miera 37 has been on what he says is a wateronly fast for 56 
days to protest alleged discrimination and injustice in society and 
the judiciary system he has vowed to fast 100 days something 
experts say means almost certain death 
theresa miera the ramsey county judges mother said her son 
was not immediately available for comment mrs miera said she had 
no comment 
the former court reporter neil k johnson said the only ruling 
acceptable to him would have been mieras removal from the bench 
it goes to show that if you make enough noise especially a 
minority you can get away with just about anything johnson 
said miera is hispanic and calls himself bisexual 
the court noted that mieras term expires in january 1991 
the citizens of ramsey county know him and his work and are in 
a position to evaulate his performance popovich said they can 
remove him by ballot if they determine we have been too lenient 
associate justice rosalie wahl in a separate opinion said she 
agreed with findings of judicial misconduct but said the penalty 
was too severe 
appointed to the bench by gov rudy perpich in august 1983 
miera was suspended by the supreme court with pay from his 67400 
a year post earlier this year 
miera refused to discuss the matter when the case was argued 
before the supreme court may 24 
the board on judicial standards in february adopted the findings 
of a threejudge panel that miera should be removed from office for 
making sexual advances to johnson and for inappropriate remarks 
and gestures to others 
johnson who worked for miera two periods from 1984 to 1986 won 
a civil suit against the judge in the spring of 1987 johnson was 
awarded 375000 in damages which was later reduced by the trial 
judge to 125000 
denise d reilly counsel for the board on judicial standards 
had said mieras comment that colleagues on the ramsey county bench 
were bloodthirsty hypocrites had undermined public confidence 
in the judicial system

two senior members of congress urged president 
reagan on tuesday to pay compensation to families who lost 
relatives aboard an iranian jetliner downed by a us missile but 
officials said the absence of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries complicated such an effort 
the idea was under active consideration at the state department 
the pentagon and the white house acording to sources and one 
congressional source said it was likely the white house would make 
some sort of offer to compensate victims within the next few days 
others however predicted no decision would come until after a 
navy investigative team completes its review of the incident in two 
to three weeks 
i think it would be a wise idea said sen john warner 
rva the ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee theres a clear admission by our president that this 
was an unfortunate accident and congress likely would provide 
the money for such payments he said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas speaking in london raised 
the possibility that a sincere us apology and an offer to 
compensate bereaved families of the 290 victims of sundays missile 
attack in the persian gulf might assuage the grief and would be 
supported by congress 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about the 
compensation issue said its a matter that has not been raised 
yet and said it was too early to say what might happen 
some on capitol hill urged caution talk of reparations is 
premature said rep william broomfield rmich they ought to 
cool their heels until we have all the information and rep tom 
downey dny suggested any compensation ought to be linked to 
the release of us hostages being held in lebanon 
one congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said administration officials are recommending a quick aid offer on 
a humanitarian basis to differentiate the united states from the 
soviet union which rebuffed all requests for compensation 
following its 1983 shootdown of a korean air lines jetliner with 
269 people aboard 
the white house may make a public offer to compensate families 
but it is unclear how such an offer could be carried out 
because of the touchiness of relations between the united states 
and iran the lack of clear precedent and the uncertainty of legal 
issues involved such an effort could take many months and is far 
from certain to succeed said legal experts in congress and the 
administration 
congress would take a major role in any payment particularly in 
providing the millions of dollars such a move would likely cost in 
addition the administration would want strong backing from 
lawmakers before taking a step so heavy with foreign policy 
implications officials said 
but ultimately the decision on whether to pay reparations would 
almost certainly have to be made by president reagan because of the 
foreign policy implications of such a move said a senior state 
department official who demanded anonymity 
youve got a basic policy choice with a very high profile 
said another administration legal expert 
there also is the question of legal authority for making the 
payments under international law no nation has to compensate for 
damages that result from legitimate military operations but the 
pentagon does have authority to make payments of up to 100000 per 
person in accidents 
most recently the united states denied liability for damages to 
neutral embassies in tripoli libya in a 1986 bombing raid and 
similar requests were turned down when neutral shipping was struck 
during the bombing of haiphong harbor during the vietnam war 
but if the damage resulted from a clear mistake such as the 
missile attack on the uss stark by an iraqi warplane last year that 
killed 37 sailors compensation may be paid iraq admitted error 
almost immediately and negotiations are continuing on the proper 
amount of damages 
the united states has compensated individuals for damage done by 
troops on maneuvers in central america and is paying owners of a 
fishing boat shot up by mistake in the persian gulf 
in another incident israel paid reparations to the united 
states following what israel said was a mistaken attack on the uss 
liberty in 1967 during the arabisraeli war 
in that case the payment was what lawyers term ex gratia 
made out of professed sympathy but without admitting fault or 
liability that could well be the form of any us payment to 
iranian families one official said 
in any case payment of reparations would require some sort of 
formal contact with iran to negotiate amounts and terms because 
there are no diplomatic relations such talks would be difficult to 
arrange 
the only forum where the two sides currently have regular direct 
contact is a tribunal meeting in the hague the netherlands to 
settle claims by both sides stemming from the 1979 iranian 
revolution 
any discussion of reparations would be well outside the scope of 
that tribunals official duties said one state department official

thousands of people went on strike in the capital 
of armenia apparently unhappy over the armenian leaderships 
presentation of an ethnic dispute at the national communist party 
conference a newspaper said tuesday 
the soviet government daily izvestia said the strike began 
monday one day after many thousands of people met in the 
theater square of yerevan the capital of the southern republic 
most flights in and out of yerevan were canceled it said 
in a tuesday edition izvestia said like yesterday a series 
of the citys industrial concerns arent working or are working 
with less than a full work force it said food stores and 
industries as well as restaurants and medical services had been 
working monday 
the newspaper said farm work was going on in stepanakert the 
largest city of the disputed nagornokarabakh region but that many 
other industries and institutions there also were shut down 
nagornokarabakh is at the center of a territorial dispute 
between armenia and the neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
nagornokarabakh is part of azerbaijan but the mountain enclaves 
predominantly armenian population has been agitating since february 
to be annexed to armenia 
armenia supports the demand azerbaijan is against it 
at least 32 people were killed in riots over annexation which 
broke out in sumgait azerbaijan at the end of february 
izvestia said the thousands of people who gathered on the 
yerevan city square sunday listened to a television broadcast by 
delegates to the fourday party conference in moscow which closed 
last friday 
armenian party leader suren arutyunyan said in remarks broadcast 
on soviet tv during the conference that authorities could not 
normalize the situation in armenia where large demonstrations 
frequently have occurred in support of nagornokarabakhs demand 
he proposed that the conference take up unspecified amendments to 
the soviet constitution 
the disagreement between armenia and azerbaijan has sent the 
issue to national authorities and the constitution specifies no 
way to solve the dispute 
delegates who spoke on television supported arutyunyans call 
for restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd 
but izvestia said that after a stormy debate on the square 
a committee was formed that called for a general strike after 
laying down a series of demands including a quick favorable 
resolution of the nagornokarabakh issue 
the committee demanded that the soviet supreme court take over 
the trials of those charged in the sumgait violence and demanded 
full information about the alleged poisoning of workers at a 
factory in the town of masis 
izvestia provided no more information about the masis incident 
except to say an investigation was under way 
the party conference called for greater attention to republics 
calls for economic autonomy but said authorities would not 
tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic tensions 
besides azerbaijan and armenia delegates from the baltic states 
of latvia lithuania and estonia also brought up ethnic questions 
at the conference 
about a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three estonian 
political prisoners had gathered more than 6000 signatures by 
tuesday during a fiveday demonstration in tallinn estonia 
we will continue the demonstration until they are freed or 
until the authorities give us an exact date for their release 
eve parnaste said as she carried a poster at the protest outside 
the estonian supreme court building 
she said the three prisoners had been demanding publication of a 
secret 1939 pact between nazi germany and the soviet union that 
placed the baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia under 
moscows control 
all three were arrested this year charged with spreading 
antisoviet propaganda or slandering the soviet state 
miss parnastes poster said kgb is an evil empire using 
the initials for the soviet secret police

a team of military experts headed by an 
admiral arrived tuesday night to investigate the attack in which a 
us navy vessel shot down an iranian jetliner 
the group of 18 arrived on a military plane from the united 
states after a stop in spain they were met by rear adm anthony a 
less commander of the us joint task force middle east 
the team is headed by rear adm william m fogarty director of 
plans and policy for the us central command headquarters in 
tampa fla 
the group made no statement after arriving 
a us navy spokesman said earlier that the team would conduct 
its investigation in secret and would remain in the persian gulf 
for as long as it takes to determine what happened 
they will interview the captain and other officers of the 
missile cruiser uss vincennes which shot down the iranian airliner 
on sunday because its crew believed the plane was an f14 fighter 
jet 
the team includes six investigators a military lawyer and 
technical experts one of them a specialist in the computerized 
aegis radarweapons system aboard the vincennes 
a navy source said it was highly doubtful the investigators 
would have any direct access to iranian officials but that their 
findings ultimately might become part of any legitimate 
international inquiry should one be conducted

critics of edwin meeses ethical conduct 
renewed their attacks tuesday after the attorney general announced 
his intention to quit but supporters praised meese and agreed he 
was vindicated by a stillsecret independent counsels report 
all he wanted to do was hang in there just to vindicate 
himself and then resign said sen orrin g hatch rutah a 
strong meese backer 
i dont know of anybody else whos been kicked around as much 
as ed meese and his family have been in this town hatch said 
but sen carl levin dmich whose governmental affairs 
subcommittee issued a critical report on meeses ethics said meese 
should stop saying the report vindicated him until a federal court 
releases the document 
he said an ethical cloud will hang over meese until the 
report is made public and added that the report could be 
devastating 
rep john conyers jr dmich said meeses departure as the 
nations chief law enforcer is a good day for american law and for 
the perception of integrity of the department of justice 
any student in an introductory course in american politics 
knows that simply staying out of prison cannot be the standard for 
remaining as the attorney general conyers said 
meese announced plans tuesday to quit later this summer saying 
the report by independent counsel james mckay after a 14month 
probe into his actions completely vindicates me 
sources said the report recommends no criminal indictment 
against meese for his ties with the scandaltarred wedtech corp or 
any other activity 
michael dukakis the certain democratic presidential candidate 
called meeses resignation long overdue 
i dont think he should have been appointed attorney general 
in the first place and he should have stepped down long ago he 
said but this administrations inability to set high standards 
for public service will not be solved by the meese resignation we 
need a president who believes in public service who will set those 
high standards and make our government something americans can be 
proud of once again 
but vice president george bush the certain republican nominee 
said ed did the right thing and i wish him well the remarks 
were in a statement read by a staff member 
interior secretary donald p hodel said he was saddened that 
meese had decided to leave the cabinet but said his decision to 
resign nevertheless is quite understandable when we consider the 
intense public assaults to which he and his family have been 
subjected 
ed meese has rendered exceptionally valuable service to our 
president to our country and to those of us who have been 
privileged to serve with him in this administration a champion of 
both personal and economic liberties he has been a valiant leader 
in the fights against crime drugs and excessive federal government 
intrusion into our daily lives hodel said 
other conservatives offered similar reactions 
im sorry to see someone who has been such a good public 
servant and a dedicated reaganaut leave office said rep henry 
hyde rill i think hes been a good attorney general and im 
sorry to see him leave if he isnt leaving on his own terms 
conservative spokesman richard a viguerie said in a statement 
ed meeses resignation is a blow to conservatives but not 
unexpected on the list of conservative heroes for the 1980s ed 
meeses name is at the top 
the ranking republican on the senate judiciary committee strom 
thurmond of south carolina commended meese for serving the country 
in a highly capable manner 
and sen phil gramm rtexas said meese made a wise decision 
in using the vindication of the independent counsels investigation 
to put this controversy behind him the way is now cleared he 
said for the appointment of an attorney general who can do his job 
without the burden of this controversy upon his shoulders 
rep harris fawell rill agreed with meeses decision the 
fellow has been charged with a lot of hearsay allegations none of 
which the special counsel has been able to establish he said 
but on the other hand the perception is not good 
senate republican leader bob dole said the mckay investigation 
cleared ed meese of any criminal wrongdoing something he 
predicted from the start 
on the other side liberals hailed meeses departure many 
saying it should have happened long ago 
among those was norman dorsen president of the american civil 
liberties union 
mr meese is due his day in court to resolve his own personal 
legal troubles and like every american he deserves to be presumed 
innocent until proven guilty dorsen said in a statement from 
aclu headquarters in new york but the jury of public opinion is 
already in with respect to his record on civil liberties he leaves 
behind a legacy stained with disrespect for the bill of rights and 
the citizens it was crafted to protect 
on capitol hill one of meeses most vocal critics sen howard 
m metzenbaum dohio said meese was an embarrassment to the 
united states his resignation is long overdue and should have come 
months ago 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of a civil service 
subcommittee that has criticized the ethical standards of the 
reagan administration said hopefully this will help them put 
some people in to bring a little dignity and vigor back 
sen patrick j leahy dvt said he was surprised at the 
timing adding the damage has already been done to the justice 
department 
he added im sure the withdrawal is not to refurbish the 
image of the department of justice i didnt think anything 
could get him to leave certainly everybodys been telling him 
hes doing enormous damage to the department 
the only thing i can think of is that finally the political 
gurus at the white house went to him and said youre causing too 
much damage to the candidates this fall goodbye 
sen paul simon dill agreeing with the decision to resign 
said meese could have served without controversy in a position 
such as secretary of transportation 
hyde said meeses resignation takes him out of the equation 
now as a figure of controversy in the upcoming elections 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash asked whether the 
resignation would have the effect of focusing more attention on the 
alleged ethical problems of house speaker jim wright dtexas said 
the two situations were entirely different 
meeses case involved a review by an independent counsel of 
whether the attorney general should be charged with criminal 
conduct foley said the review by the ethics committee of 
wrights finances has nothing to do with criminal misconduct

a restoration team on tuesday finished the 
yearlong 500000 task of cleansing a century of grime from a 
famous fresco on the ceiling of the capitol rotunda 
the cleaning was the first for the apotheosis of george 
washington the 4664squarefoot work by italian immigrant 
constantino brumidi completed in 1865 at the apex of the thennew 
rotunda 
this has become a very colorful painting said conservator 
bernard rabin of cranbury nj who headed the fiveperson 
restoration team it will have almost a jewellike quality 
the fresco a painting made on a wall as the plaster is drying 
depicts washington surrounded by several maidens greek gods 
american inventors and a host of others 
one previous cleaning was commissioned in 1957 but officials 
said the job resulted in a darkening of the fresco because the 
mural painter allyn cox simply repainted it to match the dirty 
colors that had accumulated over the years 
rabins work has left the fresco several shades brighter than it 
was 
workers constructed 180foottall metal scaffolds to reach the 
painting atop the scaffolds was a wooden platform just below the 
fresco that the conservators stood on and which has obscured the 
art from viewers 
conservators planned to begin tuesday night to remove the 
scaffolds erected in june 1987 and are expected to have them 
completely removed in 10 days 
rabin estimated that he and his helpers retouched about 5 
percent of the fresco in spots where the original paint had flaked 
off the rest of their work involved removing dirt and coxs paint 
accomplished with sponges and a solution of water and detergent 
it wasnt like washing windows rabin said

conversations that were secretly taped as part 
of the governments investigation of pentagon contracting show a 
defense consultant raising money for projects of a powerful florida 
congressman according to a report broadcast tuesday 
nbc news said it had obtained transcripts of federal wiretaps of 
charles gardner a former official of unisys corp now working as a 
consultant for defense contractors 
gardner organized a charity golf tournament in the district of 
rep bill chappell jr chairman of the house defense 
appropriations subcommittee that raised nearly 100000 from 
defense contractors nbc said 
the fbi is investigating the tournament which was held this

iran told the world tuesday the us navy 
created a wave of rage by shooting down an iranian jetliner 
and the designated heir to power urged terrorist attacks on 
american targets around the world 
tehran radio quoted president ali khamenei as saying in letters 
to heads of state that iran has the right to avenge the blood of 
innocent children men and women iran said all 290 people on the 
iran air flight were killed when the airbus a300 was shot down 
sunday 
while the us leadership has not yet officially declared its 
war against irans people it has by resorting to this criminal 
act which followed earlier aggressive actions taken a serious 
step toward war with a revolutionary islamic nation he said 
khamenei asked other nations to condemn the united states for 
the action by the us missile cruiser vincennes which he said 
roused a wave of rage in iran 
at the united nations in new york iran demanded a security 
council meeting condemnation of the united states for the 
terrorist attack and withdrawal of us military forces from 
the persian gulf where iran and iraq have been at war since 
september 1980 
the radio said ayatollah hussein ali montazeri designated 
successor to revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
urged him in a letter to order revolutionary cells inside and 
outside iran to unleash their wrath on american financial 
political and military targets everywhere 
he said iran must ignite a fire which will burn america and 
its lackeys 
khomeini 87 declared monday we must all be prepared for a 
real war and go to the war fronts and fight against america and its 
lackeys i donate my worthless life for the sake of our victory 
in other developments 
a sixman team of us experts led by an admiral arrived in 
the gulf tuesday to begin a confidential investigation us 
officials said the airliner bound for dubai from a 
militarycivilian airport in bandar abbas was mistaken for an 
iranian f14 jet fighter 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati told a news 
conference at the united nations that iran air flight 655 had sent 
normal signals to all radar that it was a civilian plane 
the pentagon said tuesday it transmitted information on two radio 
channels one identified with f14s 
american military sources said at least two other mixups 
between us warships and commercial aircraft had occurred in the 
past month they said one involved a pilot who though a navy ship 
was ordering him to change course and in the second a vessel just 
arriving in the gulf fixed its firecontrol radar briefly on an 
airliner 
air traffic to the united arab emirates was disrupted iran 
air canceled its daily flights from bandar abbas to dubai and said 
it would not use the corridor threatened by the american naval 
presence dubai canceled flights of other airlines using the same 
corridor over the strait of hormuz and air traffic to abu dhabi 
105 miles away also was affected 
iran has been trying to improve relations with other nations to 
end its isolation particularly us allies in western europe and 
a wave of terrorism corresponding with its fiery rhetoric would 
jeopardize that effort 
hashemi rafsanjani the parliament speaker and military 
commander said tuesday in tehran today is the day of test for 
international organizations in the world we will watch the 
reaction of the united nations the court in the hague and other 
organizations for their reaction to this frightful crime 
a dispatch from the official islamic republic news agency quoted 
him as saying that even if the destruction of the airliner was a 
mistake america cannot be forgiven 
this catastrophe is worse than the crime at hiroshima he 
said referring to the first use of the atomic bomb in august 1945 
the americans created the disaster they paved the way for the 
disaster and committed the crime we cannot allow ourselves to 
refrain from taking revenge the choice of timing is up to us not 
to america 
iran has accused the americans of deliberately shooting down the 
plane which it said carried 252 iranians and 38 noniranians 
tehran radio said tuesday that 200 bodies had been recovered and 
wreckage had been found but not the flight recorder 
state television repeatedly showed scenes of floating bodies 
irans envoy to the international civil aviation organization 
ali akbar golrounia said tuesday in toronto that iranian air 
traffic controllers heard no warnings from the vincennes and that 
the jetliner was still climbing when it was hit he asked the 
montrealbased icao to investigate

united arab emirates were canceled delayed or diverted after a 
us warship shot down an iranian jetliner headed to the persian 
gulf country airport sources said 
iran air has stopped its daily flights from the iranian airport 
of bandar abbas across the gulfs strait of hormuz to dubai 
airport airline sources said 
it is the same flight the iran air aircraft was making when it 
was hit sunday by missile fire from the uss vincennes which us 
officials said mistook the airbus 300 for an iranian f14 fighter 
jet iran said all 290 aboard were killed 
dubai airport has canceled all flights of other airlines using 
the same route over the strait and declared a state of alert since 
the downing of the iranian plane airport sources said

major carrier gulf air which were scheduled to arrive at the abu 
dhabi airport did not come in passengers instead had to disembark 
at sharjah airport about 120 miles to the south without advance

identified 
several passengers told the associated press they planned to sue 
the airline or the travel agencies that were responsible 
japan air lines said monday that its twiceweekly flight from 
tokyo to athens has changed its persian gulf route to avoid the 
area where the airbus was shot down a jal official said the planes 
will begin flying over abu dhabi instead of over dubai the route 
is farther south and will add five minutes flight time the 
official said 
there was also conflicting information on the number and 
nationalities of passengers and crew aboard the downed airbus 
iranian official reports said there were 290 people aboard the 
airbus and the figure was repeated by mustafa foumeni haeri 
iranian ambassador to the united arab emirates at a news conference 
on monday 
but a manifest provided by the iran air office in dubai showed 
there were only 288 people including crewmembers on board the 
list in english did not give nationalities for most of the 
victims who included arabs pakistanis indians and italians in 
addition to the iranians 
haeri told reporters that among the victims were japanese and 
koreans but the japanese and south korean embassies in abu dhabi 
said that judging from the manifest they did not believe there 
were any japanese or koreans on the plane

100000 unsecured bonds tuesday and ordered not to set foot in 
robeson county while awaiting trial 
eddie hatcher 30 and timothy jacobs 19 walked out of the 
federal courthouse in new bern to the cheers and hugs of about 35 
residents of the county where they had protested alleged official 
corruption 
us magistrate charles mccotter set the conditions for their 
release after a 90minute hearing but he indicated he was 
reluctant to free the two men who are accused of taking up to 20 
people hostage at the robesonian newspaper feb 1 
i dont know of a clearer case for detention because these are 
serious crimes mccotter said before setting out a long list of 
restrictions for bond but mccotter said a ruling by the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals last week which held that hatcher and 
jacobs had been denied a timely detention hearing after their 
arrest gave him no choice 
the conditions require hatcher and jacobs to stay out of robeson 
county avoid all contact with government witnesses report daily 
by telephone to federal probation officers and to return to the 
residences of courtapproved custodians by 9 pm daily 
hatcher is to stay with an uncle jim hatcher of winstonsalem

jacobs is to live in halifax county with a family friend patricia 
richardson who said he could make and sell indian crafts while 
staying with her family 
ive seen murderers and rapists let out on bond right away 
but they put us through hell for the last five months jacobs 
said as he left the courthouse 
hatcher praised the support of fellow american indians 
it shows there are more people than us who know whats going 
on he said 
asked if hatcher and jacobs would cooperate with a state task 
force investigating their charges of drug trafficking by law 
enforcement officers in robeson county defense attorney bob warren 
said weve been cooperating with the task force and will 
continue to 
hatcher and jacobs previously had been denied bond three times 
twice by us magistrate wallace dixon in fayetteville and most 
recently by us district court judge terence boyle in april 
hatcher and jacobs are scheduled to be tried on the 
hostagetaking and federal firearms violations next week in federal 
court in raleigh but assistant us attorney john s bruce has

it started out like just another of the 
myriad of social causes that teachers debate when they gather for 
their annual convention 
the 8227 delegates gathered for the national education 
associations annual meeting were deadlocked tuesday on a 
resolution in support of elmer geronimo pratt a convicted 
murderer and former black panther who has been in prison since 
1972 his supporters argue he didnt get a fair trial because of 
fbi interference his case has been publicized on cbss 60 
minutes 
his sister happens to be a teacher in los angeles and an nea 
member 
the voice vote was too close to call so nea president mary 
hatwood futrell ordered a rollcall vote which the union hasnt 
done in years because it is so timeconsuming 
for the next hour as delegates awaited the results of this 
somber vote strange things began to happen in the superdome where 
the teachers were seated 
teachers erupted in human waves to pass the time they tossed 
beach balls futrell included 
the teachers asked futrell to sing or dance she demurred why 
dont you do the wave again she asked and they obliged 
followed by a brisk chorus of when the saints go marching in 
futrell then boasted that she had been a cheerleader in college 
this brought a loud demand for her to demonstrate her skills 
she led a chant we want a pay raise how bout you 
after an hour the vote was in and it was indeed close 
for the resolution 3219 against 3415 abstentions 293 
ill tell you what said futrell now you see why we dont 
have rollcall votes very often

a 20foot boat flipped over drowning 
four of 15 passengers as they returned from a fourth of july 
fireworks display and the coast guard said tuesday the craft was 
overloaded and vulnerable to capsizing 
the bodies of three of the victims were recovered and the search 
of new bedford harbor continued for the body of a 5yearold boy 
presumed killed in the accident new bedford police officer ray 
furtado said 
the search was suspended because of darkness tuesday evening 
coast guard petty officer scott whalen said adding that local 
authorities would resume it wednesday without coast guard 
assistance 
furtado said the boat was headed to the dock when two boats 
passed them one on each side at a high rate of speed causing 
large waves he said the overloaded boat flipped over 
it was definitely overloaded definitely over capacity said 
coast guard petty officer david foley of the number of people on 
the boat 
the manufacturers recommended capacity for the fiberglass boat 
was 2000 pounds according to a plate attached to it empty there 
would be between two and three feet between the water and the top 
edge of the boat said coast guard lt robert campbell 
with 15 people aboard at best it would have been half that 
campbell said all it would take would be a foot and a half of 
sea to tip the boat 
petty officer 1st class brandy ian said there were about 100 
boats in the area when the accident occurred other boaters rescued 
the 11 survivors 
federal maritime law does not set limits on boat occupancy but 
negligence can be penalized with a 1000 fine ms ian said 
the owner and operator of the boat was barry constant 31 of 
north dartmouth he told police that none of his passengers wore 
lifejackets although the boat was equipped with them 
the dead were jean fauteaux 49 maria carvalho 27 and her

a probate judge exceeded his guardianship 
authority over a mentally retarded man at the walter e fernald 
state school by ordering him to undergo an aids test the 
massachusetts supreme court ruled tuesday 
the supreme court in a unanimous decision written by justice 
francis p oconnor threw out the aids testing order issued in 
1986 by probate judge eliot k cohen to the fernald school a 
department of mental retardation facility in worcester county 
a state appeals court judge had stayed cohens order pending the 
supreme court decision so the man identified in the high court 
decision only as anthony had yet to be tested the order also 
applied to another unidentified male fernald resident who allegedly 
was anthonys sexual partner 
denise mcwilliams who is both anthonys attorney and director 
of the aids law project at the gay and lesbian advocates and 
defenders organization in cambridge said she was pleased with the 
decision but disappointed it didnt go further 
the ruling is very limited in its terms she said noting 
the justices did not take up larger issues concerning state 
requirements on written informed consent from patients before tests 
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be made and their 
results disseminated 
the justices didnt take up those issues because it is clear 
that the probate and family court judge did not have authority to 
assume control of the department of mental retardation and to 
order the department to conduct tests on anthony and another 
party the court wrote 
the judge in effect and incorrectly usurped the function of 
the executive branch of the state government the court said 
mary breslauer spokeswoman for the attorney generals office 
which represented the department of mental retardation said that 
while the ruling is a narrow one we are gratified that the 
court agreed with our position that the trial judge had 
overstepped his boundary by ordering an aids test 
cohen had ordered anthony and the other man to be tested for 
aids even though that was not the issue before him 
the judge had been asked by the state to amend an earlier 
courtordered medical plan for anthony so he could have a venereal 
wart removed by the time cohen heard the case the wart had 
disappeared and anthonys physician and department officials asked 
that the request be dismissed 
but cohen ruled that the wart the unrestrictive setting at 
fernald and anthonys alleged homosexual activity were conducive 
to aids and he ordered anthony and the other patient to undergo 
the aids test 
that order came despite comments from state officials and others 
at anthonys hearing that neither anthony nor any other resident 
of the facility showed symptoms of aids that the facility was 
developing an aids education program and that aids testing was 
not medically advisable for anthony the high court said

frances newly appointed ambassador to 
iran presented his credentials in tehran ending a oneyear 
diplomatic rupture irans official islamic republic news agency 
said tuesday 
but iran said paris should be more critical of the downing of an 
iranian airliner by the us navy 
irna monitored in nicosia said ambassador christian graeff 
presented his documents to foreign minister ali akbar velayati on 
monday 
in his meeting with velayati graeff expressed deep regret 
over the us downing monday of an iranian jetliner in the persian 
gulf iran says all 290 aboard died the french foreign ministry 
also commented on the incident 
but irna quoted irans amabassador to france ali ahani as 
telling a news conference in paris monday that iran expects 
france to be a little more candid in its official statement on the 
incident and show less reservation in reacting to it 
the two countries broke off relations july 17 last year after 
iranian embassy officials in paris refused to let french 
authorities question an embassy translator suspected of terrorist 
involvement 
french police surrounded the embassy in turn iranian troops 
sealed off the french embassy in tehran france said iran had 
effectively severed relations

june 23 a week after they announced resumption of relations 
following the may 5 release of the last three franch hostages held 
by iranianbacked moslem militants in lebanon

centered on repayment of 1 billion loan made by shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi of iran before the islamic revolution in 1979

one possibility emerging tuesday to 
explain the downing of an iranian passenger jet was that the plane 
could have been signaling but the us warship that shot it down 
got the wrong message 
the airbus a300 involved was delivered to iran air six years ago 
with two transponders aboard that should have responded to 
identification requests from the uss vincennes airbus spokesman 
david velupillai said in this southern french town 
in washington chief pentagon spokesman dan howard said tuesday 
that the aircraft had been broadcasting a radio identification 
signal on a frequency used only by military aircraft leading the 
vincennes captain to believe he faced attack 
a us expert said the jetliner could have installed its own 
transponder to work with their own iranian air defense 
system 
iranian airliner pilots however denied that flight 655 would 
have been sending on a military channel 
the vincennes sent electronic identification requests and voice 
warnings to change course beamed over civilian and military radio 
channels us military officials said the plane mistaken for an 
f14 fighter was shot down sunday and all 290 aboard died 
electronic identification signals are received by transponders 
electronic devices that are standard equipment on airbus planes 
said velupillai 
he said the make of transponders on airbus planes is up to the 
individual customer and he did not know the manufacturer of the 
transponders on the iran air jet 
velupillai did not know if the original transponders delivered 
with the plane had been changed or how many transponders if any 
had been on board 
all transponders regardless of make work to international 
standards on a system called secondary surveillance radar a 
civilian ground station sends a pulse to which the plane 
automatically responds with data on the height of the aircraft its 
bearing and if the pilot has dialed in a code given by the air 
traffic controller the identification code of the plane 
irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati told a news 
conference at un headquarters in new york on tuesday that iranian 
air force commander brig gen sallari not further identified 
informed him 
the plane for 14 minutes was disseminating the normal 
signals of all civilian planes which proves to any radar that 
this is a civilian plane 
howard said at the pentagon that the iranian aircraft was 
broadcasting over a radio transmitter known as identify friend or 
foe in two modes it was squawking on mode3 which is a 
common identifier for both military and civilian aircraft used in 
air traffic control 
it was also sending signals on a military mode mode2 and 
the signals that the vincennes was receiving from that 
aircraft were signals that we had previously identified or 
associated with an f14 no commercial airliners use mode2 
bill reed a spokesman at alliedsignal incs bendix 
communications divison in towson md said tuesday that one of the 
two transponders with which jetliners are normally equipped is a 
backup 
he confirmed that when an air traffic controller or other 
transmitter sends an interrogatory signal the device transmits a 
response or transponds with the planes altitude and identity 
reed said that in the case of an aircraft approaching a navy 
ship in a combat area the ship probably would send signals trying 
to trigger transponder response in every possible civilian and 
military mode they probably were hitting them with every mode 
they had reed said 
he said most civilian airliners respond only in civilian modes 
but equipment can be added 
they may have put their own transponder in there to work with 
their own air defense system reed said 
in london on tuesday capt massoud razavi a senior iran air 
pilot denied us claims that the downed a300 was transmitting on 
two transponders including a frequency used previously for 
military information 
he told a news conference at the iranian embassy the 
transponder we are using is the standard transponder and we use 
mode a which is the civilian code the code is given by dubai a 
united arab emirates member 150 miles south of bandar abbas and 
it is preset into the transponder before takeoff 
capt mehroujan gharib an iran air boeing 747 supervisory pilot 
and safety officer replied no at the same conference when 
asked if iran air civilian planes sometimes used a military 
frequency 
both iranian pilots indicated it was hard to believe the pilot 
of flight 655 bound from bandar abbas to dubai would not have 
responded to us navy challenges

the 3000 delegates of the american 
federation of teachers gave their unofficial nod to massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis but it was jesse jacksons praise of teachers 
that brought the crowd to its feet on tuesday 
both presidential candidates addressed the convention via 
satellite as the fourday gathering was ending 
if we are going to take on our foreign competitors we have to 
make teaching an honored and valued profession again said 
dukakis who spoke from boston 
the massachusetts governor the likely democratic nominee 
called for an educational venture capital fund to improve teachers 
pay and training he said the cost would be a fraction of the 
budget for the reagan administrations strategic defense initiative 
dukakis told representatives of the 677000member union that 
the election will be the most important and closest since 1960 
the aft like other aflcio unions refrained from endorsing 
anyone before the democratic and republican conventions but it 
will send more than 150 delegates to the democratic convention 
threequarters of them for dukakis and the rest for jackson 
obviously were leaning toward dukakis because hes the 
frontrunner candidate said steve hahn publicist for the aft 
dukakiss remarks followed jacksons impassioned appeal for 
doubling teachers pay and his call for all of society to take 
responsibility for educating children 
the mass media the churches and temples have a broader 
responsibility said jackson speaking from new york city 
if the schools give homework the parents must have the child 
home to do the homework we must pay for better educational 
services by doubling the pay of teachers as our most 
fundamental investment in the future of america 
he called the relationship between his mother his teacher and 
his principal a love triangle that helped him succeed 
jackson recalled his strict sixthgrade teacher promising the 
class i will never teach down to you and telling the students 
that one of youmay become governor or president someday 
also on tuesday the delegates passed a resolution seeking 
protection for gay and lesbian teachers against discrimination in 
hiring promotion and all aspects of teaching 
meanwhile dukakis also hooked up by satellite with the national 
education association meeting in new orleans and apologized for 
not being there in person 
but with a little luck we should be able to visit each other 
often in washington after november he told the more than 8000 
teacher delegates 
nea president mary hatwood futrell told dukakis that weve 
always considered you to be a friend of working men and women 
especially those in the public sector 
last week at futrells urging the nea board of directors 
endorsed dukakis for the democratic nomination

democrat michael dukakis picked up the pace in his search for a 
running mate tuesday bringing in former rivals albert gore jr and 
richard gephardt for facetoface talks gephardt said hed take 
the job but jesse jackson dismissed contenders other than himself 
as unknown quantities 
president reagan promoted george bush as his white house 
successor suggesting voters would choose the vice president over 
outandout liberal dukakis if they did a little comparison 
shopping 
dukakis meeting briefly with reporters in boston criticized 
the administration for one scandal after another after attorney 
general edwin meese iii announced his resignation 
vice president bush out of the public eye at the white house 
all day said through a spokesman ed did the right thing and i 
wish him well 
bush was mentioned by meese who spoke to reporters in 
california after the independent counsel investigating his conduct 
in office filed a report concluding there was no basis for criminal 
indictment 
meese thanked bush for his fairness and decency in regard to 
this matter republican strategists including several bush 
aides had said meeses legal problems were hurting bush who has 
campaigned on the reagan administrations record but the vice 
president never publicly criticized meese or called for his 
resignation 
dukakis however said i think the meese resignation is long 
overdue i never thought he should have been appointed in the first 
place 
he added the meese resignation itself is not going to solve 
this administrations problems this administration has had one 
scandal after another one resignation after another 
in boston dukakis met for more than an hour with gephardt in 
his statehouse office 
when the missouri congressman was asked afterward whether he he 
would accept a spot on the ticket if offered he said i would 
do that 
i want mike dukakis to be elected president and i want him to 
be a great president and i will do everything i can to that end 
he said 
gore met with dukakis at the governors brookline hme for just 
over an hour tuesday evening he made no comment to reporters as he 
arrived and when he emerged he said only i dont have a 
statement 
the president told a conservative gathering in washington the 
american people understand what liberalism means and dont like it 
so our opponents plan to go to the voters incognito theyre 
putting on political trench coats and sunglasses 
reagan quipped that the democrats will never even in the 
lowest whisper mumble the l word again 
gore the tennessee senator and gephardt flew to boston at 
dukakis invitation the vanquished rivals treated dukakis harshly 
during the heat of the primary campaign but both men eventually 
endorsed the massachusetts governor 
in addition dukakis scheduled a meeting with indiana rep lee 
hamilton on wednesday the private sessions fueled speculation that 
the certain democratic nominee was moving closer to naming a 
running mate 
jackson who dined and watched fireworks with dukakis and his 
wife monday night said tuesday he was the most qualified for the 
vice presidential nomination but continued to duck questions about 
whether he would accept the spot if it was offered to him 
the fact of the matter is i would be an asset jackson 
said im convinced that my presence would unleash new hope in 
this country regain more people 
the others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond 
their districts and beyond their home states jackson said in 
boston before leaving for new york where he held a series of 
editorial board meetings 
aides to jackson and dukakis meanwhile began discussing their 
preconvention differences with party chairman paul kirk at hand 
the two campaigns remain apart on several platform issues but 
jackson painted a picture of unity and predicted a convention far 
less hostile and rancorous than past years 
the democrats keynote speaker texas treasurer ann richards 
paid a courtesy call on dukakis and came away with a 
comfortable impression of him but the feisty richards asked 
if dukakis had any recommendations for her speech smiled and said 
michael dukakis isnt going to tell me what to say 
democratic officials were discussing a tentative convention 
framework in which jackson would deliver a prime time television 
speech on tuesday night the second night of the party sessions 
sources said 
these sources who asked not to be identified by name said 
several other vanquished primary contenders would likely speak 
during prime time on the same evening including gore gephardt 
sen paul simon of illinois and former arizona gov bruce babbitt 
former president carter is expected to make a prime time 
appearance on monday night the first night of the convention 
dukakis will be nominated on wednesday night as is customary 
and he and his vice presidential running mate will deliver 
acceptance speeches on thursday night the final night of the 
convention the sources said 
dukakis is scheduled to return to washington next week to hold 
preconvention meetings with house leaders some dukakis aides held 
out the possibility that a decision on a running mate might be made 
by then although they insisted there was no timetable

bomb squads temporarily sealed off parts of 
salem tuesday as three incendiary bombs exploded and 10 others were 
found outside buildings and under bridges leading to the city 
the bombs that exploded caused only small fires and no one was 
injured bomb disposal experts managed to defuse the other devices 
we have no indications of any motive at this time we have no 
suspects said sgt marvin jenkins of the indiana state police 
due to the fact no one has been injured and theres no property 
damage yet were very strongly hoping that this is just a poor 
joke 
but mayor frank newkirk sr who found one of the bombs next to 
a bridge said the planting of the devices was obviously an act 
of terrorism in my book certainly done by a wacko 
this quiet southern indiana community of 6000 residents is 
surrounded by the blue river and brock creek bombs were laid under 
all six bridges leading into the city 
portions of the town were sealed off temporarily as bomb 
disposal squads from fort benjamin harrison in indianapolis and 
fort knox in kentucky defused 10 devices each of which contained 
timers attached to as many as 26 sticks of dynamite and were 
concealed in paper grocery sacks 
the washington county courthouse was evacuated as were several 
businesses said paul lyles emergency management director for the 
county department of civil defense 
the bombs were hidden under sticks and other debris lyles said 
the devices that went off produced only smoke and small fires 
and their construction indicated the person responsible was not 
experienced in handling explosives he said 
they used black powder as the cap and it didnt detonate 
luckily the guy who put it there didnt know much about 
explosives lyles said 
the incendiary devices were not set so much to go bang but to 
set fires said lt ken hollingsworth of state police 
all of the bombs were turned over to agents of the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms which was investigating along with 
the fbi indiana state police army experts and local officials 
a spokesman for the sheriffs department said a transient 
believed to be from arkansas was picked up for questioning tuesday 
morning however there was no word tuesday night on any arrests 
most of the devices were found during the morning with the 
first discovered about 3 am the sheriffs department said 
although people were allowed to return to the business district 
during the afternoon lyles said were still cautious 
people should continue to look because they may not all be 
located 
morris strange who lives across from a service station where 
one device was found said he arrived home to find officials 
surrounding it of course i was scared you dont expect this to 
happen in any town in the us this isnt the middle east

israeli security forces impersonated an abc news 
television crew to trick a palestinian youth into coming with them 
and then arrested him the network charged tuesday 
abc president roone arledge sent a telex tuesday to israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir protesting the incident 1 weeks ago 
said elise adde abcs director of news information 
as of tuesday evening there had been no response from the 
israeli government she said 
abc world news tonight on tuesday aired a report saying nizar 
dakdouk was arrested by israeli civilians posing as abc news 
personnel 
dakdouks family home in bethlehem was demolished june 16 
because the israeli army said he had thrown a firebomb at a bus 
according to the report the next day the youth and his mother 
complained on israeli television that if he was suspected of 
something the army should have arrested him before blowing up the 
house abc said 
a week after the television appearance two carloads of israeli 
civilians posing as abc news personnel arrived at the dakdouk 
familys temporary housing in the village of salfit and said they 
wanted to interview dakdouk and his brother on the site of the 
destroyed house the report said the boys agreed to go 
once they were at the site one of the cars sped off with 
dakdouk and he was later arrested abc said 
abc news is deeply distressed by this and insists that an 
investigation be conducted immediately to ascertain who authorized 
such an action said arledge in the meessage to shamir 
there are no circumstances that could justify security forces 
impersonating abc news personnel he said such activity 
presents grave perils to the safety of legitimate journalists 
abc news reported in tuesdays broadcast that it had learned 
that the impostors were members of the israeli secret security 
service shin bet it said a shamir spokesman who was not

about 10000 yugoslavs demonstrated 
in this central town on tuesday shouting down with the 
government and demanding higher wages witnesses and the tanjug 
news agency said 
most were workers from a major shoe and rubbber factory borovo 
who went on strike last saturday tanjug said they want 100 
percent pay increases and full instead of partial payment of wages 
for june 
current wage scales were not available 
the strike was the latest in a series of recent actions in 
different parts of communist yugoslavia protesting new economic 
measures 
the government in may linked wages to productivity as part of a 
severe austerity program designed to cut inflation now running at 
about 175 percent and improve economic performance 
government officials claim no alternative to the program exists 
if the country wants to pay off its 21 billion foreign debt 
witnesses told the associated press by telephone from vukovar 
about 60 miles west of belgrade that demonstrators carrying 
communist party and yugoslav flags demanded changes in the 
countrys leadership 
they refused to return to work despite repeated appeals and 
promises by local officials tanjug said 
yugoslavia listed a record 1600 strikes last year involving 
over 300000 workers but most of those work stoppages did not go 
beyond factories

attorney general edwin meese iii announced 
tuesday he will resign later this month or early august even 
though an independent prosecutors 14month probe into his official 
conduct ended without indictment and completely vindicates me 
meese 56 made his surprise announcement at a news conference 
in sacramento calif 3000 miles away from his office and the 
courthouse where independent counsel james mckay filed his 830page 
report the document was not made public but mckay did not seek 
charges against meese for his ties with the scandaltarred wedtech 
corp or any other activity according to sources 
each aspect of the investigation involved meeses relationship 
with longtime friend e robert wallach who is under indictment for 
alleged racketeering in the wedtech scandal 
meese said he informed president reagan of his decision by 
telephone shortly before announcing it at the news conference he 
said he would return to private life either late this month or in 
august 
the president praised meese his confidant of two decades as a 
darned good attorney general and said he had no one in mind to 
succeed him that will all come later said the president 
meeses decision removes a stumbling block from vice president 
george bushs presidential campaign the vice president is said to 
be uncomfortable by the continuing controversy over the attorney 
generals actions but he has refrained from criticizing meese 
publicly 
meese has been a favorite political punching bag of prospective 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis and other democrats 
in a written statement bush said only ed did the right thing 
and i wish him well 
dukakis called meeses resignation long overdue 
i dont think he should have been appointed attorney general 
in the first place and he should have stepped down long ago he 
said but this administrations inability to set high standards 
for public service will not be solved by the meese resignation we 
need a president who believes in public service who will set those 
high standards and make our government something americans can be 
proud of once again 
meese said he resisted calls for his resignation while mckay was 
conducting his probe because he refused to allow myself to be 
hounded out of office by false accusations 
but now he said those allegations have been put to rest and 
the time has come for him to return to private life 
meese thus announced the end of a tenure as the nations top law 
enforcement official that was stormy even before he took office he 
survived an attempt by some senate democrats to block his 
confirmation in 1983 and was involved closely with the appointment 
of two failed supeme court nominations 
thoughout it all though meese held the trust of the man who 
counts most in the reagan administration the president turned to 
meese to conduct an early investigation into the irancontra affair 
a probe which reaped meese more criticism from congressional 
democrats and it was meese who first announced to an unsuspecting 
world that proceeds from the sale of arms to iran had been diverted 
to the contra rebels 
it was none of that which prompted the investigation by mckay 
which culminated in the report he filed with a special panel of 
appellate judges in washington the report delved into meeses ties 
with the scandalplagued wedtech corp an iraqi pipeline project 
and two other enterprises 
in filing the report mckay signaled that he did not have 
sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against meese but 
the report could have become the basis for a separate 
administrative review of meeses fitness for office 
meese told his california news conference he could not bring 
himself to resign earlier because to allow myself to be hounded 
out of office would undermine the system 
we have been subjected to a barrage of misleading and false 
allegations circulated through the media meese said 
mckays report is expected to be issued publicly later in july 
after meeses lawyers have had an opportunity to prepare a response 
to it 
mckays office would say only that it anticipated the court 
panel would direct that a copy be sent to meeses attorneys nathan 
lewin and james rocap 
in april mckay said that if he decided that no prosecution was 
warranted he would refer all of those matters for review and 
action by the appropriate administrative authorities 
before meeses announcement it was expected that any ethical 
questions raised by mckays office would be referred to the justice 
departments office of professional responsibility a unit which 
examines allegations of improper behavior inside the department 
such a review could result in a recommendation of dismissal by 
reagan 
at the justice department in washington spokesman patrick 
korten said he didnt think the prospect of an opr examination of 
meese was a major factor in resigning 
mckays office which launched its investigation of meese on may 
11 1987 had been 
examining meeses assistance to wedtech in 1981 and 1982 when 
he was white house counselor 
reviewing his actions in connection with a 1 billion proposed 
iraqi oil pipeline project after meese became attorney general 
delving into the attorney generals meetings with regional bell 
telephone company executives and his favorable recommendation on 
behalf of the firms at a time when he held 14000 in phone 
industry stock 
looking into members of a washington real estate family 
arranging to pay a 40000ayear salary for meeses wife while 
leasing office space to the justice department 
meeses lawyers say their client received no financial benefit 
from any of the matters under investigation that he violated no 
conflictofinterest or other criminal laws and violated no federal 
ethical guidelines 
at wallachs behest meese ordered a white house review that led 
ultimately to wedtechs 32 million nobid contract to build small 
engines for the army wallach was paid over 1 million by wedtech 
from 1982 to 1986 
wallach interviewed late tuesday on cable news networks lary 
king live said mckays investigation had yielded not a 
scintilla of evidence of wrongdoing on eds part and i submit 
therefore on my part 
ed meese is the consummate lawyer in the best sense of the 
word wallach said he is capable of detaching himself from his 
personal involvement to evaluate the facts which are presented 
before him 
wallach in 1985 arranged for meese to enter a financial 
partnership with w franklyn chinn an investment manager who 
subsequently became a member of wedtechs board of directors chinn 
turned a 40000 profit for meese on a 50000 investment in just 
18 months 
the pipeline portion of mckays probe involved whether meese 
conspired with swiss oilman bruce rappaport wallach and others to 
violate the foreign corrupt practices act in connection with an 
alleged plan to pay bribes to the israeli labor party to protect 
the proposed iraqi pipeline from military attack meese received a 
memo from wallach in september 1985 saying that up to 700 million 
would be paid to israel from the pipeline project and that what 
was also indicated to me and which would be denied everywhere is 
that a portion of those funds will go directly to labor meese 
says he doesnt recall reading that portion of the memo and his 
lawyers say that in any event the words dont suggest that a bribe 
was contemplated 
in connection with the pipeline meese set up a meeting for 
wallach and his client rappaport in june 1985 with thenwhite 
house national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
the attorney general also sent a letter to thenisraeli prime 
minister shimon peres in october 1985 recommending that peres 
discuss the pipeline with mcfarlane rather than the state 
department 
in connection with the telephone stock wallach urged meese in a 
memo to get personally involved as attorney general in a 
telecommunications matter pending at the justice department after 
obtaining a white house waiver allowing him to make a decision 
despite his stock holdings meese approved a reversal of the 
departments position and asked a federal judge overseeing the 
breakup of atampt to lift most of the restrictions on the types of 
business that the regional bell telephone companies could enter 
prior to obtaining the white house waiver meese had met with 
executives of four of the regional bell companies which were 
seeking the reversal of department policy

when the democratic national convention throws 
its spotlight on atlanta two distinct black communities will share 
the stage one elite welltodo and often associated with 
government officials the other poor and struggling 
this city long regarded as a pioneer for black progress and a 
center for nearly every aspect of black culture and politics is 
faced with a deteroriating relationship between the two classes of 
blacks 
one source of the problem is that blacks do not control the 
economic pursestrings in atlanta even though they hold top 
political offices according to lyndon wade executive director of 
the atlanta urban league 
you cannot run a city with politics alone you must have an 
economic base to make it go thats why theres a lot of pressure

the communist party conference directed formation 
of a system of stronger government and individual rights but 
mikhail s gorbachevs proposal for a powerful new presidency was 
conspicuously absent from documents released tuesday 
resolutions of the fourday conference that ended friday made no 
mention of the powers gorbachev sought for the presidency and gave 
a lukewarm endorsement to his proposal to make local party leaders 
head of their areas legislative bodies 
the proposed changes could have given gorbachev significant new 
powers as president while he retaining the job of party general 
secretary which now is the single most influential position in the 
soviet unions system of collective party leadership 
a highranking party official said after the close of the 
conference that gorbachev had won approval for a presidency with 
powers to control domestic international and defense policies

while the government seeks to curb 
population growth testtube baby clinics are springing up in 
egypt largely because of restrictions imposed by the religion of 
islam on children who are adopted 
while moslem religious leaders have not come out in praise of 
invitro testtube fertilization they vaguely have approved its 
use in strictly controlled situations 
so as the government spends almost 60 million a year to curb 
population growth thousands of dollars in private money are spent 
by couples who want children 
overpopulation does not contradict this idea said hassan 
eldeeb of the ministry of health every wife wants to become a 
mother and 50 or 100 more people a year wont affect the 
population 
egypt has 54 million people and gets a million new ones every 
eight months it must feed them off just 4 percent of the land 
area the nile valley the country imports 60 percent of its grain 
religious considerations play a large role in acceptance of the 
invitro technique or fertilizing an egg outside the womb in a 
test tube for reimplantation 
islam has no written laws concerning invitro fertilization but 
it is taken for granted that only married couples can use it and 
to date egypt has no sperm or embryo banks nor can women give 
birth as surrogates for others because many clerics and moslem 
doctors say these practices risk adultery 
to disobey these religious interpretations would have the effect 
of removing a doctors right to practice medicine 
under islamic law an adopted child cannot be given the foster 
parents name unless the natural parents are unknown the adopted 
child also lacks the full rights of natural offspring including 
inheritance unless the foster parent specifically bequeaths 
property to the adopted child in a will the child gets nothing 
even with the will however the child can receive no more than 
onethird of the bequeathed property 
couples seeking to avoid those restrictions are resorting to 
invitro fertilization 
the ad hoc moral standards regulating invitro fertilization are 
shared widely by egypts moslems and its 10 percent christian 
minority but for moslems islamic theologians known as the ulema 
set down the condition that the invitro procedure must be 
performed by a moslem doctor 
islam requires preservation of family lineage for 
inheritance said sheik abdallah elmashad of alazhar mosque 
the moslem worlds highest center of theological learning 
therefore the doctor carrying out the invitro fertilization 
must be a trustworthy moslem believer with a good reputation 
as head of alazhars fatwa council which interprets islams 
holy book the koran elmashad is empowered to announce opinions 
on controversial matters the worlds moslems are expected to 
follow 
in cairos plush suburb of heliopolis mohammed fayez coowner 
of an invitro fertilization center said his team follows 
elazhars directions even though they are not legally binding 
he said the alazhar shieks therefore give his clinic no 
trouble but it has run into opponents of testtube baby technology 
who are afraid the doctors might do something wrong and mix the 
specimen i tell them we cant fully guarantee anything in life 
the center is one of three major invitro clinics in the capital 
area fayez said the clinic has achieved two pregnancies among 
about 20 patients since it began late last summer 
he said his clinic charges the equivalent of about 1450 for 
the first two attempts at fertilization and 975 for the next 
three 
in this middle eastern culture typically centered on family 
life childlessness spells problems for a couple offspring are 
considered necessary to help in the fields improve the economic 
standard of poor families or to keep the wealth of the rich within 
the family 
if there is a one percent chance for couples to have their own 
they will try adoption is not favored said fayez

as a study in squadcar tedium the 
syndicated series the street goes farther than most television 
police shows have dared but some cops on the beat in new jerseys 
largest city say it still misses the mark 
most newark police officers interviewed recently found something 
to like about the street 
but all had criticisms of the program which strives for gritty 
realism by following the eighthour shifts of a pair of twoofficer 
squads it is shot on videotape with handheld cameras a far cry 
from the glamorous featurefilm style of shows such as miami 
vice 
its cheaply made and that takes away from the setting as a 
whole said sgt mitchell mcguire its giving the general 
connotation that all newark policemen have problems 
donald gabriel found the show to be a slow but not necessarily 
inaccurate portrait of his job 
the truth is boring said gabriel a patrolman for 25 years 
it the show is great for the truth but not for people waiting 
for the action to happen 
the street is carried by stations in los angeles san 
francisco chicago miami detroit and hartford conn and by 
wwortv a station in secaucus nj that serves the new york area 
but also is seen on cable in 166 markets across the country 
wwortv officials say talks about prolonging the series are 
under discussion but no decision has been made the station plans 
to run the series at least through the summer 
the street tried to be different from the start according 
to creators dan pyne and john mankiewicz 
mankiewicz who rode with officers to get a feel for the 
environment said his intention was not to create a cop show but a 
show exploring the characters of people who work as police officers 
a bunch of new shows are trying to be like movies and are not 
serving the medium mankiewicz said its a tiny little screen 
you should tell small stories 
the officers use coarse language engage in questionable onduty 
behavior and constantly discuss personal problems 
it gives the feeling that the average newark policeman is full 
of problems and needs counseling said detective gary prystauk 
most of the relatively infrequent action is lowkey the result 
of budget constraints and the writers intent pyne said the 
producers declined to discuss how much is spent per show but 
mankiewicz said we can make a show for less than don johnson 
gets for miami vice 
there is a lot of time that cops spend in their car not doing 
anything pyne said both john and i worked on miami vice 
where there is a lot of action its so hyperreal every week they 
are killing people this happens to cops maybe three times in their 
career 
we were interested in exploring the men and what goes on in 
their mind and this endless routine of dealing with mundane 
crime pyne said 
but officers interviewed from the 1060member force said their 
tours were not as relentlessly banal as those in the street 
detective fred carter believes the show is more a flawed 
personality study than a look at the real street 
you have to show the street part of it said carter 
some days youll deliver a baby or see someone crying and hungry 
and then you have to go home 
carter and other officers say they did find authenticity in the 
shows dialogue between officers 
i think its pretty good said robert wise a patrolman in 
the citys south district it shows that we have problems and 
were trying to help people with their problems

shanghai doesnt look like a city in a 
slump 
its streets are alive with welldressed shoppers its 
commercial lifeline the huangpu river is jammed with freighters 
and fishing craft 
the bund the riverfront avenue lined with massive banks and 
hotels built by european traders early in the century remains a 
symbol of shanghais longtime status as chinas commercial and 
industrial capital 
but the city of 12 million people lost its position as chinas 
no 1 industrial power in 1985 to neighboring jiangsu province it 
lost its rank as the no 1 export earner to southern guangdong 
province which benefits from being next door to hong kong 
shanghais revenues have fallen steadily for the past three 
years and worker productivity also has dropped industry grew 68 
percent last year well behind the national pace of 165 percent 
roads sewers and water pipes built early in the century are 
inadequate for present needs its industrial technology is outdated 
and half the housing predates the 1949 communist takeover 
just one telephone is available for every 63 residents it can 
take hours to get a line to call across town 
shanghais planners and business leaders also have not been 
agile enough to keep up with chinas shift from central planning 
and insularity to freer markets competition and growing trade 
jiangsu province and canton the capital of guangdong province 
took advantage of the new policies after 1978 to set up thousands 
of small tradeoriented enterprises 
shanghai bastion of centrally controlled heavy industry 
remained mired in the old system with the state making production 
decisions and acting as trade gobetween 
yang zhihua deputy director of the city planning commission 
noted in an interview that shanghais gross production of goods and 
services is still no 1 nationally at the yuan equivalent of 14 
billion and that hundreds of shanghais products from steel to 
toothpaste dominate domestic markets 
were not lagging behind in everything just in some things 
such as exports and absorption of foreign investment he said 
we can easily catch up 
but the citys performance in the past two years indicate that 
might not be easy in early 1986 city leaders announced plans for 
a subway a new airport terminal a new railroad station a tunnel 
and other projects to stimulate growth and attract foreign business 
only the rail station has been completed the subway is stalled 
by red tape and scarce funds leaving shanghais 15000 buses and 
taxis to carry more than 15 million riders a day through narrow 
streets where traffic crawls at a norm of less than five miles an 
hour 
a yearend city report said the problems in housing traffic 
congestion and pollution were acute 
the reason lies in our thinking yang said we were used 
to the past planned economic model 
threefourths of shanghais factories are owned and controlled 
by the central government in beijing bloated workers and dependent 
upon the state for bailouts they have not kept up with chinas new 
atmosphere of competition 
central planning also has forced shanghai to give most of its 
revenue to beijing retaining little for itself its annual 
contribution to beijing of more than 27 billion is 10 times that 
of guangdong which has less stateowned industry 
the central government owes shanghai a big debt said a 
local economist zhou jianming 
mayor zhu rongji took office in april determined to reverse 
shanghais decline 
he speaks fluent english and has a salesmans manner at a 
recent trade conference in beijing he assured nearly 1000 
american businessmen they will be able to repatriate profits if 
they invest in shanghai promising in english no matter how much 
money foreign investors make in shanghai we wont be jealous 
the audience after listening to jargonlarded translations of 
chineselanguage speeches by other officials laughed and applauded 
zhus plan calls for attracting billions of us dollars in 
foreign investment and borrowing millions more to revive the 
infrastructure projects and import updated technology 
he has formed a commission with himself as chairman to 
investigate ways of attracting capital and simplifying investment 
procedures 
shanghais stateowned factories also have begun slowly to adapt 
to new economic realities seven television and electronics 
factories recently formed their own export corporation to increase 
foreign sales 
shanghai also is trying to catch some of the roughandtumble 
enterpreneurial spirit that has worked so well in canton and the 
rest of guangdong which racked up a 17 percent growth rate last 
year 
shanghai follows the state regulations yang said in 
canton they dont worry about the regulations

in a strange twist of logic the united states 
is sometimes referred to these days as a debtor nation attended by 
all the negative implications that go with such a categorization 
the popularity of the debtor thesis arises mainly from 
statistics that show the value of foreignheld assets in the united 
states now exceeds the value of us assets held abroad 
the official figures verify the situation in 1987 americans 
were said to own 11 trillion of foreign assets whereas 
foreigners were credited with owning about 15 trillion worth of 
the united states 
but say critics of such thinking so what 
before lamenting the passing of a great financial power the 
critics say an application of reason might reveal that what is 
suggested as an american weakness may very well be strength instead 
their contention is that foreigners should indeed be attracted 
to us assets since such assets are a solid investment providing 
a good return in the most politically stable large nation on earth 
in short that foreign money isnt lent to desperate americans 
so much as it is invested in attractive holdings it isnt money 
begged to avert disaster it is money attracted by good prospects 
and rates of return 
at any rate says william k macreynolds of the us chamber of 
commerce the debtor nation idea does not comport with accepted 
notions of what debtor status means 
he points out for example that a common definition of a debtor 
is that of an entity having negative net worth owing more in 
liabilities than is owned in assets profligate as he is uncle sam 
doesnt fit the definition 
macreynolds comments that all us assets including corporate 
equity and bonds government obligations real estate bank assets 
and more amount to 30 trillion of that foreigners owned but 56 
percent 
he offers still another method of looking at the socalled 
burden compare it with a years worth of income by that test he 
says one years us income is more than enough to buy out all 
foreign assets owners at once 
that eventuality of course is implausible more realistically 
only a small portion of us income measured by gross national 
product is needed to satisfy foreign asset holders in the form of 
an annual rate of return 
remember what is called debt is really investment and 
investors foreign and domestic expect only a certain annual 
percentage a rate of return rather than the entire amount at 
once 
besides says macreynolds who is director of financial and 
monetary affairs for the chamber even if the popular but spurious 
definition of debtor nation is used the united states still might 
come out on top 
officially the united states held 11 trillion of foreign 
assets at the end of 1987 or considerably less than the estimated 
15 trillion of us assets held by foreigners 
but says macreynolds something doesnt add up he asks how it 
could be that us investors abroad should earn 6 billion more 
than foreigners earned here 
his guess is that the total of foreign assets held by americans 
is greatly undervalued rather than the reported 11 trillion he 
says such assets should be valued at more than 15 trillion

prime minister margaret thatchers government 
hopes to put an end to the timehonored tradition of tenure in 
british universities and it has left many academics in outrage 
tenure is the guarantee of lifetime employment for university 
professors who are accorded it but it is to be eliminated this 
summer by the governments controversial education reform bill now 
completing a stormy passage through parliament 
tenure dates back to medieval times and it is a tradition that 
has carried over to american universities 
the education reform bill has upset many professors who content 
that tenure protects them from being fired for airing unpopular 
ideas 
the government argues that british universities are failing to 
match international research standards and that by removing tenure 
it can force unproductive academics to make way for younger 
scholars and infuse the universities with a new competitive spirit 
the new rules to apply to all faculty appointed after nov 20 
1987 will empower special government commissioners to remove all 
tenure guarantees from university charters 
mrs thatcher and the academics have been at loggerheads for 
years over her attempts to reform the funding of universities in 
1984 oxford university took the unprecedented step of refusing to 
give her the honorary degree traditionally accorded to every prime 
minister as a protest of her funding cutbacks 
both sides recognize that britain is losing prominent scholars 
to american universities but while the academics say cuts in 
government spending are to blame the government argues that what 
it calls largely tenured deadwood is draining away money and 
clogging up the system 
the governments education spokesman andrew opie said half of 
britains universities offer tenure making it impossible to impose 
layoffs this he added makes it difficult for universities to 
meet changing patterns of teaching and research and to dismiss 
incompetent staff 
professor elie kedourie head of the political science 
department at the london school of economics says abolishing 
tenure will make british universities into something very second 
rate 
although a thatcher supporter kedourie fears that the 
elimination of tenure plus other changes in the education bill 
regarding university funding will enable the government to siphon 
money to profitable studies at the expense of liberal arts 
departments whose untenured staff will then lose their jobs 
he finds it very ironic that a government deeply committed 
to free markets is being so interventionist on education 
this notion of competitiveness has been very important when 
dealing with economics but universities are educational 
establishments he said in an interview 
the house of lords the unelected upper house of parliament has 
forced amendments into the bill guaranteeing academic freedom and 
prohibiting universities from replacing senior academics with 
younger lowerpaid professors solely for costcutting purposes 
but critics arent satisfied they say the amendments can easily 
be overturned in the elected house of commons and argue that the 
commitments are no substitute for centuriesold guarantees written 
into university charters 
the debate has even spread to the united states 
without tenure scholars and teachers are ultimately subject to 
outside control and thus are not free to seek and teach the truth 
as they understand it julius getman president of the american 
association of university professors wrote in a letter to the 
times of london 
an american association spokesman robert kreiser said in a 
telephone interview that the british government can more easily 
force change on universities than the us government could 
because the british institutions are more dependent on government 
funding 
he said no us government could abolish tenure in the united 
states 
every study that has ever been done has come to the conclusion 
that the alternatives to tenure are far less attractive he said 
unlike american academics who must wait up to 15 years for 
tenure the average british academic gets it almost immediately 
after completing his phd dissertation 
but while top american salaries move into the sixdigit range 
british salaries start at 9000 pounds 15300 a year and rise 
according to a national pay scale to a top level of 26000 pounds 
44200 for a senior department head 
norman stone professor of modern history at oxford university 
sees nothing wrong with government intervention in higher 
education saying it has been going on for centuries 
there was terrible trouble over this thing in the 16th century 
when erasmus the dutch philosopher wanted to start teaching latin 
and greek at cambridge and again in the 18th century when 
reformers wanted to switch oxford and cambridge out of theology and 
the like and into things like medicine stone said in an 
interview

swedish and norwegian authorities are 
taking steps to halt an influx into their countries of chileans 
seeking work and a better life they say many arrive with forged 
documents in an effort to support their claims for political asylum 
a few hundred chileans a year came to sweden at the beginning 
of the 1980s said mats baurmann a swedish immigration 
official last year 4000 applied for political asylum most of 
them came for economic reasons 
economic reasons are not enough for an alien to stay in sweden 
or norway whose officials are concerned that their liberal refugee 
policies are being abused 
the problem also involves nationalities other than chileans but 
it is particularly acute among chileans wanting to join the 17000 
other chileans who have immigrated as long ago as 1973 when gen 
augusto pinochet took power at the head of a military government in 
santiago 
about 18000 people applied for asylum in sweden last year 
about 14000 were accepted but most of their applications had been 
pending for at least a year altogether sweden had 37000 
immigrants in 1987 said the goverments immigration agency 
the swedish government reportedly is considering tightening its 
immigration laws similar to legislation adopted by norway in june 
requiring all visiting chileans starting july 1 to obtain entry 
visas in advance of arrival 
norwegian officials rejecting claims that their move reflected 
a wave of antiimmigration sentiment among voters said they wanted 
only to sift out actual political refugees from the growing tide of 
people seeking to improve their economic well being 
annette thomessen head of the norwegian organization for asylum 
seekers said in oslo that she supported the new regulations 
she claimed that some travel agents in chile promise jobs and 
housing to those who buy tickets to norway 
but when they arrive here they get nothing she said 
instead they are sent back deeply in debt 
neighboring denmark which also has a relaxed immigration 
policy has registered no significant increase of requests for 
asylum from chileans a justice ministry spokesman in cophenhagen 
said 
baurmann the swedish official said most of the chilean 
applicants come from poor areas of their country they borrow from 
banks or from relatives to pay the return ticket which they need 
to enter sweden without a visa he added 
they arrive saying they are tourists but after a while they 
apply for political asylum baurmann told the associated press 
baurmann confirmed swedish press reports that a wouldbe 
immigrant can buy a forged document in chile that testifies that he 
or she is a victim of political persecution the documents usually 
bear the signature of a purported priest politician or human 
rights representative he said 
the dagens nyheter newspaper quoted luis bork the head of the 
human rights commission in the chilean city of valparaiso as 
saying i have seen my name on more than 200 forged documents 
we categorically oppose this kind of exile people should stay 
here and fight for democracy only if the person is threatened by 
jail or death do we help 
baurmann said most documents presented by chileans are authentic 
but are signed by people without authority or credibility 
swedish authorities do not deny that there is political 
oppression in chile but swedens rules must be tightened he 
said 
about 65 percent of the chileans coming to sweden are allowed to 
stay even though many are rejected for asylum he said 
processing an application can take up to two years while living 
expenses are paid by the government even if an applicant is denied 
asylum many of them get rooted in sweden and eventually are 
allowed to stay said baurmann 
anita doratio head of the swedish organizations for asylum 
seekers told the national radio that it would be cynical to 
tighten the rules 
she argued that swedes were not turned away when poverty forced 
1 million of them to emigrate to the united states 100 years ago

an old gag has it that unitarian universalists 
believe in one god at most 
theres truth in that says the rev william f schultz the 
affable president of the distinctively openminded denomination 
some say god is everything in the bushes and stars and some 
say hes not at all 
in fact he adds its basically impossible to say just what 
beliefs the historically influential church holds and that is one 
of the big challenges it faces 
weve always been creedless he said in an interview 
weve always tried to be open to all sources of inspiration and 
not limited to any forms of it 
while weve been global in our loyalities we have not been 
effective in articulating a clear message that all unitarian 
universalists could affirm thats one of our central tasks 
while relatively small but with a recently growing membership 
of 179000 the denomination has been at the forefront of such 
social causes as racial justice womens rights sheltering 
refugees and peace 
but with its wideopen religious perspective the church has had 
a hard time specifying just what it believes for example shultz 
offered mixed answers when asked if members hold such traditional 
religious beliefs as these 
q do they believe in a god who cares about each person 
a a few would the majority would not believe in that kind of 
personal god 
q life hereafter 
a most would not believe in a traditional hereafter perhaps a 
third would say they simply dont know some would say the 
scientific studies of death and dying point to some kind of 
ongoing existence 
q did god create the universe 
a some would say the universe had no discreet beginning that 
it always existed that it was not godcreated few call god an 
individual and most would say forces of evolution brought it into 
being 
schultz 38 a relaxed genial pennsylvanian with neatly trimmed 
beard and merry eyes was elected to his post in 1985 one of the 
youngest heads of an american denomination 
the unitarian universalist association headquartered in boston 
draws on all major religions in its teachings buddhism hinduism 
islam judaism christianity and others along with their different 
scriptures 
while the denomination encompasses all that variety of beliefs 
along with humanism schultz said its membership generally affirms 
several broad concepts that are characteristic namely 
that history and the future are in human hands an entirely 
human responsibility and we do not believe in a god or fate that 
controls it 
that there is no supernatural separate from nature that 
the natural world is interconnected and everything in the 
universe is dependent on everything else 
we do not believe that blessings come from the miraculous 
but that they are hidden in the everyday in the ordinary to find 
the face of god the emergence of the holy look to the ordinary 
the everyday 
yet even using those words such as god and holy is not 
altogether acceptable to members he said to some those terms 
are great but theyre anathema to others 
he uses them he said because they have some residual 
meaning 
a minority wing called the the unitarian universalist christian 
fellowship works to get the denomination to identify clearly with 
jesus as its central figure of guidance publishing such needling 
questions as 
so you want to be a christian but your church isnt 
schultz estimates that elmement makes up about 10 percent of 
members he says the denomination honors jesus as a model for 
living but not as divine other churches consider him both human 
and divine 
under schultz leadership the church has had a growth rate of 1 
to 2 percent a year the membership climbing from a low of 166000 
at the end of the 1970s to its present 179000 
he was born into the church but he said few are only about 10 
percent about 90 percent were raised in other faiths 23 percent 
excatholics 17 percent exmethodists a third exjews 
many are drawn into the church through interfaith marriages 
between christians and jews he said he estimated 20 to 25 percent 
are agnostics or atheists while the rest are comfortable with 
the word god 
most do not believe in the kind of god that controls events in 
this world or that you can talk to he said 
most would identify god as the ground of all being the 
sources of creativity and blessings the pattern of evolutionary 
forces in the universe that move life along developmental paths 
some would identify him as all nature identifical with 
evolutionary forces some would see him as the force of inspiration 
to love the ideals to which we aspire as that on which we are 
dependent as love and wholeness

more than 400 plans exist among various 
christian organizations to evangelize the world by the end of this 
century says a key figure in steps to coordinate the efforts 
the rev thomas wang steering committee chairman of a 
consultation planned by the different groups for next january says 
many of such past efforts have failed because of disorganization 
isolation and competition 
whats happening now is very different he said at a program 
committee meeting at headquarters of one of the major groups the 
southern baptist foreign mission board to plan an agenda for the 
world consultation 
all of a sudden it seems many of gods servants all over the 
world have begun to take the end of this century not as a magical 
number but as a target a goal a stimulation for world 
evangelism he said 
there has never been an age in the history of the church that 
is more qualified to tackle this task of world evangelization in 
terms of manpower resources technology communications and 
transportation

partys brief flirtation with anarchy the new york times commented 
in midjune this is a party that has been quite willing to 
destroy itself to thrash out the most divisive issues that the 
country faced among them civil rights and the war in vietnam 
and among consequences of 68 were farreaching reforms that in 
effect broke the power of oldline party bosses devised new ways 
in its nominating procedures and kept the white house in republican 
hands in three of four elections 
it was a tragic year for the democratic party and for 
responsible politics in a way recalls former minnesota sen 
eugene mccarthy a presidential aspirant and principal in the 
events of 1968 
there were already forces at work that might have torn the 
party apart anyway the growing womens movement the growing 
demands for greater racial equality an inability to incorporate 
all the demands of a new generation 
but in 1968 the party became a kind of unrelated bloc of 
factions each refusing accommodation with another each wanting 
control at the expense of all the others says mccarthy who now 
lives in virginia and is putting the finishing touches on his 12th 
book of essays required reading

the hotels aging facade reflected the eerie glow of television 
lights as line after line of helmeted police officers followed 
teargas canisters into the crowd a skyblue scythe cutting a 
bloodred swath 
i remember finding a room high up in the hotel so i could 
watch thinking back recalled mike royko the pulitzer 
prizewinning columnist of the chicago tribune its hard to 
believe that spasm of well silliness turned out to be a pivotal 
point in american history 
thats not to minimize the goals of some of the people in the 
antiwar movement there were people in there with genuine social 
consciences and many were active in the civil rights movement 
but because people saw this on tv the fight for the 
democratic party came down to a confrontation between bullheaded 
cops and a bunch of nervous tired kids following leaders who 
talked about revolutionary theory and suddenly had everybody paying 
attention 
i remember the chant the whole world is watching well 
most of america was anyway and except for jimmy carter squeaking 
through they have put republicans in the white house ever since 
from a fiveroom suite on the hiltons 25th floor then vice 
president hubert humphrey watched the scene below his fate already 
in the hands of men whose job was to keep the chaos in the streets 
from reaching the convention site four miles to the south 
humphrey had not won a single one of the 15 party primaries had 
not even entered the campaign until two days after lbj said he was 
getting out 
yet everyone who came to chicago that week the supporters of 
the dovish mccarthy the backers of earnest south dakota sen 
george mcgovern the idealists who hadnt recovered from robert 
kennedys assassination knew humphrey likely would emerge the 
candidate 
in 1968 delegates ran on primary ballots without a stated 
preference and the political professionals the governor the 
mayor the state party chairman exercised an inordinate amount of 
influence on how the entire delegation voted 
that enabled humphrey to court the local heavyweights and come 
away with all the delegates in states such as pennsylvania which 
had given 90 percent of its vote to mccarthy in the beauty 
contest 
it was as crude a display of power as had been seen in many 
years punctuated by the televised sequence of daley drawing a 
finger across his broad neck in a signal to the podium to cut the 
microphones as connecticut sen abraham ribicoff gave his 
nominating speech for mcgovern and spoke of gestapo tactics in 
the streets of chicago 
soon afterward those same party professionals delivered 
humphreys firstballot nomination with the same sanguine 
efficiency police displayed in their 20minute downtown sweep of 
protesters 
i recall seeing antiwar protest leader david dellinger 
standing along the curb right in front of the blackstone hotel 
said deputy chief of patrol carl dobrich who served in the chicago 
police task force that night 
he was standing there like a whipped puppy he was in this 
incredibly rumpled suit and was holding a longstemmed flower a 
daisy or something the stem had been broken in the middle and he 
looked pathetic an hour or so before hed been a leader a 
guru or whatever and he was going to lead everybody to a new 
world 
now concluded dobrich who was subsequently tried and 
acquitted of federal perjury charges stemming from the disturbance 
he didnt have anyone around him 
by the end of the week 691 demonstrators had been arrested 200 
protesters were treated for injuries and an estimated 200 others 
never sought treatment for their wounds the police also paid a 
price with 161 injuries 
dellinger would spend a good part of the next few years in 
chicago as one of eight defendants charged with inciting violence 
at the 1968 convention 
the chicago seven trial black panther leader bobby seales 
case was quickly severed from the rest opened in september 1969 
and quickly became one of the most notorious in recent history 
the defendants and their attorneys were cited for contempt of 
court nearly 200 times they became a cause celebre their 
convictions overturned in 1972 by the 7th us circuit court of 
appeals their paths since as divergent as the motives that brought 
them together 20 years ago 
i have no regrets about the 60s whatsoever abbie hoffman 
who works as a political organizer said recently 
the only regrets i have is that we didnt do it deeper make 
it last longer

deputy chief of patrol carl dobrich of the chicago police who 
served in the conventions disturbance task force 
it was anarchy in the making there were some good people 
some sincere people out there in the parks and streets but there 
were many others who were without any leadership and who were just 
looking for trouble 
on wednesday midway through the convention i heard officers 
being dispatched to the band shell area in grant park where the 
flag was being taken down and replaced with some kind of viet cong 
banner one thing kind of led to another when the officers moved 
in the demonstrators were gathering around protest leader david 
dellinger looking for instructions 
after that skirmish dellinger pulled out of the band shell 
area leading his flock as it were 
some of the crowd headed for the hilton 
when we went for the first two to haul them away they lashed 
out at the officers arresting them and kicked them i got kicked 
myself 
then everything started flying through the air as they 
started throwing things rocks shoes everything 
a tray full of dishes came flying out the window of one of the 
hotel rooms but i couldnt see from which floor 
later i recall seeing dellinger standing along the curb right 
in front of the blackstone hotel he was standing there like a 
whipped puppy he was in this incredibly rumpled suit and was 
holding a longstemmed flower a daisy or something the stem had 
been broken in the middle and he looked pathetic an hour or so

it looks like a smile on his face but its really a grimace 
it happened when a line of cops came forward with dobrich 
commanding a woman had come over and was shaking her hand at 
the police obviously incensed at what shed seen i wasnt the

threetime california assemblyman tom hayden remembers seeing 
fellow protest leader rennie davis have his head split open by 
the police while he thought he was trying to calm down or defuse a 
potential confrontation at an assembly at the band shell 
then he was taken away to the hospital and police came to the 
hospital trying to arrest him 
hospital workers had to hide him and get his head bandaged and 
get him into a cab so he could go to an apartment and rest 
late at night when the demonstrators got from the band shell 
to the front of the hilton it seemed to be the high point or the 
low point of the weeklong confrontations when they sat down and 
the television lights came on and they chanted the whole world is 
watching 
i was right there i was in the group of people that was being 
maced and we backed up and a woman started screaming 
we fell back through the windows of the haymarket lounge and 
everyone fell into the hilton and the police came after us 
through the broken windows it was hard to breathe with the gas 
and the mace but in any event there was a lot of panic and then 
the crowd fell backward and everyone fell into the windows 
i guess i wouldnt want to go through those times again 
hayden davis and six others were charged with conspiracy to 
incite violence

newsday columnist murray kempton now 70 was a convention 
delegate for mccarthy and was arrested for disorderly conduct 
during a march on the last day of the convention 
looking back it was a little illogical marching on an event 
i already had a pass to but we felt at the time that if they had a 
few older guys there it would make things quieter 
the cops were very nice once we got to the police station 
wed watched some of the earlier violence on monitors from the 
convention floor and some of the younger people i encountered who 
had been arrested seemed almost relieved when they finally were in 
custody it was safer than the streets i guess 
like a damned fool i took a trial instead of copping a plea 
on the disorderly conduct charge i had to go back to chicago it 
took weeks and nearly bankrupted me at one point i had lunch with 
the mayor while they were crucifying me upstairs they finally 
fined me 250

prosecuting some of the people that i did 
i remember especially prosecuting a very classy group of 
people 13 of them as i recall and wondering why they were in a 
courtroom 
i was curious at the time as to why they would have behaved 
the way they did it seemed immature to me then i was 33 but

historian staughton lynd who now works at a youngstown ohio 
legal clinic 
i was with a group of pacifists we decided to march to 
the convention site in opposition to the vietnam war and the police 
orders that demonstrators had to stay away from the amphitheatre 
we got there about a thousand strong and instead of just 
sitting down en masse which we should have done we decided to 
picket all night so there were only two or three dozen by morning 
when they arrested us easily it was a very minor sideshow 
my feelings havent changed that much in the intervening 
years the major convention demonstrations set the tone i think 
the wrong one for the next few years of protest they contributed 
to a lessening in the energy for local organizing

eugene mccarthy former us senator from minnesota whose 
campaign for the democratic presidential nomination had spurred a 
number of the demonstrators to come to chicago although he urged 
them to stay away 
i was fairly insulated from the actual violence but i saw a 
lot of the aftermath when they brought the wounded in from the 
fighting outside the hotel they set up a temporary hospital in the 
hilton the hilton charged us for the sheets that were used to make 
bandages 
later in the week the mccarthy headquarters on the hotels 15th 
floor were raided by police and some of the campaign workers were 
beaten 
mainly they routed people out of bed i was in my suite on 
the 23rd floor when i heard what was happening a girl was standing 
on a landing very upset and she said to me i dont know why 
they did this we were playing bridge and i had a 21point hand 
 
mccarthy says he had intended to leave chicago on friday but 
the secret service warned him not to 
they told me chicago mayor richard daley intended to arrest 
everyone with mccarthy credentials once i had left i stayed on 
another day and we managed to sneak almost all of my people out of 
chicago before i left 
when my plane was taking off from midway airport on saturday

mitch kuhn leafs through one of his bound 
collections of political buttons pauses at a page of peacesymbol 
pins and reaches 20 years into his memory for a blackandwhite 
image from august 1968 
i was a peace activist in milwaukee kuhn says i had 
worked for sen eugene mccarthy and when i saw on television the 
mccarthy folks being rousted out of their rooms at the hilton and 
beaten and bloodied that goes right to the bottom of your soul 
in hindsight looking back i wish id have been here 
here chicago 1968 when in the last week of august thousands 
of angry young antiwar protesters upstaged the democratic national 
convention and the nomination of hubert humphrey with violent 
nationally televised clashes with police in the parks and on the 
streets 
those who were there may remember the stinging tear gas the 
crackling megaphones or the sight of an enraged mayor richard j 
daley leaping to his feet on the convention floor at connecticut 
sen abraham ribicoffs denunciation of gestapo tactics in the 
streets of chicago 
but for those who were not there the artifacts remain and for 
reasons both economic and emotional prices for 68 convention 
collectibles have risen dramatically 
certain humphrey campaign buttons are worth 150 more than 10 
times their book value just 10 years ago copies of the seed 
chicagos leading underground newspaper of the day have doubled in 
price in less than five years and now sell for about 10 at 
rarebook stores 
as in any market scarcity increases value clean documented 
20yearold buttons bearing the onceubiquitous peace symbol go for 
2 but several buttons designed by cartoonist jules feiffer to 
help raise money to defend the chicago seven protest leaders 
charged with conspiracy to incite violence at the convention go 
from 5 to 1250 depending on their condition 
books of the era also are in demand says kenan heise who owns 
chicago historical bookworks in suburban evanston 
typical buyers are people in their late 30s and 40s who shared 
the rebellious spirit of the times and yearn for something more 
tangible than their memories says heise who recently added a 
shelf of outofprint books by the chicago seven 
trial by tom hayden published in 1970 at 195 sells for 
15 abbie hoffmans 1968 paperback revolution for the hell of 
it published at 195 goes for 1250 listed at 12 are jerry 
rubins we are everywhere written secretly in the cook 
county jail and smuggled out according to a cover blurb or do 
it read this book stoned 
there also are memorabilia collectors who just like the way the 
stuff looks 
one of the best things to come out of the 60s was the 
buttons says jim norton 51 of suburban oak park who collects 
antivietnam war pins 
at the spring meeting of the local chapter of the american 
political items collectors a 2000member national organization 
norton pointed out his favorites circa 1968 an antilyndon 
johnson button inscribed lsd not lbj a blackandwhite pin 
bearing a sketch of uncle sam with a pistol and a 
redwhiteandblue button showing a dove shedding a bloody tear 
my daughter almost cried when she saw that he said 
the market for chicago 68 artifacts is broad enough to include 
everything from a comicbookstyle copy of poet allen ginsbergs 
testimony at the chicago seven trial 25 at heises store to a 
humphreymuskie poster also 25 
but some items are valued by their owners beyond any price 
charles sky king 48 worked as a newspaper film courier during 
the convention and remembers steering his motorcycle through the 
tear gas in lincoln park with a photographer standing up behind him 
on the passenger footpegs shooting riot scenes 
his souvenirs include a brightorange secret service pass and

they were leftwing activists whose courtroom 
antics and commitment to political change reflected a generation of 
angry youths disillusioned by a nation in undeclared war thousands 
of miles away 
the defendants who won national attention in the chicago seven 
trial are middleaged and grayer now one the author of a barbecue 
cookbook another a professional partygiver many are fathers and 
husbands 
but most remain committed to a watereddown brand of the 
activism that made them household names 20 years ago 
a lot of people tell me im selling out because i wrote a 
cookbook says former black panther leader bobby seale 51 whose 
barbecuing with bobby was recently published 
i say why do you want to pigeonhole me seale says i 
still believe in revolving political and economic power back to the 
hands of the people 
seale and seven others were charged with conspiracy to incite 
violence in august 1968 at the democratic national convention in 
chicago 
the 4month theatrics featured wildhaired defendants whose 
antics included wearing judicial robes to court taking them off 
and stomping on them and a 74yearold judge who refused to allow 
seale his own attorney and ordered him bound and gagged in the 
courtroom when he protested 
i think it certainly was a microcosm of the times former 
defendant john froines says but it was also theater so it was 
an exaggerated statement of the times as well 
when abbie hoffman said that the judge came right out of 
central casting it was true instead of them picking a liberal 
judge who was very restrained they picked a very harsh prejudiced 
jurist who in a sense kind of reflected the kind of oppression that 
people were talking about as being the nature of america at the 
time 
the case opened in september 1969 and became known as the 
chicago seven trial when us district judge julius hoffman severed 
seale from the others convicted him of contempt of court and 
sentenced him to four years in prison 
five of the other seven defendants rennie davis david 
dellinger tom hayden abbie hoffman and jerry rubin also were 
charged with crossing state lines with intent to riot and were 
found guilty in february 1970 
froines and lee weiner were acquitted none of the defendants 
was convicted of the conspiracy charge 
the five convictions and seales contempt citation later were 
overturned by the 7th us circuit court of appeals citing errors 
by judge hoffman and criticizing his courtroom demeanor 
the seven defendants and their attorneys also were cited for 
contempt of court nearly 200 times but all but 15 of the citations 
were dismissed 
in a 1982 interview a year before his death at age 87 judge 
hoffman said the defendants had made a mockery of the nations 
highest trial court 
most have no regrets about their behavior during the trial 
i was standing up for the sixth amendment of the 
constitution seale says that every citizen has the right to 
have legal counsel of his choice 
i never disrupted the courtroom unless my name was mentioned 
but judge id say youre a racist facist dog you denied me my 
constitutional rights 
seale the father of three now works in minority recruitment at 
temple university in philadelphia where he is doing graduate work 
in political science and africanamerican studies 
he also works in a program aimed at getting students into 
community service and social action 
ive refined my perspective a lot says seale i stopped 
advocating overthrowing the government when the government stopped 
trying to overthrow our organization 
he plans to use proceeds from his cookbook to fund scholarships 
for minority college students 
former yippie leader abbie hoffman one of the brashest of the 
defendants during the trial remains one of the most politically 
involved 
im an american dissident says hoffman now 51 and the 
father of three

he has made a career out of political protests and has been 
arrested numerous times in recent years in demonstrations against 
south africbert e van patten leader of gloc research at the armstrong 
aerospace medical research laboratory at wright patterson says 
germans put meters in their ju88 dive bombers in world war ii to 
pull the plane out at low altitudes if the pilot lost consciousness 
all in all we arent that far ahead van patten says 
hill says gloc gained priority again about four years ago when 
video cameras were put in cockpits they captured pilots coming 
close to gloc 
susceptible pilots usually have many hours of flying time but 
relatively few hours in veryhigh performance aircraft they tend 
to be middleaged and have had little training on the centrifuge 
hill says 
these profiles very accurately describe our air force reserve 
and air national guard units that have converted to the f16 
hill says 
fatigue also is a big factor researchers say which could pose 
problems for a pilot flying multiple missions in wartime 
beginning in august the air force plans to train about 2500 
pilots per year fledglings and veterans on a new centrifuge at 
holloman air force base nm 
part of the training involves exercises that push the blood back 
up 
so does the gsuit a corsetlike garment inflated to keep blood 
from pooling in the legs soon to come is positivepressure 
breathing that forces air into the lungs and forces a pilot to 
exhale 
but even if a pilot does recover from gloc it can take up to 
two minutes to regain his bearings soking at 
ways to tell the airplanes computer that the pilot is unconscious 
so the plane can briefly fly itself to safety 
mcdonnell aircraft co says it is near a system that keys on a 
pilots breathing and voice patterns combined with a computer 
memory of recent sharp maneuvers in the plane to tell when a pilot 
is at gloc risk 
van pattens group is trying more complicated sensors possibly 
in helmets that would measure head slump eye blink blood 
pressure pulse in head arteries and even the grip on the stick 
those researchers want to use more extensive artificial 
intelligence including neural networks computers based on the 
architecture of the brain to make more accurate judgments 
a pilot might someday put a computer disc with his own 
characteristics on board to tell the computer how to program the 
system exactly for him van patten says 
to revive a pilot researchers are studying ways to pulsate the 
gsuit administering small amounts of carbon dioxide which dilates 
blood vessels and raises blood pressure 
perhaps even plain old smelling salts says van 
pattenthey have a long and honorable history 
but most of all a recent study shows pilots want a system that 
they wont have to attach each time they get into a cockpit and 
that they can override if it starts to malfunction 
van patten estimates a simple prototype system could be built 
for 500000 and could be ready to fly by 1993 with another 3 
million but in the current budget climate he says money is hard 
to come by

although its technically against the law 
physicians in the netherlands are tacitly allowed to practice 
active euthanasia putting an end to terminally ill patients lives 
with a lethal injection 
the practice there is believed to be more widespread than in any 
other country experts in the field say they know of no country 
where active euthanasia is legal 
but does the law wink at it yes it may in some cases says 
daniel callahan a noted author and expert on medical ethics who is 
the director of the hastings center a research institute in 
briarcliff manor ny 
dr pieter admiraal a dutch anesthesiologist at general 
hospital in delft and a supporter of euthanasia estimated in a 
telephone interview that there are about 5000 cases of euthanasia 
a year in a population of 15 million people only a handful of 
doctors have been prosecuted and officially only 140 cases were 
reported last year admiraal says 
most doctors fill in the form that it was a natural death 
he says admiraal says that in the last 10 years he has helped more 
than 100 patients to die he faced prosecution only once but the 
charges were dropped 
we are the first in the world to do this kind of experiment 
he says i think its done in a lot of countries always secret 
and illegal 
admiraal says doctors can be 95 percent sure the state wont 
bother them if they follow certain rules 
the patient must ask for euthanasia more than once he says 
the patient must be in a normal mental state and suffering 
unbearably it must be a disease which we cannot cure and the 
doctor has to have a second opinion 
we discuss the possibility of euthanasia for a week or so and 
we also have to believe it is the only way we have a whole team 
involved in the decision making we have to agree there is no other 
way to do it its not something to decide in an afternoon

editors note elliott abrams is a man not given to compromise 
or mincing his words that has made him a sizable band of political 
enemies especially in his handling of central american policy 
where the administrations efforts have not notably prospered 
undaunted the assistant secretary for interamerican affairs means 
to soldier on until the end of president reagans term 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
elliott abrams is ronald reagans point man in 
the one area where the presidents vaunted good luck seems to have 
deserted him 
on no issue have reagans policies come under more sustained 
assault than in central america abrams turf but abrams 
campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers 
cubanstyle communism there havent gotten very far 
in the process he has become a lightning rod for policy 
opponents wrath and he has often found himself the target of 
corrosive taunts on capitol hill and in the bureaucracy as well 
abrams assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of the 
hemisphere but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries 
panamas gen manuel antonio noriega and nicaraguas sandinista 
government seem to have misfired 
the policies abrams has pursued are no less controversial than 
his style although hes only 40 few have seen more intellectual 
combat than he has 
few neutrals emerge when abrams is the subject of conversation 
a sampling of opinions hes arrogant hes brilliant hes 
untrustworthy hes courageous hes unscrupulous hes principled 
i dont like the man says former ambassador frank mcneil 
using a stronger noun 
i wish him a long life says rep henry hyde rill 
abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing with 
people who disagree with him 
this is a political battlefield he says the opposition 
fights with every weapon available and we need to fight equally 
hard 
off duty the abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears 
as does the mantle of the noapologies crusader 
dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three small 
children on weekends he makes french toast from scratch late at 
night he can be found curled up with a novel but during working 
hours its the combat zone 
the combat zone was livelier than usual during the irancontra 
hearings last year it developed that abrams had earlier misled 
congressional committees about fund solicitations for the contras 
and us involvement in an illfated resupply flight for the 
nicaraguan rebels 
from the democratic camp came predictable cries for abrams 
resignation he didnt oblige 
some blame him for the administrations more recent policy 
setbacks accusing him of flawed tactics and an abrasive style that 
alienates potential allies his supporters fault congress as balky 
and shortsighted irresolute friends in latin america hostile 
media bureaucratic infighting and the intractable nature of the 
problems he inherited 
abrams is a neoconservative he worked for two democratic 
senators daniel patrick moynihan of new york and the late henry 
jackson of washington state and in the 1980 campaign for the 
election of ronald reagan he is a native of new york city and a 
product of harvard 
abrams wife rachel is the daughter of norman podhoretz 
editor of commentary magazine and midge decter a champion of 
conservative causes 
after defecting to the republican party he joined the 
administration in 1981 becoming at age 33 the youngest person 
ever with the rank of assistant secretary of state he has had that 
title as head of three bureaus international organizations human 
rights and since 1985 latin america 
american aid to the antisandinista cause has been an article of 
faith with abrams when congress last february rejected further 
military shipments to the contras abrams thought it would 
undermine them in negotiations with their foes perhaps fatally 
the next blow came in may with the collapse of abrams 
negotiating efforts to induce noriegas departure it was 
especially pams had seen there a chance to further 
democracy in the hemisphere while ridding panama of a leader who 
was under indictment in the united states on drugdealing charges

according to abrams script american diplomatic and economic 
pressure coupled with discontent among the panamanian people 
would be enough to topple noriega it didnt happen panama is left 
with a wounded economy and noriega firmly in charge 
abrams misread noriega very badly says mcneil former 
ambassador to costa rica and one of his more persistent critics 
abrams approach regarded panamanians as little brown brothers 
to be pushed around with a little muscleflexing he says 
incredible ineptitude 
abrams backers contend his hand was weakened by a campaign of 
leaks from the justice department and the pentagon to undercut his 
grand design mcneils suggestion that noriegas abdication could 
best be achieved by a latin american led negotiating team is 
dismissed as balderdash by hyde one of abrams staunchest 
supporters 
abrams assumed his duties three years ago determined to try to 
overcome what he saw as a decline in american political will and 
leverage in central america like reagan he was convinced that the 
nicaraguan government left unchecked would spread its revolution 
and ultimately present national security dangers to the united 
states 
in pursuing his objectives abrams was never tonguetied in 
responding to his critics one congressmans suggestion that the 
administration was unconcerned over the murder of four american 
churchwomen in el salvador he called not only false but i would 
say malicious and bordering on the vicious 
he upbraided another blame america blame america never 
blame the communists 
talking with a reporter in his sixthfloor state department 
office abrams insists that he doesnt seek confrontation for its 
own sake 
but he says i have never understood that my function here 
was to take the presidents views and water them down sufficiently 
so that theyd be more popular in congress 
hed be delighted to solicit bipartisanship he says but the 
democratic party leadership had decided before i got here 
that this was impossible on central america 
its not just the democrats though hes critical of colleagues 
in the administration who he claims fail to toe the line in 
support of reagans policies but tend to accommodate the 
presidents ideological opponents because they have a personal 
agenda stretching beyond the presidents tenure lucrative jobs in 
private business after their government service ends 
i dont think that is why tens of thousands of people worked 
their fingers to the bone getting ronald reagan elected so that 
guys like me could come to washington and meet lots of people and 
get a good law firm job he says 
were supposed to pursue policies and if there are people in 
the press or in congress or in socalled human rights groups who 
dont like it too bad 
the people who dont like abrams almost succeeded in dislodging 
him from his office 
they had a good shot in june 87 abrams says they almost 
got me theyve only had one shot since then in april when 
everybody was blaming me for panama 
june 87 refers to his testimony before the committees 
investigating the irancontra affair in october 1986 abrams had 
denied us government involvement in a contra resupply flight that 
was shot down over nicaragua leading to the capture of an american 
soldier of fortune 
abrams said later he had not been informed that the flight was 
part of the contra aid network created by lt col oliver north 
the former national security council aide 
in june 1987 he testified before the congressional committees 
investigating the irancontra affair and called his misstatements 
completely honest and completely wrong 
in november 1986 abrams told the senate intelligence committee 
that the united states had not asked third countries for money for 
the contras in fact as the june hearings brought out abrams 
himself solicited a 10 million contribution from brunei a tiny 
oilrich sultanate in southeast asia 
he apologized to the committee explaining that he had promised 
brunei confidentiality and he admitted his handling of the matter 
had been foolish 
one democratic representative who is unmollified is george 
crockett of detroit who heads the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on interamerican affairs he wont allow abrams to 
testify without swearing him in first so we can at least go 
through the motions of trying to believe what hes testifying to 
wayne smith a former head of the us diplomatic mission to 
cuba calls abrams a man willing to lie and misrepresent the 
facts about anything 
robert kagan a former deputy to abrams puts such attacks down 
to political differences the liberal 
intelligentsia hates elliott abrams because he ical and ideologis the most 
articulate spokesman for administration policy he says he is 
a person of unique personal strength and strength of conviction 
nevertheless there are some people at the white house too who 
would like to see him replaced abrams believes but enjoying the 
full support of reagan and secretary of state george p shultz he 
says hell stay on board until the presidents term is up 
im not going anywhere he says

representing both countries will make its debut in august with a 
monthlong concert swing across the united states and the soviet 
union 
its such a great opportunity to make music and travel in the 
united states and travel in russia says caroline coade 20 of 
san diego calif 
coade a student of the viola who graduated may 30 from oberlin 
college is one of 58 americans and 52 soviets ages 17 to 23 
selected for the orchestra twelve participants are from oberlin 
college 
the orchestra will assemble on oberlins campus on july 16 for 
rehearsals and workshops to acquaint them with each others social 
and cultural traditions 
the orchestras opening concert is scheduled for aug 5 at the 
kennedy center for the performing arts in washington zubin mehta 
music director of the new york philharmonic will conduct 
the orchestra grew out of a luncheon attended by oberlin 
president s frederick starr an expert on soviet affairs and 
officials of afs intercultural programs an international exchange 
group based in new york says grace kennan warnecke the 
orchestras executive director 
warnecke daughter of george f kennan former us ambassador 
to the soviet union initiated negotiations with the soviet 
ministry of culture last year she says the idea was greeted with 
far more enthusiasm on both sides than anticipated which is not 
to say it still isnt hard 
in the soviet union the orchestra will be sponsored by the 
ministry of culture and gosconsert 
warnecke says a joint orchestra would have been impossible 
before glasnost the new spirit of openness in the soviet union 
although separate tours have been permitted 
whats different about this is were creating a brand new 
institution and thats never happened before says warneke who 
lived in the soviet union periodically as a child and attended 
fifth grade in a soviet school while her father was ambassador 
she says the orchestra could be ongoing but efforts are 
concentrated on this years program 
if glasnost becomes a complete success increasing openness to 
the point that we dont need a sovietamerican orchestra 
well put ourselves out of business and thats all the better 
she says 
the american musicians represent 24 states and were chosen from 
some 500 who auditioned either in person or by tape they are to 
receive expenses and a small allowance from foundations who have 
agreed to finance the program according to warneke 
while touring the united states the musicians will stay in 
dormitories private homes or hotels 
the trip to the soviet union is an important element for claudia 
lasareffmironoff 23 who is studying for a masters degree in 
viola at northwestern university her parents left the soviet union 
as children and emigrated to the united states after world war ii 
i think its really important that we share musical ideas the 
russian school of string playing is such a famous school im 
really excited to be an american string player and to be getting to 
share in that says lasareffmironoff who speaks russian 
one of the musicians calvin lewis 18 of hephzibah ga who 
studies the violin at the cleveland institute of music says hes 
eager to hear the soviet musicians perform lewis says he doesnt 
know any russian but suspects the soviets will know some english 
music is a language in itself i dont think therell be a 
problem says lewis who will be making his first trip out of the 
country 
one of the youngest participants will be junko kaji 17 a 
junior at maumee valley country day school in toledo shes been 
playing the violin since the age of 3 and plays in a youth 
orchestra in toledo 
kaji says the tour in the soviet union is an opportunity to see 
whether her perceptions of that country are valid i thought i 
might want to see what the soviets are really like she says 
during the orchestras 2 weeks in oberlin they will rehearse 
with larry rachleff oberlin conductor and music director and 
leonid nikolaev for the moscow conservatory of music 
after the opening concert the musicians will perform in new 
york city on aug 7 milwaukee aug 9 san francisco aug 11 and 
trenton nj aug 14 the soviet tour will open and close with 
concerts in moscow with four concerts in two other cities in 
between 
the orchestras repertoire will include works by american and 
russian composers and the new york performance will include the 
world premiere of a symphonic piece by soviet composer edison 
denisov

editors note it started as a backyard picnic over the past 
42 years it has become a family tradition for a special american 
family the veterans of the famed world war ii jungle fighting unit 
known as merrills marauders as one says were more than 
friends 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they are old men now many in their 80s but they remain as 
fierce in their loyalty to one another and to an annual tradition 
as they were when they fought and suffered together and earned the 
nickname merrills marauders 
for the 42nd year in a row the graying marauders will assemble 
this time in charlotte nc on sept 24 to refight the old 
battles and talk about bullfight brandy a concoction of their own 
never approved by the medics and swap pictures of grandchildren 
im sure there will be a few who will attend for the first 
time along with those who show up every year says tom martini of 
charlotte this years reunion chairman 
the difficulty is in getting the word out with so many moving 
to new homes in retirement its hard to keep a current mailing 
list which was never complete to begin with 
after all these years some guys arrive and say i never knew 
about it before 
but they have never forgotten the marauders 
for six months in 1944 twice as long as the operation had been 
originally planned the marauders became the stuff of legend they 
fought in five major and 30 minor actions against veteran japanese 
troops behind enemy lines in northern burma when their final 
objective was taken their force of 3200 numbered fewer than 500 
who could be classified as effective fighting men 
yes says marauder phil piazza of seneca sc we were 
all volunteers and yes we have discussed at our reunions why we 
volunteered 
why did i i guess i was a little bit crazy i was single i 
was anxious to see some action dont forget world war ii was not 
like the vietnam war we had a clear purpose i wanted to be a part 
of it i think most of the others would tell you just about the 
same thing 
it was an experience none of us would want to relive but it 
had to be done and we would do it again if necessary 
they had all responded to a request for volunteers for a 
hazardous mission somewhere they were never told where and 
there is evidence supporting piazzas idea that they were men who 
actually liked combat 
in a book about the unit written in part from material gathered 
at a reunion marauder charlton ogburn of beaufort sc recalled 
the 1st battalion commander suggesting in a lull between battles 
that if nothing else was going to happen they might cross the ridge 
and start a fight with 2nd battalion 
of course he was joking writes ogburn but all the same 
the idea had occurred to him 
merrills marauders was the name given by a time magazine 
reporter to honor their commander brig gen frank merrill their 
official designation was 5307th composite unit provisional which 
led one marauder under fire to wonder what the hell had become of 
the other 5306 
they had come from army units in the south pacific puerto rico 
panama and the infantry school at fort benning ga their job was 
to cut japanese communications hit the enemy from the flank and 
rear and open the strategically important ledo road 
they fought in jungle never knowing what terror lay beyond the 
next bend in the trail and made famous such forgettable names as 
walawbum shaduzup nhpum ga inkangatawng and myitkyina but they 
never forgot 
they lost 93 killed 293 wounded and five times that many to 
disease in the end wrote the medical historian of the 
chinaburmaindia theater amoebas bacteria rickettsiae and 
viruses rather than japanese soldiers and guns vanquished the 
most aggressive bravest and toughest outfit that fought in the far 
east in the second world war 
in the end merrills marauders won a presidential unit 
citation six distinguished service crosses four legions of merit 
44 silver stars and a bronze star for every man in the regiment 
their shoulder patch lives on as the symbol for the 1st battalion 
of the 75th infantry ranger regiment 
a few years ago a marauder spotted a decal of the patch on the 
window of a car ahead chased the car for miles along the 
pennsylvania turnpike caught up motioned for the driver to pull 
over and learned about the reunion 
phil piazza was the one who started the reunion he was 
commander of a heavy weapons company of blue combat team of 2nd 
battalion 
we had three battalions each with two combat teams 
naturally nobody in the unit could know all the 3000 men in the 
regiment but i knew my company and my battalion i lived in 
bridgeport conn then and after the war a few of us in the area 
would get together from time to time and finally i said to them 
why not make it an annual affair 
we were all back working at new jobs and none of us had any 
vacation time accumulated so we picked labor day weekend we held 
the first reunion in my back yard we worked from a list of 
whoknowswherewhois and about 75 guys showed up 
well labor day weekend became the traditional time to hold 
it which makes it difficult for some who have other family plans 
but in recent years we have always had 300 to 400 on hand that 
includes wives and children and now grandchildren 
over the years the generations the reunion has grown from a 
gathering of warriors to a fellowship of families some save up all 
year for the annual blast 
weve had some wonderful trips says jean martini whose 
courtship with tom included frequent letters to him in burma 
weve been to phoenix chicago savannah charleston st louis 
new york boston orlando and i cant remember where all last year 
we went to new orleans 
romance has blossomed the widow of a marauder married a 
marauder widower the son of a marauder married the daughter of 
another 
we are closer than friends jean says we are family its 
a family reunion

tv audiences will soon get their first real 
chance to hear pianist vladimir feltsman who emigrated to america 
last summer after much publicized difficulties in getting out of 
russia on wednesday july 13 he will perform in a live from 
lincoln center telecast on pbs 
this will be my first purely musical tv event says the 
36yearold feltsman playing in the white house sept 27 and 
my debut at carnegie hall nov 11 were shown on the news a 
little i was on the 60 minutes show it was more talking than 
music 
the mostly mozart festival now in its 22nd year at avery fisher 
hall will open with feltsman on tuesday july 12 the program will 
be repeated on wednesday night and televised live 
mostly mozart is one of the leading music festivals in the 
world i am very pleased i have been invited says feltsman i 
will play mozarts piano concerto in b flat major the last by 
mozart he was composing it at the same time he was composing the 
magic flute it is an absolute masterpiece 
then frederica von stade will sing something and then we will 
do an aria by mozart together so i think it will be fun 
since arriving in america feltsman has played 60 performances 
this season has been very special for me he says because i 
am doing everything for the first time the first time in 
philadelphia israel new york chicago los angeles 
feltsman was considered one of the soviet unions best young 
pianists when he applied in april 1979 for an emigration visa 
that year he says 52000 soviet jews emigrated but his 
application was denied two hours after he applied moscow radio 
and tv stations were ordered not to play his records all his 
concerts were canceled for two years then for the next six years 
feltsman was allowed to give a few concerts one such in a factory 
where machinery all but drowned out his music 
on june 14 1982 feltsman supporters who knew him through 
recordings and european concerts scheduled his new york debut 
to publicize his plight misha dichter played that evening 
five years later feltsmans emigration was approved alice 
chandler president of the state university of new york in new 
paltz who had looked up feltsman when she visited russia 
telephoned to offer him a job feltsman his wife anna and son 
daniel arrived in new york last august 
their 5yearold son is settled into nursery school and already 
finds it easier to speak english than russian as for his and his 
wifes adjustment feltsman says we came here more or less well 
prepared we were not looking for some miracles we understand that 
it is a beautiful country with many problems which we all know 
paradise does not exist in the world as we also know for 
people of my occupation my mentality my psychology my ability 
im certain it is still the best place in the world 
feltsmans debut with symphony orchestra was in february with 
zubin mehta and the new york philharmonic from then till this 
fall im playing 10 different concertos and three different recital 
programs its a little bit tough 
in may feltsman played a piano sonata by alfred schnittke the 
soviet composer and his wife were allowed to travel to new york for 
the occasion this single fact assured me about glasnost much 
more than speeches made by soviet officials he says a few 
years ago such a visit of a leading soviet composer and playing by 
a jewish immigrant was unimaginable now it is real i hope such a 
normal attitude will go forward 
in addition to his concerts feltsman is cutting records and 
talking about a special school for budding american pianists he 
has made two recordings already and soon will make two more 
i think recording is one of the most important parts of the 
life of a musician he says the performing artist plays and 
it is disappearing in air now im already thinking not about 
success but about leaving some legacy 
part of that legacy too could be a special program for 
promising young american pianists of those hes worked with he 
says their main trouble even for the best i heard is their 
training at a very early age if you miss something at 6 7 8 or 
9 technically physically psychologically you will never get it 
back later 
feltsman has talked with some wealthy people about endowing a 
school free but available only to the most gifted 
with such things as music if you want to get good results you 
have to be very tough at the beginning he says and the 
principle has to be talent not ability to pay you cannot buy a 
musical gift with money 
asked whether hell be nervous about the mostly mozart opening 
and televised concert feltsman says i am very nervous always 
probably thats the way you have to pay for the joy to play 
the music

at dinner two years ago a friend told david 
henry hwang a bizarre tale that had made headlines in europe but 
received little attention in the united states 
a french diplomat falls in love with a chinese actress in 
beijing they carry on an affair for 20 years he later is arrested 
in france on espionage charges at the trial it is revealed that 
the actress is a man who was coerced into the liaison by the 
chinese government the diplomat claims he didnt know she was a he 
the story had a kind of resonance that appealed to me hwang 
says of what turned into m butterfly winner of the 1988 tony 
award as best play of the season so i initially thought of doing 
it as a musical 
hwang approached producer stuart ostrow who once had brought 
hwang composer philip glass and designer eiko ishioka together for 
a musical project that didnt pan out 
hwang thought about the story for two months and decided to 
dovetail the spy drama with the plot of puccinis madama 
butterfly he sent a twopage outline to ostrow it contained the 
axis of the plot particularly the idea of the french man thinking 
of himself as pinkerton and the actress as butterfly 
the outline became a play written in about six weeks rather 
than a musical because hwang didnt want to go through the lengthy 
process of finding a composer and lyricist 
i did no research on the story itself because the fact that 
the incident existed was enough for me he says i wanted to 
interpret it in my own way instead i did a lot of research on the 
period what type of secrets could have been passed in the early 
60s the origins of the vietnam war and what was going on in 
china 
before the end of 1986 ostrow optioned the play for production 
john dexter director of equus came aboard in 1987 and a year 
was spent casting and raising the 12 million needed to bring the 
play to new york when it opened in march 1988 at the eugene 
oneill theater john lithgow was starred as the hapless diplomat 
and bd wong played the exotic chinese opera singer 
broadway always was the goal hwang says i thought this 
was a play that had some commercial potential but it had never 
occurred to me growing up and working in the nonprofit theater 
that you could initiate a production on broadway 
m butterfly is the first broadway play for the 30yearold 
hwang even though he has had extensive credits offbroadway he 
made his mark there in the early 1980s with plays about 
chineseamericans such as fob the dance and the railroad 
and family devotions 
hwang was raised as a musician not a writer his first theater 
experiences were playing violin in the pit orchestra for amateur 
musicals but at age 12 he wrote a detailed family history 
divided into three generations 
my mothers family were wealthy chinese merchants who went to 
the philippines in the 19th century hwang says my fathers 
family came from shanghai where my paternal grandfather was a 
businessman 
hwangs parents arrived in the united states to go to school 
his father to study business at the university of southern 
california his mother to study piano they met at a foreign 
students dance at usc 
hwang was born in los angeles and grew up in a comfortable 
california suburb he has two younger sisters one a cellist and 
the other an elementary school teacher 
hwangs father wanted him to study business in college but he 
ended up at stanford which didnt have an undergraduate business 
program so he majored in english literature 
i started writing plays in college hwang saysi liked the 
idea of creating a world which then would exist in front of you 
in 1978 he studied writing with sam shepard and maria irene 
fornes at the fledgling padua hills playwrights festival in 
claremont calif 
it was a real mind opener for me hwang says they helped 
me get in touch with my subconscious in terms of using the 
subconscious to influence your work and give your characters life 
out of the festival came fob the story of a young chinese 
man fresh off the boat coming to united states to live with 
his chineseamerican relatives the play was first performed at his 
stanford dormitory and during his senior year it was accepted by 
the national playwrights conference in connecticut from there in 
the summer of 1979 fob was picked up by the new york 
shakespeare festival for production in new york in 1980 
after that i kind of had a career hwang says ive 
always been able to make a living as a writer its been a 
combination of the play writing some film and television writing 
and grants 
now hes cautiously enjoying his fame as a tony awardwinning 
playwright 
i had a vaccination against this at a younger age hwang 
says when i was in my early 20s i had a certain amount of work 
done not at this level but i got a certain amount of attention 
and dealt with these things at a smaller level i like to think 
that im more prepared 
since the opening of m butterfly hwang has turned his 
attention to a new musictheater monologue he is creating with 
glass and designer jerome sirlin its called 1000 airplanes on 
the roof and concerns the unlikely subject of ufo abductions the 
piece starring actor rocco sisto premieres in vienna this month 
and comes to the united states in september 
hwang who lives in los angeles with his wife ophelia would 
like to get back to writing his next play one already has been 
commissioned by the south coast repertory of costa mesa calif 
which received a tony this year as outstanding regional theater 
when im working on a play the play determines the hours 
he says i can write continuously consequently i can finish my 
plays fairly quickly usually between three and six weeks 
hwang feels he gradually has been able to get attention as a 
playwright not a chineseamerican playwright 
i feel less like a spokesman for asianamerican playwrights 
than i did the last time around says hwang referring to the 
days when fob and the dance and the railroad first 
attracted attention those early plays were specifically 
chineseamerican 
today i am less inclined to accept the role of spokesman for 
the asianamerican community once i felt dutybound to fulfill 
it now i feel its not really possible for me to be any kind of 
spokesman for any view other than my own

editors note you can put kids in the classrooms but you 
cant make them learn you have to make them want to learn and 
that says teachers union leader albert shanker will require major 
innovations in the nations school systems 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
washington its the old dog food story that albert shanker 
draws on once again to deliver his indictment of american schools 
to students at the harvard graduate school of education 
despite the best ingredients pretty packaging and an aggressive 
ad campaign brand x dog food just isnt selling the dogs just 
dont like it a nervous corporate underling tells his boss 
and that is what is wrong with american education shanker tells 
these future school administrators and phds 
the lesson is right the books are right but in the end 
if the dogs dont eat it it doesnt make any difference whats 
good about the dog food says the president of the american 
federation of teachers 
shanker who went to jail twice in new york in the 1960s for 
leading his teachers on illegal strikes today is one of the 
severest critics of public schools and the leading advocate for 
radical changes in the way they are run 
in his lectures at harvard in interviews and in the speeches he 
makes while traveling a halfmillion miles each year shanker 
argues that american schools are failing 80 percent of the students 
who pass through their doors 
what you have in schools today is very similar to what you had 
in the field of medicine for a couple of thousand years shanker 
says people would go to doctors hoping to get cured but they 
actually got hurt doctors didnt realize that they were supposed 
to sterilize their instruments or wash their hands 
his solution 
make school teaching more like medicine let teachers work in 
teams under lead teachers who would diagnose problems and 
prescribe treatment for the classroom teachers to apply 
they would also command salaries sharply higher than the 28085 
the aft says the average american schoolteacher made last year but 
fewer would make it to the top 
i know that sounds bad shanker tells his harvard pupils 
but remember as you get fewer teachers if you do it right 
theyre all of higher quality 
shanker takes no comfort from polls that show parents giving 
local public schools good marks and rating their own childs school 
even better 
in a way the satisfaction of parents is due to pretty 
effective public relations says shanker citing a recent study 
that found nearly every state claiming its children are above 
average on tests a statistical impossibility 
but what does average mean asks shanker who says a more 
reliable measure is the national assessment of educational 
progress which has found that most 17yearolds cannot handle 
junior high school math concepts read complex materials or 
decipher a bus schedule 
how many people in this country know that only 15 percent of 
the 17yearolds can write a halfway decent letter with a lot of 
misspellings and grammatical errors he asks harvard students 
maybe weve got to generate a lot of unhappiness 
there is compelling evidence that the current structure of 
schools actually harms large numbers of students and prevents large 
numbers of students from learning 
we need to rethink everything that now goes on rethink the 
passive nature of kids rethink asking kids questions in front of 
other kids rethink when we let kids into school rethink whether 
you move them around every 40 or 45 minutes 
shanker proposes letting any group of six to 12 teachers form an 
autonomous school within a school with a prorated share of the 
budget to experiment with different ways of teaching it would 
have the blessings of the principal school board and local union 
and participation by teachers and students would be voluntary 
once given a green light each experimental school would be 
given free rein for five to 10 years to demonstrate whether it had 
indeed come up with better formulas for learning 
what we need are experiments shanker says see if you can 
model a school on a law firm see if you can model it on group 
medical practice see if you can model it on the university see if 
you can look at what hewlettpackard does and procter amp gamble 
shanker envisions schools where the lecturing would be done by 
videotape and where students could work in teams progressing at 
their own pace and learning in their own style 
although there might be fewer certified teachers there would be 
more adults in the classroom through wider use of aides interns 
and volunteers 
shanker says it isnt practical to hope that all teachers 
salaries could be raised to the point where education would attract 
people of the caliber of law medicine and the other professions 
it would cost nearly 30 billion to raise every teachers salary 
by 10000 and that is not likely to happen says shanker 
even if it did happen he says we would still have a very 
tough time getting additional teachers of much greater quality 
because ibm isnt going to go out of business theyll just raise 
salaries a little bit more 
shanker says his aft locals will keep pressing at the bargaining 
table for better salaries smaller classes and better working 
conditions but real improvements in the teachers lot will never 
materialize as long as schools are run the way they are now

shanker was jailed twice in new york city in the 1960s for 
leading teachers to illegal strikes his image was such that woody 
allen lampooned him in the movie sleeper as the guy who 
precipitated nuclear war 
that image gave way as shanker began rubbing elbows with 
governors and corporate chieftains got a seat on the trilateral 
commission a highpowered foreign policy group and launched a 
weekly where we stand column that appears as a paid 
advertisement in the sunday new york times he is also a vice 
president of the aflcio 
shanker president of the 665000member aft since 1974 has 
long championed tough school standards and was an early advocate of 
rigorous tests for incoming teachers he had a pivotal role in the 
creation of a voluntary national board for professional teaching 
standards 
his adversaries scoff at the image of the new shanker and even 
some of his allies think he has too little faith in the efficacy of 
traditional instruction 
secretary of education william j bennett a persistent critic 
of mediocre school performance says shanker has failed to 
recognize the power of a great teacher 
myron lieberman an education professor who championed 
collective bargaining for teachers in the 1950s and is now an 
unsparing critic of unions calls shanker the most skillful 
manipulator in the field of education 
lieberman who teaches at the university of pennsylvania says 
the image of him as some kind of courageous statesman doesnt 
square with my experience and my perception what al says is not 
binding on any local organization the aft contract in chicago 
is a complete disaster from any public or parent point of view 
bennett has called chicagos schools the nations worst and laid 
much of the blame at the door of the chicago teachers union local 
1 of the aft which has struck nine times in the past 19 years 
they have bludgeoned that school system the union has taken 
what it could get and has not served the teachers says bennett 
bennett says the aft has been a bit more innovative not so 
hidebound as the national education association in places such as 
rochester ny dade county fla and hammond ind where 
shankers locals have accepted stricter accountability in exchange 
for more say in running schools 
but bennett says the experience in chicago shows the aft can 
be as intransigent and mindless as the nea 
shanker says of the situation in chicago theyre in the 
middle of a war 
i dont feel any need to call jackie vaughan and say make 
nice and talk differently because she doesnt have anybody to 
deal with on the other side says shanker referring to the ctus 
president i think if there were some opening to really be able 
to do something there she would be very cooperative 
bill honig californias superintendent of public instruction 
and an ally of shankers on curricular reform says while i 
agree with al were nowhere near where we have to be i think 
school is getting a lot better for a large number of kids not just 
20 percent 
when storm clouds gathered over american schools in 1983 with 
the release of the explosive a nation at risk report shanker 
quickly signaled that his union was willing to consider any and all 
reforms 
he was rewarded with invitations to the white house and 
president reagan addressed the aft convention that summer using 
the occasion to blast the nea for opposing merit pay and for 
sponsoring a dovish course guide to nuclear arms 
but shanker was never enamored of reagans education policies 
and his relations with bennett have turned frosty of late 
after attending a white house ceremony last april marking the 
fifth anniversary of a nation at risk shanker sent an open 
letter to bennett accusing him of a major failure of leadership 
mary hatwood futrell president of the 19 millionmember nea 
remarks it took him 3 years to realize mr bennett was not an 
advocate for education 
she charges that shanker grabbed headlines with controversial 
stands on merit pay and by favoring choice in public education and 
then backed away from them 
shanker says part of the problem with american schools is that 
too many parents and teachers are comfortable with the status quo

editors note they arrived in the 1930s to help modernize 
farming particularly cotton farming they stayed and flourished 
when they found it easier to be black in the soviet union than in 
their native american south 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at night when they were finished 
working they sang the blues and their voices carried over the 
sunparched cotton fields of soviet central asia 
their homes mississippi virginia harlem were half a world 
away 
they had come to the soviet union in the 1920s and 1930s to 
build a better world to earn a living during the depression and 
to flee the bigotry they had known at home because their skin was 
black 
in the 20s and 30s americans by the tens of thousands flocked 
to the soviet union to work driven by revolutionary fervor or 
joblessness at home they felled trees in karelia built blast 
furnaces in magnitogorsk and founded an industrial colony at 
kuzbass in siberia 
but none of their stories is more poignant than that of the 
group of american blacks led by communist party member oliver 
golden who arrived in tashkent on the mournful steppes of 
uzbekistan in 1932 after a fiveday train trip from moscow 
he had seen the terrible conditions of the country and its 
ruined economy says goldens daughter lily 53 a historian who 
now lives in moscow his idea was that not just white americans 
but blacks as well must help the soviet union 
golden and his colleagues all agricultural experts had signed 
a twoyear contract with the sovietamerican trade organization 
amtorg to help modernize cotton growing and farming in one of the 
countrys most backward regions 
for their talents they would earn about 100 a month 
the members of the group did not belong to any political 
party the group was made up of young black specialists with 
different ideas about life george w tynes recalled in the 
memoirs he wrote before his death in 1982 
for tynes the youngest of 10 children of a roanoke va 
preacher the opportunity was a dream come true 
the idea of going to a country where no racism existed and 
where i would be given an equal chance to work according to my 
ability was just what i had dreamed about all of my life 
recalled tynes a 1931 agriculture graduate of wilberforce 
university in ohio where he was a black allamerica halfback 
he eventually chose to spend the rest of his life in the soviet 
union 
golden too decided to make the soviet union his home he is 
still remembered in uzbekistan as a blackskinned giant 
golden son of a former slave from clarksdale miss began work 
on a cotton farm at age 10 and served with the us army in france 
during world war i but after studying agriculture at tuskegee 
institute in alabama and alcorn state in mississippi golden 
couldnt find work in that field he became a dining car waiter 
instead and was outraged at how black workers were treated he 
joined the american communist party in 1925 
golden went to moscow for a brief period to learn the trade of 
party militant in 1931 he contacted black agricultural 
specialists asking them to return with him to the soviet union 
the 16member party arrived by ship in leningrad on a frigid day 
in november 1931 after an atlantic crossing aboard a german liner 
for tynes who had been teaching in maryland with a certificate 
that restricted him to colored schools the egalitarianism of 
soviet russia was a striking contrast to his native south and its 
segregation laws 
here tynes recalled there was no for black or for white 
signs here was a people working together black and white to 
build a better life for everyone with no bar because of color

at tashkent the group split up tynes was sent to a railroad 
whistle stop south of the city named yangiyul where he helped 
soviets build their own farm machinery by studying foreignmade 
farm implements he also tried his hand at poultry breeding 
golden and his wife bertha byalek a polishborn new yorker who 
was the only white in the group went to the central cotton 
selection station to try to produce a new hybrid suited to 
uzbekistans broiling summers 
the group members worked from dawn to dusk the newspaper 
tashkent pravda wrote decades later under mulberry trees by the 
canals at night they sang the negro blues 
their research work was instrumental in blending features from 
native american and egyptian cotton plants to obtain a boll that 
opened at the right time before harvest uzbekistan historian 
valery germanov said in a interview 
black poet langston hughes who visited tashkent in 1933 wrote 
of spending christmas that year inside goldens neat 
whitepainted cottage 
we even had a pumpkin pie for dessert and the tables were 
loaded down with all the americanstyle dishes that those clever 
negro wives could concoct away over there in uzbekistan hughes 
recalled they were delightful hosts these cottoncollective 
negroes from america in the middle of a mudcake oasis frosted with 
snow 
at the end of their contract most group members went back to 
america others stayed including tynes golden and joseph sutton 
a microbiologist and a former professor under george washington 
carver at tuskegee institute 
for golden the birth of his daughter lily in july 1934 
convinced him not to return to his native america 
he couldnt imagine having a white wife and a black daughter 
in the us at that time lily golden says speaking in heavily 
russianaccented english he remembered how hard it was for him 
and my mother a black man and a white woman when they lived in 
harlem 
golden went to work as a researcher at tashkents irrigation 
institute the man from mississippi who became a soviet citizen in 
1935 was so popular that he was elected to the city council 
in 1940 golden died at age 48 he had a heart ailment and 
kidney injuries reportedly inflicted when policemen beat him during 
a communist party demonstration in new york in the 1920s 
he was buried under a lilac bush at a cemetery on a dusty road 
on the fringes of tashkent the granite slab that marks his grave 
was rediscovered last year by a tashkent schoolteacher interested 
in the role of american blacks in uzbekistans past 
goldens wife who also had become a soviet citizen died in 
moscow at age 80 
lily golden became the tennis champion of soviet central asia 
before moving to moscow where she studied african history and 
music she became a researcher and historian in both fields and 
made her first trip to the united states last year 
she said only one member of her fathers group is still alive 
a man she knows only as rowan who lives in washington dc 
george tynes who also became a soviet citizen became a 
recognized expert in raising chickens ducks and turkeys he 
married a soviet woman maria in 1937 their three children are 
soviet citizens 
slava tynes 48 a former journalist with the government news 
agency novosti says he has no bonds with his fathers american 
past 
i grew up and have lived all my life with russians in our 
home only russian was spoken the balding bearded man said in 
an interview 
but he kept a copy of his fathers memoirs 
george tynes wrote of the economic opportunities he had in the 
soviet union in contrast to the prejudice and bigotry he found in 
the american south 
i often wondered how could it be that i was born in the 
usa worked and studied in the usa graduated from college in 
the usa became an allamerica football player in the usa 
and now just because of my color i would be denied equal rights in 
the usa the country where my father and mother were born lived 
and worked all of their lives

editors note she had alzheimers disease and to her husband 
seemed to be suffering so much that he shot her to death at her 
nursing home it was a tragedy that some saw as a mercy killing 
others as murder the case points up some of the ambiguities in the 
concept of euthanasia last of three articles

oscar carlson loaded the old revolver 
that he had used to shoot hogs and headed from his farm home to the 
crestview manor nursing home as he drove the two miles into town 
he recalled i prayed the lord to help me that whatever was laid 
upon me to do i would be able to accomplish 
what was propelling carlson to the nursing home this february 
day was the news that his wife of 47 years agnes her mind already 
fogged by alzheimers disease had broken her hip and would need 
surgery to replace it feeling guilty for having put her in the 
nursing home he had taken her out often for rides in the country 
on the day before feb 28 a sunday while they were at the farm 
home she had fallen on the porch 
i could take no more so i think my mind cracked carlson 
says the next thing he remembered he was in room 103 standing 
beside his wifes bed 
do you want to go to the hospital he asked her no she 
said then using a term he said she understood because he had used 
it in his job of butchering hogs he asked her do you want me to 
give you a shot so you dont have to she looked at him as 
he stood there with the gun in his hand yes she replied 
according to his court testimony 
just then judy berg a nurse walked into the room with a 
gurney to take her to the hospital he had the gun to her 
chest she said as i looked at him i said my god hes 
going to shoot her oscar looked up at me at the same time and 
pulled the trigger 
i fired twice in her chest and then i sat down and watched her 
die so nice and peaceful carlson said afterward when 
she opened her mouth a little bit he fired twice more i 
didnt want the doctors to get hold of her and start pumping out 
blood and putting on respiration and all that stuff and tubes and i 
could see no sense to that 
those shots reverberated throughout this farming community of 
571 people where the crop feed service center and the railroad 
tracks running through the center of town give it an identity of 
midwestern security and serenity where no one could ever imagine 
that oscar carlson who in all of his 78 years had never had so 
much as a parking ticket would do such a thing 
not the oscar carlson who had grown up in douglas county who 
had to trudge through the snowdrifts for miles to get to school and 
missed so many classes because of the weather that he finished only 
eighth grade who at age 16 began hiring out to farmers milking 
cows cleaning barns and shucking grain 
the killing unleashed a flood of emotions anger and anxiety 
fear and frustration guilt and grief 
in a broader sense carlsons deed raised once more that tangled 
question of anyones right to end anothers life in a mercy killing 
especially under slightly ambiguous circumstances which in some 
peoples minds clouded the issue here 
not oscar carlson nor anyone else the town said he pleaded 
guilty to seconddegree murder in a plea bargain and was sentenced 
may 26 to 43 months in prison with good behavior he will be 
eligible for parole in 28 months 
at the nursing home and in the town carlson brewed anger and 
fear among his three daughters he spawned guilt grief and 
frustration

we have residents still afraid he might come barbara 
walters director of nursing at crestview manor said in a recent 
interview while carlson was free on bail to go wherever he wanted 
except to the nursing home and to friends homes where he once had 
been invited but was now unwelcome 
i went through every stage of grieving and i still feel very 
angry said walters looking out over the lounge area where 
pitiful residents sat one a 102yearold woman her head buried in 
her hands two other residents in the room with agnes when she was 
shot also suffer from alzheimers other residents followed the 
tragedy on the television set in the lounge and in the newspapers 
the staff is still angry says mrs walters i think we 
feel kind of violated how would you feel if someone came into your 
home and shot somebody its a small facility 70 beds we pretty 
much feel like all family 
jennie harjes assistant director of nursing remembered that 
two days before agnes was shot she recognized a visitor and called 
her by name thats the way alzheimers is she says 
both staff and residents of the nursing home have suffered 
nightmares 
i dream that im here at work and that im trying to do my job 
and i see oscar says harjes hes interfering with my being 
able to do my job it has interfered in all our lives made it 
uneasy for all of us hes just there his presence is there 
when it first happened says judy berg id wake up in the 
middle of the night when i tried to go back to sleep id see it 
to me it wasnt a mercy killing the woman was in no pain 
except shed broken her hip she wasnt the one suffering it was 
oscar watching her state of alzheimers 
says bonnie champeau director of crestview manor a murder 
was committed here mercy killing or euthanasia is basically done 
to relieve pain its usually not done to relieve the mental pain 
of family members its usually not done with four shots from a gun 
for other people to witness and live with 
many of the elderly people particularly women feared carlson 
while he was free awaiting sentencing friends who know him well 
welcomed him even though they were angry with him at first his 
family felt he needed daily supervision eight nursing homes turned 
him away because they feared he would upset other residents his 
attorney thomas j reif finally found one willing to accept him 
in the interim 
the issue says ann l carrott the douglas county prosecutor 
is whether carlson had the right to decide whether his wife 
couldnt take it anymore she says she had to treat the shooting as 
a murder and that she is opposed to lessening the degree of guilt 
in mercy killings 
where do you draw the line she asks what type of illness 
would warrant that kind of a defense is it going to be based on 
illness or age or disability i dont know that society wants to 
start drawing those kinds of lines

agnes carlson was 72 years old her mental condition had 
worsened to the point where her mind often was fixed in the 40s 
when oscar came home from world war ii she thought he was her 
father and began calling him grandpa agnes family name also was 
carlson and her fathers first name was alven 
she would make up an extra bed in the evening like on the 
sofa either she should sleep there or i should sleep there says 
carlson that often happened if she would lie down there i 
said you better come to me and we would lie down and say our 
prayers and then id say you can go back if you want to but 
she never did 
she hid his mail those letters that had money and the checks 
like social security they were to oscar carlson and i was supposed 
to be alven carlson so i wasnt supposed to have anything to do 
with them 
she longed to visit apple orchards that had vanished with her 
memory says carlson a lot of times in the evenings she would 
say why dont we take a drive down to my folks place and i 
would tell her that theres no place there anymore the house was 
burned down and they plowed down the apple orchard so there was 
nothing to go for but i would usually take her down there 
she sometimes didnt bathe for weeks she was kind of shy so 
she done the best she could on that herself 
sometimes oscar helped her wash her hair i always set her 
hair every week 
this wasnt the agnes that oscar and their three daughters 
remembered oscar met agnes in april 1940 when agnes 
brotherinlaw a customer of a butcher shop in miltona where oscar 
worked asked him to give her a ride to evansville one sunday 
oscar told his brother thats one girl i got to take out again 
he made a date with her for the following wednesday night six 
months later they were married on the farm where he was born he 
and agnes ran a meat market until 1942 when he went into the army 
after his discharge in 1945 they started farming 80 acres they had 
bought before he went into the service 
when his three daughters finally persuaded him she should be 
placed in a nursing home in june 1987 things got worse for him 
instead of better filled with guilt and depression he no longer 
felt like pulling the weeds in the garden as he put it 
reif his attorney says he intentionally avoided referring to 
the shooting as a mercy killing 
we do not think what oscar did was premeditated thought out 
or planned in the type of detail that a mercy killer would normally 
do he says 
but according to bruce montplaisir carlsons soninlaw oscar 
had told people agnes would be better off dead 
the morning when we put her in the nursing home montplaisir 
recalled hed said im a hundred percent for that you know 
im the kind of guy that could shoot his own dog i think he felt 
that he was almost to the point that his only relief would be to 
get her into the nursing home before something like that would 
happen 
shortly before agnes was shot nursing home officials expressed 
concern to one of his daughters mary beth montplaisir telling her 
that carlson had said maybe if you dont feed her so much she 
wouldnt live so long 
mary beth says that about two weeks before the shooting she had 
talked to nursing home officials about removing two guns from her 
fathers home but before the three daughters could meet with a 
social worker to discuss it their mother was dead 
i feel kind of an anger at the whole system says the 
daughter a grade school remedial reading and math teacher i 
feel more frustration because i wanted to keep something like this 
from happening and i was not able to do it i guess i dont 
really feel so angry at my father as i feel sorry for him i just 
dont think it should have happened 
they buried agnes on march 3 millie penuel the youngest 
daughter has said 
it was probably a couple of years ago that i really 
acknowledged that my mother was not my mother anymore it felt like 
she had died and we were left with this little lady who looked like 
her so yes it had felt like we maybe lost her earlier but we 
were not able to have a funeral then

editors note it started more than 300 years ago with two 
modest progenitors one french one english this first pair of

60000 that floods scholars and scientists today much of this 
outpouring goes unread but it gets people published

pity the heart specialist who wants to keep up 
he could read cardiology the american journal of cardiology and 
the american college of cardiology journal the american heart 
journal and the british heart journal arteriosclerosis and 
atherosclerosis 
and more much more 
cardiologists are not alone in this physicists entomologists 
anthropologists sociologists and everyone else who makes a living 
in science and medicine are deluged with magazines full of 
information they need to know but dont have time to read 
too many people are publishing too many papers in too much of 
a hurry contends dr thomas p stossel former editor of the 
journal of clinical investigation 
not everyone agrees that the huge volume of the literature 
as its called is necessarily a bad thing but fretting about it 
is probably as old as the ritual of publishing scientific reports 
in periodicals 
this complaint cant keep up cant keep up people have 
been saying that forever says dr henry small director of 
corporate research at the institute for scientific information 
this is the normal griping of anybody whos literate who can 
read all the new novels who can read all the newspapers 
it all began in 1665 in january of that year le journal des 
savants came out in paris followed in march by the philosophical 
transactions of the royal society in london 
the goal was to give learned men a convenient way to keep up 
with the scholarly observations of their fellows the idea caught 
on at the start of the 18th century there were about 100 
journals by the beginning of the 20th there were 10000 
not only can nobody read all the journals nobody can say with 
certainty how many there are 
ulrichs international periodicals directory lists about 31000 
scientific medical and technical publications but doesnt claim to 
know about all of them dr belver griffith professor of 
information studies at drexel university guesses the worldwide 
total is somewhere between 40000 and 60000 and is growing at a 
rate of 4 percent or 5 percent a year 
a browse through any science library shows just how diverse this 
enterprise is 
a few journals have broad tastes nature and science as their 
names suggest will publish articles about almost anything in 
science but most are satisfied with narrower horizons there is 
for instance experimental and applied acarology about ticks and 
mites the journal of applied ichthyology fish and the clubroot 
news letter plant disease 
some journals get to the point quickly in their titles yeast 
blood gut trees and starch leave little doubt about their 
specialties the international journal of aerial and space imaging 
remote sensing and integrated geographical systems and the 
international multidisciplinary journal devoted to swallowing and 
its disorders are a bit less terse 
some are downright obscure try to guess what ktheory is about 
mathematics or stochastic hydrology and hydraulics random 
models in water resources or the journal of paleolimnology 
prehistoric waters or genomics gene mapping 
many journals seem to overlap in the area of drugs that affect 
the brain there is psycholopharmacology the journal of 
psychopharmacology and the journal of the british association of 
psychopharmacology not to mention neuropsychopharmacology 
they also spawn quickly the young field of teaching computers 
to think has artificial intelligence for engineering design 
artificial intelligence review and ai amp society among others 
reading these magazines is often heavy going even for people 
who are conversant with say the nuances of applied acarology 
most sag with dry formal writeups of scientific experiments and 
observations even the most prestigious are boobytrapped with 
jargon that reduces simple ideas to properly academic tangles of 
verbiage 
so does anyone read this stuff 
the actual readership of fundamental scholarly journals 
appears to be quite low says griffith the bestread articles 
in a standard disciplinary based journal will be read at most by 
2 percent of the people who receive it we found that there were 
almost no readers

professional journals such as those that go to doctors and 
engineers may be more widely read but how many journals about 
cardiovascular diseases ulrichs lists about 135 of them should 
a heart specialist be expected to plow through 
dr arnold relman editor of the new england journal of 
medicine estimates that five or six properly chosen is all the 
average specialist needs to keep up with 
however stossel says there are probably plenty of doctors who 
read nothing but the throwaways a disparaging term for the stacks 
of relatively readable newspapers and magazines filled with drug 
ads that arrive free in the mail each day 
with all of this information much of it trifling its no 
surprise that some magazines do nothing but tell people whats in 
other magazines newsletters are devoted to terse condensations of 
the high points of the literature among these is the eightpage 
journal watch published every other week by the massachusetts 
medical society 
we try to point out what doctors should know about and let 
them know where they can find the article if they need it says 
joe elia its executive editor nobody can read everything and i 
think some people throw up their hands and say there is so much 
i cant read any of it 
yet with all this volume the printing presses churn out 
hundreds of new titles each year and established journals grow 
fatter 
the abstracting service of the american chemical society 
produces brief summaries of all the chemistry articles and patents 
it can find around the world in 1957 it published 100000 in 
1966 it passed 200000 in 1971 it exceeded 300000 and in 1977 
it went beyond 400000 the rate of growth has slowed since then 
but in 1987 it put out 476178 abstracts from 13000 journals 
and thats just chemistry other areas are booming too for 
instance the 40 journals of the american institute of physics 
published 23042 articles in 1980 last year they published 33955 
computers havent done much to help cope with the avalanche of 
information they have made the journals more accessible 
researchers can use them to scan big collections of titles and 
abstracts for interesting subjects 
however once they zero in on the article they want to see they 
still must go to the printed journal since the full texts of 
reports are seldom kept in computers 
the bigname journals are exclusive clubs they publish a 
quarter or less of all the papers submitted to them most of the 
rejects eventually land in print in less choosy publications 
writes drummond rennie senior contributing editor of the 
journal of the american medical association there seems to be no 
study too fragmented no hypothesis too trivial no literature 
citation too biased or egotistical no design too warped no 
methodology too bungled no presentation of results too inaccurate 
too obscure and too contradictory no analysis too selfserving no 
argument too circular no conclusion too trifling or too 
unjustified and no grammar and syntax too offensive for a paper to 
end up in print 
scientists buy journals of course especially the biggest and 
best which also tend to be the cheapest but at fees often ranging 
from 100 to 1000 a year many of the smaller magazines depend on 
their main customers the libraries some have huge collections 
the national library of medicine in bethesda md subscribes to 
about 12000 and librarians frequently buy them without worrying 
much about how often they are actually read 
in a research library you try to be as complete as you can 
given your resources in anticipation that the good material you 
get even if it is not important now may in time be of value 
says alan erickson head librarian at harvards cabot library 
you cant be pragmatic and purchase exclusively for todays 
audience because you know there are going to be some people who 
have to have access to the older literature 
so if the quality is bad and hardly anybody reads them why do 
all these articles get written and published griffith says the 
journals serve as a sort of archives and registry 
what these articles consist of is claims that a person has 
done a certain type of work or made a certain achievement he 
says hes registering that against the background of general 
scholarship within a profession

there seems to be no end to the proliferation of 
scientific journals and most of them are widely unread then what 
accounts for the steadily increasing volume in part its the need 
to be published 
experiments rarely turn up products to be manufactured or ideas 
to be patented a few pages printed in a journal are all that most 
researchers ever have to show for months in labs and libraries 
getting published is essential for people in science it is how 
they keep score impressive lists of published articles weigh 
heavily in decisions about who will be hired and promoted by 
universities and industry and they are a factor when government 
agencies decide where to give money for research 
some people argue that an emphasis on quantity not quality 
encourages unhealthy and deceptive practices although faking 
results is probably rare they contend that other abuses are more 
common such as recycling the same data to different journals 
cutting the findings of an experiment into small chunks and 
publishing them piecemeal and adding the names of coauthors who 
had nothing to do with the research 
as the results get smaller and smaller the discussion and 
ballyhoo get more and more grandiose because editors and other 
people have to be convinced that this is an important study says 
dr marcia angell senior deputy editor of the new england journal 
of medicine 
this system has advantages too she concedes little of 
importance gets hidden because people constantly tell the world of 
their latest discoveries no matter how trivial but in the end 
she believes the harm outweighs the benefits 
the source of it is the system of rewards within the academic 
community angell says the journals are parasites they are 
taking advantage of that the engine is driven by the system of 
rewarding people for large numbers of publications 
some institutions have begun to cut back on the number of 
journal articles they will look at when hiring and promoting 
faculty members new guidelines at harvard medical school suggest 
specific limits such as five papers for an assistant professor 
seven for an associate professor and 10 for a full professor 
david pendlebury an editor at the scientist a newspaper for 
the profession agrees that the system has its weaknesses but he 
believes the volume of published studies simply reflects the huge 
success of science 
while there might be an increase in the number of papers its 
hard to believe that a cartel of scientists hungry for references 
in their bibliographies get together and create a journal he 
says a journal has to exist in response to an invisible college 
of researchers its got to make some sort of intellectual or 
economic sense to survive

editors note freshwater mussels and clams are falling victim 
to disease and greed and experts ponder the fate of the rivers 
that depend on them 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ecologist richard sparks has worked the 
muddy bottoms of the mississippi and illinois rivers studying 
freshwater clams and mussels natures water filters and he 
doesnt like what he sees 
the shelled creatures are disappearing from their native north 
american riverbeds where they spend their lives filtering polluted 
water through hairline openings in their shells scientists cite 
two reasons 
one is massive dieoffs as yet unexplained 
the other is the voracious appetite of the japanese cultured 
pearl industry which grinds tiny beads from mussel shells and 
imbeds them in oysters to produce pearls overzealous shellers are 
staging a rush on us mussel beds further harming supplies 
there used to be 50 species of mussels on the upper 
mississippi and now therere only 36 to 38 left says sparks a 
river ecologist with the illinois natural history survey at its 
river research lab in havana 
sparks is one of dozens of scientists and others in states 
across the midwest concerned about the plight of mussels and clams 
which come in all sizes and shapes and live as long as 50 years 
ive been buying shells on the mississippi river for 14 
years says de butch ballenger owner of the mississippi 
valley shell co in muscatine iowa i plan on doing this a long 
time thats why me and another buyer pushed for laws in wisconsin 
and iowa to limit the season and shell size 
ballenger 49 employs about 130 harvesters he exports his 
shells to japan and is working with environmentalists to get state 
action to protect the mussels from overharvest 
he worries about the recent influx of shellers from rivers in 
states such as oklahoma texas alabama tennessee and kentucky 
were getting more and more shellers from outofstate 
ballenger says the mussel beds down south are exhausted and 
theyre moving up here states along the upper mississippi 
shouldnt sell outofstate shelling licenses 
shelling is a multimilliondollar industry in the united states 
with shells alone selling for 300 to 1000 per ton 
in 1987 1128 tons were collected from illinois and 1016 tons 
from iowa wisconsin waters yielded 667 tons of shells in 1986 the 
only full year for which figures were available 
freshwater clams and mussels are harvested by hand using hooks 
on poles or by dredging riverbeds 
in camden tenn john latendresse has branched out from simply 
selling shells to japan through his tennessee shell co now hes 
growing pearls and producing jewelry the first american to crack 
the japanesedominated industry 
he says the cultured pearl industry accounts for 3000 jobs in 
japan and his dream is to bring as many of those as possible to 
the united states but the industry may be shortlived latendresse 
says unless state and federal lawmakers act to protect american 
mussel beds 
we exported 16 million worth of mussels to japan in 1986 
says latendresse citing industry research cultured pearls are a 
500 million a year industry over there were exhausting our 
mussel beds to supply their industry its a big problem and im 
very concerned about it 
even representatives of japans cultured pearl industry are 
concerned about overharvest in the united states 
its a freeforall out there says nori sakata president 
of the sakata pearl co of tokyo referring to the competition 
between shellers on american rivers its not just the 
mississippi river its the ohio river and others they definitely 
need restrictions 
the commercial harvesters are overdredging the rivers they 
dont give the mussel beds a chance for any new growth to occur 
everybodys trying to get in on it and theyre starting to dredge 
smaller rivers it doesnt do any good for the ecology 
sakata runs the chicago office of the company which imports 
jewelry and cultured pearls grown at the family oyster farm in 
japan founded in 1956 the company began its us operation 25 
years ago and had 35 million in sales last year 
it think they might need to protect their resources better 
sakata says the persian oriental pearl industry is dead because 
they didnt protect it the persian gulf used to be a hotbed for 
pearls 
if people dont protect their resources theyre going to lose 
them

ron refsnider a staff biologist for the federal department of 
the interiors fish and wildlife service in minneapolis says 
several states have laws governing mussel shells although they are 
inconsistent and vary widely 
refsnider says its unlikely the agency will impose quotas or 
restrict shelling even though 25 species of mussels are on the 
endangered list and 75 species are candidates 
if anything regarding the threat to mussels is overstated 
refsnider says its the ease of solving the problem 
mussels are very good indicators of the biological health of 
an ecosystem a lot of factors have contributed to the very serious 
mussel decline it would cost millions of dollars to solve and no 
one is certain as to the cause 
mussels dont help their cause any refsnider says because they 
are not a real charismatic species they have largely been 
ignored except for their commercial value 
mussels and their smaller cousins clams long have had 
commercial value american indians collected them ate the meat and 
used the shells as ornaments prospectors set off pearl rushes 
on mussels in the 19th century and in 1891 the pearl button 
industry was launched using discarded shells 
development of plastics in the 1920s killed the pearl button 
industry and mussels had relative peace until water pollution 
started taking its toll in the 1950s 
the spread of mussels also was restricted by construction of 
locks and dams as well as by declines in certain species of fish 
that carry embryonic mussels like hitchhikers up and down river 
systems 
recent studies about mussel dieoffs in american rivers over the 
past five years have focused on an invasion of diseasecarrying 
asiatic clams no matter the cause their loss trickles down 
through the ecosystem rivers become more polluted without natures 
filters and wildlife that once fed on the little creatures are 
driven from the area in their search for food 
proposals to save freshwater mussels and clams in the united 
states have ranged from federal import taxes on pearls mussel 
harvest quotas shorter shelling seasons and a ban on exporting raw 
shells but the solution most exciting to sparks is creation of 
river sanctuaries for endangered mussels 
seven sites along the illinois side of the mississippi river 
have been proposed as sanctuaries where scientists would have 
unrestricted access to study mussels and clams 
sanctuaries are urgently needed on the mississippi river 
sparks says we have several endangered species which we must 
save 
but latendresse is not impressed with the sanctuary idea 
several states have created sanctuaries but they dont follow 
up with research funds to study the mussels so the sanctuaries are 
worthless he says theres so much money to be made the 
shellers harvest them out of the sanctuaries

editors note his life seems like something out of a graham 
greene novel a missionary priest with a talent for impressing his 
superiors and other wellmeaning people to others including 
authorities in the united states and italy his dedication was to 
mammon throughout a singularly shady pilgrimage the rev lorenzo 
zorza never relinquished his role of wideeyed innocence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the most tangible legacy of the rev lorenzo 
zorzas two decades as a missionary is a small patch of concrete 
near the consolata society mission in somerset nj 
on this site the consolata fathers had weekly sales of used 
clothes and furniture to benefit their african missions lorenzos 
task to supervise the lay people who ran the rummage sale 
but the priest had a bigger idea to transform the site into 
consolata village a tourist attraction with music food 
rides a gift shop and a copy of the trevi fountain zorza had the 
concrete fountain base poured before telling the other priests of 
his plans 
we said hold it this isnt our kind of thing recalls 
the rev reno aiardi 
that incident 15 years ago was the first of many attempts by 
zorza to mix piety and profit his explanation at the time i was 
only trying to help would become a refrain as he lurched from 
scrape to scrape in 1982 when he was arrested for art smuggling 
in 1987 when he was arrested for trying to sell stolen property 
and this spring when he was accused of being a bag man for an 
international drug ring 
after zorzas april 6 arrest in italy on the drug charge 
published reports linked him to two of italys biggest postwar 
financial and political scandals the collapse of milans banco 
ambrosiano and the rightwing p2 conspiracy to undermine 
italys constitutional government 
in a prison interview broadcast on the syndicated television 
program a current affair zorza maintained his innocence he 
said he was guilty of drug charges only by association or 
interpretation 
but he admitted his ministry such as it was had failed 
i had all kinds of dreams and everything vanished 
he said in heavily accented english the reason is i could never 
lean on anything that was organized its easy to drive a car on a 
highway or to walk on a trail someone made but when you have to 
make your own trail you dont know whats there 
zorzas odyssey began march 24 1941 in a village in northern 
italy near the yugoslav border the youngest of nine children he 
began studying for the priesthood at age 11 at 24 he was ordained 
zorza was assigned by the consolatas to somerset where he 
impressed other priests with his ambition and willingness to work 
the son of a gun is amazing says aiardi if someone had 
car trouble in the middle of the night hed say ill go get 
him if you told him theres this family that needs a little 
something hed be the first one to jump in the truck and bring it 
to them 
but zorza soon became restless aiardi says in the mid1970s he 
moved out saying he wanted to raise money for missionary friends 
in brazil 
i was taking a different direction zorza later explained 
but a conversation secretly recorded in 1982 indicated it may have 
been a crooked one 
in a meeting with a journalist posing as a shady art dealer 
zorzas partner described the priests brazilian initiative as an 
opportunity for profit not charity you can make more money in 
this than paintings he promised 
over the years zorzas fundraising operations changed names 
and locations but it was never clear to us what he was doing 
recalls aiardi even when id ask him personally larry what 
the heck are you doing hed pass over it 
zorza who had become an american citizen became a volunteer at 
the vaticans mission to the united nations in 1978 his role soon 
expanded although he was neither a diplomat nor a paid employee 
by 1982 he was the fourthranking staffer 
as usual zorza was always available driving nuns to the store 
representing the mission at italianamerican community functions 
picking up officials at the airport 
he made contacts including francesco pazienza an italian 
financier later charged in the ambrosiano collapse and convicted in 
the 1980 bombing of a bologna train station which killed 85 people 
europeo an italian magazine says that zorza pazienza and a 
third man offered 45 million for an island in the caribbean 
nation of antigua in order to create their own state with stamps 
currency and liberal tax laws but the deal fell through when 
antigua refused to cede sovereignty over the island the magazine 
said 
during this period zorza lived in the rectory of st agnes 
church on east 43rd street one of the most prominent parishes in 
the new york archdiocese although not officially on the staff he 
said mass heard confessions and performed marriages he boasted 
that one of his most beloved parishioners was greta garbo 
but one of zorzas new friends led him into a trap 
peter watson the journalist posing as an art dealer was told 
zorza was a diplomat with contacts at airports in new york and rome 
who would be willing to smuggle contraband art 
when they met watson who was working with the customs service 
asked zorza if he had brought in much before the priest nodded 
small things are better he told watson jewelry is good 
you have jewelry 
when watson asked you have brought in jewelry zorza 
answered yes 
after the meeting watson was told zorza would carry two 
paintings to new york from rome for 8000 a week later zorza 
arrived at kennedy airport with customs agents secretly watching 
he declared only a bottle of wine some books and family heirlooms 
when he was arrested the next day zorza fainted en route to 
his arraignment he told a customs agent i have to say mass at 5 
oclock 
zorza pleaded guilty but before sentencing the priests 
supporters deluged the prosecutor with phone calls the judge with 
letters a typical plea came from thomas l cassidy managing 
director of first boston corp who wrote 
i know of no person who has a greater concern for his fellow 
man to the detriment of his own personal interest i cannot 
conceive of father zorza doing anything illegal or immoral

<TEXT>
although several months earlier he had tried to sell sothebys a 
piece of forged pottery judge robert ward said zorza may not be 
as knowledgeable and sophisticated as others in the case 
pronouncing it unlikely that such conduct would be repeated he 
sentenced zorza to three years probation 
zorza said it all was a mistake i did it sincerely to help 
somebody and now i am terribly sorry i have learned a lot 
but outside the courtroom watson wrote in his book the 
caravaggio conspiracy the weeping suddenly stopped and he 
laughed and joked with his lawyer about the way they had beaten the 
system 
zorza was banished from the un mission and st agnes he 
stopped visiting somerset and refused his orders offers of a new 
assignment including one in africa 
although his rights to say mass and administer other sacraments 
were not renewed by the archdiocese at the end of 1985 zorza 
continued to say mass at various locations including a catholic 
womens home on west 44th street 
those who met zorza noted his shabby dress stained frayed 
jackets torn pants scuffed shoes 
he once came into a theater district restaurant run by another 
priest he was trying to sell watches with a drawing of christ on 
the face a cross formed the minute and hour hands 
at roughly the same time according to italian newspaper 
accounts the ragged priest became interested in the banco 
ambrosiano collapse the papers citing american police files that 
were turned over to italian judges say zorza hired a private 
investigator to reconstruct the bank moneys route to south america 
when roberto calvi the head of the bank was found hanged from 
a bridge in london in 1982 zorza contacted his family to offer his 
services according to calvis son carlo 
zorzo allegedly knew caesar tall guy bonventre a 
sicilianborn member of new yorks bonanno crime family after 
pieces of bonventres body were found stuffed in a glue vat zorza 
was seriously worried about his own life the investigator said 
meanwhile zorza apparently had time for more mundane matters 
in the summer of 1987 he and another man walked into a manhattan 
theater ticket agency and tried to sell 40000 worth of tickets to 
les miserables 
employees immediately recognized the tickets they had been 
stolen from the same office six months earlier they told the men 
to come back later and called the police 
after his arrest zorza said he was only helping friends who 
never told me the full story about the tickets 
i made two mistakes in my life and im learning from this 
he said i dont want to but im going to have to stop doing 
favors for people 
that was august 21 on aug 9 zorza had met two women at newark 
airport who had flown in from rome federal agents suspect they 
were carrying heroin 
next morning the priest spoke with michael bernardo a partner 
in the latest of a series of zorzas businesses fashion brokerage 
international trading on fifth avenue and a reputed member of the 
italian mafia 
there is a big closeout of suits in the area of camden and 
philadelphia zorza said do you want to talk with them 
yes if its nighttime said bernardo although federal 
agents monitoring the conversation insist suits meant 
drugs zorza claims he was brokering a sale of discounted suits 
when zorza was arrested in rome in april it appeared he would 
be extradited to the united states to face charges that could put 
him in prison for the rest of his life 
but his lawyer frank rubino who also represents gen manuel 
noriega says zorza since has been questioned by italian judges in 
connection with banco ambrosiano calvis death and mafia art 
swindles and that it now is unclear whether italy will relinquish 
him 
zorza meanwhile claims to be at peace 
everything that happens is good is grace even if you have to 
suffer he said in the television interview ive never been so 
serene in my life

tom wopat says after seven years on the 
dukes of hazzard with its good ol boy stereotypes working on 
his newest series seems like the promised land 
wopat stars in the cbs summer series blue skies in which he 
plays an advertising executive who gives up his career in san 
franciso and returns with his new family to his hometown in oregon 
i look at the dukes as something that will fade in time 
says wopat i dont mind the notoriety i dont disclaim it if i 
keep plugging away at what i do people will see a wellrounded 
entertainer and see that im not a onetrick pony 
blue skies halfway through an eightweek run also stars 
season hubley as his wife pat hingle as his father and kim hauser 
alyson croft and danny gerard as their chidren 
dukes was a great education for me says wopat but when 
i started working with carol and nigel mckeand it was like the 
promised land the writing quality is so good and after a few 
weeks they began writing to my personality which they should the 
attention to detail is so good 
the mckeands who are the executive producers also created 
family a successful abc series in the 1970s 
i had no desire to get right back into another series wopat 
says but this show seemed like a wonderful opportunity to get 
back to the tv audience the comment im getting from most people 
is i didnt know you could act 
in the dukes of hazzard he and john schneider played 
cousins luke and bo who never seemed to have anything better to do 
than to tear around hazzard county in the general lee a soupedup 
dodge charger and foil the latest scheme of the corrupt county 
politician boss jefferson davis hogg and the dimwitted sheriff 
roscoe p coltrane 
after he and schneider finished work on dukes in 1985 wopat 
resumed his musical career that had languished during his tv days 
i focused all of my energy on musical pursuits both in 
nashville and in new york says wopat im pretty firmly 
established in nashville now my second album dont look back 
from capital records is coming out in july 
when we finished the series i did a revival of carousel in 
washington then i did an offbroadway show called olympus on my 
mind which is based on a greek legend i played the god jupiter 
while i was doing olympus i got a call to do the cbs morning 
news 
wopat says mckeand who was looking for a lead for blue 
skies happened to see the interview while he was shaving it 
was pure dumb luck he says the twohour pilot was filmed on 
location in ferndale a picturesque little town known for its 
victorian architecture near eureka in northern california after he 
finished the pilot he went to nashville to work on his new album 
then he came back to do seven episodes 
i feel the relationships in the series develop very well he 
says that and the strength of the cast give it an awful lot of 
potential plus of course the writing by the mckeands i play 
frank cobb who was a widower with two children who marries a woman 
with one child there are some interesting conflicts with the 
children hers and mine 
i also have some conflict with my father henry played by pat 
hingle hes angry that i came back because he wanted me to rise 
above his humble beginnings its a matter of communication the 
generation gap still exists theres conflict but also a lot of 
affection 
in the final episode of the summer run his wife annie 
discloses that shes pregnant if the show does well enough in the 
ratings the early ones were soso to get a pickup for next 
midseason the arrival or imminent arrival of a baby will give 
them plenty of story material 
weve all extended our contracts to see how it does says 
wopat were up against alf on nbc and macgyver on abc i 
think at this time of year theres a good potential for growth i 
think the show gets better as it goes along and the later episodes 
will reward people who stick with the show 
last year wopat was reunited with schneider for a tv movie 
christmas comes to willow creek it was an opportunity for them 
to work together again this time outside their dukes roles 
i enjoy working with john says wopat we feed well off 
each other but were two completely different actors i dont mind 
doing more work with him but i think both of us want to show that 
we can do more than that

oddcouple crime fighters are much in vogue this summer the 
generationgap pairs of sean penn and robert duvall in colors 
mark harmon and sean connery in the presidio 
now comes the culturalgap variety arnold schwarzenegger and 
james belushi in red heat 
it was a nifty notion on the part of walter hill southern 
comfort 48 hrs to transport the dirty harry of moscow to 
the mean streets of chicago and for most of the way the movie 
works on a purely action level only in the latter portions does 
hill succumb to the customary overkill of piling one violent action 
on another until the viewer is numbed by crashes and shootouts 
hill wrote the original story and collaborated on the screenplay 
with harry kleiner and troy kennedy martin the impact begins 
immediately as schwarzenegger strides menacingly through a steam 
bath filled with hardmuscled men and women he confronts the 
leader of a drug ring and the battle begins with head blows that 
would kill a fullgrown ox 
the soviet scenes display a rare verisimilitude since hill was 
allowed to film establishing shots in red square and other moscow 
landmarks interiors and street scenes were done in budapest where 
the eastern european locales and faces also contribute to a sense 
of reality hill wisely has the actors speak russian and english 
subtitles explain the dialogue 
when a vicious drug dealer ed oross escapes to chicago 
schwarzenegger insists on permission to track him down the soviet 
cop is combined with chicagos most undisciplined detective 
belushi and between arguments they pursue the dealer and his 
equally brutal confederates 
hill is expert at staging gun battles and chases and he 
maintains the excitement most of the way but excess does not 
always succeed as when schwarzenegger and his quarry fight a 
street duel with greyhound buses such destruction of chicago real 
estate hasnt been seen since john landis filmed the blues 
brothers 
schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the stoic singleminded 
russian whose brutal enforcement is leavened with wry oneliners 
since he says little his reluctant sidekick belushi is required to 
maintain both sides of their conversations and he is able and 
amusing peter boyle has some good scenes as belushis superior ed 
oross is a real find as the steeleyed villain 
red heat is a tristar picture produced by hill and gordon 
carroll the rating is rightfully r because of language nudity and 
violence running time 103 minutes

fans of arnold schwarzenegger can see more of 
their hero than usual in red heat which features an opening 
sequence of a nearnaked brawl in a soviet sauna 
is this a change of heart for the muscular star whose contracts 
give him alone the decision of whether he takes off his shirt or 
more 
not at all he claims pointing out that it was important to 
establish at the outset his character as moscows toughest cop 
one of the things we decided to do was to have this great 
sauna scene with naked men and women where i try to infiltrate 
into the soviet crime organization dealing with drugs he said 
like the others i have nothing on but this little skirt then 
this big fight scene begins with breaking a big window and rolling 
down in the snow 
schwarzenegger recalled he had done one other nearnaked scene 
at the beginning of terminator 
whenever the scene calls for nudity and it fits into the 
movie i dont mind that he said but if it is exploiting the 
whole idea and is thrown in for no reason then it bothers me and i 
stay away from it 
while sylvester stallone is fighting the soviets in rambo 
iii schwarzenegger joins them in red heat as the moscow 
detective he follows a drug merchant to chicago and stalks him 
with the aid of a local cop james belushi in this glasnost era 
director walter hill was able to film in red square 
schwarzenegger had visited the soviet union 10 years ago and he 
was surprised when he returned amazing changes have taken place 
the people were much more relaxed about their freedom there are 
now privatelyowned restaurants in moscow i have seen break 
dancing heavy metal rock bands all kinds of things i did not see 
10 years ago 
the whole idea of an american film company to get permission 
to shoot in red square that has never happened before he said 
we were very fortunate walter hill felt it was very 
important to create realism in the film to make the audience feel 
that they are in moscow at the beginning 
before i went to russia i believed that none of my films had 
been seen there maybe some of the kids would know me because of my 
bodybuilding and weightlifting activities i was surprised to see 
thousands of people coming to red square to watch us film and a 
lot of them had videotapes they were trading them on the black 
market and they were very much aware of commando and predator 
and terminator 
its hard to imagine but schwarzenegger says that he drew 
inspiration for his red heat role from a 1941 greta garbo movie 
ninotchka was the most important vehicle for me in preparing 
for the role he said she plays the same kind of character i 
do in red heat she is a russian who comes to paris very cold in 
the course of the movie she falls in love with a french guy 
melvyn douglas and whole new emotions are coming out that she was 
unaware of i studied the film very carefully and saw it every day 
when we were filming red heat 
schwarzenegger who will be 41 on july 30 must be the most 
disciplined of movie stars not just the body building and all 
that his entire life seems to be minutely calculated and that 
dates back to his beginnings in graz austria as a boy he was 
inspired by seeing american films 
the movies made a tremendous impact on me especially the john 
wayne war movies he remarked they made me want to come to 
america because he represented america so well 
schwarzenegger used his body to achieve his fame scoring as mr 
olympia seven times he came to america at 21 with little knowledge 
of english realizing the need to develop his mind as well as his 
body he read voluminously confident of his future earnings he 
studied for a degree in business and international economics at the 
university of wisconsin 
business has always been something that i liked very much 
he said dating back to when i managed a health club in munich at 
19 i started running bodybuilding competitions in europe and i 
was more of a businessman than a bodybuilder 
when i came to this country and studied business 
administration at college that was very helpful in learning the 
american way of doing business i got into real estate and was very 
fortunate all that is very helpful now especially when you make 
chunks of money in acting and five years later you may be making 
nothing 
acting careers are not like government jobs that last forever 
youre on top one day then maybe the next day youre not 
with the violencefilled vengeance movie seemingly on the wane 
schwarzenegger is varying his films right now he is shooting 
twins for director ivan reitman ghostbusters 
danny devito and i play twins obviously its a comedy he 
said 
he will follow with a world war ii movie based on the comic 
strip sgt rock

forsaking richard wagners classic der ring des 
niebelungen the seattle opera has gone to the opposite extreme 
with a production of the minimalist satyagraha by philip glass 
nonetheless neither the companys general director speight 
jenkins nor glass expects any backlash from wagnerians who have 
made annual pilgrimages from around the world to annual productions 
of the ring since 1975 
only in bayreuth germany where wagner built an opera house to 
stage his fourpart musical epic in 1876 has the ring been 
performed more regularly in modern times 
with performances set for july 23 26 28 and 30 satyagraha 
opens the seattle companys 25th season and is the first minimalist 
opera performance on the west coast jenkins said in an interview 
ive gotten worlds of calls saying we want the ring back 
but no calls saying we love the ring we hate this show we want 
the ring back he said 
why satyagraha an opera in sanskrit 
we want to prove that opera is not just producing old works in 
new and exciting ways jenkins said 
it illustrates the importance of one good man he said it 
illustrates the importance of the duty of all of us to improve 
the life we have around us 
the 19thcentury maestros lavish rendition of a nordic myth 
shows the corrosive force of greed and the redemptive power of love 
the 20thcentury composers musical portrays mahatma gandhis 
years in south africa as the root of passive resistance and 
nonviolent activism 
both represent major historical developments in opera jenkins 
said 
unlike wagners lavish complex often explosive scores glass 
relies on small often quiet and slowly changing themes to create a 
spellbinding effect 
while wagner was working in what was then a popular 
wellestablished medium glass has been instrumental in reviving 
opera as an outlet for late 20thcentury composers jenkins said 
he is working on his fifth opera and all those operas 
completed to date are playing to full houses he said philip 
glass operas always sell well 
even now with glass and other contemporary composers enjoying 
renewed popularity opera companies hesitate to mount repeat 
productions of their work the problem with writing opera in 
the middle part of the 20th century was that a lot of the composers 
were writing for other composers and not for their audiences and 
they admitted it jenkins explained 
glass is one of the leading lights in modern music besides his 
own small group the welltraveled philip glass ensemble he has 
written for theater dance and film including the sound tracks for 
koyanisqatsi mishima and the recently released 
powaqqatsi 
satyagraha the second and most widely performed of his 
operas was first performed by the netherlands opera in 1980 it 
was a sellout again at the brooklyn academy of music in new york 
and the lyric opera of chicago last year 
the seattle performance features tenor douglas perry who has 
had the lead in every performance to date and in a cbs masterworks 
recording claudia cummings another satyagraha veteran of 
stage and studio as gandhis secretary and bruce ferden music 
director of the spokane symphony who conducted the orchestra in 
the world premiere in rotterdam 
glass who like gandhi is a vegetarian said he had long been 
inspired by the leader of the independence movement in india and 
visited there several times before the opera was commissioned by 
hans de roo of the netherlands opera 
in 1977 the gandhi film didnt exist yet so it was kind of a 
longshot in a way gandhi wasnt in the news south africa wasnt 
in the news but it was something i believed could hold the 
stage he said 
the title combines the words satya meaning truth or love 
and graha meaning power or force 
the sanskrit libretto is based loosely on the bhagavad gita the 
hindu religious text that was ghandis lifelong inspiration rather 
than on the action which is performed in mime 
instead of translating the words into english supertitles 
projected onto the stage merely summarize the action 
oddly enough this actually makes the whole thing easier 
glass said instead of going to the opera house and trying to 
understand what the people are singing you know right away that 
youre not going to understand it and then you see the opera 
the way i wanted you to 
i wasnt interested in the text really but the people had to 
sing something he said i wanted the operatic experience to be 
completely about the images and music and very little about the 
text 
i thought i could relate the story of gandhi without recourse 
or the need of any text 
besides offering a contemporary theme and musical style for the 
audience glass productions cost less especially compared with 
an extravaganza such as the ring 
jenkins said it would cost about 700000 to mount 
satyagraha with ticket sales expected to cover about 450000 
the boeing co has contributed 50000 and 200000 remains to be 
raised he said 
jenkins said the fate of the seattle ring hinges on assuring at 
least a 50 percent local share of the roughly 12 million in 
private and corporate donations needed to supplement ticket sales 
for the 22 million he figures it would take to revive das 
rheingold die walkure siegfried and die 
gotterdammerung next year 
in the past he has strongly favored staging the ring every other 
year or perhaps in two years out of each three 
with a bit of a twinkle in his eye glass said his own operatic 
trilogy of einstein on the beach satyagraha and 
akhnaten scheduled for a series of performances this fall by 
the stuttgart opera in germany was being labeled by some european 
fans as the glass ring 
does he expect to see the seattle opera alternate rings in 
future years 
worse things could happen he said with a laugh but im 
not going up against wagner do you think im crazy

its been four years since corey hart had a hit 
with sunglasses at night four long years 
i know when i sing sunglasses its like a teenager trying 
to be cool its not me anymore said hart who has released his 
fourth album young man running 
i was going on pure adrenaline and energy i was driven by my 
music and driven to succeed by my music i loved doing it but i 
started missing out the daytoday pleasures of life 
success came early for hart who was only 20 at the time of his 
debut album first offense his next record boy in the 
box sold over a million copies in his native canada and yielded 
a top 5 single in the united states never surrender 
it was a million times more exciting than i thought it would 
be hart said you can never imagine 
but success took its toll on hart who found himself losing 
control of his life in the summer of 1987 he collapsed from 
mental and physical exhaustion 
by end of the day if i hadnt crossed the finish line and was 
the victor i would be very dejected and i would be really cursing 
myself hart recalled it was leading to a cyclical destructive 
pattern i started to negate anything i had down and i was 
basically never happy with anything 
on the first single from his lp in your soul he sings i 
have always thought i could run faster than the wind count your 
blessings cause its in your soul 
hart believes in your soul represents a more reflective way 
of living 
its the pivot song he said it weaves itself throughout 
the record you just have to look within yourself to find what you 
need i realized with in your soul that each day is each day and 
you dont necessarily have to achieve your ultimate fulfillment in 
one day 
chippin away the title of one of the songs on the album 
might best sum up harts philosophy he still is anxious to 
succeed but he believes he has become more realistic about 
achieving his goals 
life is the constant pursuit whatever the 10 or 15 or three 
major ambitions you have in your life you have to pursue it 
hart said its not that you can reach the ultimate goal theres 
no such thing in life in my opinion 
hart produced or coproduced all the songs on young man 
running 
i had a vision for this album he said i wanted to marry 
the technological and acoustic together only through my eyes could 
i achieve that 
the music on young man running covers a range of styles 
in your soul fits comfortably on fm rock stations chippin 
away has a relaxed country feel i thought of jed clampett 
on tvs the beverly hillbillies just whittling away the song 
was fun i think its really loose 
several songs feature the vocals of ruby turner an english soul 
singer hart met her through helen terry of culture club and 
was so impressed by turner he rewrote the lyrics of spot you in 
a coalmine so he could include her 
hart first wrote coalmine while at the san remo song festival 
in italy 
i was at a hotel where the other bands were staying one of 
those bands was duran duran hart recalled there were maybe 
400 or 500 kids out front clamoring for duran duran banners 
and posters 
out of the corner of my eye i saw these three kids holding up 
a banner that said corey hart we could spot you in a coalmine 
although hart is from canada he rejects the idea that there is 
anything specifically canadian about his music 
we have c and w in nashville and in alberta hart said 
i think music has no bounderies i dont like to attribute 
anything to being a canadian artist it doesnt give me a merit 
point 
two songs no love lost and crossroad caravan tell 
about the breakup of harts parents 
no love lost is harts own interpretation of why the 
marriage failed 
its deception towards another he said its my 
perception as a kid watching them split up and later trying to 
figure out what happened 
on crossroad caravan hart imagines the night when his 
mother realizes she can no longer be with his father 
my mom worshiped my father he said i had this image of 
her knowing that she was alone and that the marriage had crumbled 
but because she knew that she was free 
hart will tour in the fall and is aware that many fans will be 
anxious to hear sunglasses 
im not going to do the song injustice by trashing it because 
its what i was then hart said but i feel that the audience 
has grown up with me the majority of them 
anyone listening to corey hart cant ever say i wasnt doing 
what was true to me

during the late 1960s and early 70s 
thousands of young people fled americas cities with dreams of 
subsisting off the land and living simpler lives 
many perhaps most became disillusioned and eventually 
returned to more traditional careers in an urban setting 
one who stuck with the dream and turned it into a life of 
contentment was terry silber who gave up her highpowered job as 
art director for the atlantic monthly left boston and attempted to 
eke out a living on the abandoned western maine farm she had 
purchased on a whim in 1965 
in a small farm in maine houghton mifflin 1795 silber 
tells how she and her husband mark a russianborn nature 
photographer turned that rundown property from a weekend retreat 
to the centerpiece of a selfsustaining business one that now 
embraces horticulture crafts teaching and writing 
some may view the book as a nononsense guide for anyone who 
nurtures similar dreams of cutting loose from urban connections and 
becoming selfsupporting on the farm 
its how to get rid of the mythologies and face the realities 
of coming to the country the 47yearold silber said in an 
interview 
but more than that its a personal memoir of an energetic 
intelligent and resourceful woman whose abiding love for the land 
has intensified with each passing year 
this very ordinary piece of land has become my home my 
office my laboratory and on it i am able to work play study and 
live all the while enjoying an environment that is so beautiful 
so stimulating and so seductive that i have become unfit to live 
elsewhere silber writes 
the book was the brainchild of editor richard todd her former 
colleague at the atlantic and a parttime farmer himself todd 
maintained there was a story in the atypical success of an urban 
dropout who went back to the land and actually stayed 
initially cool to the idea she insists shes a visual person 
not a writer silber finally relented once she was sure her 
familys agricultural future was secure 
i came reluctantly to it she said i got to the point in 
the development of this place where i thought were here i know 
were here i know were here for the duration 
from rank amateurs who sought out neighbors advice on planting 
such commonplace crops as corn and tomatoes the silbers have 
become recognized experts whose assortments of herbs and flowers 
are among the most varied and unusual 
the childlike delight they once took in watching a newlyseeded 
row of beans push up through the soil has given way to a 
familiarity with hundreds upon hundreds of herbal varieties whose 
names border on the unpronounceable 
the silbers have turned hedgehog hill farm into a horticultural 
showplace thousands of visitors each year buy seedlings or dried 
flowers and herbs attend classes on subjects ranging from 
basketmaking to floral design or simply revel in the silbers 
botanical paradise 
the couple have become experts in production of everlastings 
the dried flowers and herbs that account for a large share of their 
mailorder and retail store sales they are collaborating on a 
comprehensive and lavishly illustrated guide to everlastings due 
for publication later this year 
such valueadded products have helped to make the farm a 
success and silber hesitates when asked if she and her husband 
could have survived on market gardening alone 
i play with that question a lot she said i really dont 
know 
of the 160 acres that the silbers now own only 10 acres have 
been cleared and no more than three are ever under cultivation but 
their farming is extremely intensive making use of greenhouses 
raised beds and black plastic sheets to spur crop growth and 
control weeds 
silbers feelings for the farm expressed eloquently in the 
book are evident as she paces its walkways and strolls between 
rows of plants savoring the soft spring rain that intensifies the 
lush green of her surroundings 
i love working on the land she said explaining how she and 
her husband have had to scale back the business for fear it would 
turn them into fulltime administrators with litle time to work in 
the fields nine people including the silbers themselves work at 
the farm 
she says her love of physical labor you work harder than 
youve ever worked in your life was one of the factors that 
allowed her to succeed where so many other backtothelanders had 
failed 
perhaps the most important factor however was the gradual 
process by which the silbers weaned themselves from their urban 
support systems and moved slowly and deliberately along the path 
toward rural selfsufficiency 
while others uprooted themselves abruptly and came to the 
country with little more than a romanticized vision as a guide 
silber continued initially to take on consulting work in order to 
supplement the income she and her husband earned from selling 
produce at farmers markets after they became fulltime maine 
residents in 1977 
for seven years prior to their move the couple led a double 
life spending weekends on the farm before returning to their 
boston jobs tuesday morning and dashing back to their country 
retreat after work on friday 
ironically silbers farm odyssey has taken her almost full 
circle from the region in which she grew up she was born in 
lewiston a mill city just 20 miles from here and lived in five 
states two foreign countries and more than two dozen apartments 
and houses before returning to maine 
the decision to become a fulltime organic farmer represented an 
aesthetic choice she said rather than a moral or an ethical one 
you have to find out if the rewards that you want are really 
the rewards that a rural life offers luckily for mark and me they 
are they are aesthetic sensual and for us extremely intellectual 
in that we have so much to learn she said

nearly 25 years after he hit the british 
pop music scene as a teenage vocalist steve winwood is 
recapturing the popularity of his youth with the help of nashville 
and memphis session men 
the grammy awardwinning artists new album and hit single of 
the same name roll with it hark back to his days in the 
mid1960s with the rhythm and bluesstyled spencer davis group 
the move to tennessee he says gave him the chance to go back 
to his musical roots on the new album 
it certainly reflects the fact that ive been in tennessee 
winwood said in an interview it has a memphis feel to a lot of 
the songs since ive been down here ive had a strong interest in 
the musical history of the area 
winwood had his first taste of stardom at the age of 16 when he 
was the lead vocalist on the spencer davis groups hit gimme some 
lovin he later had stints with traffic and blind faith before 
going on to a solo career 
two recent albums arc of a diver and back in the high 
life went platinum and the single higher love from the 
latter won winwood grammys for record of the year and best male pop 
vocalist in 1986 
he calls his latest release a happy album 
theres nothing melancholic about it he said 
winwood credits several factors for the upbeat mood of the lp 
at 40 years old im having the best album and the best part 
of my career that ive ever had im also very happily married and 
i have a beautiful little girl he said 
winwood married eugenia crafton of nashville in january 1987 
they have a baby daughter mary clare and keep homes in nashville 
and britain 
on his latest work he tapped trumpeter wayne jackson and 
saxophonist andrew love of the memphis horns for the album 
nashvilles mike lawler plays keyboards and michael rhodes plays 
bass on the album and during winwoods 31city tour this summer 
winwood loves the rhythmandblues sound that first made him 
popular with the spencer davis group and he still listens to it 
but when asked if a reunion was possible the veteran rocker said 
it isnt likely 
there are no plans at all for a reunion i couldnt say it 
isnt entirely impossible but my brother former band mate muff 
hasnt played bass in 10 to 12 years he said 
roll with it has a distinctive rhythmandblues sound that 
comes with the gutsy brass of the memphis horns and the bop of the 
hammond b3 organ winwood is unsure if renewed interest in the 
blues among american audiences is contributing to his success 
im never quite sure about audiences he said i am 
getting more influenced by rhythm and blues but about audiences i 
dont really know i tend to think its a mistake to aim for a 
certain audience 
though he now lives and works in the country music capital of 
the world winwood seemed a bit surprised by the diversity of 
musicians available he plans to collaborate with more nashville 
musicians although he hasnt decided who 
i will use and am using musicians from nashville but i 
dont think it will have the obvious effect i wont be using a 
fiddle player or steel guitar he joked but there are great 
musicians here not only in the country field but great rock n 
roll players 
i dont think it will affect the music so much it wont 
affect the writing wherever i go it usually comes out sounding 
like a steve winwood album

zapping fresh foods with radiation may 
increase their shelf life and make them safer to eat but the 
notion of eating irradiated fruits vegetables and meats leaves a 
bad taste in some mouths 
despite claims by some scientists the federal government and 
others that irradiation is a safe way to rid foods of bacteria 
microorganisms or insects antinuclear activists and other 
scientists insist it can harm people 
the process involves running produce on a conveyor belt around a 
radiation source for a few seconds or minutes eighteeninch long 
rods containing either cobalt 60 or cesium 137 treat the foods 
without raising their temperature when not in use the rods are 
immersed in water as a safety precaution 
xrays and gamma rays break chemical bonds and either disrupt 
the ongoing process of decay or any contaminant on the food said 
christine bruhn consumer food marketing specialist with the 
university of california cooperative extension at davis 
supporters say food does not become radioactive at the doses 
used and is safe to handle and eat immediately after irradiation 
they say it can extend shelf life of some produce and meats and rid 
pork of dangerous parasites 
scientists say it is safer than products contaminated with 
microorganisms or mold or some chemically approved products ms 
bruhn said 
opponents contend that studies showing adverse effects have been 
ignored or suppressed one found chromosome damage in humans four 
weeks after they ate freshly irradiated wheat said denis 
mosgofian director of the san franciscobased coalition to stop 
food irradiation 
irradiation of food actually changes the food rearranges its 
chemistry creates new chemicals many of which are toxic 
mosgofian said irradiated food has been shown repeatedly to 
produce adverse health effects to both animals and humans who 
consumed it 
rep douglas bosco dcalif introduced legislation in march to 
rescind a 1986 ruling by the food and drug administration allowing 
the sale of irradiated foods he also called for a national academy 
of sciences study of the process 
bosco said he wanted any new technology proven safe before it 
is allowed to permeate our food chain 
ms bruhn acknowledged that scientists have found a meat product 
that produced a unique radiolytic product when irradiated 
the important thing is does that make it toxic the indication is 
that it does not she said 
concern also has been raised that irradiation might allow 
mutations of bacterias or viruses but a world health organization 
study turned up none it could happen in the future ms bruhn 
said its unlikely 
irradiated food is rare at us supermarkets partly because 
fumigation is cheaper but the process is used to sterilize medical 
equipment at 40 plants in the united states and some spices are 
irradiated to kill microbes 
the washington apple commission has received thousands of 
letters in what officials say seems to be an organized campaign 
expressing concern that apples will be treated at an irradiation 
research center the us department of energy plans to build at 
pasco wash 
an irradiated apple a day keeps the consumer away said one 
commission spokesman charles st john said washington apples 
will not be irradiated even though the process would kill codling 
moth larvae that keep large amounts of fruit out of the japanese 
market the japanese have told us they are not going to accept 
irradiation so it is a moot point he said 
ms bruhn said most california consumers are undecided some 
want to avoid them others want to buy them in any case they all 
want to be able to make an informed choice

for decades breast cancer meant mastectomy but 
rosanne forziano had her cancer removed in december while keeping 
her breast 
its easy to assume that with her tumor gone without 
disfigurement her problems were over but thats not the story 
that emerges from forziano and other members of an unusual support 
group for lumpectomy patients 
what is devastating to you is that you had cancer says 
forziano 34 its gone now but will it come back and where will 
it come back 
lumpectomy patients are not alone among cancer patients in 
worrying about recurrance but forziano and other group members say 
the shared surgical experience helps in discussing that issue and 
others 
having chosen lumpectomy i want to be with women who made 
that kind of choice says sarah a woman in her mid50s who 
asked that her real name not be used these are the people who 
know what this is about 
nancy denton a social worker who works with lumpectomy groups 
at long island jewish hospital says many people fail to realize 
that patients whose breasts have been spared still need emotional 
support 
they are looked at by society by their family members by a 
lot of the medical profession as here they are they have their 
whole breast intact so they dont need anything 
in fact the bottom line is that they have breast cancer that 
in itself warrants some attention 
support groups specifically for lumpectomy patients are unusual 
most are for breast cancer patients in general or even cancer 
patients in general 
the long island hospital plans four lumpectomy groups a year 
each running six weeks the one that included forziano had a dozen 
members 
lumpectomies account for maybe 20 to 25 percent of breast cancer 
surgeries and its definitely on the increase says dr david 
winchester medical director of the cancer department of the 
american college of surgeons 
the surgery is used on small tumors then the breast is 
irradiated five times a week for about six weeks chemotherapy also 
may be required 
the radiation treatments involve the strain not only of daily 
trips to the hospital but also of seeing radiation patients who 
are doing poorly says forziano you say to yourself is that 
going to be me next year 
the support group lets members discuss such feelings as well as 
anger at what cancer has done to their lives and the pressure to be 
stoic around their families says denton meetings also include 
lessons in stress management exercise and breast selfexamination 
one payoff says sarah is being able to encourage each 
other to allow family and friends to really be there in an 
emotional supportive way 
i still come out feeling most of the time that im lucky 
to have had it found early have been able to keep my breast and 
be with other women who know what thats about

takehiko furusawa an engineer specializing in a 
technological field with potential military application says there 
is a definite change under way in japan regarding freedom of 
information 
research results here used to be completely open but since 
eastern bloc countries have used our technology for military 
purposes weve had to close off conferences and the flow of 
information in a number of fields said the university of tokyo 
professor 
in the wake of last years scandal involving exports of 
sensitive technology to the soviet union japan has moved with 
uncharacteristic speed to clamp down on strategic exports and cut 
off access to information on sensitive technology like the carbon

talks between japan and the united states have 
focused on balancing trade between the countries but havent 
ignored the fact that japan has built its technological edge on the 
foundations of western science 
under a pact signed last month by president reagan and prime 
minister noboru takeshita japan will spend 4 million to invite 
us scientists and engineers to the country open research 
laboratories to americans and boost the number of foreigners 
invited on scholarships from 28 to 200 
washington has demanded more research funding and a commitment 
to balance the flow of researchers and information getting tough 
as critics particularly us industry call for an end to what 
they say has been japans free ride 
the japan center at the university of north carolina estimates 
that 15000 japanese students and researchers enter us 
institutions a year five times the number of americans who come to 
japan 
leading japanese scientists many of whom have studied or worked 
in america agree that the time has arrived for japan to repay its 
debt 
my generation has all gone to the united states to study 
japan just preaches about international cooperation but it really 
has to start putting out more funds like the us government 
which has spent so much over the years tokyo university 
professor shoji tanaka one of the worlds leading 
superconductivity researchers said in an interview 
hiroshi inose head of the national center for science 
information system and inventor of the digital telephone switch 
when he was a researcher at the university of pennsylvania and bell 
telephone in the late 1950s agrees 
i have repeatedly told the government that the united states 
has spent a great deal to invite japanese scientists and engineers 
on fulbright scholarships i dont think we ever reciprocated for 
that 
the usjapan agreement on cooperation in science and 
technology was first signed in 1980 to promote basic research in 
nonenergy areas it was renewed five times since 1985 and after 
10 months of negotiations ending in june officials agreed to a new 
pact effective until 1993 
in tokyo however the feeling pervades that japan is being 
forced to comply with a pact of benefit only to washington to us 
in japan it appears we are under the pressure of the us 
government inose said 
and american researchers are afraid of being left behind by 
their colleagues back home said nagahide onozawa who will 
oversee 100 foreign researchers under the governmental japan 
society for the promotion of science 
tokyo universitys tanaka head of the new international 
superconductivity technology center questions us intentions 
tanaka found no takers when he tried recently to interest american 
companies in the project in addition the us government has 
closed off symposiums on superconductivity to foreigners while 
citing the field as one for joint research in the bilateral pact

zapping fresh foods with radiation may 
increase their shelf life and make them safer to eat but the 
notion of eating irradiated fruits vegetables and meats leaves a 
bad taste in some mouths 
despite claims by some scientists the federal government and 
others that irradiation is a safe way to rid foods of bacteria 
microorganisms or insects antinuclear activists and other 
scientists insist it can harm people 
the process involves running produce on a conveyor belt around a 
radiation source for a few seconds or minutes eighteeninchlong 
rods containing cobalt 60 or cesium 137 treat the foods without 
raising their temperature when not in use the rods are immersed 
in water as a safety precaution 
xrays and gamma rays break chemical bonds and either disrupt 
the ongoing process of decay or any contaminant on the food said 
christine bruhn consumer food marketing specialist with the 
university of california cooperative extension at davis 
supporters say food does not become radioactive at the doses 
used and is safe to handle and eat immediately after irradiation 
they say it can extend shelf life of some produce and meats and rid 
pork of dangerous parasites 
opponents contend that studies showing adverse effects have been 
ignored or suppressed one found chromosome damage in humans four 
weeks after they ate freshly irradiated wheat said denis 
mosgofian director of the san franciscobased coalition to stop 
food irradiation 
irradiation of food actually changes the food rearranges its 
chemistry creates new chemicals many of which are toxic 
mosgofian said irradiated food has been shown repeatedly to 
produce adverse health effects to both animals and humans who 
consumed it 
rep douglas bosco dcalif introduced legislation in march to 
rescind a 1986 ruling by the food and drug administration allowing 
the sale of irradiated foods he also called for a national academy 
of sciences study of the process 
irradiated food is rare at us supermarkets partly because 
fumigation is cheaper but the process is used to sterilize medical 
equipment at 40 plants in the united states and some spices are 
irradiated to kill microbes

for decades breast cancer meant mastectomy but 
rosanne forziano had her cancer removed in december while keeping 
her breast 
its easy to assume that with her tumor gone without 
disfigurement her problems were over but thats not the story 
that emerges from forziano and other members of an unusual support 
group for lumpectomy patients 
what is devastating to you is that you had cancer says 
forziano 34 its gone now but will it come back and where will 
it come back 
lumpectomy patients are not alone among cancer patients in 
worrying about recurrance but forziano and other group members say 
the shared surgical experience helps in discussing that issue and 
others 
having chosen lumpectomy i want to be with women who made 
that kind of choice says sarah a woman in her mid50s who 
asked that her real name not be used these are the people who 
know what this is about 
support groups specifically for lumpectomy patients are unusual 
most are for breast cancer patients in general or even cancer 
patients in general long island jewish hospital plans four 
lumpectomy groups a year each running six weeks the one that 
included forziano had a dozen members 
nancy denton a social worker who works with lumpectomy groups 
at long island jewish says many people fail to realize that 
patients whose breasts have been spared still need emotional 
support 
they are looked at by society by their family members by a 
lot of the medical profession as here they are they have their 
whole breast intact so they dont need anything 
in fact the bottom line is that they have breast cancer that 
in itself warrants some attention

doctors will be able to unmask eye disease 
in its earliest stages with a new chart that uses progressively 
disappearing letters to measure ability to distinguish tones its 
designers say 
it is reasonable to think that many would not become blind or 
would become blind later in life because of this enhancement of our 
early detection tools said neuroscientist denis g pelli one of 
the inventors of the pellirobson letter sensitivity chart 
the new chart will provide a more efficient method of diagnosing 
serious eye problems pelli said during its recent unveiling at 
syracuse universitys institute for sensory research the chart is 
being used in two nationwide trials sponsored by the national eye 
institute and is set for general distribution to doctors this 
august 
unlike the traditional snellen chart found in most doctors 
offices with its shrinking letters the pellirobson chart uses an 
evensided block with six character lines of fourinch high 
letters the pellirobson letters gradually fade from solid black 
to gray and then melt into the whitewash background 
the traditional eye chart is very effective in prescribing 
eyeglasses but it is a poor detector of most eye diseases said 
john g robson a professor in neurophysiology at cambridge 
university england 
robson and his colleagues found that many eye diseases are 
preceded by a loss in the ability to perceive contrast eyesight 
as measured by traditional charts may withstand the effects of 
disease longer 
available methods of measuring contrast sensitivity are complex 
time consuming or unreliable said robson 
the inventors hope their chart will let doctors identify 
cataracts glaucoma myopia macular degeneration optic neuritis 
and diabetic retinopathy in earlier stages 
we are desperately in need of new devices said dr john 
hoepner chairman of the ophthalmology department at the state 
university of new york medical center here we know that were not 
really measuring functional disability and picking out disease with 
these older techniques 
the use of contrast sensitivity is exciting to us

outside the country 
daihatsu officials said the company is considering marketing the

taiwans surplus with the united states increased 
29 percent to 839 million in june from 652 million in may 
although it was still 48 percent below the surplus of 161 billion 
in june 1987 the government said tuesday 
it was the third month in a row taiwan has posted an increased 
trade surplus with the united states after eight months of decline 
overall taiwan posted a 138 billion trade surplus in june 
the highest level of the year but still less than a year earlier 
the government said 
the overall june surplus was 237 percent higher than the may 
surplus of 112 billion but 236 percent below the surplus of 
181 billion in june 1987 according to the directorate general of 
budget accounting and statistics 
taiwans trade surplus for the years first six months came to 
454 billion down 501 percent from the same period last year 
exports in june totaled 529 billion up 67 percent from a 
year ago and imports reached 391 billion up 221 percent 
trade officials associated the larger overall monthly surplus 
mainly with stable new taiwan dollar that drew many orders back to 
local manufacturers 
the taiwan dollar after two years of appreciation in value 
against the us currency has remained stable since the start of 
the year 
another factor in the larger monthly surplus was a reduction in 
taiwans imports of gold bullion from the united states the 
islands largest trading partner although precise june figures 
were not immediately available officials said

the japanese cabinet gave its formal approval 
tuesday to agreements with the united states and australia aimed at 
easing curbs on imports of beef and citrus fruits from those 
nations a foreign ministry official said 
the approval was given during a regular cabinet meeting 
clearing the way for a gradual loosening of japans import curbs on 
the agricultural items according to the official who demanded 
anonymity 
japans restrictions on beef and citrus fruits was a hotly 
contested issue among the three nations with both the united 
states and australia threatening to take their case to the general 
agreement on trade and tariffs an international body based in 
geneva that sets trade rules and offers a forum for resolving 
disputes 
japan escaped a gatt battle in midjune by reaching separate 
bilateral agreements with the two countries 
on june 20 the japanese government acceded to us demands to 
phase out quotas blocking beef imports over a threeyear period 
beginning 1991 farm minister takashi sato signed a similar 
agreement with australian officials in canberra on june 24 
also beginning in 1991 japan will permit unlimited imports of 
us oranges but subject to the current tariff rates of 40 percent 
in season and 20 percent off season

grain and soybean futures prices turned sharply 
lower today after opening higher on the chicago board of trade 
traders and analysts attributed the decline to profittaking in 
the wake of the national weather services latest 6to10day 
outlook which predicted abovenormal rainfall in key growing areas 
late this week and early next week 
substantial weekend rains in the southeast and extreme northern 
plains also pressured the markets analysts said 
but prices appeared to be rebounding at midmorning after the 
early gyrations 
jerry gidel an analyst with the gh miller division of 
britishowned trading company lit america inc said some private 
meteorologists disagreed with the national weather service 
prediction and expect continued hot and dry conditions for the 
droughtstricken farm belt 
people are feeling the weather scenario hasnt changed that 
drastically yet gidel said 
in early trading wheat was 13 cents to 18 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 384 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to 5 cents higher with july at 342 a bushel oats were 3 cents 
to 15 cents lower with july at 320 a bushel soybeans were 11 
cents to 25 cents lower with july at 964 a bushel

oil prices rose only slightly today in reaction 
to the us destruction of an iranian jetliner over the persian 
gulf and traders said they did not think the crisis marked a big 
threat to supplies from that region 
on the new york mercantile exchange a key barometer of prices 
the augustdelivery price for west texas intermediate crude was up 
only 13 cents per 42gallon barrel to 1507 by late this morning 
the expectations are that the iranians arent going to take 
any action that threaten oil supplies said jayne ball an 
energyfutures trader at the investment firm of dean witter 
reynolds in new york if they were the market would have been up 
a dollar here the market already has figured out thats not going 
to happen 
some said that because the incident happened sunday and the 
iranians had not retaliated us oilmarket strategists had more 
than a day to consider the risks before domestic trading resumed 
which lessened the chances of any drastic reaction the market was 
closed monday for the fourth of july holiday 
others said the market did not react strongly to the crisis 
because excessive supplies have been overwhelming demand recently 
pushing prices down to the lowest level of the year 
a key reason is that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries which once controlled prices has failed to enforce 
production discipline among its members which are increasingly 
violating output restraints 
i think the reaction here is muted because of overwhelming 
concern about the fundamentals said stephen smith an oil 
analyst at bear stearns cos in new york

the stock market was narrowly mixed today in

of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 572 up 638 down and 
516 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 7378 million shares as of noon 
on wall street 
there was some initial profittaking in the wake of higher 
interest rates in the credit markets and fridays lackluster 
equities trading session but one trader characterized activity as 
more apathetic than anything else the market is trying to shrug 
off holiday cobwebs 
traders anticipated light volume as some key decision makers 
have extended their holiday weekend and since portfolio managers 
have yet to pick their investments for the new quarter those 
decisions arent made in a day a trader noted 
because the stock market was closed monday for the independence 
day holiday this is the first opportunity traders had to react to 
the weekend downing of an iranian passenger plane by the us navy 
but analysts said the incident was not a key focus 
the market will take it as an international incident said 
larry wachtel first vice president at prudentialbache securities 
inc 
he noted that the oil and precious metals markets which are 
most sensitive to such global news had no response and therefore 
to attribute any weakness in the dow to that incident would be 
missing the point 
traders speculated that there would have been more of a reaction 
if the jetliner attack had occurred during the week 
mirroring activity in the previous session utility stocks 
dominated the most active issues on the big board with delmar 
power and light up at 18 boston edison down at 15 pacific

getting a jump on bigger rivals a 4yearold 
company has put together a system that allows personal computers to 
use rewritable laser disks for storing huge quantities of 
information 
rewritable laser disks are considered part of the future of the 
computer business they are close cousins of the compact disks used 
for music except they are set up for computer information and can 
be erased and written on repeatedly 
the system assembled by new yorkbased advanced graphic 
applications inc is the first of its kind on the us market said 
ed rothchild chairman of rothchild associates a san 
franciscobased consulting firm 
advanced graphic applications which buys the components from 
other companies wrote software that allows the datastorage 
devices to be connected easily to personal computers using the 
popular msdos operating system 
its significant that theyre offering a plugandplay 
solution rothchild said but he added they will have lots of 
competitors 
for now the 40employee company has a jump on companies such as 
sony corp maxtor corp and eastman kodak cos verbatim unit 
which have not put together complete systems that are ready for 
sale 
sharp corp announced a complete system in december but only 
for the japanese market rothchild said he said some companies may 
be hanging back waiting to see what industry standards develop 
rewritable laser disks are capable of storing 650 megabytes of 
data or nearly 300000 typewritten pages of information which is 
many times more than can be held on fixed hard disks moreover 
unlike hard disks they can be taken out and used in other computers 
the laser disk drives already on the market led by 
international business machines corps topselling model can 
write information once but cannot erase and rewrite ibms model is 
made for it by matsushita electric industrial co 
the disk drive in the new discus rewritable system is made by 
olympus corp of japan and the disks themselves are made by 
minnesota mining and manufacturing co 
advanced graphic applications said it was taking orders on the

a group that includes koppers co managers 
said tuesday it had agreed to pay 660 million to take the 
companys chemicals and related businesses private in a deal with 
the winners of a bitter takeover battle 
the managers with financier gordon cains sterling group as an 
equity financing partner expect to complete the deal by aug 5 
the deal was negotiated with bns inc a takeover group composed 
of british industrialist brian beazer the wall street investment 
bank shearson lehman hutton inc and national westminster bank 
bns completed a 18 billion tender offer for koppers june 15 
cain will serve as chairman and glen tenley who was president 
and chief operating officer of koppers will serve as president and 
chief executive of the business to be known as koppers chemical co 
the new company with annual sales of about 600 million in 
chemicals and wood products will remain headquartered in 
pittsburgh 
beazer wanted koppers for its building materials businesses 
which he added to his own international operations in the same 
industry 
he had intended to sell the chemicals and related businesses to 
help finance the takeover and he gave the pittsburghbased 
managers exclusive right to negotiate for the units 
the 6yearold sterling group has completed 20 leveraged 
buyouts about onethird in the chemical industry tenley 60 is a 
33year veteran of the chemicals business 
the size of cains equity stake in the new company is among 
the details to be worked out said koppers spokesman robert 
ogara 
im not sure how much of that is going to be made public this 
is going to be a private corporation he said 
the other major unresolved issue is personnel ogara said 
the chemicals businesses employ about 4000 people at 25 plants 
around the country all but 50 of the 1150 employees at koppers 
headquarters work for the chemicals businesses and beazer has yet 
to pick the employees he wants to hire for the construction 
materials operations ogara said 
the parties hope to resolve both issues in the next four weeks 
he said 
our cash flow is strong and the outlook for the koppers 
chemical business is good tenley said in a statement 
we are confident of our ability to grow to a 1 billion sales 
organization by the early 1990s and we will add that growth 
through expansion of quality programs in our businesses and by 
serving our customer base with new products and services he said 
local government officials had pressed for beazer to keep 
koppers in pittsburgh and beazer said the buyout constitutes the 
fulfillment of our pledge to give local management an edge in

plunged as the market digested mondays 6to10 day national 
weather service forecast predicting abovenormal rainfall in key 
growing areas for the fiveday period beginning sunday 
the large speculative trading firms refco inc and campd

in the droughtstricken farm belt for the rest of this week and 
that was enough to support corn prices 
the corn crop is entering its critical pollination stage in the 
eastern corn belt and if these private forecasters are right its 
going to be real real bad for corn said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago

soybean futures prices plunged tuesday on the chicago board of 
trade as a rainy forecast diluted drought fears but corn prices 
advanced on speculation that the moisture would come too late to 
prevent heavy damage to the corn crop 
wheat and oats futures prices followed the soybean market which 
saw some contracts plummet the 30centsabushel limit for daily 
trading 
on other markets cattle futures were mostly higher while pork 
futures were mostly lower energy and preciousmetals futures 
gained and stockindex futures advanced 
trading was heavy and extraordinarily volatile in the grain 
and soybean markets as players digested mondays 6to10 day 
national weather service forecast predicting abovenormal rainfall 
in key growing areas next week said victor lespinasse a trader 
for dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
after a brief opening rally across the board soybean futures 
plunged and the grains generally followed 
analysts said a return to normal precipitation patterns even 
this late in the growing season would save most of the soybean 
crop indications that a growing number of farmers in the southeast 
and southern great plains plan to plant soybeans on land cleared by 
the winter wheat harvest also weighed on soybean prices said jerry 
gidel an analyst for gh miller amp co in chicago 
the large speculative trading firms refco inc and campd 
commodities were massive sellers of both soybeans and wheat 
despite disagreement among private and government forecasters about 
the 6to10 day outlook analysts said 
but virtually all forecasters concurred on a hot dry scenario 
in the droughtstricken farm belt for the rest of this week and 
that was enough to support corn futures prices as the crop entered 
its critical pollination phase 
this week were staring down the barrel of pollination in the 
eastern corn belt areas gidel said the corn crop could 
sustain significant damage this week if the current weather 
patterns persist and even if the rain comes next week its not 
going to help the cause very much 
added lespinasse if these private forecasters are right its 
going to be real real bad for corn 
wheat settled 8 cents to 11 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 389 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents 
higher with july at 344 a bushel oats were unchanged to the 
limit 15 cents lower with july at 322 a bushel and soybeans were 
12 cents to 30 cents lower with july at 959 a bushel 
the drop in grain prices combined with a demanddriven rise in 
cash cattle prices gave most cattle futures a healthy boost on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
but hog futures finished mixed and frozen pork bellies plummeted 
their 2centsapound limit for the second consecutive session in a 
continued bearish reaction to thursdays monthly hogsandpigs 
report from the agriculture deparment analysts said 
the report showed a lot more hogs than expected and there were 
ideas well have to liquidate those hogs now because of the high 
corn prices said thomas morgan president of sterling research 
inc of arlington heights ill 
live cattle settled 53 cent lower to 110 cents higher with 
august at 6570 cents a pound feeder cattle were 78 cent to 145 
cents higher with august at 7512 cents a pound hogs were 97 cent 
lower to 58 cent higher with july at 4407 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 190 cents to 2 cents lower with july at 3325 
cents a pound 
oil futures rallied on the new york mercantile exchange but the 
market registered little reaction to the downing of an iranian 
passenger jetliner by a us navy ship in the persian gulf 
analysts said 
instead the rise in prices was primarily a technical correction 
after last weeks sharp declines said peter cardillo commodities 
trading adviser for josephthal amp co in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 16 cents 
higher with august at 1509 a barrel heating oil was 54 cent to 
60 cent higher with august at 4159 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 85 cent to 137 cents higher with august at 4972 
cents a gallon 
precious metals basically followed the oil markets higher in 
rather dull trading said richard levine vice president of the 
precious metals and foreign exchange group for elders futures inc 
in new york 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 70 cents to 120 
higher with august at 44030 a troy ounce silver was 6 cents to 
66 cents higher with july at 6766 a troy ounce

dennis b levine the former investment banker 
whose squealings led to wall streets biggest insider trading 
scandal was freed from prison tuesday and transferred to a 
workfurlough program 
kenneth treon a counselor at the lewisburg federal prison camp 
in lewisburg pa where levine had been confined since april 1987 
said by telephone that a relative of levines picked him up tuesday 
morning for the drive to new york about 150 miles to the east 
he had a clear conduct record treon said he had no 
violations of institution rules or records he did what he was 
told 
treon said levine who is in the midst of a twoyear prison 
term was released under a halfwayhouse program for inmates within 
six months of their parole date he said the program enables a 
man to enter back into society by assisting them with possible job 
opportunities 
unescorted by guards levine left to go to a halfway house for 
federal inmates in the new york area said kathryn morse a bureau 
of prisons spokeswoman in washington she declined to identify the 
facility until wednesday after levine had reported there in 
accordance with federal rules 
levines attorney martin flumenbaum also declined to identify 
the facility except to say it was in new york he also declined to 
speculate on what type of work levine hoped to do 
formerly a mergers specialist at the investment firm drexel 
burnham lambert inc levine was arrested in may 1986 after the 
securities and exchange commission accused him of making 126 
million in profits through illegal trading on inside information 
levine was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of 
securities fraud tax evasion and perjury he is eligible for 
parole beginning this september 
whatever work levine does it will not be related to wall 
street under an sec order against him spokesman chiles larson 
said levine is barred from any participation in any form of the 
securities business in any capacity 
it was levines cooperation with federal authorities that led 
them to wall street speculator ivan f boesky who used sensitive 
information provided by levine to profit on insider trading himself 
boesky paid the sec a record 100 million in illicit insider 
trading profits and penalties in november 1986 he is now serving a 
threeyear federal prison term for conspiracy to lie to the sec 
both men provided extensive information to prosecutors and 
implicated other securities professionals in a widespread insider 
trading scandal that jolted wall street and raised a clamor about 
ethics in the financial world 
last month boesky was temporarily transferred from a prison 
camp in lompoc calif to a new york correctional facility john 
veltri lompocs assistant superintendent said boesky had been 
returned to lompoc last friday 
boeskys presence in new york raised speculation he was 
testifying before a federal grand jury about john mulheren a stock 
trader arrested in february on charges he intended to kill boesky 
for implicating him in the scandal 
under federal speedytrial rules mulheren had a right to an 
indictment by tuesday unless he granted prosecutor requests for 
more time thomas puccio mulherens attorney said he agreed on 
tuesday to a threeweek extension

bond prices declined in quiet activity tuesday 
as traders returned from the threeday holiday weekend without any 
strong conviction about the markets direction 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond lost about point 
or 5 for every 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate 
trends rose to 887 percent from 883 percent late friday 
the financial markets were closed on monday in observance of 
independence day 
analysts said many investors remained on the sidelines in 
anticipation of fridays unemployment report for june 
theres no reason to do anything said maria ramirez a 
managing director of drexel burnham lambert inc the markets 
losing a sense of direction people dont know what to focus on 
a weaker dollar on world currency markets and a recent 
purchasing managers report showing continued economic growth 
brought a negative tone to the market analysts said but 
nothing really jumps out at you said mitchell held chief 
economist for smith barney harris upham amp co 
signs of a strong economy are considered bearish for 
bondholders who worry about increased inflation and rising 
interest rates 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues declined by between 116 point and 732 point 
according to figures provided by telerate inc a business 
information service intermediate maturities fell by between 732 
point and point and 20year issues dropped 716 point 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer stood at 115211 down 254 the merrill

the stock market climbed tuesday to its highest 
levels since the october crash in moderate postholiday trading 
driven by futuresrelated buying 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials gained 2703 points to 
finish at 215861 its highest postcrash level since it closed at 
215220 on june 22 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
939 issues up 520 down and 447 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse totaled 17179 million shares 
down from 23833 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
19891 million shares 
a weaker dollar lower bond prices and the us navys downing 
of an iranian passenger jet over the weekend had convinced many 
traders that the stage was set for a selloff 
a man of common sense would say we were due for continued 
profittaking said hugh johnson senior vice president at first 
albany corp 
but while the market did open moderately lower the dow average 
moved into plus territory around midday and steadily climbed for 
the rest of the session 
the main impetus behind the lift in the dow was buy programs 
by arbitrageurs said alfred goldman director of technical 
market analysis at ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
he was referring to a strategy which utilizes computers to 
automatically buy stocks in new york and sell equivalent 
stockindex futures in chicago to profit from price discrepancies 
the dow average also got a solid boost from a sharply higher oil 
sector chevron was up 2 at 47 exxon was up 1 at 45 and texaco 
was up at 47 each is a component of the key index 
charles jensen chief technical analyst at mki securities corp 
said stocks are continuing to gather a following because people 
are realizing theyre not going down when bonds are off 
investors have to jump aboard despite the action in the bond 
market 
money managers who are realigning their portfolios as the third 
quarter gets underway are keying in on equities 
there are lots of institutions that underperformed in the 
second quarter because they didnt own stocks and they came into 
this quarter under a little pressure to own equities johnson 
said 
with the stock market closed monday for the independence day 
holiday this session marked the first opportunity traders had to 
react to the navys attack on an iranian passenger plane but 
analysts said the incident was largely overlooked 
it appears that the market is suggesting that this event as 
tragic as it is will pass johnson said fundamentally analysts 
say oil prices remain on the decline 
among actively traded big board issues ibm was up 2 at 129 
general electric was up at 44 and atampt was up at 27

cnw corp threatened tuesday to eliminate 1200 
railroad jobs and risk a strike affecting 40000 chicagoarea 
commuters unless it gets substantial union contract concessions 
beyond those proposed by a presidential board aiming to avert a 
strike 
but the leader of the united transportation union called the 
announcement a ploy and said the union had no plans to meet with 
the company to discuss the job cuts which would take effect aug 4 
a threemember emergency board appointed by order of president 
reagan under the railway labor act to head off a threatened strike 
has recommended a nonbinding compromise that would allow cnws 
railroad subsidiary the chicago amp north western transportation 
co to eliminate nearly 700 jobs 
further job reductions would be decided on a casebycase basis 
under the recommendation made friday 
but chicagobased cnw expressed disappointment tuesday in the 
panels suggestion saying it does not go far enough toward 
solving the problem of archaic work rules that require the north 
western to retain obselete unproductive brakeman jobs 
if the recommendation were accepted the north western would 
still be required to retain approximately 500 brakeman jobs which 
no longer have any function and would spend approximately 25 
million each year for unproductive labor costs the company said 
in a statement 
cnws plan to eliminate virtually all the brakeman jobs on its 
freight trains cutting the crew size from four to two workers in 
most cases would save the company 53 million a year said 
spokesman fred bloedorn 
bloedorn said technological advances of the past 100 years have 
eliminated many of the brakemans traditional duties 
but the union contends elimination of the jobs would violate its 
contract and insists that no cuts be made 
although the proposed job reductions apply only to cnws freight 
lines both the union and railroad said a strike would halt 
commuter service 
cnw said it expected to meet with the union within the next few 
days under the auspices of the national mediation board but unless 
the utu offers concessions substantially beyond the emergency 
boards recommendation the company said it would implement its 
jobreduction plan on aug 4 immediately after the end of a 30day 
coolingoff period 
as far as im concerned thats just a ploy by the carrier

tropicana products inc has sued the 
cocacola co over labeling and advertising claims for its 
premium choice pasteurized minute maid orange juice 
tropicana contends the description on the side panel of the 
minute maid container and ads depicting the juice as 100 percent 
pure florida orange juice straight from the orange are false and 
deceptive under an appellate ruling in a 6yearold case 
a cocacola spokeswoman responded that the 1982 case involving a 
tropicana television commercial and the new suit are not comparable 
tropicana filed the lawsuit friday in us district court in new 
york said martin gutfreund a tropicana vice president 
tropicana maintains its competitor violates the federal appeals 
court decision governing advertising of pasteurized orange juice 
minute maid seems to us to have willfully disregarded the very 
rule of law that was established in their own lawsuit gutfreund 
said tuesday 
cocacola established in a 1982 case against tropicana that no 
processor could claim pasteurized orange juice was juice as it 
comes from the orange gutfreund said 
cocacola has been served with a copy of the suit and a 
showcause hearing has been set monday said michelle beale 
cocacola foods vice president of public affairs in houston 
we think tropicana is making a mountain out of a molehill 
she said tuesday night in a telephone interview basically we 
think the 1982 lawsuit was materially different that was a 
challenge to an entire commercial what they have done now is pick 
out a phrase on a package

south korea would allow individuals to 
buy up to 1 million worth of overseas real estate under a 
government draft plan that drastically would ease current 
restrictions on such purchases officials said wednesday

measures the purchases would be subject to the bank of koreas 
approval and would apply to houses land and other real estate 
the ministry officials said the measures were expected to go 
into effect later this month following revisions to foreign 
exchange control regulations 
they said the new measures were intended to spur investment 
abroad and trim the countrys sizable current account surplus in a 
bid to avoid friction with the united states and other countries 
which run trade deficits with south korea 
south koreas current account surplus reached 98 billion last 
year and is projected to hit the 10 billion mark this year unless 
steps are taken to hold it down 
they said business corporations would be exempt from any 
government control in purchasing up to 1 million in real estate 
overseas but would need the central banks approval for purchase of 
more than 1 million 
however both individual and corporate investors would be banned 
from buying luxurious villas in famous world resort areas the 
ministry officials said 
under the new measures the scope of corporate purchase now 
limited to businessrelated property such as offices warehouses 
parking lots and exhibit halls would be expanded to include 
houses welfare facilities forest land and other real estate the 
officials said 
south koreas overall direct investment overseas aggregated to 
103 billion at the end of 1987
