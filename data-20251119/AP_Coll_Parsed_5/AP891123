the space shuttle discoverys fiery 
thanksgiving eve ascent lit up the night sky providing a 
spectacular view over a large portion of florida but cloud cover 
obscured the visibility for the rest of the southeast 
it was 100 times brighter than a star said glenna milberg 
a producerreporter at wsvntv in miami 200 miles to the south 
it was a real pretty orange against the blue black sky 
it looked like a roman candle over the citys biscayne bay 
she said 
the captain of the cruise ship mardi gras at sea close to 
freeport in the bahamas described the liftoff as like lightning 
on the horizon 
first came the bright light capt angelo sornari said in a 
telephone call to the associated press then the line of fire 
that rose up 
he said he could see the shuttle tail of fire for 1 to two 
minutes from the bridge 
as the shuttle roared toward the heavens people at the launch 
site could see it for more than 600 miles 
it was gorgeous it was a bright bright orangey sky said 
dorothy flores of winter park 
tampa tribune editor ecton theriot watching from 150 miles 
away described the fire ball visible from the gulf coast as 
about the width of a full moon 
i thought it was pretty impressive that it was as bright as it 
was considering the distance he said 
the last night launch was of the space shuttle atlantis on nov 
26 1985 when its bright orange tail could be seen to the west in 
tampa and st petersburg south to key west and north to 
charleston sc about 300 miles north of cape canaveral 
clouds prevented such a view wednesday 
viewers in jacksonville about 150 miles north of cape 
canaveral also were disappointed 
it was too cloudy everyone ran out to the parking lot but we 
couldnt see a thing said francis x donnelly a reporter for 
the florida timesunion 
in nearby titusville wednesday night church services were 
halted as parishoners poured out of the buildings to watch the 
liftoff an estimated 40000 to 50000 visitors watched the rising 
fireball said jerry eads assistant titusville police chief

korean air has been ordered to suspend 
its flight service to tripoli for two months in connection with the 
july crash of one of its dc10s in the libyan capital the 
government said today 
officials said the action followed the transport ministrys 
conclusion after months of investigation that pilot error caused 
the crash in which 74 people aboard and six on the ground were 
killed 
they said the suspension order effective jan 1 was final and 
irrevocable and that the south korean flag carrier had accepted the 
order 
the seoultripoli route via saudi arabias jiddah was opened in 
1981 mainly to carry south korean construction workers to and from 
africa and the middle east where south korean contractors are 
engaged in many projects 
kal officials declined to discuss business losses from the 
twomonth suspension of the onceaweek flight service 
the ministry revoked the licenses of the planes pilot copilot 
and flight engineer and filed a criminal complaint with government 
prosecutors against the three ministry officials said the three 
survived the crash 
they said the flight crew could face murder and negligence 
charges if the criminal inquiry concludes they were at fault 
the koreran air jetliner reportedly crashed short of the runway 
while attempting to land at the fogshrouded tripoli airport

more americans now believe the soviet union is 
a force for peace than a threat to peace and most believe the cold 
war is ending according to a new poll 
results of a random sample of 1007 adults in the washington 
postabc news poll reported in thursday editions of the newspaper 
showed 46 percent responding that the soviet union is more a force 
for peace than it is a threat while 38 percent answered in the 
reverse 
when the same question was asked in 1983 90 percent said the 
soviet union was more of a threat to peace 
fiftyeight percent of respondents in the latest survey thought 
the cold war is coming to an end 64 percent of the men and but 
only 52 percent of the women 
the sample divided though over whether this meant the 
possibility of major reductions in defense spending without harm to 
national security 50 percent said yes 45 percent said no 
though the report did not give a margin for error a standard 
statistical calculation shows it is likely to be slightly more than 
plus or minus three percentage points 
a big majority was said to favor aid to poland hungary and 
east germany though no figure was given and seven in 10 
favored the reunification of germany 
of several possible reasons for the decline of communism about 
six out of 10 said the fact that the soviet system was not 
working was a major reason and 43 percent said it was the single 
most important reason 
slightly less than a third said the tough antisoviet policies 
of the reagan administration were a major reason for changes in the 
soviet bloc and only 14 percent believe the changes are coming 
about because reagan forced them to change

us army green berets sprinted 
across the pool deck of a luxury hotel to freedom wednesday ending 
a 28hour siege that began when leftist guerrillas seized the 
building in their latest offensive 
late wednesday the rebels reiterated that they were willing to 
participate in a ceasefire in fighting that began 11 days earlier 
providing the first steps toward fundmental political social and 
economic reform be made they also demanded international 
verification 
there was no immediate reaction from el salvadors rightwing 
government 
on wednesday morning the us soldiers carrying their luggage 
rifles and grenades ran from the hotel when the rebels apparently 
abandoned it waiting police pickup trucks then sped off with them 
inside 
the raid on the el salvador sheraton hotel began before dawn 
tuesday as part of a larger attack on the capitals wealthiest 
neighborhood numerous foreign guests including the chief of the 
organization of american states were evacuated but the green 
berets remained until wednesday morning 
president bush said wednesday an elite army unit liberated the 
hotel but the administration said later the special unit never 
entered the building 
reporters who spent the morning with the soldiers saw no special 
operation although security was heavy around the hotel and 
included a few us soldiers 
us ambassador william walker said 12 green berets and three 
civilians were trapped inside the hotel overnight 
the el salvador sheraton is not now part of the usbased chain 
union chief felix blanco secretarygeneral of the 40000 
salvadoran workers central asked the nations guerrillas on 
wednesday to forget the armed struggle saying the war impeded 
economic progress for the common people 
blanco spoke in caracas venezuela where he was attending a 
world labor conference and where president carlos andres perez was 
preparing to meet salvadoran guerrilla leaders on thursday to try 
to stop the fighting 
perez has scheduled talks with representatives of the farabundo 
marti national liberation front or fmln the coalition of 
guerrilla armies in el salvador 
the fmln late wednesday expressed its immediate acceptance 
of a truce that if agreed would be monitored by un 
peacekeepers the communique was mainly a reiteration of the 
rebels negotiating position during two sessions of peace talks 
earlier this year that had ended in deadlock 
however it also indicated that the rebels renewed their demand 
to negotiate directly with the armed forces they had earlier given 
up their insistence of an armed forces presence on the government 
delegation saying the move was a concession indicating flexibility 
the green berets told reporters before leaving that they never 
considered themselves hostages although they barricaded themselves 
behind mattresses they said they never exchanged fire with the 
guerrillas 
walker and bush said the salvadoran government negotiated for 
the soldiers release but the green berets said most of the rebel 
assault force simply walked out of the building at dusk tuesday 
the hotel facade was sprayed with thousands of bullets two 
salvadoran bodyguards of oas chief joao baena soares were killed 
were all ok we got some sleep during the night but there 
was sporadic firing said one us soldier 
all the guerrillas had abandoned the building by dawn although 
isolated shots indicated a lone rebel sniper may have remained in 
the area after daybreak 
the soldiers dressed in sneakers jeans and sport shirts or 
tshirts waited three more hours to make their dash 
the green berets declined to give their names but confirmed they 
were from fort bragg nc and were in el salvador on a 13day 
training mission 
us advisers who spend less than two weeks here are not counted 
in the 55trooper limit on military advisers set by congress 
the raid was the latest act of an 11day offensive by the fmln 
the day broke without heavy gunfire or air attacks for the first 
time since nov 11 at least 1000 people have been killed in the 
offensive 
guerrilla chiefs said tuesday in escalon the objective was to 
take control of the zone around the hotel as a demonstration of 
strength to baena soares who was in el salvador on a peace mission 
the guerrilla assault began at 4 am 5 am est tuesday when 
at least 100 rebels entered the western neighborhood of escalon 
they established tentative control around the sheraton but 
government troops backed by tanks surrounded the area 
that frustrated a guerrilla plan for facundo guardado a top 
rebel army leader to meet personally with baena soares guerrilla 
leaders said 
baena soares a brazilian was trapped for hours before being 
evacuated by an armored personnel carrier he then flew to 
washington 
the guerrilla action besides bringing the war to the front 
doors of the rich and partially destroying a fourstar hotel 
appeared to achieve little 
the capital was almost completely quiet wednesday and reports of 
calm from the provinces indicated the escalon assault might have 
been the offensives last gasp 
gregorio rosa chavez the auxiliary roman catholic bishop of san 
salvador said a church delegation would meet with president 
alfredo cristiani and with guerrillas in mediation efforts 
more than 71000 people mostly civilians have died in the 
civil war

it was a real mickey mouse election this 
year in buffalo 
the cartoon character picked up seven votes in the nov 7 
election for mayor according to erie county board of election 
workers who were tallying the final writein votes this week 
mickey also got votes in other races including city common 
council erie county leglislature buffalo city court and family 
court 
also gathering votes in the mayoral race were fellow disney 
characters donald duck and goofy as well as daffy duck pee wee 
herman bullwinkle the moose and bill the cat a character from the 
former cartoon strip bloom county 
none garnered enough votes to deny incumbent mayor james d 
griffin another term though griffin rolled to an easy victory 
with the backing of the democratic republican conservative and 
right to life parties 
the fact that he had no real opposition apparently accounted for 
an unusually high number of frivolous writein votes election 
officials said 
deadhead a radio persona adopted by local disc jockey danny 
neaverth gathered 82 writein votes for mayor everybody else 
gathered two votes 
three voters wrote in judge joseph wapner of televisions 
peoples court for city judge 
even zsa zsa gabor got one writein vote for county sheriff 
sheriff thomas higgins ran unopposed 
the jokes were lost on deputy elections commissioner theodore 
filosofos who mentioned that two recent races were decided by one 
vote 
we spend about 4 million a year in this office to register 
everyone keep track of their addresses and polling places and 
record their votes he said they think its a joke they 
squander their vote these votes are just wasted we dont count 
them

space shuttle discovery blasted off 
on a secret military mission wednesday night staging a brilliant 
thanksgivingeve fireworks show as it rode twin 700foot geysers of 
fire into orbit 
we are delighted with the results said forrest mccartney 
director of the kennedy space center its something that 
americans can be proud and thankful for on thanksgiving 
as the shuttle completed its second circuit around earth 
mission control gave a twosentence status report 
the crew of discovery has been given a go for orbit 
operations the orbiter and crew are doing well said spokeswoman 
billie deason it meant the astronauts had been given permission to 
launch their secret cargo reportedly a spy satellite to be 
released in the 10th hour of flight 
the shuttle lifted almost straight up and headed out over the 
atlantic ocean its booster rocket fire carving two trails in the 
sky the light could be seen in miami 200 miles to the south 
it was 100 times brighter than a star said glenna milberg 
a television reporter in miami 
nothing was heard over the public communications channel from 
col frederick d gregory the shuttle commander nasa provided 
launch commentary until discovery reached orbit nine minutes after 
launch and then the system went silent 
liftoff of space shuttle discovery for its thanksgiving day 
flight said launch controls george diller indeed the 
astronauts were carrying five meals of turkey and gravy in their 
food locker 
night turned into day over the central florida coast as 
discovery flashed to life with a light twice as brilliant as the 
sun the sky was cloudless the sight dazzling 
liftoff occurred at 723 pm after a blackedout countdown made 
public just minutes before launch 
at two minutes after liftoff the spent booster rockets fell 
off ships were waiting below to recover them 
the shuttle still was visible at the launch center as a very 
bright star in the sky even when it was more than 650 miles away 
and traveling about 6800 mph 
as the 100ton spacecraft rocketed away the ground a the space 
center shook and windows rattled clouds of steam billowed out of 
the flame trenches below the shuttle as 100000 gallons of water a 
minute poured out to douse the fire 
discoverys mission is to put a spy satellite into orbit but 
the air force gave no details nasa was under instructions to say 
nothing further about the mission except to give advance landing 
notice 
the exact schedule like everything else about this 32nd shuttle 
mission was secret 
this was the third night launch in the shuttle program and only 
the fourth in 28 years of manned space flight discoverys 
timetable was dictated by the cargo and its mission 
sources said the 2ton 300 million satellite cradled in 
discoverys cargo bay is capable of listening in on military and 
diplomatic communications voice and telemetry broadcast from 
soviet military installations the satellites duty post is to be 
22300 miles over the equator with lineofsight to the soviet 
union china the middle east africa and all of europe

on the last launch after dark the fiery trail of the shuttles 
two solid rocket boosters could be seen along a 700mile strip from 
charleston sc to key west fla and in the bahamas 
police in nearby titusville prepared for about 50000 people to 
gather at prime viewing sites only a fraction of the crowds that 
lined the roads for the early launches but more than for other 
liftoffs in recent months 
the flight was the fifth turned over entirely to the defense 
department 
it is also only the third launch after dark a timetable 
dictated by the cargo and its mission 
in late morning national aeronautics and space administration 
crews turned valves to send 528000 gallons of supercold liquid 
hydrogen and liquid oxygen surging into discoverys propellant 
tank a threehour procedure during which the launch pad area is 
cleared of people 
when that was completed about 1 pm the countdown entered a 
twohour planned hold and an inspection team went to the pad to 
check for ice buildup on the fuel tank chunks of ice breaking away 
during launch could damage the orbiters fragile surface 
the astronaut crew of four men and one woman slept past noon to 
adjust to the mission schedule their flight is expected to last 
four days but nasa wont announce the landing at edwards air force 
base in california until 24 hours before its due to happen

manley sonny carter jr and kathryn c thornton 
military officials say the secrecy is necessary to make it more 
difficult for soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off 
cape canaveral to track the shuttle 
critics argue that soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly 
already know a great deal about the mission and that once discovery 
is in orbit they will be able to track it precisely and know what 
is doing 
the menu for the mission includes thermostabilized turkey 
and gravy which means the food has enough preservatives to be 
carried without refrigeration

an undersea photographer is a step closer to 
becoming the first person in 10 years to dive to the wreck of the 
monitor the ironclad civil war ship thanks to a decision by a 
federal official 
the government stonewalled and exaggerated safety concerns 
in denying diver gary gentiles request to examine the shipwreck 
off the north carolina coast said commerce department 
administrative law judge hugh j dolan 
dolan recommended that the government reconsider its decision 
rejecting on safety grounds gentiles applications for diving 
permits to photograph the historic ship 
dolans opinion this week gives the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration 15 days to uphold my decision or do 
what they want to with it the judge said in an interview on 
wednesday 
gentiles attorney peter hess called the decision a decisive 
victory on behalf of public access to public property gentile is 
a philadelphia writer and undersea photographer 
calls to noaa were referred to spokesman dane konop who was on 
leave wednesday and unavailable for comment 
the ironclad monitor sank in a gale off the north carolina coast 
after a celebrated battle with the confederate ship merrimack 127 
years ago noaas refusal to allow anyone to dive to the monitors 
watery grave for the last 10 years has angered divers who believe 
the ship is on the verge of collapsing 
gentile 43 has filed 11 permit applications and written more 
than 50 letters to noaa in his quest to photograph the monitor 
which he calls americas most famous shipwreck 
gentile said in a brief filed with dolan recently that he was a 
victim of intransigence and delaying tactics by noaa and that 
the agency had ignored his record as one of the most experienced 
and skilled stage decompression scuba divers in the nation 
stage decompression dives are made on compressed air because of 
depth they require divers to interrupt their ascent to allow 
nitrogen to leave the bloodstream without forming incapacitating 
bubbles 
the monitor is about 220 feet below the surface a depth that 
noaa says poses a serious and unreasonable risk noaas concern 
is based partly on tricky currents and weather and on the 
knowledge that at certain depths nitrogen in the breathing air can 
impede divers motor skills 
but dolan said it appears that a significant number of 
trained scuba divers frequently penetrate to depths at and in 
excess of 220 feet there is certainly an element of increased 
risk but not to the extent that restrictions on personal activity 
can be justified 
he said the problem of nitrogencaused lack of concentration 
is unduly exaggerated by the agency and contrary to the 
experience of the scuba diving community as reflected in the 
record 
dolan also said that noaa failed to properly apply its own 
criteria and that the agency was slow to make decisions on 
gentiles requests 
the last time noaa granted permission to examine the monitor was 
in 1979 when it allowed a dive by french explorer jacques 
cousteaus party but the visibility was poor and little or no 
usable footage was produced 
dolan said cousteaus application was handled differently than 
gentiles by noaa while he dolan was stonewalled cousteau was 
encouraged the judge said

nasa has pulled the plug on the 
venerable solar maximum satellite jettisoning the antenna and 
rendering the spacecraft mute 
solar max has been getting scientific information about the sun 
for nearly 10 years but the fuel that has kept it out of the pull 
of earths atmosphere is running out the satellite is expected to 
make its fiery plunge back to earth about nov 29 
the national aeronautics and space administration said the 
satellite was at an altitude of 1661 miles wednesday a 40mile 
drop from its oct 31 position and the rate of descent is 
accelerating 
technicians sent a signal on wednesday to blow off the 
satellites highgain antenna as an engineering test to determine 
if the system dormant for 95 years still operated nasa said 
without the antenna the spacecraft cant communicate with 
another satellite overhead although three of its seven instruments 
continue to take data that can be retrieved when solar max passes 
over ground stations 
the final engineering exercise the jettisoning of smms solar 
panels will be conducted when officials conclude that science 
operations should cease nasa said it is estimated that this 
exercise will be performed within the next couple of days

oliver north urging the reversal of his 
irancontra convictions says the judge in his trial inexplicably 
failed to require proof that his case was untainted by his 
immunized testimony to congress 
in court papers filed wednesday norths lawyers say he was 
prosecuted in stunning disregard for his fifth amendment rights 
norths six days of compelled testimony were carried live 
and reprinted with pearl harbor headlines said the court 
papers 
a 1972 supreme court ruling prohibits prosecutors from using 
immunized testimony 
under that ruling the prosecution must systematically 
establish an independent source for each and every item of evidence 
which may have been considered by the indicting grand jury said 
north quoting a 1985 appeals court case 
the 70page brief and nine volumes of supporting material were 
submitted in support of norths appeal made in july 
us district court judge gerhard gesell inexplicably failed 
to require independent counsel lawrence walsh to make a showing 
that the information in the north prosecution came independently of 
norths congressional testimony said his lawyers 
the court was required to make a witnessbywitness 
itembyitem showing that testimony hadnt been derived from 
norths immunized statements to congress 
all gesell did said north was to conduct a pretrial hearing 
to ensure that prosecutors werent exposed to immunized testimony 
gesell apparently concluded that warnings to the witnesses 
not to testify to anything learned from norths immunized 
testimony would suffice said the court papers 
north was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress destroying government documents and accepting an illegal 
gratuity the former marine was at the heart of the reagan 
administrations effort to arm the nicaraguan rebels during a 
congressional ban on us military aid to the contras 
in seeking to have his convictions overturned norths lawyers 
also said gesell erred when he 
quashed a defense subpoena seeking to compel expresident 
reagan to testify at norths trial 
refused to give any jury instruction concerning authorization 
by reagan administration higherups of his activities for which he 
later was charged with crimes 
norths lawyers also said gesell shouldnt have excluded 
videotaped portions of congressional testimony by former national 
security adviser john poindexter norths boss 
north was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to 
perform 1200 hours of community service in addition to a 150000 
fine

if this nations leftist 
guerrillas were trying to make a point by assaulting one of its 
wealthiest neighborhoods seizing part of a luxury hotel for day 
they succeeded 
theyve proved they can hit where they want to when they want 
to said eduardo luis quiroz an insurance salesman whose 
comfortable home is overlooked by the hotel 
quiroz an insurance executive who used to work as an explosives 
expert for dupont inc pointed to ceilings and furniture shattered 
by two hand grenades and said he had been held at gunpoint by the 
guerrillas 
they said they wouldnt hurt any of us they threw the 
grenades because they thought there was a sniper on the roof 
said one of quiroz maids ana francisca perez 
she quiroz and another maid had been working all day to clear 
shattered china pieces of a garden trellis and other debris after 
the guerrilla attack on escalon ended wednesday morning 
about 150 guerrillas had come up through a nearby ravine before 
dawn tuesday occupying parts of the neighborhood and the vip tower 
of the luxury hotel where at least eight us green berets were 
trapped for 28 hours 
escalon climbs a hillside near the san salvador volcano in the 
citys northwest most homes are large and beautiful with fourcar 
garages and gardens of bougainvillea roses and white porcelana 
but they are also surrounded by stone walls topped with reels of 
razorsharp concertina wire 
throughout the neighborhood there were signs of combat downed 
tree limbs and electric wires windows blown out burned cars but 
it hardly equaled the destruction in poorer neighborhoods where 
fighting raged for most of the rebel farabundo marti national 
liberation fronts 11day offensive 
still the neighborhood was shaken 
some people are talking about forming a neighborhood defense 
committee said alfredo martinez moreno a lawyer who was el 
salvadors foreign minister in 196768 and and head of the supreme 
court until 1972 
it would have to be wellcontrolled because people might think 
its a death squad he said 
he noted that such committees had been banned under the 
government of jose napoleon duarte who gave way to president 
alfredo cristiani on june 1 
martinez moreno said a neighbors house had been shot up and 
bombed by guerrillas who discovered literature supporting arena 
cristianis rightwing party which has been linked in the past to 
death squads 
he said he was in washington but flew back when tuesdays attack 
began worried that his home would be bombed as poorer 
neighborhoods were he knew who to call 
im not political any more but i know cristiani and i asked 
him if they were going to bomb us he said 
cristiani asked for his address moreno said then called back 
and said there would be no bombardment 
asked wednesday why escalon had not been hit cristiani told 
reporters that air force policy is to strike only when guerrilla 
concentrations are isolated with little danger to civilians 
the neighborhood where they dig in has nothing to do with the 
response said cristiani noting that the escalon fighting was 
less severe and briefer than elsewhere 
martinez mancera said that his telephones were out too but he 
called the president of the telephone company 
theyll be fixed tomorrow he said he was told 
quiroz who said he served in the us army and was wounded in 
the korean war didnt think much of the salvadoran armys 
performance 
they should have known their intelligence failed the 
guerrillas come down the ravine from the volcano its like playing 
billiards the 8ball in the corner pocket obvious he said 
rafael rivera another neighbor said he heard guerrillas 
enjoying the power of their guns yelling i love that car 
before shooting it up 
the guerrillas set other cars on fire and torched part of an 
exclusive country club nearby 
neighbors gave patrolling salvadoran soldiers packs of 
cigarettes and other gifts quiroz brought out a motheaten olive 
army scarf he had worn in korea and gave it to a sergeant 
he picked up 31 m16 cartridges 10 ak47 cartridges and 7 
dragunov sniper rifle cartridges and arranged them on the curb 
outside his house 
people are still shaking around here he said

east germanys historic decision to 
open its borders last month has failed to halt the stream of 
citizens heading west to live with more than 40000 arriving since 
travel restrictions were lifted 
millions of east germans have crossed as tourists into west 
germany since nov 9 taking advantage of their new freedom to see 
the longforbidden west and buy goods not available at home 
as of wednesday nearly 11 million east german citizens had 
received visas to travel to the west east germany has a population 
of 165 million 
but the stream of east germans crossing into west germany with 
the intention of staying has not stopped despite east germanys 
promises of political and economic reforms 
east germany granted free travel to assauge growing public 
unrest and the tens of thousands of its citizens fleeing across the 
borders more than 200000 have fled permanently this year many of 
them young skilled workers including doctors and teachers 
the federal interior ministry said wednesday that within the 
previous 24 hours 1694 east german resettlers had arrived in west 
germany 
since east germany opened its borders on nov 9 about 44000 
east germans have arrived as permanent residents the ministry said 
the continuing stream of resettlers indicates continuing 
pessimism that conditions especially economic ones in east 
germany will be dramatically changing for the better anytime soon 
nonetheless the stream of east germans coming as tourists is 
far greater 
more than half a million east german tourists crossed into west 
germany and west berlin on tuesday crowding downtown streets and 
jamming into stores 
but it was an official holiday in the west on wednesday and 
border police said the stream had ebbed considerably something 
over 10000 banks that hand out 100 marks 55 in free 
governmentdonated welcome money as well as most stores were 
closed for the day 
i have not seen it this quiet in 14 days our colleagues with 
the gdr german democratic republic border guards are finally 
getting a breather said wolfgant schlee spokesman for the 
bavarian border police in munich 
the influxes of east german tourists have caused huge traffic 
backups at east german border crossings as the travelers line up to 
cross into the west in their sputtering trabant and wartburg sedans 
west berlin police said streets there were also quieter 
but travel from west berlin to east berlin has increased 
many people wanted to use the holiday to have a look at the eastern 
side said a west berlin police spokesman who did not give his 
name 
the open borders also have fueled the east german black market 
the communist government on wednesday announced a ban on the 
removal of antiques and consumer goods that might be sold abroad 
the antismuggling effort was announced late wednesday by east 
germanys official adn news agency which gave no details of the 
restrictions except to say that they were effective immediately 
both government and opposition forces have called for more 
stringent customs controls to prevent east germans from taking 
their valuables to the west and selling them for hard currency

the current system of financing congressional 
campaigns is demeaning to everybody and should be replaced at 
least in part by publicly financed races senate majority leader 
george mitchell says 
while avoiding direct comment on the ethics problems of five 
senate colleagues mitchell said merely questioning lawmakers 
standard of conduct is insufficient 
there isnt any clearly established line on what services a 
senator should or should not provide to constituents and political 
donors the maine democrat told reporters during an endofsession 
interview wednesday 
mitchell was questioned in connection with an ethics committee 
probe into five senators intervention with federal regulators on 
behalf of lincoln savings and loan association lincolns collapse 
is expected to become the nations largest sampl failure at a cost of 
up to 25 billion 
the five sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and donald w 
riegle jr dmich received or solicited a total of 13 million 
in political contributions from lincolns owner phoenix 
millionaire charles h keating jr 
all five have told the ethics committee they violated no laws or 
senate rules and have denied charges that their meetings in april 
1987 with regulators on behalf of lincoln were improper 
mitchell said all lawmakers are vulnerable to accusations of 
conflict of interest because they can be seen as beholden to people 
who helped them get elected he said he plans to push early next 
year for a review of senate ethical guidelines which he said are 
more vague than those in the house 
but he also said focusing solely on ethics rules is treating 
the symptom not the cause 
we have to change the method the system by which we elect 
public officials in our society and by which we finance and conduct 
campaigns he said in doing so mitchell restated his past call 
for public financing of congressional campaigns 
mitchell said there is builtin conflict because members of the 
house and senate know theyre expected to bring home the bacon 
for their constituents whether it involves saving a military base 
or getting a new federal building opened 
but he said he was not optimistic about the prospects of 
achieving major campaign finance changes when the 101st congress 
convenes for its second session jan 23 
this system is demeaning for everybody its not a good system 
the republicans have got a big advantage and they dont want to 
give up that advantage he said thats the single direct fact 
i think it really is in their interest to change it 
mitchell was referring to the republican partys historical 
ability to eclipse the democrats in raising money from the 
wealthiest donors 
the fact of the matter is that voters like and reward in the 
form of approval at the polls people who they think are 
aggressively representing them he said weve developed a 
whole colloquial language about it bring home the bacon

ralph nader is launching a campaign to repeal 
a congressional pay raise and limit members of congress to 12 years 
in office 
such governmental misbehavior and effrontery cannot 
continue nader said at a news conference wednesday the pay 
grab of november 1989 is symbolic of the government rot that is 
reaching critical mass 
nader called the bipartisan leadership agreement that allowed 
the rapid passage of the pay raise a twoparty cabal that used 
dictatorial procedural practices 
nader wants to persuade congress to reverse itself on the pay 
raise when it meets next year or barring that to generate 
opposition to members of congress who supported the raise and face 
reelection next year 
members of congress nader said already receive an adequate 
salary a lavish pension and other benefits and are in the top 1 
percent of all americans in pay 
he disputed the notion that paying more would attract more 
qualified people to government 
all it does is increases their greed nader said 
he said he also wanted a constitutional amendment to limit 
members of congress to 12 years in office saying it would reduce 
the power of legislative leaders who pushed the pay raise 
house salaries will increase from 89500 to about 125000 by 
1991 while members will be barred from collecting pay for 
speeches senate salaries would rise to about 100000 but 
senators may still take money for speeches

clement f haynsworth jr whose 
nomination to the supreme court was rejected by the senate in 1969 
because of questions about his judicial ethics and views on 
minorities has died of a heart attack at age 77 
haynsworth a semiretired federal judge died wednesday at 
home said his wife dorothy he had continued hearing cases 
parttime during the past year despite heart problems she said 
president eisenhower named haynsworth in 1957 to the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals in richmond va and he was senior judge 
there when president nixon nominated him for the supreme court seat 
left vacant by justice abe fortas resignation 
the senate judiciary committee voted 107 in favor of the 
nomination but the full senate defeated it 5545 on nov 21 1969 
former chief justice warren burger called haynsworth one of 
the outstanding judges in this country it was a great loss when he 
was not confirmed to the supreme court 
ill miss him said us sen ernest hollings dsc he 
was a special friend and one of the nations finest jurists i only 
regret that the american people were denied his exceptional talents 
on the nations highest court 
the most damaging questions about the nomination centered on 
haynsworths participation in a case involving a company that did 
extensive business with a company in which he owned a oneseventh 
interest 
in addition civil rights groups and organized labor opposed 
haynsworths nomination portraying him as insensitive to 
minorities and working people 
haynsworth later said the criticisms of his stance on racial 
issues were unfair 
what happened was we had a terrible practical problem he 
explained in 1977 you couldnt jump from complete segregation to 
complete integration in a moment the critics felt i didnt press 
forward as rapidly as they might have hoped 
when a federal building in greenville was renamed in his honor 
in may 1983 haynsworth called it a touching footnote to the 
history of 1969 
at that ceremony supreme court justice lewis f powell jr said 
the senates rejection was purely political and that 
injustice was done by the vote 
haynsworth spent 17 years as chief justice on the circuit court 
in richmond before retiring as a fulltime judge in 1981 
after taking senior status haynsworth maintained an office in 
the greenville federal building he said he wanted to step down to 
give up the business of housekeeping to have time to do the 
business of a judge 
haynsworth was graduated from furman university summa cum laude 
in 1933 and from harvard law school in 1936 he was admitted to the 
bar in 1936 and joined his familys law firm 
besides his wife haynsworth is survived by a brother harry 
haynsworth iii of greenville a sister betty taylor of columbia a 
stepson and three grandchildren a funeral was planned for friday

a top politician pays big money to a 
mystic for his election victory 
an astrologist prescribes gems to members of parliament for 
their success in the polls a wise man who walks around naked 
blesses his candidates by patting their heads with his feet 
swamis stargazers gurus and palm readers are raking it in 
during the indian election as dozens of unsure candidates seek that 
special something to catapult them to victory 
jupiter is rising said noted astrologer rn sharma as the 
voting began earlier this week that means a close fight 
after the election was called last month astrologers were 
consulted on the best time to file nomination papers the respected 
times of india newspaper reported that the release of the governing 
congress party manifesto was delayed because of astral 
considerations 
some columnists have claimed that the voting which began 
wednesday was also scheduled with the heavens in mind 
we live in unsure times says political commentator bhabani 
sen gupta all of us especially politicians are worried about 
the future a little occult often sets the mind at ease 
stargazing and palm reading in india date back to before the 
time of christ two sages parashara and bhrigu are credited with 
writing texts explaining the cosmos 
the idea of reincarnation one of the foundations of the hindu 
philosophy plays a central role in their writings the sages also 
borrowed liberally from the assyrians who flourished in southwest 
asia around the 7th century bc and are believed to have invented 
what has become the modernday horoscope 
astrology has played its role in modern indian history 
on aug 15 1947 india became independent of british rule but 
it happened at midnight not an auspicious hour fable has it that 
viceroy louis mountbatten the famed british naval officer who 
supervised the transfer of power was angered that none of his 
advisers was familiar with astrology 
over the last 25 years astrology and other soothsaying arts 
have grown in popularity especially among indias middle and upper 
classes 
commentator sen gupta reports that few of his friends and 
political colleagues are without an astrologer or a palm reader 
others visit gurus and holy men he himself journeys to a seer in 
calcutta every year 
development creates rootlessness he explains in 
traditional societies everything was so very certain you consulted 
an astrologer only for acute situations marriage or death now 
nobody knows what will happen 
the result has been fame and fortune for many a pundit a 
sanskrit word for soothsayer astrologers palmists and gurus have 
set up shop in top hotels and charge thousands of rupees hundreds 
of dollars for a session 
harvest time for indias people of the occult occurs when the 
nation votes indias lively staterun press is filled with 
predictions and politicians seek out the savants for advice on how 
to achieve victory 
lately sharma has been recommending gems 
they all need power stones sharma says of the 40 members of 
parliament he claims as his clients yellow and blue sapphires 
those are selling fast 
he says the sapphires work by harnessing the power of saturn and 
jupiter planets which play a critical role in politics 
other politicians have commissioned yogis to pray for their 
victory the indian express reported that home minister buta singh 
paid 5 million rupees about 300000 for a tantric prayer 
session or pooja 
even prime minister rajiv gandhi has reportedly visited devra 
baba a sadhu or hindu holy man the baba as he is known is a 
nudist and blesses his followers by touching their heads with the 
balls of his feet 
ben gupta sees the trend as dangerous for india 
all this black magic stuff encourages resignation and 
acceptance of ones fate he says we dont need that here we 
are poor so we must struggle 
sharma says he believes the more astrology the better the only 
change he recommends is in indias money 
we have no mention of god on our bills he says fingering a 
100 rupee note that is why america is so great every bill says 
in god we trust

the state department citing the democratic 
evolution poland and hungary will stop processing new 
applications from the countries refugees in western europe to 
resettle in the united states 
in addition officials said about 19000 of the estimated 
20000 applications already on file likely will be rejected 
because with few exceptions only those refugees with strong 
family ties in the united states will now be admitted 
the announcement was met with dismay from polishamerican and 
hungarianamerican groups as well as the roman catholic church 
even though the bush administration had served notice to congress 
weeks ago that it likely would curtail the admittance of polish and 
hungarian refugees in light of political changes in their homelands 
dawn t calabia a us catholic conference official who was 
among private leaders briefed wednesday at the white house on the 
cutback said the administration is basically saying that there 
are 19000 applicants who now dont have to be considered 
theres no question the administration is short on 
resources she said but i wonder if we sacrifice our 
principles because of resources at the very least its a very 
ungenerous policy for some of the people who have been on the 
waiting list for years 
the 20000 current applicants represent but a fraction of the 
polish and hungarian refugee population in western europe 
according to the roman catholic church there are more than 100000 
polish refugees on the continent 
even without the policy change comparatively few would have had 
a chance for imminent admittance to the united states under 
president bushs refugee ceilings for this fiscal year 
those ceilings totaling 125000 worldwide allow for 6500 
refugees from eastern europe in the current budget year and most 
of those already have gone to applicants from hungary and poland 
according to state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler she 
said that unless we change our present policy and practices we 
will be unable this year to process and admit other deserving 
applicants from such countries as bulgaria and romania 
in the last eight years 33060 poles and 5459 hungarians have 
come to the united states as refugees federal law defines a 
refugee as a person with a wellfounded fear of persecution on 
account of race religion nationality political opinion or 
membership in a particular social group 
gerald coyle acting chief of staff of the immigration and 
naturalization service told congress earlier that because of the 
democratic changes in poland and hungary most of the refugees from 
those nations are unlikely to have very substantive claims to 
us refugee status 
ms calabia acknowledged that the poles and hungarians are not 
in imminent danger as a boat person might be but these are people 
still looking to the united states for a future and they deserve a 
hearing and an interview 
moreover said ms calabia many of the refugees still have a 
wellfounded fear of the consequences of returning to their 
homelands because despite democratic change at the top the 
local communist party apparatchik is still in control in many 
areas

the white house blames initial information 
from the pentagon for president bushs statement that elite us 
troops swept a hotel in el salvador to rescue american green berets 
barricaded inside 
shortly after bush made the statement on wednesday the 
administration said the special troops never entered the hotel 
witnesses in el salvador reported the dozen green berets left 
the hotel without incident after leftist rebels who had besieged it 
apparently withdrew during the night 
bush speaking with reporters aboard air force one said a unit 
of the armys elite delta force commandos swept the hotel to make 
sure there were no remaining guerrillas or mines to harm the green 
berets but that there was no fighting thank god they didnt have 
to fire a shot he said 
bush said to reporters that hotel was liberated with finality 
from the clutches of this outrageous guerrilla attack bush was 
on his way to memphis to speak on volunteerism 
this morning the salvadoran special forces joined by us 
elements of special operations went through that hotel and i can 
tell you im very pleased that all the americans have been 
released there was no loss of life bush said 
shortly after bush spoke white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
issued a statement saying updated information showed us forces 
did not actually enter the hotel entry proved to be unnecessary 
fitzwater explained the first information from the pentagon 
was wrong he said its not a big deal anyway since the 
green berets were freed unharmed it doesnt make any difference 
whether they delta commandos went in or not 
bush said he consulted with salvadoran president alfredo 
cristiani who had not requested us help in dealing with the 
guerrillas who took over the hotel tuesday 
i told him what we were going to do and he acquiesced bush 
said 
one us official commenting on condition of anonymity said of 
the american special operations forces they were sent they were 
in position but as the operation evolved they never went into 
action the bad guys melted away and the 12 came out 
in el salvador the green berets chatted with reporters after 
leaving the hotel saying they never considered themselves hostages 
although they barricaded themselves behind mattresses they said 
they never exchanged fire with the guerrillas 
on another aspect of the situation in el salvador bush was 
asked about recent raids by the rightist government on catholic 
baptist and lutheran churches he said i would condemn it 
totally unless the church workers harbored guerrillas or 
otherwise involved themselves in the war 
the usbacked salvadoran government contends the churches 
most of which say they are merely working with the poor are 
bastions of support for the leftist farabundo marti national 
liberation front rebels 
the americans inside the salvadoran hotel were a dozen army 
green beret special forces troops who had been on a twoweek 
training mission in el salvador and were scheduled to return to the 
united states on tuesday us officials said 
the united states has provided about 35 billion to oppose the 
insurgency over the past decade but congress has forbidden us 
troops from acting in other than an advisory capacity bush said 
the troops he sent were only there to rescue americans

federal authorities rejected two airline 
passengers claim that their pilot asked passengers to vote on 
whether he should continue a flight in a storm 
the federal aviation administration has determined that the 
american airlines pilot acted properly faa spokeswoman kathleen 
bergen said wednesday 
the agency found that the decision to divert a flight from 
laguardia airport in new york city to a small airport in upstate 
new york nov 16 was made by the airline rather than at the 
passengers behest bergen said 
nobody did anything wrong bergen said the issue is 
closed 
but muriel and fred sider of suburban chicago insisted the pilot 
on flight 492 from chicago let passengers vote on where to land 
i understand instructions when i hear them and my wifes been 
a travel agent for 20 years said sider who owns an advertising 
agency i dont think we both could have misunderstood it 
the decision to land the airplane at stewart airport near 
newburgh ny was made by officials at americans headquarters in 
dallas said airline spokesman tom stack there was never any 
question raised to the passengers about the diversion he said 
once the plane landed at stewart passengers were asked to vote 
on whether they wanted to be bused into new york city or take a 
return flight to chicago stack said 
the pilot whom stack refused to identify did what he was 
supposed to do and handled himself in a professional manner he 
said 
the plane landed in a heavy rainstorm at stewart strong winds 
that day collapsed a cafeteria wall at an elementary school three 
miles from stewart killing nine pupils 
the siders version of events is quite different from that given 
by american and backed by the faa 
about an hour into the flight the pilot got on the loudspeaker 
and said that laguardia was definitely closed in but they could 
get into stewart airport and wanted a vote as to how the 
passengers felt said mrs sider 61 the stewardesses took a 
show of hands 
thats carrying democracy a touch too far said her husband 
i dont want to be involved in safety decisions

women who think they are safe from aids because 
they avoid risky sex may have a false sense of security say 
researchers who traced 11 cases of aids infection to sexual 
relations with the same man 
the women all belgians were largely welleducated and 
middleclass and averaged 2 sexual partners over a threeyear 
period but despite their seemingly low risk they caught the virus 
from a civil engineer who probably contracted it in africa 
researchers said their study emphasizes that middleclass 
women can catch the virus even though they dont have sex with 
drug addicts or bisexuals 
women who do not consider themselves at risk because they do 
not engage in what they perceive as highrisk sexual practices may 
have a false sense of security they wrote in todays new england 
journal of medicine 
doctors said the cluster of infection is the largest to be 
documented among heterosexuals since the epidemic emerged almost a 
decade ago 
in my view it is only the tip of the iceberg said dr 
nathan clumeck its probably something that will be more 
frequently described in the future among heterosexuals without 
apparent risk factors 
he and his coauthors said the spread should also serve as a 
warning to women who believe they can avoid the aids virus by 
limiting themselves to a few sexual partners 
emphasizing only sexual relations with multiple partners as a 
risk factor for women may be irrelevant and even 
counterproductive they wrote since it implies that the 
absence of multiple partners makes women safe 
clumeck a physician at st pierre university hospital in 
brussels was the reports principal author 
their detective work began in 1985 when a belgian woman in 
antwerp was found to have aidsrelated symptoms she said an 
african man was the only person from whom she could have caught the 
virus 
about the same time two other belgian women and an african 
woman in brussels were found to carry hiv the aids virus all of 
them named the same man as a possible source of their infections 
after interviewing the man who did not know he was infected 
they obtained the names of 19 women with whom he had sex over the 
previous three years 
eighteen of the women agreed to be tested and 11 turned out to 
be infected these 11 named eight other male sex partners and one 
of these men was also infected with hiv 
clumeck said the cluster is probably larger however because 
the african man said he had about 20 sexual partners a year but 
could not remember most of their names 
the man who spread the virus moved from central africa to 
belgium in 1963 but traveled frequently in parts of africa where 
the aids virus is common among heterosexuals 
he died of aidsrelated illness in 1986 among the 11 infected 
women three have aids one has preaids illness and six others 
have swollen lymph glands another symptom of infection 
in the united states particularly heterosexuals thought to 
be at risk belong mostly to iv drug users or people with contact 
with prostitutes or prostitutes themselves said clumeck the 
interesting feature of this cluster is that most of the women are 
middleclass and welleducated 
among the 19 sexual partners 12 were europeans eight were 
married none used intravenousdrugs and they said they had between 
one and four sexual partners during the previous three years two 
of those who got infected had sex just once with the african man 
it highlights the risks associated with heterosexual contact 
and in particular with the documentation of two transmissions 
after one contact the important of safer sex practices said dr 
nancy padian of the university of california san francisco 
she has documented a similar case of one man spreading the 
infection to four women

a group of japanese construction firms has agreed 
to pay the us government 326 million to settle a dispute over 
alleged bidrigging of projects at an american military base near 
tokyo us officials said today 
the us side had threatened lawsuits both in japan and the 
united states unless a settlement was reached 
representatives from seven japanese construction firms and 
american officials signed the memorandum of intent on behalf of 99 
japanese firms the us justice department said in a statement 
the memorandum stipulates that the payment be made by december 
20 according to the statement which was released by the us 
embassy 
officials from japanese companies involved in negotiations were 
not available for comment because of a national holiday in japan 
the us government alleges 140 japanese construction and 
related firms were involved in the bid rigging and the statement 
said the justice department would continue to seek damages from the 
41 not covered by the memorandum 
some executives among the 41 firms have said they should not 
have to pay compensation since they did not bid on the disputed 
sections of the project the 41 firms are expected to hold a 
separate talks with the us side 
in the negotiations the us side demanded a total of 348 
million in compensation from the 140 firms which participated in 
construction projects at the us navy base at yokosuka southwest 
of tokyo between april 1984 and september 1987 
during the period the us navy awarded 140 firms a combined 
total of 1349 million worth of orders including construction of 
a housing complex for military personnel 
the us side claimed there were improper charges and 
bidrigging in connection with the construction at the base 
in december japans fair trade commission issued warnings to 
140 japanese firms for their alleged prior consultations or 
dango in setting prices of projects undertaken at the base 
the dango system long established in japans construction 
industry is considered an anticompetitive practice that prevents 
firms outside the group including foreign firms from getting 
contracts 
in another development the us government said wednesday it 
would not impose retaliatory sanctions against japan in a trade 
dispute over the ability of american companies to compete for 
construction work in japan 
us trade representative carla hills said she determined that 
japan had made significant progress in allowing us companies 
to compete on construction jobs including allowing american 
companies to bid on five major airport projects

filtered coffee by far the favorite among us 
coffee drinkers may also be the healthiest brew for the heart a 
study says 
the research in todays new england journal of medicine found a 
strong link between rising cholesterol levels and boiled coffee a 
brewing method popular in scandinavia 
people who used this method for nine weeks had a 10 percent rise 
in their cholesterol levels which translates into a 20 percent 
increase in their risk of heart disease but when they stayed with 
filtered coffee the most popular brewing method in the united 
states their cholesterol levels remained steady 
the bottom line of the study is that it seems the way you make 
your coffee makes a large difference said dr diederick e 
grobbee of erasmus university medical school in the netherlands 
but despite the latest research the possible link between 
coffee and cholesterol remains confusing last week a report 
presented at the annual meeting of the american heart association 
by stanford university researchers concluded that decaffeinated 
coffee is the true cholesterol villain 
in a statement the national coffee association characterized 
grobbees finding as good news because it exonerates the kind of 
coffee most americans drink 
still the association conceded that there appears to be an 
association between boiled coffee and cholesterol 
about 75 percent of us coffee drinkers make filtered coffee 
they use either electric drip machines or manual filter pots 
in the study grobbee and dr annette aa bak compared this 
with boiled coffee which is made by pouring boiling water into a 
pot of ground coffee and letting it sit for 10 minutes the 
technique is similar to percolating coffee still used by 20 
percent of us coffee drinkers 
grobbee said that the latest findings raise concerns that 
percolators might also have a bad effect on cholesterol 
without having tested the possibility he said there is 
some reason to believe it might be somewhat similar 
in the study 107 young adults with normal cholesterol levels 
drank filtered coffee for three weeks then they were randomly 
assigned to drink four to six cups a day of boiled coffee four to 
six cups of filtered coffee or no coffee at all 
after nine weeks their total cholesterol levels rose 10 percent 
after switching to boiled coffee but they were unchanged in those 
who used filtered coffee or those who abstained 
grobbee offered three possible explanations for why boiled 
coffee seems to raise cholesterol 
its made with hotter water than drip coffee 
the water stays in contact with the coffee grounds longer 
filters screen out some cholesterolraising substance in coffee 
there is in coffee a very potent substance in terms of the 
effect on cholesterol said grobbee its timely to put energy 
into detecting what that substance is it seems that by filtering 
your coffee you can remove it

a man who had to tell his only child she 
isnt his biological daughter planned a quiet family thanksgiving 
to reassure the 10yearold hes raised since birth that im 
still your daddy 
i dont even care about the turkey robert mays said 
wednesday 
hes worried about kimberly michelle mays a sensitive 
fifthgrader who learned mays isnt her biological daughter i 
just want to concentrate on kim making her as happy as possible 
shes confused shes going through a tremendous amount of 
emotional disappointment in her life he said 
mays told kimberly genetic tests proved she is really the 
daughter of ernest and regina twigg parents of seven other 
children the girl the twiggs raised as arlena who died of heart 
disease last year was really the child of mays and his wife 
barbara who died in 1981 
the girls were born three days apart at hardee memorial hospital 
in rural wauchula in 1978 
after mays learned the news friday he broke it to the blonde 
hazeleyed youngster 
kimberly is totally aware of what is going on he said 
ive tried not to keep anything a secret from her 
she cried for a long time then asked what it meant to their 
relationship 
i held her she just simply wept i was crying myself she 
said daddy daddy daddy what does this mean mays said 
i told her honey it means only that you are not my 
biological daughter and that means nothing in our life ive loved 
you raised you and cared for you and thats not going to 
change 
mays said he was relieved the long ordeal is over but 
shocked disappointed and let down at the outcome 
at a news conference wednesday in his attorneys office mays 
voice sometimes broke with emotion as he described how kimberly 
seems more withdrawn since hearing the news 
shes a very outgoing lovable funloving kid she enjoys 
life thoroughly he said i see her spending more time alone 
and quiet and not being quite as active and funloving as she has 
been in the past she is worried about this 
just before arlenas death the twiggs discovered through 
genetic testing she was unrelated to either of them 
the twiggs claimed in a federal lawsuit against the hospital 
that a swap occurred in the hospital and began a 14month search 
for the child they lost 
mays a roofing contractor said he would never have agreed to 
genetic testing if the twiggs hadnt signed an agreement in october 
promising they wouldnt claim kimberly as their own 
the next step is for kimberly to meet with psychologists who 
will make recommendations about a first meeting and subsequent 
visitation schedule with the twiggs who live in the central 
florida city of sebring mays said he would leave the decision to 
the girl 
kimberly has always celebrated her birthday on nov 29 and wont 
change it to dec 2 the day the twigg baby was born 
im sure if its left to kim shell celebrate it on both 
days mays said adding we decided wed do it on the 29th sort 
of as a remembrance to arlena

the nations largest senior citizens group 
says repeal of a sweeping medicare insurance program for 
catastrophic illness is a great setback for more than 20 million 
americans 
there are many many more losers than winners as a result of 
repeal and we cant afford to sit around very long before we try to 
take this on again because the problem is getting worse said 
john rother legislative director for the american association of 
retired persons 
but rother added that the battle over repeal has shown that 
efforts to revive the program wont succeed unless a new proposal 
spreads the costs over the whole population and includes protection 
against longterm care costs 
even though longterm care coverage could cost as much as six 
times the 10billionayear catastrophic program it may be more 
supportable because it would do what they senior citizens most 
want government to do he said 
aarp supported the catastrophic program when it was passed last 
year and throughout the ensuing outcry for repeal from many older 
americans including some of its members 
once heralded as the biggest improvement in medicare since its 
inception in 1966 the catastrophic illness program will become the 
first major new social program to be repealed in recent times 
senior citizens who led the revolt said wednesday that congress 
repeal of the program was a victory for seniors president bush 
is expected to sign the repeal approved by congress just before it 
adjourned early wednesday 
now we hope the congress will go on and address the nations 
real need which is taking a good look at our health care system 
including crisis and longterm care said jack mcdavitt a 
spokesman for the national committee to preserve social security 
and medicare 
the committees members were among the leading opponents of the 
medicare expansion which would have cost higherincome retirees up 
to 800 in a special surtax this year though the surtax was 
repealed most medicare recipients will continue to pay a 4 
monthly premium 
extended hospital coverage that has been available to medicare 
beneficiaries this year would expire at yearend limits on 
outofpocket expenses for doctors bills and prescription drugs 
would die before taking effect a package of more minor benefits 
including mammograms home health care and hospice care also was 
eliminated 
two provisions however would remain medicaid improvements for 
lowincome pregnant women children and elderly and protection 
from impoverishment for one spouse when the other spouse enters a 
nursing home 
as to the next step many in congress and outside government are 
awaiting direction from the congressional pepper commission named 
after the late rep claude pepper dfla which is studying the 
nations healthcare financing and access problems and is due to 
report in march a separate blueribbon panel in the bush 
administration is studying the problems as are officials in the 
department of health and human services 
theres going to be a period of regrouping said eric 
shulman legislative director of the national council of senior 
citizens which opposed the hefty surtax but sought to keep some of 
the benefits 
theres a growing consensus among employers workers and 
others that we need to move toward a national program shulman 
said 
i wouldnt expect national health care in bushs first term 
but if he gets on the wrong side of the issue he may not have a 
second term he said

levels of carbon monoxide considered safe by 
federal air quality standards can trigger a potentially dangerous 
oxygen shortage in the hearts of people with coronary artery 
disease a study today shows 
effects were found at carbon monoxide levels equal to those in a 
room full of cigarette smokers 
these are definitely adverse health effects said dr thomas 
e dahms of st louis university school of medicine 
the study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
found a decrease in the amount of work that people with heart 
disease could perform when their carboxyhemoglobin levels the 
combination of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin reached 2 percent 
hemoglobin ordinarily combines with oxygen and carries it 
throughout the body but carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin even 
more tightly than oxygen does so when people breathe carbon 
monoxide it cuts down the amount of oxygen in their blood and 
high doses are fatal 
the health consequences of very low levels however have been 
less clear in general standards set by the us environmental 
protection agency allow enough carbon monoxide in the air to take 
up 2 percent of the bloods hemoglobin 
what we have shown with this paper is that its beyond any 
doubt that there is a documented effect at 2 percent which frankly 
was a surprise to us said dahms its such a small amount that 
one would not think you could see that kind of change 
federal health surveys have found that 5 percent to 10 percent 
of all nonsmoking americans have this much carboxyhemoglobin in 
their blood at any time the two chief sources of carbon monoxide 
in the air are cigarette smoke and engine fumes 
dahms said a nonsmoker in a closed room with 20 smokers would 
breathe enough carbon monoxide to have about a 2 percent 
carboxyhemoglobin level someone who smokes a pack of cigarettes a 
day has levels between 4 percent and 8 percent 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal drs edward m 
dwyer jr and gerard m turino of st lukesroosevelt hospital 
center in new york said it is difficult to set any safe level of 
carbon monoxide 
the safest level would be the lowest level achievable in the 
atmosphere they wrote 
the study was performed on 63 men with coronary artery disease 
they exercised on a treadmill while breathing ordinary air or air 
that increased their carboxyhemoglobin levels to 2 percent or 4 
percent 
at 2 percent carbon monoxide levels they could do 5 percent 
less exercise before their hearts showed signs of oxygen 
deprivation and at 4 percent levels they could do 12 percent less 
exercise they also developed chest pain sooner with increasing 
levels of carbon monoxide 
as people exercise their hearts demand more oxygen in people 
with healthy hearts their arteries can expand to deliver more 
oxygenrich blood and small amounts of carbon monoxide have little 
effect 
but when people have heart disease clogged arteries dont 
expand properly carbon monoxide can make an important difference 
by lowering the oxygen load of the blood that gets through

avtex fibers inc was fined 615 million 
for polluting the shenandoah river and ordered to pay to clean the 
river of a cancercausing chemical discharged by its rayon plant 
richmond circuit judge theodore j markow said the company 
probably had been discharging polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs 
into the river since 1983 from its plant in front royal 70 miles 
west of washington dc 
attorney general mary sue terry said the decision wednesday 
shows that respect for the environment is good business in 
virginia 
avtex spokesman jeff nelson was out of his office and could not 
be reached for comment 
the companys attorneys told markow last week that avtex 
couldnt pay fines or cleanup costs because the 50yearold rayon 
plant shut down nov 10 under order from the state water control 
board avtex operates another fiber plant in pennsylvania 
the us environmental protection agency has placed a lien of up 
to 40 million on the plant property and the virginia attorney 
generals office has seized saleable items in the plant in case the 
company files for bankruptcy 
markow acknowledged avtexs efforts since august to clean up pcb 
contamination at the 440acre plant site but he chastised the 
company for ignoring evidence of pcb spills in 1983 and late 1985 
he called the pollution a public nuisance that had damaged 
the river significantly the virginia department of health advised 
in may against consuming fish caught from the river near front 
royal 
the closure of the plant put 442 employees out of work and 
stopped the manufacture of a carbonized yarn used in rocket nozzles 
on the space shuttle and nuclear missiles government officials 
said stockpiles of the yarn would last until a second manufacturer 
is approved 
the judgment included a 3 million fine for discharging pcbs 
into the river plus various fines and penalties for violating 
water quality and worker safety regulations

pepsi cola apologized today to atlanta residents 
for a job recruitment quiz that belittled their city as home to 
rustics who prefer fatback to fine dining and get their kicks by 
cowtipping 
the apology comes in a fullpage newspaper advertisement in the 
form of an open letter to atlanta residents it was signed by ron 
tidmore president of pepsicola south who described himself as a 
native southerner angry and embarrassed by the characterization 
the quiz was distributed to business students during a pepsi 
employment recruiting trip to northwestern university in evanston 
ill 
it was the creation of a young pepsi employee trying to 
demonstrate the relative merits of living and working in atlanta 
where the cocacola co has its headquarters and pepsis corporate 
home in the new york city suburb of purchase ny 
the quiz asked which city offers any food in the world and 
which has fat backs and grits it also asked which city offers 
yachting as recreation and which has cow tipping the prank of 
catching a cow unaware and knocking it over 
were sorry it happened the ad says pepsi certainly does 
not want to lose your business but most important we do not want 
to lose your respect 
neither pepsi nor the atlanta journal would reveal how much the 
ad cost 
though the quiz offended some the reference to the obscure 
activity of cow tipping has become something of a local joke among 
radio callin show hosts and newspaper columnists in the past week

a prominent soviet writer has offered an agonized 
apology for the collective murder his country committed when it 
sent tanks into czechoslovakia in 1968 
in an open letter published in this weeks moscow news writer 
daniil granin calls the soviet move illegal ruinous 
intervention that brought to power dogmatic stalinists 
the soviet government has declared the 1979 intervention in 
afghanistan a mistake but has yet to renounce the 1968 warsaw pact 
invasion that crushed the prague spring reform movement in 
czechoslovakia 
however foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said last week 
the government was still reevaluating many aspects of past policy 
in a torturous process and president mikhail s gorbachev has 
declared that the soviet union has no right to intervene in the 
affairs of its warsaw pact allies 
soviet television recently broadcast an interview with alexander 
dubcek who was ousted as czechoslovak leader for championing the 
1968 reform movement 
but granins letter was the first in the soviet press to openly 
denounce the invasion its publication in the maverick weekly 
appeared to represent his own personal views 
granin wrote that he and his friends had never felt such shame 
for our country for our party and government as when they heard 
the news of the 1968 invasion 
czechoslovakia had embarked on its own early brand of 
democratic reform and we were the ones to smash and slander this 
perestroika it was collective murder granin wrote gorbachev 
has dubbed his reform campaign perestroika or restructuring 
grann said some soviets did try to speak out against the 
invasion but they lost their jobs were imprisoned interned in 
psychiatric hospitals or exiled 
soviet intellectuals underwent suffering for their 
helplessness and most of all shame that is pangs of the 
conscience 
even now granin said it is very difficult to get criticism of 
the 1968 invasion published and remarks on the subject were edited 
out of a recent article he wrote for a central newspaper 
commentators told him to wait until it all sorts itself out 
apparently meaning that either the czechoslovak or soviet 
government would first have to admit the 1968 invasion was 
unjustified 
granin said he felt compelled to publish his letter because 
our conscience hurts the berlin wall the war in afghanistan 
prague and it is also unclean in the face of our own soviet 
dissidents who went into prisons and camps 
dubcek has this year broken the silence he was long forced to 
keep 
on wednesday he declared his support for the movement for 
democratic change that has brought hundreds of thousands of 
antigovernment protesters into the streets of prague over the past 
six days 
in a message to demonstrators that was received with wild 
cheers he backed demands for the resignation of czechoslovak 
leaders who took over in 1968 and oversaw a massive purge of party 
members

new york city had a white thanksgiving for the first time in 51 
years as snow fell today from the mountains of northwestern north

the bush administration is backing away from 
imposing trade sanctions against japan in a longrunning dispute 
over the ability of american companies to compete for construction 
work in japan 
but us officials are warning the japanese that more progress 
must be made on the issue or the possibility of sanctions could be 
raised again 
in announcing the decision us trade representative carla 
hills said wednesday she had determined that japan had made 
significant progress in allowing us companies to compete for 
construction jobs 
firm and measured negotiations have produced results and we 
welcome japans commitment to improve access to its construction 
market she said 
separately us officials in tokyo said today that a group of 
japanese construction firms has agreed to pay the us government 
326 million to settle a dispute over alleged bidrigging of 
projects at the us navy base at yokosuka southwest of tokyo 
representatives from seven japanese construction firms and 
american officials signed the memorandum of intent on behalf of 99 
japanese firms the justice department said in a statement 
the us government alleges 140 japanese construction and 
related firms were involved in the bidrigging and said the justice 
department would continue to seek damages from the 41 not covered 
by the memorandum 
hills could have recommended sanctions that would have 
effectively doubled the cost of some japanese imports to the united 
states 
she said the united states and japan will continue negotiating 
on the construction issue in an effort to remove further 
impediments to american companies and she set a may deadline for 
concluding the next round of talks 
she said the decision not to retaliate was made because the 
japanese have agreed to make greater efforts to discourage bidding 
collusion between japanese companies 
she also cited commitments by the japanese to provide more 
information to assist potential bidders and to allow open 
competition on the architectural design phase of five upcoming 
major airport renovation projects in the country 
while sanctions could still be imposed if japan does not go 
further in opening its markets hills refused to say what actions 
she might take then 
i dont threaten anyone she said i sit down to 
negotiate 
us construction engineering and architecture companies have 
long complained about barriers the japanese have erected that kept 
them from obtaining contracts 
expansion of trade in services where the united states is still 
considered to have the lead is considered by many to be the best 
hope america has of reducing its huge trade deficit which is still 
running at an annual rate of 100 billion with japan accounting 
for about half of that amount 
hills said construction was an area in which we can supply a 
better product at a lower price 
the review of japanese construction practices was mandated by 
congress in the 1988 trade law which gave the administration one 
year to review the issue and decide whether to retaliate 
the administration is conducting several other negotiations with 
japan all aimed at reducing the huge trade imbalance between the 
two countries 
on another matter hills said she was optimistic that the united 
states would achieve many of its objectives in worldwide trade 
talks being held with 97 other nations under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
known as the uruguay round the trade talks are scheduled to 
conclude at the end of 1990 
hills told reporters during a briefing that she hoped to reach 
agreement on some less contentious aspects of the talks by next 
summer clearing the way for debate in the final months over such 
sensitive issues as the us demand for scrapping costly farm 
subsidies

decorated wednesday for heroism and exceptional performance in 
fighting fires and aiding injured shipmates when a t2 buckeye

my theory is that in order for my people to follow me i have 
to be out front said the sailor from brooklyn ny after the 
ceremony on the ships hangar deck that was my position to give 
guidance and direction to ensure that my procedures were being 
followed

a blaze that killed 134 sailors on the uss forrestal off the coast 
of vietnam in 1967

said the navy and the lexington in particular have enviable 
safety records despite the focus on a recent series of accidents 
in the service 
miller the catapult launch officer stationed near the front of 
the ship was cited for leading a hose team that fought the main 
fire he then followed up by going below deck into a smokefilled 
area to spray a firesmothering chemical on flames coming from 
fuelsoaked insulation 
turner a crash and salvage specialist rizzutos chief 
assistant was stationed on the forward part of the flight deck 
he said he first ran to get out of the way of flaming debris 
then grabbed a hose 
when other people started to arrive i dispersed people to 
different jobs to get them moving and attack the fire turner

a district court today acquitted 
prominent czech dissident jan carnogursky of sedition and 
subversion charges but kept him in prison pending an appeal by the 
prosecution a human rights group said 
the verdict was a victory for prodemocracy demonstrators who 
had gathered outside the court in bratislava czechoslovakia to 
support carnogursky and to join other protesters nationwide calling 
for poltical reforms 
carnogursky a trained lawyer barred from practice was quoted 
as telling the court that it cannot be subversive to tell the truth 
and that his activities were christian in character rather than 
political 
the judge accepted the request of the prosecution not to release 
carnogursky while the prosecuters appeal is pending the 
viennabased international helsinki federation said in a statement 
carnogursky a roman catholic activist and human rights 
campaigner was tried on charges of sedition and subversion for an 
article he wrote for a bratislava underground monthly and for a 
statement he and four other activists signed in august the 
statement called on slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the 
1968 warsaw pact invasion that crushed the prague spring reform 
movement in czechoslovakia by laying flowers in memory of the 
invasions victims 
carnogursky was detained aug 14 together with those four 
leading slovak activists miroslav kusy hana ponicka anton 
selecky and vladimir manak 
kusy got an eightmonth suspended sentence after a court last 
week found him guilty of harming state interests abroad 
ponicka selecky and manak who were charged with sedition 
together with carnogursky were acquitted by the court 
gerald nagler secretary general of the international helsinki 
federation who attended carnogurskys twoday trial said the 
judge treated the case with a purely legal approach disregarding 
any political argumentation 
the fact that on one hand the trial was carried out in a 
nonpolitical way unheard of in czechoslovakia and that on the 
other hand carnogursky was not released after having been 
acquitted reflects the present situation of confusion in 
czecholsovakia nagler said 
for the first time in years alexander dubcek the leader of the 
crushed prague spring movement was able to attend part of the 
trial in bratislava czechoslovak state television in a departure 
from longtime pratice briefly showed dubcek who has generally 
kept a low profile since 1968 
outside the palace of justice on wednesday where the 
carnogursky trial took place dubcek briefly addressed a crowd of 
several hundred people taking advantage of the fastmoving 
developments in czechoslovakia marked by mass prodemocracy 
protests throughout the nation 
dubcek who was cheered by the crowd said he agreed with them 
that the charges against carnogursky were unfair witnesses

senior conservatives are rallying around prime 
minister margaret thatcher to fend off an unprecedented challenge 
to her leadership of the party 
deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe in an appeal for party 
unity today joined party chairman kenneth baker and tory elder 
statesman lord whitelaw in denouncing attempts to unseat her 
they were reacting to an announcement wednesday by a 
rankandfile lawmaker sir anthony meyer that he will challenge 
mrs thatcher for the leadership when she comes up for her annual 
reelection 
meyer conceded he was an outsider with no chance of defeating 
mrs thatcher but said he would go ahead with his candidacy unless 
a higherprofile nominee emerged 
no tory has ever run against mrs thatcher since she became 
party leader 14 years ago but lately economic troubles her 
prickly personality and her resistance to deeper british 
integration into the european economic community have stirred 
dissent in the party 
party rules require the leadership election to be held by dec 
19 the complex procedure means mrs thatcher must win the votes of 
at least 57 percent of the 374 tories in the house of commons to 
win outright 
meyer said he hoped to provoke sufficient abstentions to send 
mrs thatcher a message of disenchantment and possibly lure a major 
challenger into the race if it goes to a second round of voting 
howe and baker are regarded as possible thatcher successors but 
both made clear their distaste for a contest 
the leading contender former defense secretary michael 
heseltine said he would take no part in a challenge to mrs 
thatcher 
in a statement howe said i urge any parliamentary colleague 
who might be thinking of forcing the party into a leadership 
election not to do so 
he said it was crucial to maintain continuity of policy and 
authority as well as unity of purpose 
a leadership challenge would give an unwarranted boost to our 
opponents and would play into the hands of a section of the 
media who have been trying to engineer a leadership crisis 
there is no such crisis the prime minister commands the 
overwhelming support of the party in parliament and in the 
country howe said 
lord whitelaw a former thatcher deputy told parliamentary 
correspondents wednesday that he wanted to see the conservatives 
stay in power under mrs thatcher at the next election which must 
be held by mid1992 
baker the party chairman was quoted in an interview with the 
financial times as calling meyers challenge an irrelevant 
distraction and urging tory members to end their gossip rumor 
and intrigues and close ranks around mrs thatcher 
baker was quoted as saying that from his contacts with thousands 
of party activists in recent weeks the message is very very 
clear there is overwhelming support for margaret thatcher 
the financial times said party whips were nonetheless assuming 
the contest would go ahead and were preparing to put intense 
pressure on wavering lawmakers to support mrs thatcher 
it said the challenge appeared to be coming from the party left 
with a view toward mounting a more serious challenge next year 
the left opposes mrs thatchers hardline freemarket reforms 
and her perceived hostility to the eec but was in limbo as long as 
her policies seemed successful now that inflation is above 7 
percent and interest rates are at an eightyear high of 15 percent 
the dissenters are resurfacing

eastern airlines pilots are calling off their 
sympathy strike and offering to return to work dealing a stunning 
blow to machinists on strike against the carrier since march 
the air lines flight attendants also voted to end their walkout 
the leaders of easterns union pilots voted wednesday to end 
their walkout although it remained unclear whether eastern would 
welcome back all of the more than 2200 pilots still on strike 
the decision by the air line pilots association instantly 
crushed the solidarity of the strike begun by the machinists and 
until now supported by the pilots and union flight attendants 
on wednesday local 553 transport workers of america informed 
easter airlines of the unions immediate and unconditional return 
to work 
this was a very difficult decision but one made in the best 
interests of the flight attendants said mary jane barry 
president of twu local 553 
the machinists vowed to continue their walkout 
were not calling this thing off said union vice president 
john peterpaul calls to the flight attendants union were not 
returned but the attendants traditionally have honored machinists 
picket lines even when pilots have crossed them 
the 20member master executive council of the eastern pilots 
group said president bushs veto of legislation establishing a 
special congressional panel to propose a solution to the strike 
convinced the pilots there was no end to the strike in sight and 
that returning to work was the best way to protect their jobs 
its a very interesting development miamibased eastern 
said in a statement our only regret is that it didnt come 
earlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that has come to 
eastern airlines 
there currently are no openings for pilots at the airline which 
now has about 1800 fliers the company said but it indicated 
there could be slots in the future which would be filled in the 
order in which pilots returned to work except in cases where 
pilots with experience on specific types of aircraft are needed 
eastern said striking pilots will be recalled as jobs come 
open in the future and invited them to sign the recall list 
eastern has been hiring replacement pilots and using several 
hundred union pilots who crossed picket lines the airline has been 
planning to reorganize as a carrier about 85 percent of its former 
size 
theyve got all the pilots they need paul karos an airline 
analyst at first boston corp said wednesday the strike has 
been mainly symbolic 
technically under the railway labor act which governs airline 
contract disputes only the machinists are involved in a 
fullfledged strike the pilots and easterns union flight 
attendants have been honoring machinist pickets in legal sympathy 
strikes 
the machinists went on strike after refusing to agree to a 
demand for 150 million in concessions on wages work rules and 
other issues sought by frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
company texas air corp the machinists said later they would agree 
to similar or greater concessions if lorenzo would sell eastern 
but sale attempts have fallen through 
the pilots union has a history of crossing the picket lines of 
other unions limiting the effectiveness of airline strikes but it 
stood with the machinists until wednesday giving organized labor 
an important boost even though in recent months eastern has been 
able to expand operations with replacements 
duke jack spokesman for the local alpa branch said bushs veto 
was the final straw in leading the pilots to drop the strike 
president bush at the eleventh hour decided working people 
werent that important in his 1000 points of light when he vetoed 
that the resolution we took a look around and said we didnt have 
anywhere else to go he said 
the decision to end the strike was announced by skip copeland 
who in august replaced jack bavis as head of the eastern pilots 
after bavis advocated returning to work 
copeland said the pilots have been instructed to contact the 
company about returning to work 
the time has come now to go back rebuild eastern and get on 
with our lives and professions copeland said 
but don hanson an 11year machinist and who was picketing 
outside miami airport on wednesday said as long as frank 
lorenzo is at the helm ill never go back to work theres no 
future with the man the man doesnt treat his people right

the election commission today ordered a 
revote in more than 600 polling stations across the country amid 
charges of assaults intimidation and fraud in national 
parliamentary elections 
at least 40 people were killed in violence during wednesdays 
balloting the first of three days of general elections the 
congress party of prime minister rajiv gandhi and the opposition 
national front accused each other of rigging votes and instigating 
the fighting 
election commissioner rvs peri sastri said complaints of 
fraud and violence had been received from almost all the 221 
constituencies which went to the polls wednesday 
he said a repoll had been ordered in 636 of the estimated 
150000 polling booths and inquiries into allegations in other 
areas were continuing these he said included the amethi 
constituency in uttar pradesh state where gandhi is seeking 
reelection we will withhold the result from amethi until the 
inquiry is completed he said 
the national front a loose coalition of opposition parties has 
accused congress of widespread vote fraud and attempted murder in 
amethi and demanded a repoll 
lc jain the campaign manager of opposition candidate raj 
mohan gandhi told reporters that congress party goons hoodlums 
and gangsters took over polling booths in the constituency and 
stuffed ballot boxes 
raj mohan gandhi no relative of the prime minister was not 
present at the news conference because he was at the bedside of 
sanjay singh a local opposition leader who was shot and seriously 
wounded by congress gunmen jain said 
singh whose wife is a niece of national front leader vishwanath 
pratap singh was in the intensive care unit of a hospital in 
lucknow the state capital and doctors said he was in critical 
condition he was given a large blood transfusion and was still 
unconscious they said 
the very fact that the congress is bent upon violence 
shows that they are losing the elections said arun nehru 
gandhis estranged cousin and a leader of the opposition front 
gandhi faces the most cohesive election challenge ever mounted 
by opposition parties during the current elections 
five opposition parties have overcome their differences and 
melded themselves into the national front to oppose gandhi in the 
face of the rare opposition unity the congress party is in serious 
trouble and might even lose opinion polls say 
the congress violence in amethi is an example of blatant 
rigging and the worst type of criminal act nehru told reporters 
in lucknow 
congress party spokesman anand sharma said the demand for a 
revote in amethi was a conspiracy to constitute parliament minus 
rajiv gandhi he told reporters it would play right into the 
hands of the conspirators 
the progovernment national herald newspaper also blamed 
wednesdays violence on the national front and said they will 
find themselves sadly mistaken if they think that musclemanship can 
bring them political dividends in the election 
on wednesday 15 of the countrys 25 states and five of its 7 
federally ruled territories voted other regions vote friday and 
sunday 
at stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the lok sabha or house of 
the people parliaments policymaking lower house several 
contests were postponed because of incomplete voter rolls and 
candidates deaths 
at least three candidates all independents were among the 84 
people killed in campaign violence since the elections were 
announced oct 17 most of the other victims were party workers 
election officials and voters 
gandhi and his congress party are the main issues in the 
campaign 
there are few major distinctions between the campaign platforms 
of the congress and the national front except for the national 
fronts plank to oust congress for alleged corruption and 
ineptitude 
the congress party has sought to portray the election as a 
choice between stability and chaos maintaining that the 
oppositions newfound unity will shatter if it is voted into power

romanian communists today praised 
nicolae ceausescu as a hero and officials said no one will oppose 
the reelection of the leader who has denounced the changes 
sweeping the rest of the east bloc 
ceausescu 71 the longestserving party leader in eastern 
europe and his wife elena the no 2 official in the nation 
left their seats soon after the 14th communist party congress 
convened for a fourth day today but hundreds of delegates chanted 
and applauded in support of them 
in a speech opening the congress monday ceausescu rejected the 
reforms gripping all six other warsaw pact nations and proclaimed a 
strengthened role instead for his ruling communist party which he 
has led since 1965 
expressing scorn for the political liberalization transforming 
allied soviet bloc parties and countries ceausescu hinted that 
reformist communist leaders elsewhere had betrayed their people 
politburo member emil bobu no 3 in the chain of command led 
the praise today lauding the brilliant report submitted to 
congress by ceausescu bobu said ceausescus speech made a 
great contribution to the process of scientific socialism the 
formal name for romanias brand of communism 
ceausescus intolerance of opposition to his concepts had led to 
the most suppressive atmosphere within the soviet bloc even before 
the onset of changes elsewhere 
delegate ion dodu balan a writer described ceausescu as an 
ardent patriot and revolutionary a hero of the nation 
dilligent brave and righteous 
delegates chosen by congress organizers to speak to reporters 
also rejected reforms of the kind sweeping czechoslovakia and 
bulgaria bringing hundreds of thousands to the streets 
we know whats going on in bulgaria thats abnormal said 
delegate mihacea tasca also in czechoslovakia but things 
like that shouldnt happen here 
the reelection of ceausescu will probably take place friday by

president bush in a thanksgiving message 
previewing the superpower summit is urging soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to help bring down the last barriers to a 
new world of freedom and end the cold war 
in a televised speech to the nation bush on wednesday night 
offered a new partnership with the soviets while at the same 
time cautioning that a time of historic change is no time for 
recklessness 
thus he said he will act with prudence when he meets on 
shipboard with gorbachev in the mediterranean next week 
i want president gorbachev to know exactly where the united 
states stands let me be clear america stands with freedom and 
democracy bush said lauding the moves toward reform in germany 
poland czechoslovakia hungary and bulgaria 
we welcome the appeal of the president to use this meeting in 
order to break out of the boundaries of the policy of containment 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a news 
briefing today 
we are concluding the period of development after world war ii 
and coming to broad and open cooperation gerasimov added 
bush delivered the thanksgivingeve address from the 
presidential retreat at camp david md where he and his wife 
barbara are spending the holiday with family members and friends 
offering a look at his agenda for their dec 23 meeting off the 
coast of malta bush said he and gorbachev will begin the work of 
years 
he said he would seek gorbachevs assurance that the process of 
reform will continue in eastern europe and we will give him our 
assurance that america welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking 
advantage but as a people offering support 
the peace we are building must be different than the hard 
joyless peace between two armed camps weve known so long bush 
said the historic task before us now is to begin the healing of 
this old wound 
he called gorbachev the dynamic architect of soviet reform 
he said he would tell the soviet leader that america wants the 
people of the soviet union to fulfill their destiny and i will 
assure him that there is no greater advocate of perestroika than 
the president of the united states perestroika is gorbachevs 
policy of restructuring for his countrys ailing economy 
house speaker thomas s foley interviewed on cnn after the 
speech said that in the past bush appeared perhaps too detached 
and too calm too relaxed about things that are truly exciting 
but he added i think that democrats now expect the 
president to approach these historic issues with determination and 
prudence 
foley dwash called bushs speech a fine and eloquent 
address one that every american can wholeheartedly agree with 
on friday british prime minister margaret thatcher will visit 
bush at camp david the president told reporters earlier wednesday 
he will consult with her on the upcoming ussoviet summit 
on other thanksgivings the world was haunted by the images of 
watchtowers guard dogs and machine guns bush said in his speech 
to the nation but now the world has a new image reflecting a 
new reality that of germans east and west pulling each other to 
the top of the wall a human bridge between nations 
this is not the end of the book of history but it is a joyful 
end of one of historys saddest chapters 
looking ahead to the summit he said i am reaching out to 
president gorbachev asking him to work with me to bring down the 
last barriers to a new world of freedom 
let us move beyond containment and once and for all end cold 
war 
bush offered assurances that he and the soviet leader would not 
mastermind a superpower plan for europe after all the peoples 
of europe are determining their own future he added however 
though there will be no surprises sprung on our allies we will 
miss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace 
the president answered in advance a possible soviet move to 
remove all us and soviet troops from europe he stated he would 
entertain no such notion although reductions in us forces in 
europe are a plausible goal 
when he meets with allied leaders in brussels after he sees 
gorbachev bush said i will assure them that no matter how 
dramatic the change in eastern europe or in the soviet union 
itself the united states will continue to stand with our allies 
and our friends 
bush reiterated administration statements that he will not 
attempt an arms control agreement at the malta summit and that he 
will press gorbachev on using its influence with the leftist 
government of nicaragua

a senior military official said 
today the army is opposed to ending oneparty rule in communist 
yugoslavia because it could aggravate nationalistic problems in the 
country 
adm petar simic who heads the influential communist party 
organization within the armed forces said at a key conference of 
the body that the introduction of westernstyle democracy would 
further enhance a nationalistic split within yugoslavia 
his comments carried by the state tanjug news agency followed 
growing calls from some parts of yugoslavia for introduction of a 
pluralistic system to solve the countrys economic and political 
problems 
hungary and poland have moved away from oneparty rule and 
there are increased calls in east germany and czechoslovakia for an 
end to the communist partys monopoly on power there 
we do not see the future of our country in the restoration of 
the westernstyle parliamentarian system simic reportedly told 
the conference which was called to prepare the armys political 
platform for a communist party congress in january 
officials opposing the introduction of westernstyle democracy 
in yugoslavia believe the ensuing political parties would be formed 
along ethnic lines and could trigger a civil war in this country of 
numerous nationalities 
communist leaders from yugoslavias largest republic of serbia 
favor the communist partys continued monopoly on power while 
liberals in the northern republic of slovenia advocate introduction 
of a multiparty political system 
with the two factions within the countrys leadership unable to 
agree on meaningful ways of revamping the economic and political 
system many yugoslavs fear the country could splinter under the 
strain 
the annual inflation rate stands at 1500 percent unemployment 
in 1988 was at 15 percent and the foreign debt was 21 billion in 
mid1989 the living standard has been in steep decline since 1980 
economic problems have been accompanied by a resurgence of 
historic ethnic rivalries in yugoslavia a loose federation of six 
republics and two autonomous provinces 
much of the unrest has centered on the province of kosovo where 
ethnic albanians form a majority of more than 90 percent and have 
clashed with the serb minority which wants greater control over 
the province 
until recently the military had remained on the sidelines of 
political conflicts in yugoslavia but senior officers now show 
signs of increasing unease over the problems

flags flew at half staff church bells 
tolled and a general strike brought life to a standstill in 
syrianpoliced regions of lebanon today in mourning for slain 
president rene mouawad 
speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem moved swiftly to try 
to convene parliament in north lebanon to elect a new president and 
rescue an arabbrokered peace plan to end 14 years of civil war 
fortythree legislators left moslem west beirut by car for 
zgorta mouawads hometown in the syrianpoliced north to pay 
condolences to his family and to be on hand for the election 
a quorum of 48 deputies or twothirds of the 72 surviving 
legislators is required to convene and elect a head of state 
the late president was to be buried in zgorta on saturday 
druse chieftain walid jumblatt and shiite moslem leader nabih 
berri said in damascus syria that a new president must be chosen 
quickly 
unless we elect a new president within 24 hours or at the most 
a very few days we shall enter a period of hell jumblatt told 
an impromptu news conference in the syrian capital 
the bomb that killed mouawad and 23 other people was detonated 
by remote control as the 64yearold maronite catholic presidents 
motorcade drove down a west beirut boulevard on wednesday 
the killing raised fears in lebanons warweary population of 
renewed hostilities pitting troops of christian army commander gen 
michel aoun against syrian and allied moslem forces 
police said thousands of people were evacuating beiruts moslem 
and christian sectors to safer areas in the south the eastern 
bekaa valley and the northeastern mountains 
no one claimed responsibility for the assassination 
in further reaction today to the killing asoviet government 
spokesman labeled the assassination political terror foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said moscow hoped the 
warring groups in lebanon would show a sense of national 
responsibility at this difficult moment 
pope john paul ii sent a telegram to the maronite christian 
patriarch nasrallah pierre sfeir once again violence and hate 
have bloodied the land of lebanon the pontiff said 
syrias moslem and leftist allies in lebanon accused aouns army 
of carrying out the killing aoun issued a statement denouncing it 
as a loathsome crime 
mouawad was elected by parliament in syrianpoliced northern 
lebanon nov 5 with a mandate to supervise implementation of an 
arab leaguebrokered peace plan to end lebanons 14year civil war 
aoun refused to recognize mouawads election and accused 
parliament of selling out to syria by accepting a peace plan that 
did not set a timetable for the withdrawal of the 40000 troops 
syria maintains in the country 
the staterun news media of iraq which supplies aoun with arms 
accused syria and iran of murdering mouawad syria earlier issued a 
statement condemning the killing and blaming it on the hand of 
betrayal and treason 
government offices banks schools shops and other businesses 
closed to abide by the strike call as all radio stations broadcast 
classical music in mourning for the christian president who was 
killed on the 46th anniversary of lebanons independence 
employees at beirut international airport observed a twohour 
strike that was ending at noon but employees of the beirut 
municipalitys road maintenance department were not on strike 
dozens of workers operating cranes and bulldozers were removing 
the piles of twisted metal and the gutted wreckage of several cars 
from the boulevard where the bomb explosion killed mouawad 
the strike called by various leftist and moslem factions was 
not observed in the 310squaremile christian enclave most of 
which is controlled by aouns troops 
schools were open in the christian enclave but very few students 
showed up for class because parents were worried about the 
possibility of renewed violence a local reporter said 
an official statement said mouawads body would be taken to his 
hometown of zgorta 45 miles from beirut in north lebanon later in 
the day he will be buried saturday 
the national front alliance of syrianbacked militias blamed the 
assassination on aoun who fought a sixmonth battle against syrian 
troops until a september ceasefire aoun had rejected mouawads 
election as unconstitutional 
but the iraqi stateowned newspaper al thawra blamed the killing 
of mouawad on syria and iran saying they are behind the 
assassination of mouawad 
iraq and syria are bitter enemies ruled by rival factions of 
the arab baath socialist party 
lebanon had been without a president since september 1988 when 
amin gemayels term ran out and no replacement was elected aoun 
then formed an interim christian cabinet and salim hoss the acting 
prime minister formed a moslem cabinet 
by police count at least 930 people were killed and 2744 
wounded in six months of fierce artillery duels between aouns 
forces and the syrians in and around beirut before an arab 
leaguebrokered ceasefire took hold sept 22

jailed black leader nelson 
mandela whose release is expected within months is meeting 
regularly with government ministers a fellow african national 
congress leader said today 
govan mbeki who spent 23 years in prison with mandela visited 
his colleague for three hours at victor verster prison outside cape 
town mbeki was released in 1987 
he mandela meets with government ministers more or less on a 
continuous basis mbeki told journalists after the meeting he 
declined to name any of the ministers or reveal the nature of the 
discussions 
mandela the countrys best known black leader was taken from 
the prison in july to meet with thenpresident pw botha and also 
has had discussions with justice minister kobie coetsee 
president fw de klerk and his top officials have declined to 
discuss any dealings they may have had with mandela 
mandelas contact with top government officials is seen as an 
effort to lay the groundwork for his release widely expected in 
the next few months 
seven of mandelas anc colleagues were freed unconditionally 
oct 15 in what was seen as a test run for his release 
mandela is serving a life sentence for a 1964 conviction of 
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
mbeki 79 was convicted at the same trial he was released two 
years ago for health reasons but the government placed him under 
tough restrictions that were only lifted earlier this month 
the anc based in lusaka zambia is the main black group 
attempting to undermine the whiteled government 
mbeki described mandela as alert and fit but said the anc 
leader had received no official information as to when he might be 
freed 
the question of his release is not in his hands it is in the 
hands of the government mbeki said 
mbeki who lives in the southern city of port elizabeth is 
scheduled to meet with several of the recently released anc leaders 
this weekend at a rally in the black homeland of the transkei

palestinian guerrilla bases in southeast lebanon close to the 
syrian border police said one guerrilla was killed and four were 
wounded 
police said four f4 phantom fighterbombers carried out the 
10minute raid firing 10 rockets into the bases manned by 
syrianbacked guerrillas of ahmed jibrils popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command 
six rockets hit a base in the village of sultan yaaqoub four 
miles west of the syrian frontier in the bekaa valley of east 
lebanon 
three guerrillas including the base commander known by the nom 
de guerre of abu murad were wounded police reported 
the other four rockets demolished a base in deir zanoun four 
miles to the south killing one guerrilla and wounding another 
said a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations 
both bases are north of israels selfdesignated security 
zone an occupied border strip in south lebanon it was set up by 
the israelis in 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla raids 
the israeli military command said in a brief communique in 
jerusalem that its planes destroyed one target serving as an 
operational base and heaquarters for the guerrilla group it said 
the jets all returned safely 
the group has been blamed by western intelligence agencies for 
bombing a new yorkbound pan american jumbo jet over scotland in

involved 
the radical faction is fiercely opposed to palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafats peace overtures toward israel

bases after the attack which came a day after lebanese president 
rene mouawad was assassinated in moslem west beirut israeli

guerrillas opened up with twinbarreled antiaircraft guns but no 
hits were observed 
the israeli jets released scarlet balloons to deflect 
heatseeking missiles but none was fired witnesses said

causing sonic booms as they broke the sound barrier and drawing 
antiaircraft fire from militia gunners around the citys moslem 
sector

abortionrights forces hailed the settlement of a 
lawsuit over illinois abortion regulations saying it removed the 
threat of the us supreme court using the case to reverse its 1973 
ruling legalizing abortion 
this is a tremendous political victory for the prochoice 
movement said dawn johnsen legal director of the national 
abortion rights action league its a relief having this case off 
the supreme courts docket 
the settlement announced wednesday would end the battle over 
detailed state regulations on abortion clinics 
abortionrights advocates said the rules were unduly restrictive 
and would force clinics to either close or make changes that would 
make them raise the price of an abortion beyond the reach of many 
women 
the settlement between the state and an abortion clinics 
operator who filed the suit refine the rules to make them 
acceptable to both sides said dr bernard turnock director of the 
illinois department of public health 
the settlement was announced by state attorney general neil 
hartigan and the american civil liberties union which represented 
dr richard ragsdale of rockford 
the principals in this case hartigan said have created a 
system that protects a womans health and safety while exercising 
her right of choice 
annlouise lohr staff counsel for the americans united for life 
legal defense fund said her antiabortion group was extremely 
disappointed hartigan didnt let the case go to the high court 
she called it a backroom deal that will compromise the ability 
of all states to protect the health and safety of women 
hartigan who is running for governor has said he believes 
women are guaranteed the right to choose abortion under the 
constitutional right to privacy but he has also said he favors 
restrictions on direct public funding for abortion 
while hartigan has portrayed himself as prochoice in his bid 
for the democratic nomination his sincerity was questioned 
wednesday by abortionrights advocates 
hes a political candidate taking the pulse of the 
electorate said patricia dougherty executive director of the 
illinois chapter of the national abortion rights action league 
the us supreme court had been scheduled to hear arguments in 
the case dec 5 but the settlement ends the legal controversy the 
formality of seeking a dismissal remains such action when 
requested by both sides in a case is common 
some abortionrights forces including hartigan had feared that 
without a settlement the supreme court might use the case as a 
vehicle for overturning its 1973 roe vs wade decision which 
legalized abortion 
in that landmark ruling the court forbade states from 
interfering with a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of her pregnancy the court said states may seek 
to protect the womens health during secondtrimester abortions and 
may seek to protect fetal life in rare thirdtrimester abortions 
under the settlement the state would allow abortions to be 
performed by private physicians in their offices by doctors at 
walkin surgical clinics and by physicians at fullservice 
hospitals 
walkin surgical centers that perform abortions as their sole or 
majority business would be subject to inspections beginning as 
early as next year by the department of public health turnock said 
surgical centers whose sole business is abortions would be 
limited to performing them before the 18th week of pregnancy 
surgical centers licensed to perform both abortions and other 
outpatient procedures could perform them after 18 weeks he said 
unlike the illinois regulations that were shelved by the case 
the new ones wouldnt require abortion clinics to modify their 
buildings in any significant way said aclu attorney colleen k 
connell 
four years ago ragsdale won a preliminary injunction against 
the illinois regulations in us district court in chicago 
he contended the states elaborate building codes for abortion 
clinics were medically unnecessary and represented a veiled attempt 
by the public health department to restrict womens access to 
abortion 
barred from enforcing the regulations turnock and hartigans 
office appealed arguing that the rules were necessary to protect 
womens health 
in 1987 the 7th us circuit court of appeals sided with 
ragsdale 
the requirements include 250squarefoot surgical rooms some 
corridor widths of eight feet lounges lockers and separate 
toilets for male and female employees and a janitors closet 
adjoining the surgical suite

a 27member government representing 
greeces three major parties was sworn in today temporarily 
resolving a political crisis 
the administration will govern the country until new elections 
are held in april 
party leaders have been unable to form a coalition government 
since the last election nov 5 in which none of the parties 
received a majority they said they agreed to a temporary 
government to avoid immediate elections and to take steps to save 
the collapsing economy 
the nov 5 election was the second in five months in which no 
party received enough votes to govern alone 
the interim government is led by xenophon zolotas the former 
central bank governor 
following swearingin ceremonies at the presidential palace 
zolotas said he planned to submit his governments program to the 
parliament for debate wednesday 
he told members of his cabinet that the government would cut 
spending and try to attract foreign investment to reduce the public 
deficit 
zolotas ruled out a devaluation of the nations currency the 
drachma but said it would be permitted to slide against other 
currencies 
the drachma which had a parity of 30 to the us dollar in 
1973 reached 170 this year after several devaluations and 
depreciation 
the 27 cabinet seats were allocated in proportion to the votes 
won by each of the three major parties nov 5 
the conservative new democracy party which won 462 percent of 
the vote was given nine ministerial posts the panhellenic 
socialist movement or pasok won 406 percent of the ballots and 
received seven portfolios three posts were given to the 
communistdominated coalition of the left and progress which 
received 108 percent of the vote

an official newspaper today denounced east 
germanys role in the 1968 invasion that crushed a reform movement 
in czechoslovakia and it said east germany now should help its 
neighbor achieve change 
also today the staterun media quoted the head of state 
security wolfgang schwanitz as blaming the past party and state 
leadership for deformation of the security force 
the government detailed new laws to curb smuggling of goods 
across the border in an effort to prevent further decay of the 
troubled economy 
the newspaper der morgan published a surprisingly candid report 
on how east germany helped suppress the popular democratic revolt 
in czechoslovakia known as the prague spring 21 years ago 
we must help our southern neighbor to find the courage for 
reform as much as we need it ourselves said the newspaper 
which is run by the liberal democratic party the party has 
recently dislodged itself from a cluster of communistcontrolled 
political groups 
we recall our own inglorious role in 1968 when east german 
troops with their invasion stomped on the tiny sprouts of renewal 
and democracy it said 
east germans have made supportive statements about the swelling 
prodemocracy movement in czechoslovakia in recent days but der 
morgans report was the first to acknowledge the part played by 
east germany in suppressing the previous reform drive 
the official adn news agency quoted schwanitz as saying 
hardline leaders in the past hurt the security service 
discussion with those who thought differently was rejected out 
of fear that to do so would mean recognizing them adn quoted 
schwanitz as saying instead opponents were subjected to 
administrative fighting a euphemism for official harassment 
he said 
the communist partys longtime leader erich honecker was 
ousted oct 18 amid an exodus of hundreds of thousands of east 
germans dissatisfied with his orthodox rule honecker was replaced 
by egon krenz who has opened east germanys borders and indicated 
he is open to some reforms 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer said new measures to counter 
smuggling of consumer goods and blackmarket sales of currency and 
artworks abroad include strict border checks and a requirement that 
purchasers in east germany show identity cards to buy heavily 
subsidized goods such as textiles food and electronics 
the move was apparently aimed at many poles who travel to east 
germany to buy goods and take them back across the border to 
poland where prices have skyrocketed this year 
meyer said the government would not consider devaluation of the 
east german mark as part of the recovery effort a step seen as 
necessary by many western economists if east berlin seeks to 
bolster its economy 
new forum the leading prodemocracy reform group issued a 
statement today calling on east germans to renounce currency 
speculation sales of artworks and other blackmarket activities 
that damage the economy 
take no part in the sellout of our nation the citizens 
group declared in the statement carried by adn 
on wednesday politburo member wolfgang herger indicated during 
a public discussion that at least some members of the communist 
elite were willing to do away with oneparty rule 
herger who is responsible for security matters said the 
dogmatic distorted model of the political system should be 
changed in theory as well as practice 
acknowledging their lack of credibility among people who have 
taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand their 
ouster the ruling communists announced wednesday their willingness 
to open talks with the opposition 
polands communists opened such talks in february agreeing in 
them to reinstate solidaritys legal status and hold partially free 
elections now solidarity leads the warsaw government

more than 200000 antigovernment 
demonstrators poured into downtown prague today and alexander 
dubcek the ousted crusader for reform arrived in the capital to 
address the crowd 
as pressure mounted for changes in the hardline communist 
leadership party chief milos jakes hinted that he would not 
suppress the demonstrations which have occurred in prague for 
seven straight days 
several plainclothes police officers went to the news center of 
czechoslovakias staterun television and told top officials not to 
broadcast footage of todays demonstration said a television 
employee speaking on condition of anonymity the officials agreed 
the employee said by telephone 
on wednesday government television broadcast live for the 
first time a huge rally in downtown prague but the coverage was 
abruptly halted after a worker interviewed at the rally accused the 
communist party of lying to us 
todays huge crowd of excited demonstrators gathered in central 
wenceslas square the heart of czechoslovakias new protest 
movement 
dubcek leader of the prague spring reform movement that was 
crushed by the 1968 sovietled invasion traveled from his hometown 
of bratislava to give a brief address to the rally according to 
banned playwright vaclav havel the countrys most prominent 
dissident 
dubcek was to be joined by leading representatives of the 
socialist and peoples political parties which have traditionally 
been allied with the communists but which have recently criticized 
them 
the official news agency ctk reported that jakes met with 
representatives of party trade union and youth organizations as 
well as coal miners from northwestern czechoslovakia they 
indicated support for him but expressed concern about the recent 
developments ctk said 
jakes pledged that the party leadership will use political 
means to halt the negative development in society the agency 
reported 
unlike other east bloc leaders jakes has refused to accept the 
reforms that were introduced by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
and that have since caused such momentous changes in poland 
hungary and east germany 
ctk said a meeting of the communist partys central committee 
had been called for friday in an apparent move to respond to the 
unparalleled unrest 
the prague chapter of the communist youth organization the 
socialist union of youth today demanded legal reforms to allow 
freedom of assembly and an inquiry of top officials 
the statement also called for an immediate meeting of the 
federal parliament to discuss the current situation in the country 
and said the meeting should be broadcast live on state television 
a group of young party members in a prague police unit also 
demanded necessary personnel changes in the ruling politburo to 
restore the effectiveness of the party 
their statement published in the youth organizations daily 
newspaper mlada fronta was the first such demand to come from the 
traditionally convervative police ranks 
more than 200000 people rallied in downtown prague on wednesday 
and cheered when a message from dubcek was read to the crowd 
dubcek now a 67yearold pensioner backed demands for the 
resignation of president gustav husak who succeeded him as 
communist leader in 1969 and jakes responsible for the purge of 
dubcek and half a million other communists in 1970 
after years of silence dubcek began to speak out publicly this 
year as poland and hungary with the blessing of gorbachev began 
to cast off oneparty communist rule 
now the tide of reform has swept up czechs and slovaks protest 
leaders have called for a general strike nov 27 to press their 
demands 
in a victory for those demanding change a district court today 
acquitted prominent czech dissident jan carnogursky of sedition and 
subversion charges but it kept him in prison pending an appeal by 
the prosecution a human rights group said 
carnogursky was charged in connection with an article he wrote 
for a bratislava underground monthly and for a statement he and 
four other activists signed in august 
the statement urged slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the 
warsaw pact invasion by laying flowers in memory of the invasions 
victims 
outside the courthouse wednesday 15000 protesters called for 
free elections and also shouted long live dubcek 
state television in a departure from longtime practice briefly 
showed dubcek attending the court session dubcek later briefly 
addressed the crowd outside 
dubcek has been named the winner of the european parliaments 
sakharov peace prize for 1989 
dubcek symbolizes for all europeans our best hopes for 
peaceful reform in eastern europe enrique baron the 
parliaments president said wednesday as he announced the 1989 
prize winner in strasbourg france

a guerrilla ceasefire proposal 
that came on the heels of an 11day offensive is just 
propagandistic manipulation a government spokesman said today 
the government cant take it seriously said mauricio 
sandoval the governments secretary of information 
there were few reports of gunfire in the capital and the 
morning was largely peaceful for the first time since the 
guerrillas offensive began 
the guerrillas renewed their ceasefire proposal wednesday night 
they have always tried to change what it means to have a 
ceasefire said sandoval he noted that the communique hadnt 
been addressed to the government but rather to the people of 
salvador and the international community and said that the 
government would give no formal reply 
they are doing this because of the big defeat they suffered 
because their offensive failed said sandoval in a telephone 
interview 
president alfredo cristiani said on wednesday that he believed 
the rebels might renew their attacks 
the guerrilla offer came late wednesday after the quietest day 
the capital has experienced since a rebel offensive began nov 11 
salvadorans began slowly emerging from hiding stores reopened and 
cleanup efforts began 
the shock is over and we can open our market for business 
said a woman from the battered mejicanos neighborhood 
this morning at a food distribution center in ciudad delgado 
more than 400 people lined up for food although workers inside 
said they didnt know if they would get any 
gravediggers worked through the morning at the soyapango 
cemetery burying victims of the fighting near the curb outside the 
walls because there was no room left inside more than 1000 people 
have died in the recent fighting 
the offensive seemed to be over following an attack on the 
wealthy escalon neighborhood and the occupation of a luxury hotel 
trapped a small group of us army green berets for 28 hours 
president bush sent a team from the elite delta force to rescue 
the soldiers if need be but the guerrillas slipped away after dusk 
tuesday 
the green berets left the compound wednesday sprinting across 
the pool deck of the hotel 
late wednesday the rebel farabundo marti national liberation 
front renewed its offer to accept a negotiated ceasefire that 
would be verified by the united nations 
to the security council of the un we express our disposition 
to define an immediate ceasefire the rebels said in a 
communique read on radio venceremos the rebels this morning 
changed that section to read our willingness to cooperate with 
the measures that are adopted in favor of an immediate ceasefire 
in our country 
the issue of whether to negotiate or define the details of a 
ceasefire before it goes into effect has been a key sticking point 
on which peace talks foundered in september and october 
there was no immediate comment to the modification from the 
salvadoran government which has proposed an immediate ceasefire 
to be followed by negotiations but before the guerrilla position 
was announced cristiani seemed to play down the possibility of 
direct talks in the near future 
the worst is over but i dont think escalon was the last 
gasp they are doing some things that look more like regrouping 
than withdrawing cristiani said in an interview wednesday 
afternoon 
he noted that joao baena soares the brazilian secretarygeneral 
of the organization of american states had been in town on a peace 
mission but left shortly after he was whisked out of the luxury 
hotel during the rebel attack 
maybe he saw enough to draw his conclusions said cristiani

police and intelligence agents launched a 
massive hunt thursday for a dissident who eluded arrest after 
appearing at an opposition campaign rally 
intelligence authorities are offering a reward equivalent to 
84600 for information leading to the arrest of kuo peihung 
chairman of the formosan independence league a los angelesbased 
group 
kuo a native of taiwan had been barred from returning since 
1984 but sneaked back last month he is wanted on charges of 
entering taiwan illegally 
kuo appeared wednesday at a campaign rally for opposition 
candidate chou huiying and told about 5000 people he would 
continue to campaign for an independent taiwan 
independence means rejection of the ruling nationalist partys 
claim that taiwan is a province of china the nationalists who 
retreated to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to 
communist forces on the chinese mainland claim to be the 
legitimate government of all china and consider calls for an 
independent taiwan to be seditious 
about 3000 police at the rally in a suburban taipei stadium did 
not move against kuo so as not to stir up the crowd kuo later 
sneaked out when organizers shut off the stage lights and 
supporters put on black masks to confuse police 
the legislative mayoral and magisterial elections dec 2 will 
be the first in which the nationalist party faces a challenge from 
legal opposition parties opposition figures formally registered as 
independents in previous elections

it was not business as usual at 
pragues barrandov studios where milos forman filmed amadeus 
and where other oscarwinning films came to life 
telephones rang constantly in a small crowded office 
transformed into the headquarters of a strike committee supporting 
the burgeoning prodemocracy movement 
we will have a oneday strike on monday said producer 
vaclav marhoul who heads the committee we are backing the civic 
forum the loosely organized opposition group 
and a delegation from barrandov has for the first time 
wednesday taken part in the demonstrations on wenceslas square 
he said 
the square in central prague has been the scene of daily 
protests the past week with hundreds of thousands of people 
gathering to demand a new government and more freedom 
work continues at studio 7 on a frenchczechoslovak 
coproduction called the last butterfly it is a film about 
german world war ii propaganda and how it painted a false picture 
of contented life in the nazi concentration camp at terezin a 
village north of prague 
for many jews the camp was the first stop on the way to the 
auschwitz death camp 
things have become a bit difficult because the western actors 
and crew would like to finish the job of course marhoul said 
but they have expressed solidarity with the strike and told us 
ok we can wait 
british actor tom courtenay who plays a leading role in the 
movie drew applause from czechoslovak cast members when he told 
them he would not press to finish shooting on schedule next week 
when he must go home 
i was very moved he said in an interview between scenes 
i said i wanted them to know that they have my sympathy and that 
i would be available to return later 
courtenays face was covered with what looked like blood 
no i was not at last fridays demo he said with a smile 
referring to the bloody crackdown at the nov 17 rally that sparked 
the most widespread protests in 20 years 
this is just makeup for the next scene he said but i was 
at a demonstration on tuesday it was exciting 
courtenays many previous films included the loneliness of the 
longdistance runner and dr zhivago 
shooting of the film began last august some scenes were filmed 
at the village of terezin 
director karel kachyna a friend of forman and himself a winner 
of film awards said he hopes to complete the movie in a few weeks 
but i would not rule out a disruption as things are changing 
that fast kachyna said

rural indians took time off from their 
fields and revved up family tractors in thousands of villages to 
join the celebrations that surround the general elections 
bicycles and bullockcarts created traffic jams around polling 
centers veiled women walked alongside sloganshouting children and 
old men were helped into voting booths on the first of three days 
of balloting 
its a festival everyone is having fun said dharam chand 
an election officer in this village 60 miles northwest of new delhi 
next to him on wednesday the line for entering one of the 
village polling centers was growing steadily each cart or tractor 
pulling up at the field in front of the center contained as many as 
20 people 
many were children who formed groups and vied in shouting 
slogans of competing political parties several men settled under 
the shade of a tree to smoke the hookah the pipe passed from 
person to person after each puff before going in to vote 
its my right to vote said karan singh a grayhaired 
farmer when asked why the event was important singh spoke in 
hindi but switched to english to repeat fundamental right 
my wife and daughterinlaw are going in to vote now he 
said pointing to a group of about 10 women joining the queue with 
their heads and faces covered with red and green cotton scarves 
wednesdays polling was held in 15 of the countrys 25 states 
and in five of its seven federallyadministered territories other 
regions go to the polls friday and sunday 
its the elections but it is also a time to meet friends 
gossip a little said chand the election officer most of 
these people have taken a day off from the fields and wont return 
home until late afternoon 
its also very peaceful the police dont have much to do 
he said 
elsewhere in the country there was scattered violence during 
the polling dozens of people were killed in fights between rival 
political groups 
the farmers at meham were reluctant to disclose who they would 
vote for it seems a close battle between the hand and the 
wheel said one referring to the election symbols of the 
governing congress party and the national front an opposition 
coalition 
the national front has mounted a strong challenge to prime 
minister rajiv gandhis congress party and many political analysts 
predict it will form the next government but precise predictions 
are difficult because more than twothirds of the voters live in 
villages often isolated from the election issues considered 
crucial 
we dont know what will happen said the meham farmer but 
well know by monday

space shuttle discoverys 
astronauts deployed a spy satellite today as they whirled around 
earth on a hushhush military mission that began with a dazzling 
nighttime launch 
there was no official confirmation from nasa or the pentagon 
but sources close to the project said the 2ton 300 million 
payload was released from the shuttles cargo bay about 10 hours 
after wednesday nights liftoff 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
satellite was designed to monitor soviet missile tests and listen 
in on military and diplomatic communications in the soviet union 
and other countries 
a militaryimposed news blackout surrounding the flight 
continued today the five crew members first full day in orbit 
they were to have a late thanksgiving dinner of turkey and 
cranberry sauce because of the night launch their schedule had 
them sleeping until after noon est 
the beginning of the classified mission was anything but secret 
as discovery blasted off at 723 pm from cape canaveral fla 
carving a spectacular fiery path across the heavens 
people at the launch site could see it for more than 600 miles 
it was gorgeous it was a bright bright orangy sky said 
dorothy flores of winter park 
the dark sky over the central florida coast turned bright as the 
shuttle lifted almost straight up and headed over the atlantic 
we are delighted with the results said forrest mccartney 
director of the kennedy space center its something that 
americans can be proud and thankful for on thanksgiving 
the liftoff was only the third after dark and the time was 
dictated by the secret cargo and its mission the shuttles ascent 
provided a spectacular view over a large part of florida but 
clouds obscured the visibility for the rest of the southeast 
it was 100 times brighter than a star said glenna milberg 
a television reporter in miami 200 miles south of the launch 
center 
it looked like a roman candle over the citys biscayne bay 
she said 
the national aeronautics and space administration provided 
launch commentary until discovery reached orbit nine minutes after 
liftoff the broadcast system then fell silent until 2 hours 
later when mission control commentator billie deason issued a 
brief status report 
the crew of discovery has been given the go for orbit 
operations the orbiter and crew are performing well ms deason 
said 
the satellite is to be put in orbit 22300 miles over the 
equator with lineofsight to the soviet union china the middle 
east africa and all of europe a similar satellite was released on 
a shuttle flight in 1985 
unless a problem occurs the official silence is expected to 
continue throughout the flight except when nasa gives a 24hour 
advance notice of the shuttles landing 
the flight the fifth dedicated entirely to the military is 
expected to last four days landing will be at edwards air force 
base calif 
according to military officials the secrecy is needed to make 
it more difficult for soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy 
ship off cape canaveral to track the shuttle 
but critics argue that soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly 
knew much about the mission before it launched and are keeping 
track of discovery as it orbits earth 
to celebrate the holiday today a fairly traditional 
thanksgiving meal consisting of turkey and gravy cranberry sauce 
and pumpkin bread was packed aboard the shuttle for the crew 
members 
the commander is air force col frederick d gregory who was 
pilot of the shuttle challenger on a 1985 flight gregory is the 
first black astronaut to command a shuttle mission 
discoverys pilot is air force col john e blaha who is making 
his second flight this year he replaced astronaut s david griggs 
who was killed while practicing stunt flying in june for an air 
show

east germans starting new lives on the 
western side of the berlin wall feasted on turkey cranberry sauce 
and stuffing thursday joining american soldiers for a mess hall 
thanksgiving dinner 
were sharing our holiday with the east germans said maj 
terrence meehan public relations officer for the berlin brigade 
were extending the hand of friendship 
for dessert besides pumpkin pie and hard candies there were 
horns of plenty spilling over with apples bananas grapes and 
oranges set in front of a scale model of the brandenburg gate 
behind a tiny graffiticovered berlin wall 
i never had such a nice dinner i never saw such a variety of 
food said beate chilla who arrived wednesday from east berlin 
with her husband and their two young sons and everythings 
decorated so nicely for the children 
paper napkins and tablecloths featuring orange and brown 
drawings of turkeys covered the mess hall tables at andrews 
barracks a us base on the southern outskirts of west berlin 
dozens of recent east german immigrants were bused from the 
citys marienfelde reception camp to several us army dining 
halls including 49 who crowded in with american soldiers and their 
families at andrews 
its really a symbolic effort limited by the capacity of the 
facilities meehan said just providing special meals to american 
soldiers and their families already makes thanksgiving day a busy 
one for the mess halls he said 
more than 275000 east germans have arrived this year in west 
germany and west berlin the flood of refugees fleeing west through 
czechoslovakia poland and hungary forced the communist leadership 
to lift travel restrictions nov 9 
since then the vast majority of the millions of east germans 
who flocked across to visit the west have returned home but not 
all of them 
in the past two weeks more than 40000 east germans have 
declared their intention to stay in the west the bonn government 
says 
hansjuergen eichler digging into some ham and cranberry sauce 
said he had been seeking permission for two years to emigrate with 
his wife and 15yearold son but was refused because of his 
backing for illegal environmental and human rights groups in east 
germany 
his wife petra had been allowed twice to visit her grandmother

former president chun doohwan in 
selfimposed exile at a buddhist temple after resigning in disgrace 
a year ago said thursday he engaged in some trial and error 
while in office but denied harming south korea 
chun spoke at a ceremony marking the first anniversary of his 
exile at the baekdam temple on the east coast it was his first 
public appearance since he went into exile nov 23 1988 
because of short wisdom and ability i committed some trial 
and error while in office but the claim that i squandered national 
treasure and ruined the country is wrong he said 
during the onehour ceremony chun who has converted to 
buddhism consecrated sarira a relic of buddha and spoke to 
about 5000 people 
chun who stepped down in february 1988 at the end of his 
sevenyear term went into rural exile nine months later after 
apologizing for corruption and misdeeds committed under his 
administration 
he surrendered about 24 million in unused political funds 
before going into exile about a dozen members of his family have 
been arrested on corruption charges 
despite chuns wish to end his exile dissident and radical 
groups vehemently oppose his return to seoul arguing he should be 
arrested tried and punished 
they charge among other things that chun was involved in the 
military crushing of a civil uprising in the southern city of 
kwangju which resulted in some 200 deaths by official count and 
more than 1500 injuries 
critics contend the kwangju incident was part of efforts by 
chun then an army general and his followers to seize power in the 
chaotic days that followed the assassination of president park 
chunghee 
the 58yearold expresident said that while he made some 
mistakes in office he should receive credit for some actions 
including stepping down at the end of his term to pave the way for 
south koreas first peaceful transfer of power 
south korea formed after koreas division in 1945 has had a 
succession of dictatorships and military coups chun himself came 
to power in a coup in late 1979 
i was neither expelled nor dropped out of chongwadae the 
presidential mansion i was graduated chun said referring to 
his stepping down at the end of his constitutional term 
one of chuns close friends roh taewoo succeeded him early 
last year after winning a popular presidential vote 
chun wearing a buddhist monks robe looked healthy as he spoke 
through a microphone 
on many nights i abruptly woke up and bolted from the bed 
vowing to retaliate against several people who turned their backs 
on me he said but my grudge slowly disappeared as i became 
immersed in the profound teaching of buddha 
after all i have become a man who would never lose his 
temper he added 
roh and chun had been close friends through much of their 
careers they are from the same province and graduated from the 
same middle school and the korea military academy roh a former 
army general was closely involved in chuns seizure of power in 
1980 
but newspapers quoting chuns aides reported he now has a 
personal grudge against roh believing roh has been indifferent 
toward him 
a local newspaper quoted chun as saying i have lost a friend 
of 40 years because of politics

washington us experts and czechoslovak exiles give alexander 
dubcek the ousted 1968 prague spring hero whose name is being 
chanted by his countrymen an outside chance of making a political 
comeback 
some said the one time czechoslovak communist party chief who 
turns 68 monday would be ideal for a peaceful transitional role 
us specialists on east europe czechoslovak exiles and 
czechand slovakamericans were asked to weigh the prospects for 
dubcek ousted and thrown into official disgrace after the 1968 
soviet invasion of his homeland 
there is an acute shortage of leadership acceptable to both the 
throngs demonstrating for change and the hard line leaders still in 
power after deposing dubcek a generation ago they said 
i think dubcek is the ideal man acceptable to mikhail 
gorbachev who could maintain some semblance of stability while 
they take time to make serious changes said john hvasta 
executive director of the slovak american national council 
all our slovakamerican organizations are banking on dubeck to 
emerge and maintain stability hvasta said he is the man at 
least for this time no other potential leader that anyone is 
familiar with has emerged who could maneuver a course to stop 
short of an untested situation such as an uprising he added 
like other us czechoslovakwatchers hvasta frequently 
contacts acquaintances in czechoslovakia by directdial telephone 
he quoted one whom he would not identify as saying dubcek 
journeyed this week to prague from his retirement home in 
bratislava capital of slovakia a cheering crowd of 200000 in the 
capital was told friday dubcek would soon appear before them 
restoration of dubcek would not be as simple as it might appear 
experts said even though during the prague spring his countrymen 
idolized him for pioneering reforms now favored by the kremlin 
under gorbachev 
those in power in prague are the very people installed to 
scuttle the prague spring striving constantly since then to 
discredit dubcek and his reforms turning czechoslovakia into one 
of europes most authoritarian countries 
milos jakes now the communist party chief personally led the 
purge of more than 400000 dubcekites forced to support themselves 
at hard labor or menial work at the end of the 1960s most are 
still barred from high profile jobs and many emigrated 
the experts said 20 years of such policy denied the country a 
chance to develop alternative leadership able to take over today 
and pilot czechoslovakia to a soft landing among the democracies 
dubcek could play a every important role in transition said 
a us government expert speaking on condition of anonymity it 
would depend whether socialism is what both sides want he said 
noting that dubcek always reaffirmed his dedication to marxism even 
while blacklisted as the enemy of the communists who succeeded him 
the postdubcek purge created a true leadership gap in 
czechoslovakia aggravated by the young generation staying out of 
public life the source added 
ohio state university historian and journalism professor jiri 
hochman voiced a remote possibility that under the right 
circumstances dubcek might be called to new leadership if the 
russians recommend it 
there is hardly any other possibility to institute order no 
reserve team no known personality hochman said agreeing with 
other experts the leadership is all so terribly discredited 
their recruitment for the last 15 years has been complete 
mediocrity said hochman one of czechoslovakias best known 
journalists and editors until he was purged and imprisoned after 
the soviet invasion 
johns hopkins university professor george liska said the 
czechoslovak communists could use dubcek as a front man for 
continuity but expressed doubt that he would be reelevated to 
leadership 
dubcek is as responsible as anyone for the soviet invasion 
because he failed to control events in 1968 when much could 
have been saved of the prague spring said liska who left 
czechoslovakia at the time of the 1948 communist takeover 
william h luers us ambassador to czechoslovakia in 198386 
said the key actor in changing the leonid brezhnevinstalled 
leadership in prague is likely to be gorbachev who despite his 
nonintervention policy is becoming impatient 
in the past week a new phase began which will end the 
brezhnev era in czechoslovakia as it is ending in hungary poland 
east germany bulgaria and the soviet union luers now president 
of the metropolitan museum of art in new york wrote in a

a corpse weighted down with a concrete 
block was pulled from a well on a farm bringing to five the number 
of bodies discovered in a murder investigation focusing on an 
elderly couple 
the body taken from the 28foot well near ludlow on wednesday 
was that of a man 25 to 30 years old but the identity and cause of 
death were not immediately known the livingston county coroners 
office said 
the discovery came in the seventh week of an investigation into 
the disappearance of drifters hired to work for ray and faye 
copeland a farm couple from nearby mooresville copeland is 75 
his wife 68 
the bodies of four men all of them shot in the head were 
found in shallow graves last month in two barns near the copeland 
farm 
three have been identified and the copelands were charged with 
murder in those deaths they are in jail on 500000 bail each 
the copelands are suspected of killing their employees after 
using them to buy cattle fraudulently prosecutors said they 
believe the couple hired transients set them up with small bank 
accounts then had the employees write checks for cattle the 
checks bounced by which time the employees had disappeared 
investigators used a backhoe to dig 30 feet to the bottom of the 
well after deciding it was too unstable to lower anyone into it 
sheriff leland odell said the well is about 150 yards from a barn 
where the fourth body was found

china on thursday described as unacceptable a 
us congressional bill making it easier for chinese students 
fearing persecution at home to remain in the united states 
foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said the government would 
make some due response to the us legislation but he refused 
to elaborate 
it is international practice to request personnel studying 
abroad to return to the home country and give their service jin 
said china and the united states have reached a clear 
understanding of this in their educational exchanges 
the bill of the us congress runs counter to the agreements 
between the two governments the basis on which the us 
congress proposed such a bill is even more unacceptable he said 
nearly half the estimated 80000 chinese studying abroad are in 
the united states and most hold exchange visitor visas or j 
visas 
the bill passed by both houses of congress would allow them to 
apply for a change in visa status within four years 
currently holders of j visas must return home for at least two 
years before applying to the united states for a different visa 
the bill which president bush is expected to sign into law 
also requires the justice department to give special consideration 
to chinese citizens who seek asylum in the united states because of 
chinas population control policy of allowing only one child per 
couple 
china has insisted there will be no reprisals against the many 
chinese students abroad who participated in prodemocracy 
demonstrations before and after the june 34 military crackdown on 
demonstrators in beijing 
it also has said top priority will be given to finding 
appropriate jobs and ensuring good living conditions for returning 
students 
a serious brain drain of students reluctant to return to china 
has accelerated since the june political turmoil the united states 
and most other western countries already have extended the visas of 
students concerned about political persecution upon their return

in talks with president bush on friday prime 
minister margaret thatcher likely will be seeking support for her 
view that however dramatically europe is changing the nato 
alliance should not lower its guard 
mrs thatcher visits the united states once a year on the 
average and this 24hour trip was arranged weeks before the 
political picture in europe was transformed by the opening of the 
berlin wall 
but the visit to camp david now takes on added significance 
given the wests need to formulate a united response to the 
changes it comes eight days before bushs summit with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev a summit of the 12nation european 
economic community states follows on dec 89 
mrs thatcher told reporters as she left for the airport im 
delighted with his bushs speech last night 
she was referring to bushs televised address to the nation 
wednesday night in which he praised gorbachevs reforms urged him 
to bring down the last barriers and end the cold war and 
promised to support the reforms in eastern europe without taking 
adversarial advantage of them 
after several meetings with gorbachev mrs thatcher is effusive 
in her praise lauding him as a reformer of courage and vision but 
she is also cautious about his chances of completing the revolution 
he has unleashed 
therefore she continues to advocate a strong nato and opposes 
any changes in the present lineup of nato and warsaw pact forces 
lest they become ammunition for gorbachevs hardline foes 
she reiterated this stance in her legislative program for 1990 
which pledged britain to uphold its nato obligations and sustain 
the united kingdoms contribution to western defense by maintaining 
adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces 
giving her view of european events she said times of great 
change are times of great uncertainty even danger 
we have to be prepared for any threat however unexpected as 
events demonstrate ever more conclusively we are winning the 
battle of ideas we must make sure that we dont subsequently lose 
the peace 
she and bush will likely discuss the nato states decision in 
may to defer until 1992 a firm decision on the deployment of new 
shortrange nuclear missiles in west germany 
even before the wall opened west german chancellor helmut kohl 
was balking at having to take new missiles now the task is far 
more complex but mrs thatcher remains committed to it 
domestically the 64yearold prime minister is looking more 
vulnerable than when she last visited washington a year ago to say 
goodbye to her ideological soulmate ronald reagan and welcome 
bush into the fold of western democratic leaders 
resurgent inflation and criticism of her combative style of 
leadership have pushed her as far as 11 points behind the 
opposition labor party in opinion polls 
before the year is out she is likely to face an unprecedented 
formal challenge to her leadership the annual election of 
conservative party leader has been a formality throughout her 10 
years in office but this time rankandfile lawmaker sir anthony 
meyer says he will probably seek her job 
he has no chance of success but says he hopes his move will 
galvanize other disenchanted tories into sending her a message of 
discontent

president bushs thanksgivingeve speech 
appears to have quietened criticism that he has been too timid in 
the face of changes in eastern europe while also reassuring those 
who feared a freewheeling superpower summit next week 
though there will be no surprises sprung on our allies we 
will miss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace 
bush said of his upcoming first meeting as president with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
and to those who question our prudent pace they must 
understand that a time of historic change is no time for 
recklessness he said 
while praising gorbachev and offering him the hand of 
partnership bush made clear his agenda for the dec 23 meeting 
with gorbachev off the mediterranean island of malta it is the 
soviets not westerners who must keep moving 
he said the kremlin has made progress but still had room to 
improve urging gorbachev to curtail military aid to cuba and 
nicaragua 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash previously had 
criticized bush as being perhaps too detached and too calm too 
relaxed about things that are truly exciting 
foley recalled that when solidarity leader lech walesa appeared 
last week before a joint meeting of congress there was a sense 
of electricity in the chamber of enthusiasm and celebration and 
excitement 
after bushs speech wednesday night foley applauded the 
president for echoing those feelings 
democrats now expect the president to approach these historic 
issues with determination and prudence foley said on cable news 
network 
in his speech bush said he will seek gorbachevs assurance 
that this process of reform in eastern europe will continue 
he did not mention requests from the soviets and poland for 
american economic advice and assistance but did say he had sought a 
meeting with gorbachev to forge a new partnership 
as we begin the next decade i am reaching out to president 
gorbachev asking him to work with me to bring down the last 
barriers to a new world with a new europe rising on the 
foundations of democracy he said 
while some critics had focused on what they viewed as bushs 
timidity others had expressed worries that his first meeting as 
president with gorbachev might resemble the 1986 summit at 
reykjavik iceland 
unexpectedly president reagan and gorbachev used that occasion 
to discuss eliminating their entire nuclear arsenals in the end 
they parted angrily over the us star wars program 
sen charles robb dva said bush kept expectations about 
where they ought to be 
i was concerned at reykjavik because it seemed to me that 
gorbachev and president reagan had somehow become involved in a 
higher stakes poker game than i thought they ought to be at that 
particular point said robb 
in his address bush said the events in eastern europe still 
have not removed the invisible walls of suspicion doubt 
misunderstanding and miscalculation between east and west 
this is a first meeting a time for exploration it is not a 
time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next 
years summit he said referring to a meeting scheduled in the 
united states next spring or summer 
reaffirming the need of the united states to move in step with 
its allies in the north atlantic treaty organization bush said he 
would travel straight from malta to nato headquarters in belgium 
i will assure them that no matter how dramatic the change in 
eastern europe or in the soviet union itself the united states 
will continue to stand with our allies and our friends he said

polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the east 
blocs only noncommunist head of government arrived in moscow 
thursday night hoping to place relations with the soviet union on 
an equal footing 
more than 40 years of communist rule in poland ended in august 
when the polish parliament elected mazowiecki a former solidarity 
trade union editor and close adviser to lech walesa to lead the 
new government 
the prime minister has said poland will respect its warsaw pact 
obligations but that relations with the soviet union long 
dominated by moscow must be based on reciprocity 
mazowiecki flying on a special polish miliary aircraft landed 
at moscows vnukovo airport and was welcomed by a small group of 
soviet officials led by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
the polish leader was given a large bouquet of pink roses by two 
polish children who live in moscow a motorcade then whisked him 
into town where he is scheduled to begin meetings friday with 
kremlin officials including president mikhail s gorbachev 
although bound by economic and military treaties to moscow the 
new polish government is emotionally distant 
mazowieckis first foreign trip took him to rome to meet with 
polishborn pope john paul ii and not to moscow as tradition 
required of his communist predecessors 
nevertheless the new polish government recognizes the 
importance of economic relations with its powerful neighbor 
poland would like to renegotiate the terms of trade with the 
soviet union which accounts for onethird of polands foreign 
trade a highlevel delegation of economic officials is 
accompanying mazowiecki 
the soviet union supplies almost all of polands oil natural 
gas and iron ore as well as many of its cars planes washing 
machines and televisions 
poland is seeking soviet support as it makes the transition to a 
marketoriented economy and tries to make its currency the zloty 
convertible on world money markets 
during his fiveday visit mazowiecki also intends to seek 
improvement in the situation of an estimated 2 million ethnic poles 
who live in the soviet union 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the 
kremlin expects the polish leaders visit to improve relations 
we expect the positive development of sovietpolish relations to 
continue after tadeusz mazowieckis visit gerasimov told a 
government news briefing 
in warsaw polish government spokeswoman malgorzata 
niezabitowska said the situation in east germany and the issue of 
german reunification would be among the political issues discussed 
during mazowieckis visit 
both poland and the soviet union suffered from german aggression 
in the past and appear wary of the potential reemergence of a 
unified powerful german nation in the heart of europe 
after two full days of talks and meetings in moscow with 
gorbachev ryzhkov and other soviet officials mazowiecki is to 
focus on religion and the painful legacy of world war ii 
a roman catholic the polish leader is to travel sunday to the 
city of zagorsk site of a wellknown russian orthodox monastery 
later that day he is scheduled to travel west to the katyn 
forest where more than 4300 polish officers were murdered in world 
war ii the soviets originally blamed the nazis but polish members 
of a joint sovietpolish historical commission created to study the 
massacre said this year there was no reasonable doubt the soviets 
were responsible 
during a visit to poland on oct 2425 to prepare mazowieckis 
trip soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the 
kremlin was committed to establishing the truth about who killed 
the polish officers 
gerasimov also said that blank spots in the history of 
sovietpolish relations must be filled in 
both poland and ourselves should now look forward and think 
how to improve relations he said their development is 
sometimes hindered by efforts to cling to the past the sooner 
these issues are resolved the better

a court has decided no trial will be held 
in belgium on the 1987 zeebrugge ferry disaster that killed 193 
people because the ship and all its victims were british officials 
said thursday 
judge arthur dhoest had been working on the case for two years 
and will turn over thousands of pages of his work to british 
officials said spokesman filip van belle 
court proceedings have opened in britain against the owners of 
the capsized herald of free enterprise and seven employees a 
trial in britain could start early next year 
the bruges court based its decision not to pursue a trial in 
belgium on a 1961 international treaty stipulating that trials in 
such disasters can be held in the country of the ships flag 
the court found there was no need for a trial since no belgian 
interests were involved van belle also said two trials would be 
too confusing and a waste of time 
the herald of free enterprise capsized in less than a minute on 
march 6 1987 just outside zeebrugge harbor

it was late at night and the sandinista search 
for those elusive nicaraguan contras was on after two hours of 
frustration the sandinistas decided to call it a night 
the scene was not a remote nicaraguan battlefield but a 
nondescript office building a few blocks from the white house 
where sandinista and contra negotiators had spent seven days trying 
to work out a ceasefire 
on the night in question the contras took a recess from the 
talks and caucused among themselves leaving the sandinista 
delegation in the dark as to their whereabouts two hours passed 
there was no sign of the contras 
we dont know where they are the chief sandinistas 
negotiator victor hugo tinoco told reporters after deciding he 
had waited long enough this building is rather large he left 
the episode seemed to crystallize the inability of the two sides 
to achieve harmony even on relatively simple issues this past 
tuesday the talks were suspended indefinitely both sides agreeing 
their efforts were going nowhere 
the pattern resembles what has been happening in other regional 
conflicts angola afghanistan and cambodia 
in each instance the ussoviet dimension of the conflict has 
diminished but long years of accumulated mistrust among local 
rivals are impeding negotiated settlements accordingly the 
warfare continues albeit at differing levels of intensity 
in nicaragua the united states suspended military aid to the 
contra rebels almost two years ago the fighting continues with 
each side accusing the other of being the obstacle to peace 
indeed the collapse of the nicaraguan ceasefire talks combined 
with the escalated fighting in el salvador in recent weeks has 
raised doubts whether the central america peace process which has 
boasted a number of highly touted peace breakthroughs is still 
viable 
a peace settlement in nicaragua will hinge largely on whether 
the national elections set for february produce a result that 
nicaraguans of all political colors can live with or at least 
accept as legitimate 
in el salvador there is nothing to indicate that the government 
and the rebels have the political will to negotiate their 
differences 
angolas experience is somewhat similar to central america just 
weeks ago there were hopes for a ceasefire followed by talks on 
national reconciliation between the leftist government and the 
usbacked rebels 
instead fighting has escalated recently us officials believe 
the more militant factions in the angolan government leadership 
have the upper hand over those favoring a political settlement 
meanwhile the eastwest dimension of the 14yearold conflict 
in angola has diminished with the continuing withdrawal of what had 
been a 50000strong cuban troop presence all the cubans are due 
to be home by early 1991 but moscow and washington are continuing 
to arm their respective allies 
in afghanistan the soviets completed their withdrawal more than 
nine months ago but there is nothing resembling a peace process 
between the warring faction and soviet and american weapons 
continue to pour in 
in cambodia troops from the prosoviet government in vietnam 
have left after a 10year stay but once again a political 
settlement seems beyond reach at the moment 
the incumbent government in phnom penh has refused to consider 
any role in a transition arrangement for the khmer rouge because of 
the mass killings they carried out when they ruled cambodia during 
the latter half of the 1970s 
the khmer rouge remain a force to be reckoned because of the 
large and powerful guerrilla army they have developed since their 
ouster from power 
while the superpower component of all the conflicts has been

israel wont be drawn into the lebanese 
conflict again and lebanons christian army commander gen michel 
aoun will pay the price for his mistakes a government 
official said thursday 
syria has accused aoun of involvement in the assassination 
wednesday of new president rene mouawad a christian rival of the 
general aoun denies it 
we dont support gen aoun said yossi olmert director of 
the israeli government press office we are not in the pocket of 
any lebanese warlord no lebanese warlord is in our pocket 
israel was allied with the christians when it invaded lebanon in 
1982 to drive out the plo but has taken an increasingly neutral 
position since withdrawing in 1985 from all but a border security 
zone in south lebanon 
iraq has backed aoun because of its enmity for syria and olmert 
claimed the palestine liberation organization also supports the 
christian generals efforts to drive syrian forces out of lebanon 
the arab enemies of syria do not happen to be our friends 
olmert said in an interview and added about aoun he will do 
what he likes to do and he will pay the price it is his problem 
mouawad was killed 17 days after parliament elected him with a 
mandate to seek an end to the 14yearold lebanese civil war in 
which more than 150000 people have been killed 
aoun called him a syrian lackey 
israeli officials warned lebanese factions and syria not to take 
advantage of instability following the assassination to threaten 
israels security 
we say to everybody concerned lebanese and others they 
should not infringe on our vital security interest in south 
lebanon said olmert a former professor of middle east studies 
at tel aviv university

reeling from the pace of political and 
economic changes the soviet military alliance in eastern europe is 
looking more like nato its members are quarreling among 
themselves administration sources say 
the disagreements are largely over procedural matters and have 
not disrupted negotiations nor undermined the soviet blocs 
position on cutting troops in europe the sources said likening 
them to disputes within nato 
delegates from czechoslovakia and bulgaria where reforms have 
been slow to take hold do not fully trust negotiators from poland 
hungary and east germany where changes have been quicker the 
sources said 
as a result the czechs and bulgarians have balked at exchanging 
data and disagreed with their warsaw pact allies on where to hold 
strategy sessions said the sources speaking on the condition they 
not be identified further 
the rancor illustrates how the rapid change in eastern europe 
and talk of a reunification of east and west germany are forcing 
the us and soviet military alliances to review their roles 
the issue of germany the nature of nato the nature of 
europe are all up for discussion and need to be reconsidered 
former white house national security adviser henry kissinger said 
last sunday on abctv 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has proposed that the 
eastern and western military alliances be scrapped and that the 
superpowers withdraw their forces from europe 
president bush has rejected that idea repeating in his 
thanksgiving address that in a new europe the american role may 
change in form but not in fundamentals 
bushs first stop after his summit next week with gorbachev will 
be to consult with nato allies in belgium even if us and soviet 
forces are significantly reduced he said we will remain in 
europe as long as our friends want and need us 
the north atlantic treaty organization which includes the 
united states and 15 other nations will play a role in europe no 
matter what happens on the eastern side of the division said 
francis fukiyama deputy director of policy planning at the state 
department 
but fukiyama added everyone is looking with uncertainty at 
the future of the warsaw pact 
so far the reform governments in poland and hungary have 
pledged to remain in the pact but changes in those two nations 
will oblige the soviets to reform the alliance which unlike nato 
is a purely military rather than a political and military 
coalition said a senior solidarity official who visited washington 
last week with lech walesa 
this is an idea we are passing along to the soviets just to 
sleep on said janusz onyszkiewicz the solidarity national 
spokesman and deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee in 
the lower house of the polish parliament 
the soviets have already woken up to the idea said yuri 
davydov head of european studies at the usacanada institute a 
moscow think tank 
the warsaw treaty organization needs a structure more similar 
to that of nato davydov said 
in the past the communist party leaders of warsaw pact members 
met regularly to review policy but that process has lost meaning 
because poland has a solidarityled government and hungary has 
scrapped its communist party 
fukiyama davydov and onyszkiewicz said in separate interviews 
it is likely that the warsaw pact will establish something akin to 
the secretariat nato has in belgium leaders of its member 
countries and their defense and foreign ministers would then hold 
regular consultations like those of nato 
they have no choice but to change the structure of the warsaw 
treaty organization said the state departments fukiyama it 
is going to have to be an alliance of free countries along the 
lines of nato i think we have to encourage that 
meanwhile the bush administrations byword is caution 
our attitude must be that we not be seen pushing for the 
breakup of the warsaw pact that is a matter for those countries to 
decide fukiyama said 
dissolving either alliance would be a mistake both will be 
needed to stabilize europe during rapid change said zbigniew 
brzezinski who was president carters national security adviser 
a more stable way to establish a framework for a more unified 
europe would be not to abolish the alliances but to use them as 
pillars for a new order of shared geopolitical interests 
brzezinski said in a speech during walesas visit 
brzezinski said he envisions a europe in which some nations 
could belong to a reformed warsaw pact and at the same time be 
affiliated with the european common market 
the key reason for preserving the alliances is to assure that a 
united germany would not threaten europe said francois heisbourg 
head of the londonbased international institute for strategic 
studies 
there could be a threat if germany reunited outside of the 
alliance system heisbourg said on abc 
dismembering the warsaw pact would not guarantee the withdrawal 
of the half million soviet troops in east germany poland and 
czechoslovakia because moscow has bilateral security arrangements 
with those countries 
but those troops concentrated in east germany worry some 
soviets 
we are ready to liquidate our military presence in europe as a 
whole said davydov stressing that the red army has no 
security role to play in central europe now that eastwest 
tensions are reduced 
moreover davydov said these troops in east germany cannot 
play any political role the presence of these troops irritates 
people

parliament probably will convene friday 
to choose a successor to president rene mouawad who was slain 
while forming a government he hoped could end lebanons civil war 
an aide to the speaker reported 
flags flew at half staff church bells tolled and a general 
strike brought life to a standstill in syriancontrolled regions in 
mourning for mouawad who was assassinated wednesday 
hussein husseini the shiite moslem speaker of parliament 
tentatively set the session for friday at the kleiat airbase in 
syriancontrolled north lebanon his aide said 
mouawad was elected nov 5 in a session held at kleiat because 
gen michel aoun the christian military commander threatened to 
shell the parliament building in beirut a new lebanese peace plan 
which aoun opposes was approved the same day 
in damascus the syrian defense minister accused aoun of 
ordering mouawad killed in order to undermine the peace agreement 
we shall cut off the hand which has assassinate lebanese 
legitimacy and very soon lt gen mustafa tlass said 
thursday he did not elaborate 
iranian state radio said a foreign ministry official urged 
lebanese moslems to confront this new conspiracy aimed at 
bolstering aoun 
the general denied involvement and in a statement thursday 
said mouawad was a national martyr because he was murdered in the 
shadow of syrian occupation 
four israeli phantom jets attacked guerrilla bases at sultan 
yaaqoub and nearby deir zanoun close to syria in east lebanon 
police reported one guerrilla killed and four wounded at bases of 
the syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
israel has made 14 previous raids into lebanon this year in 
which 17 people were reported killed and 103 wounded 
aouns christian forces and druse militiamen allied with syria 
skirmished after sundown in hills southeast of beirut no 
casualties were reported 
the fighting and the tlass declaration added to fears that a 
2monthold truce would collapse because of the death of mouawad a 
64yearold maronite catholic who was trying to end a sectarian 
civil war that has taken more than 150000 lives in 14 years 
mouawad and 23 other people were killed by a remotecontrolled 
bomb that exploded in a street of moslem west beirut as his 
motorcade passed police said thousands of people had fled beirut 
since the assassination to safer parts of the country 
aoun opposes the peace accord reached by lebanese legislators 
oct 24 in taif saudia arabia because it does not guarantee 
speedy withdrawal of the 40000 syrian soldiers stationed in 
lebanon the general also said mouawads election was illegal and 
called him a syrian lackey 
husseinis aide said the air base had been told planes carrying 
some of the lebanese legislators currently abroad could arrive at 
any moment 
fortythree moslem and christian lawmakers drove from west 
beirut to mouawads hometown of zgorta in north lebanon on thursday 
to offer condolences to his family and be on hand for the session 
the speaker is trying to convene parliament to elect a new 
president before mouawads funeral saturday in zgorta and will 
announce the final date for the session once he is sure that a 
quorum is guaranteed the aide said 
in order to elect a head of state 48 deputies must be present 
twothirds of the 72 surviving since the last election in 1972 
among the leading candidates the aide said are deputies butros 
harb fuad naffaa and pierre helou 
all are maronites as lebanese presidents have been since 
independence from france in 1943 under terms of an unwritten 
covenant the president is christian the prime minister sunni 
moslem and the parliament speaker shiite moslem 
harb leads a powerful maronite clan naffaa is a former foreign 
minister and helou is a businessman they have good relations with 
lebanese moslems and with syria the countrys main power broker 
political sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
tougher candidate such as former president suleiman franjieh would 
be more likely if there were plans to move against aoun 
franjieh a powerful prosyrian maronite chieftain from zgorta 
is the only person capable of shouldering the responsibility of 
confronting aoun militarily one said hes not the type of man 
who would leave the presidential palace under aouns control 
aoun occupies a bunker under the presidential palace at baabda 
east of beirut and refused to turn the residence over to mouawad 
the palace was battered by shellfire during an artillery war 
between aouns men and the syrians that lasted six months until the 
arab league arranged a truce sept 22 
the general had led a christian government in competition with 
a moslem cabinet since president amin gemayels sixyear term 
ended in september 1988 with parliament unable to agree on a 
successor

a newspaper reported thursday it discovered 
security breaches at the london home of prime minister margaret 
thatcher and other government leaders that leave them vulnerable to 
terrorist attack 
the report in the daily mail comes four days after a police 
warning to public figures to take extra security measures following 
attacks on the british mainland by the irish republican army 
the paper printed a picture that it said showed the view from an 
easily accessible foreign office window overlooking the rear of 
downing street where the residences of mrs thatcher and other 
government members are located 
this is the view which could put members of the cabinet in the 
sights of the ira gang roaming britain the newspaper said 
from this foreign office window a sniper would have a 
commanding position over the area around downing street the 
newspaper said the prime minister herself could easily come 
within range 
mrs thatchers official residence is at no 10 downing st 
even more alarming than the snipers position was the 
knowledge that a bomber could easily leave delayed action 
explosives in exposed walls and floors while restoration work is 
being carried out the daily mail said 
the story by daily mail reporter paul henderson said all i 
had to do to reach this vantage point to the rear of 12 downing 
st was to walk past a single security officer and into an area of 
the foreign office being renovated by workmen 
i was not challenged i needed no pass and i remained inside 
for 10 minutes taking pictures all around there were the voices of 
irish workmen 
irishmen building workers have for decades been prominent on 
construction sites in britain and high unemployment in ireland has 
increased the number in recent years 
a foreign office spokesman who in accordance with british 
practice declined to be identifed said i am aware of the 
allegations we will investigate any claim that there has been a 
breach of foreign office security and we will look into it most 
carefully we take such stories very seriously 
henderson reported the security lapse was pointed out by laborer 
tom mansell who was working for a company of subcontractors 
employed to clean stonework 
according to henderson mansell told him workers were entering 
the foreign office by using security passes issued to other 
tradesmen henderson said security passes were switched to avoid 
having to go through lengthy checks 
commander george churchillcoleman the head of scotland yards 
antiterrorist branch on sunday told public figures in mainland 
britain and security force personnel to take extra security 
measures in the wake of ira attacks 
the ira claimed responsibility for planting a bomb found nov 14 
outside the london home of lt gen sir david ramsbotham commander 
of the british field army and inspector general of the reserve 
army the bomb was defused 
the ira also claimed responsibility for a bomb attack at the 
garrison town of colchester in eastern england on saturday that 
severed the legs of an army sergeant 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting british rule in 
northern ireland it wants to unite the predominantly protestant 
province with the mainly catholic republic of ireland under 
socialist rule

a woman was shot to death in 
the crowded nablus market thursday and moments later masked men 
paraded through the market and said through loudspeakers that she 
was killed for collaborating with israel 
the 35yearold victim was one of three palestinians killed 
thursday in nablus and in the nearby village of beit umrin the 
second palestinian was shot in a clash with soldiers and the third 
was killed by a suspected collaborator 
shoppers scattered in fright through the narrow crowded alleys 
of nablus central market when haniya swissa was shot at about 11 
am 
witnesses said a lone arab walked up to the woman asked if her 
name was swissa and opened fire at close range when she replied 
yes 
men in masks then marched through the crowd and accused her of 
having cooperated with israeli authorities

blamed for killing at least 15 alleged collaborators said the 
group would kill anyone who works with israel even israelis if 
ordered to do so by plo chief yasser arafat 
did you hear about the woman who was killed now is the time 
to punish collaborators when we have orders from arafat well

of the west bank and gaza strip should not become an armed struggle 
against israelis he has refused to condemn killings of 
collaborators but has called for caution in passing the death 
sentence 
people in nablus say one such statement of caution was aimed at 
the black panthers who initially were aligned with arafats 
mainstream plo fatah faction but later adopted a more independent 
line

killed by fellow arabs during the uprising most have been accused 
of informing on uprising activists or otherwise collaborating with

suspected sinhalese radicals killed a 
south korean engineer who tried to stop them from setting fire to 
his companys vehicles and 10 other people were killed in ethnic 
violence officials said thursday 
the military officials who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules said jun herchoi was killed wednesday in kurunegele 
district 85 miles northeast of colombo 
at least 10 other people including six suspected sinhalese 
radicals were killed across the island nation in violence 
associated with the sinhalese uprising since wednesday they said 
jun was killed when at least 40 radicals attacked the offices of 
keanan a south korean road construction company and began setting 
vehicles on fire the officials said jun 32 tried to intervene 
and was killed 
at least 6000 people have died since the uprising against the 
sinhalesedominated government was launched by the radicals in july 
1987 only a few foreigners have died in the sinhalese violence 
in eastern sri lanka at least four people were reported killed 
in areas where a new tamil militia has been attacking the 
predominantly sinhalese army and police force 
residents of ampara 125 miles east of colombo said two members 
of the tamil national army were killed thursday when the militia 
exchanged mortar fire with the sri lankan army 
the tamil national army claimed to have killed nine sri lankan 
soldiers but this was denied by military officials in colombo 
the officials said however that unidentified gunmen killed two 
tamil civilians wednesday in ampara 
sri lankas traditional conflict has been between the sinhalese 
majority and the tamil minority but the violence has turned into a 
tangle of disputes 
in 1983 tamil guerrillas started their violent campaign for a 
separate state in northeastern sri lanka where most tamils live 
in 1987 indian peacekeeping troops were sent to the northeast to 
enforce a peace pact 
in the meantime sinhalese extremists were outraged by the 
sinhalesedominated governments attempts to make peace with the 
tamils spearheaded by the radical peoples liberation front they 
claimed too many concessions were being given to the tamils 
the front started assassinating government officials and 
supporters 
so far at least 11000 people have died in the tamil 
insurrection while another 6000 have been killed in the sinhalese 
feuds 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists make up 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people tamils comprise 18 percent and say the 
sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and education 
there also is a small moslem minority that in the past two years 
has come under attack from tamil guerrillas

about 300000 people jammed 
wenceslas square on thursday to demand democratic reforms capping 
a week of unprecedented protest but the military warned it stands 
ready to defend the achievements of socialism 
vaclav havel the nations leading dissident told the largest 
rally yet to assemble in prague we will never return to the old 
system of totalitarian rule 
alexander dubcek the ousted crusader for reform addressed tens 
of thousands at an antigovernment rally in bratislava his 
hometown and the nations secondlargest city the state ctk news 
agency said 
the highly popular dubcek led the prague spring reform 
movement which was crushed by a sovietled invasion in 1968 
in an apparent reference to those events he called for a 
renewal of society but warned protesters against making extreme 
demands that could have tragic consequences 
also thursday a top communist official said the ruling party 
would discuss personnel changes in the leadership at a meeting of 
the of the central committee on friday in seven days of protests 
demands have mounted for the resignation of the hardline 
leadership 
havel called on the nations military and police forces to 
stand by the people for the first time 
but the military issued an entirely different message 
in a statement carried by ctk it said we reject the anarchy 
spread by antisocialist forces from within and abroad we actively 
support the efforts of the central committee the federal 
government and the majority of our working people 
it added it was prepared to defend the achievements of 
socialism 
among the top military leaders said to have endorsed the 
statement was defense minister milan vaclavik 
earlier communist party chief milos jakes hinted he would not 
suppress the demonstrations he told a delegation of party and 
trade union officials and coal miners the leadership will use 
political means to halt the negative development in society ctk 
reported 
havel also told the crowd thursday that we will never give up 
our ideal of a free democratic and prosperous czechoslovakia no 
matter what happens 
taking aim at the communist leadership havel said we shall 
see whether our country will reach democracy in a political way or 
whether an isolated group of sadists will prevail who want at any 
cost to hide their power and privileges by empty words about 
reform 
the crowd responded by shouting resign and shame 
in addition to prague and bratislava state media said there 
were antigovernment protests thursday in the cities of usci nad 
labem with 12000 demonstrators plzen which had 30000 hradec 
kralove with several thousand ostrava with 3000 and eanska 
eystrica with 5000 
another activist the rev vaclav maly told the crowd that 500 
businesses had expressed support for the oppositions call for a 
work stoppage on monday 
dubcek had been expected to speak at the prague rally but 
stayed in bratislava 
although some members of the ruling party have appeared anxious 
to end the growing unrest by meeting with opposition and church 
leaders there are indications of a major rift within the party on 
how to handle the biggest challenge to the government since 1968 
security police thursday ordered top officials of the nations 
statecontrolled tv not to broadcast live footage of the rally 
police were posted at the stations central news office said an 
employee who spoke on condition of anonymity

the head of the communist party said 
thursday the solidarityled governments promarket policies will 
return poland to capitalism and hurt the people the official news 
agency pap reported 
mieczyslaw f rakowski who led the government for nine months 
until july criticized the government of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki at a meeting of a special parliament commission 
investigating rakowskis tenure as prime minister 
the current government has announced a radical course and 
economic decisions which will hurt and badly at that i cannot 
reply how society will stand these blows pap quoted him as 
saying 
solidarity leader lech walesa returned thursday from a twoweek 
visit to the united states canada and venezuela and said poland 
was ready for foreign investment 
for more than 20 years the image of poland was different and 
people did not trust us he told reporters they thought we 
were waiting here with a knife between our teeth that we would 
take away their capital and nationalize it 
since the new government took over poland is a better place 
for making business than the united states he said we have 
done our best for better business and it is time for foreign 
investors to take advantage of it 
rakowski accused the government of violating the roundtable 
agreements on economic and political reform earlier this year 
those agreements led to legalization of solidarity after a 
sevenyear ban and to partially free june elections in which the 
independent trade union dealt the communist party a humiliating 
defeat 
after the communist party failed to form a government 
parliament chose mazowiecki a former solidarity editor and a 
walesa adviser in july to lead a new cabinet that ended more than 
40 years of communist rule 
the governments economic program is marketoriented and calls 
for changes in property laws that left many state enterprises under 
the control of the communist party 
it follows from the statements of some ministers of the 
current government or the commentators associated with them that 
their goal is the return of poland to capitalism rakowski said 
as far as i remember the new economic order which was 
outlined at the round table did not envisage polands return to 
capitalism 
the parliamentary commission has said the rakowski government 
ran the government into debt and contributed to polands current 
economic difficulties rakowski says his government was not in 
power long enough to do real damage 
another pap dispatch said parliament voted thursday to disband 
the paramilitary volunteer police force known as ormo solidarity 
lawmakers who proposed the legislation said the volunteer force was 
a relic of stalinism 
official reports put the strength of ormo at 328510 including 
both communist party members and noncommunists

west german merchant seaman of spying on military facilities near 
transit waterways and sentenced him to five years in prison 
the trial against the west german identified only as 
24yearold peter s was the first espionage proceeding open to 
the public the court also issued one of the lightest sentences 
ever handed down in east germany after conviction on spy charges 
the berlin military high court accused the west german 
intelligence agency the bundesnachrichtendienst of luring the 
young seaman into espionage 
there was no immediate comment from the west german government 
in bonn

inexperienced man in debt the court rejected prosecution calls for 
a sevenyear sentence despite finding the seaman guilty 
the court said the sailor was paid about 160 per month for 
intelligence gathered during passage through transit waterways that 
flank east german territory 
the defendant was said to have earned altogether about 6000 
over two years for spying using the money to pay off debts 
the case also marked the first time a west german charged with 
espionage in east germany was allowed to have with him at the trial 
a diplomat from the legal affairs department of bonns permanent

communist east germany on thursday lifted 
bans on a dozen films it had called subversive since the mid60s 
and president egon krenz attended one screening a director said it 
marked the end of cultural censorship 
director frank beyer blacklisted for eight years after 
authorities banned his film trail of stones broke into tears 
at a news conference with government officials 
krenz who is also communist party chief was among hundreds who 
packed an east berlin movie house thursday night for the first 
showing of trail of stones in 23 years he applauded at the end 
of the movie 
the film focuses on a mason and the party official running a big 
construction site where the mason works conflict erupts when the 
workers are told to work harder without getting more materials 
officials said they expect to exhume many other films that ran 
afoul of the party line over the years including cartoons 
documentaries and tv productions 
today marks the start of publicly dealing with a terrible 
intervention in arts and culture said horst pehnert the 
governments deputy culture minister responsible for films 
the action is among reforms that east german officials have made 
since hardline leader erich honecker was ousted oct 18 
most of the films were banned after a december 1965 meeting of 
the communist partys policysetting central committee that 
included walter ulbricht east germanys first leader and 
honecker who succeeded him 
beyers film considered among east germanys finest was pulled 
back shortly after release in 1966 when authorities deemed it 
defamatory toward the communist system 
the filmmaker was banned from making feature films for eight 
years as punishment 
beyer 57 broke into tears as he read the names of several 
fellow cultural figures who were muzzled or forced to emigrate 
under hardline stalinism which he called the basic evil in 
east german history 
ralf richter head of a new official commission investigating 
censorship of feature and television films said directors and 
critics have tried for years to bring these films back to the 
public but failed because no one dared to question official 
unscrupulousness and abuse of power 
the panel will proceed on the assumption that all film 
censorship of the past was unjustified he told reporters 
he suggested the movies though a quartercentury old could 
contain themes relevant to east germanys current reform efforts 
tickets were sold out for thursday night showing of trail of 
stones at the 550seat international theater 
officially sponsored rowdies disrupted the films july 1966 
premiere at the same theater days later the film was banned under 
a culture ministry order 
beyer credited the popular uprising that has forced a leadership 
change and moves toward reform in east germany for reviving freedom 
in the nations film theaters 
asked whether the end of cultural censorship was at hand he 
replied yes i believe that is so 
director kurt maetzig said he cried when he saw his i am the 
rabbit at a special showing thursday the film was never shown in 
east germany after its completion in 1965 
maetzig 78 said he regretted an apology that he made to 
authorites in order to continue making films 
i did it in the hope of preventing the witch hunt back then 
he said east germany also recently lifted a ban on several 
antistalinist soviet films and the soviet periodical sputnik 
which published an article that east german authorities found 
offensive

soviet bloc reform helped increase eastwest trade 
this year and has set the stage for more economic integration in 
europe says a un report released thursday 
it also said structural problems and noncompetitive industries 
made prospects uncertain for further export growth in soviet union 
and eastern europe 
the report by the economic commission for europe cited hungary 
and poland as examples in urging more foreign investment as a spur 
to economic liberalization the commission is the only economic 
forum bringing together eastern and western europe the soviet 
union united states and canada 
in its assessment the 34nation commission predicted the soviet 
blocs debt to the west this year will remain at last years level 
of about 99 billion with romanias repayment of foreign loans 
helping offset a predicted increase for the soviet union 
growth in east european exports to western market economies 
slowed to 4 percent in the first half of 1989 from 6 percent in 
1988 slackening further as the year progressed the report said 
by contrast after three years of stagnation the increase in 
imports by eastern europe shot up to 13 percent mainly because of 
more purchases by east germany poland and hungary 
despite increasing sales opportunities in the west the report 
said poor commodity structure and declining competitiveness of its 
manufactured goods made it uncertain whether eastern europe could 
expand exports in the future 
sales of soviet goods to the west grew by 9 percent between 
january and june and imports increased 11 percent it said 
the soviet trade deficit with the west increased in 1989 despite 
favorable developments caused by the strengthening of oil prices 
and the dollar and the commission predicted a growth of the 
deficit to more than 4 billion for the year compared with 27 
billion in 1988 
it said the soviet debt probably will increase by as much as 4 
billion by the end of the year to 28 billion 
turning to the poland and hungary the report said the 
approximately 5 billion in financial assistance offered by 24 
western nations probably will be supplemented by loans totaling 1 
billion from the international monetary fund and world bank 
those loans in turn would open the way for more debtrelief 
measures from western creditors to the tune of up to 6 billion 
it said 
further stimulation of direct investment flows would be most 
desirable to increase production capacity which would allow the 
loans to be repaid in the future the report said

former chancellor willy brandt of west germany 
said thursday that western financial help to encourage reform in 
east europe must not be granted at the expense of development aid 
to the third world 
in an opening speech at a twoday meeting of the socialist 
international council brandt described the changes sweeping the 
soviet bloc as the growingtogether of europe and called for an 
alleuropean environmental agency as part of this process 
he welcomed the european communitys awareness of the need 
for more productive economic cooperation between east and west 
the delegates also heard a call thursday for a change in us 
policy toward el salvador 
the us government must be requested to take on a more 
constructive attitude to a political and not a military solution 
said hector oqueli of the national revolutionary movement a 
salvadoran opposition party 
we are alarmed that the united states does not want 
perestroika in satellite countries in central america said 
oqueli referring to the reform fostered by soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
he asked the rightwing salvadoran government to begin new peace 
negotiations with the leftist rebel movement to end fighting that 
has killed more than 1000 people in the largest guerrilla 
offensive of the 10yearold civil war 
brandt president of socialist international and the 1971 nobel 
peace laureate told the twiceyearly council meeting he had one 
serious reservation about growing eastwest cooperation 
many in the third world express the fear that what is going on 
may mean a lessening of interest shown in the development 
process of the south he said 
he spoke of the risk that western money to help boost the 
flagging economies of reforming east bloc countries might mean a 
diversion of funds away from the third world 
a closed sesion of the council meeting is expected to discuss 
membership bids from east european social democratic parties which 
have traditionally operated in exile 
the social democratic party of hungary illegal until recently 
has applied for full membership of the international body as has 
hungarys governing socialist party 
the east german social democratic party set up last month has 
asked for observer status with the organization brandt said 
under socialist international rules only those parties 
operating in a multiparty system can be full members

democratic parties of the soviet republics of latvia lithuania and 
estonia the hungarian and czechoslovak social democratic parties

will not change its course 
ramiz alia in comments carried by the official albanian news

also exist exploitation social injustice and oppression

east germanys communist party has opened a 
disciplinary investigation against former leader erich honecker and 
expelled one of his former top lieutenants from the party state 
media said thursday 
also thursday communist party chief egon krenz told west german 
tv he is ready to step down if that is the decision of next months 
party congress 
i am not clinging to any personal power and certainly not to 
any function krenz told ardtv 
the east german state news agency adn said the proceedings 
against honecker former economic adviser guenter mittag and two 
other former officials were based on grave abuses of the party 
charter and responsibility for the current situation in the 
party and the country 
mittag was thrown out of the party the announcement said last 
month he lost his seat on the ruling politburo along with honecker 
east german officials already have said a parliamentary 
commission was looking into charges of misuse of power and 
corruption against honecker and his inner circle 
an earlier dispatch from adn said doctors had decided that 
honecker was too ill to make any statements in the proceedings 
honecker 77 has had severe medical problems since a gallbladder 
operation this year 
krenz told ard he had talked several times to honecker by 
telephone and that the former leader accepts that he is largely 
responsible for this situation a reference to east germanys 
political crisis 
krenz also said honecker was too ill to make any public 
statements 
the west german newspaper bild reported wednesday that mittag 
63 was interrogated for 14 hours last week about reports he 
stashed hundreds of millions of marks in swiss banks 
on oct 18 honecker was replaced by krenz after the worst 
unrest in the nations 40year history and the exodus of tens of 
thousands of east germans dissatisfied with honeckers years of 
stringent rule 
a special communist party congress next month is expected to 
make more changes in the east german leadership krenz is expected 
to meet with chancellor helmut kohl of west germany after that 
kohl had indicated he wanted to visit next month but the east 
german calendar has gotten so full that kohl spokesman hans klein 
told reporters in bonn on thursday that the chancellor will likely 
wait until early january 
the east germany government announced earlier thursday it will 
send security agents into stores frequented by foreigners as part 
of a major effort to stop the flood of goods over the newly opened 
borders 
the new measures will particularly affect poles who have been 
pouring into east germany and buying up subsidized items to resell 
in their shortageplagued homeland 
since east germany opened its borders nov 9 the communist 
government has been wrestling with a growing black market and 
smuggling on a scale not seen since before the berlin wall was 
built in 1961 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer announced the antismuggling 
measures at a news conference and said they will take effect friday 
the new measures do not address the smuggling of east german 
marks but meyer ruled out devaluing the currency to make smuggling 
less attractive 
meyer said the crackdown will include restricting sales of 
certain goods such as some clothes and foods to east germans and 
to foreign workers living in the country 
most polish people traveling between west germany and west 
berlin wont be allowed to stop in east germany he said 
in addition meyer said customs inspectors and internal security 
agents both plainclothes and in uniform will be deployed in east 
german stores frequented by foreigners to aid in the crackdown on 
statesubsidized goods leaving the country the customs force also 
will be increased 
he ruled out general searches of all travelers and insisted the 
government has no intention of cutting back on the new freedom to 
travel across the border 
meyer did not comment on the increasingly tense situation in 
czechoslovakia which was the subject of a surprisingly candid 
report thursday in east germanys governmentrun newspaper der 
morgen 
the newspaper denounced east germanys role in the 1968 
sovietled invasion that crushed a reform movement in 
czechosolovakia and it said east germany should help its neighbor 
achieve change 
for a week thousands of czechoslovaks have turned out for 
prodemocracy protests in their country where hardline leaders 
are resisting the east bloc reforms introduced by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
despite the lifting of travel restrictions thousands of people 
continue to go west to live 
west german officials said more than 40000 east germans have 
arrived since the travel restrictions were lifted nov 9 
as of wednesday nearly 11 million east german citizens had 
received visas to travel to the west east germany has a population 
of 165 million

president alfredo cristiani 
rejected a guerrilla ceasefire proposal thursday and said an 
11day rebel offensive had been defeated but small bombs went off 
nearby during the news conference 
the renewed proposal by the leftist guerrillas for a negotiated 
ceasefire was propaganda the rightwing president told a 
large gathering of reporters at military headquarters 
shortly after the news conference began suspected rebels 
apparently tried to steal the show by setting off at least five 
small bombs in a ravine about five blocks away a military officer 
said the explosives were guerrilla homemade bombs 
the news conference continued as helicopters roared overhead 
dropping bombs and rocketing the slopes of a volcano in apparent 
retaliation 
cristiani who was surprised but maintained his composure said 
the farabundo marti national liberation front tried to spark a 
popular uprising to topple the government 
they tried it and lost said cristiani he said the fmln had 
to come to its senses and stop its aggression against the people 
then we can sit down to look at the few things we can do to 
facilitate their incorporation into the democratic process 
hopes that talks would begin under the auspices of venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez were dashed with the announcement 
that only guerrilla officials would meet with perez 
cristiani said the guerrillas had used the peace process for 
propaganda purposes while preparing the 11day offensive that began 
nov 11 
the guerrillas had virtually the entire foreign press corps for 
an audience when they set the small bombs cristiani jumped but 
kept talking telling everyone not to worry 
at one point he knocked over a chair as he reached for a 
cigarette and several times he mopped his brow the conference was 
held in an openair pavillion at military headquarters which has 
been attacked numerous times during this nations 10year civil war 
the guerrillas had already proved their ability to launch 
attacks anywhere in the city and cristiani said anybody with a 
small group of people could launch terrorism 
fighting thursday flared in apopa eight miles north of the 
capital soldiers were ambushed while buying soft drinks at a 
roadside stand but suffered no casualties dozens of government 
troopcarrying helicopters came and went from an air base near the 
city and the air force bombed a hillside near apopa 
san salvadors 1 million residents worked to clean up after the 
rebel offensive and return the capital to some semblance of 
normality 
people lined up for gas food and medical supplies at the 
soyapango cemetery east of the city gravediggers buried five 
bodies that had been left at the cemetery gates and said they 
expected more work 
truck driver israel herrera stood in a line of 50 people at a 
natural gas distributorship in soyapango saying he ran out of the 
fuel a week ago 
weve been cooking with wood he said since i dont have 
any fuel for the truck im spending my days in line 
fighting in san salvador ended wednesday morning after 12 us 
army green berets left the sheraton hotel that had been seized by 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
the hotel is not now part of the usbased chain 
on wednesday night the fmln renewed its ceasefire proposal but 
included language the government rejected earlier saying a 
ceasefire had to be defined 
rebelgovernment meetings in september and october foundered on 
that point 
they have always tried to change what it means to have a 
ceasefire said sandoval who repeated the government position 
that any truce should begin at once with details to be arranged 
later 
the rebels who amended their proposal thursday to say they 
would cooperate in negotiating terms of a ceasefire say that 
a ceasefire without terms works only for the government 
the guerrilla proposal also asked that the armed forces be 
represented at the talks another demand rejected previously the 
rebels say the army holds the real power 
the guerrillas said they launched their offensive to persuade 
the cristiani government that they could not be defeated and would 
have to be taken into account if the country was to have peace the 
10yearold insurrection has cost about 71000 lives

discoverys astronauts reportedly 
put a spy satellite in orbit thursday to complete the main task of 
their secret mission before a thanksgiving meal of irradiated 
turkey and freezedried vegetables 
there was no official confirmation from nasa or the pentagon 
but sources close to the project said the 2ton 300 million 
payload was released from the shuttles cargo bay about 10 hours 
after wednesdays dazzling nighttime liftoff 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
satellite was capable of monitoring soviet missile tests and 
eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications in the 
soviet union and other countries 
they had no information on how well the satellite was operating 
a similar satellite was launched by a shuttle crew in 1985 
a militaryimposed news blackout surrounding most of the flight 
was lifted briefly thursday evening when nasa announced that the 
shuttle would land sunday night at edwards air force base calif 
mission control commentator billie deason said discovery is 
scheduled to return to earth at about 702 pm pst 
the crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform 
satisfactorily she said in the brief status report 
the five crew members meanwhile continued to whirl around the 
earth their words heard only in secure control centers in houston 
and sunnyvale calif 
because of the nighttime launch the astronauts were to have 
slept until early afternoon est and then were to have celebrated 
thanksgiving with a feast of turkey vegetables and cranberry sauce 
with the satellite deployed the crew could turn attention to 
experiments for the star wars missile defense system and other 
military projects 
the commander is air force col frederick d gregory and his 
crew is made up of air force col john blaha the pilot and three 
mission specialists navy capt manley carter jr f story 
musgrave and kathryn c thornton 
a blazing 700foot tail of engine fire illuminated the night as 
discovery darted toward orbit wednesday the sky was so clear 
people at the launch site could see the exhaust for 7 minutes out 
to a distance of more than 600 miles 
it was 100 times brighter than a star said glenna milberg 
a tv reporter in miami 200 miles south of the launch center it 
looked like a roman candle 
the shuttles ascent provided a spectacular view over a large 
part of florida but clouds obscured the visibility for the rest of 
the southeast 
it was the third afterdark liftoff in 32 shuttle missions and 
the time was dictated by the secret cargo and its mission 
the satellite was to be maneuvered into a stationary orbit 
22300 miles above the equator with lineofsight to the soviet 
union china the middle east africa and all of europe 
the flight is the fifth shuttle mission dedicated solely to the 
military the pentagon said the secrecy is necessary to make it 
more difficult for the soviets to track the shuttle and learn its 
purpose

hungary and the vatican have agreed to resume formal 
diplomatic relations after a 44year hiatus a leading hungarian 
official said thursday 
hungary would become the second warsaw pact country to establish 
ties with the papal state since pope john paul iis native poland 
did so in july 
the two sides agreed that no obstacles exist to resuming 
diplomatic relations in the imminent future said barna sarkadi 
nagy head of the governments secretariat for church affairs 
after three days of talks with vatican officials he gave no date 
the vatican made no immediate comment but officials have 
previously indicated a resumption of diplomatic ties was possible 
with hungary which has enacted democratic reform in recent months 
nagy speaking at a news conference at the hungarian embassy 
said a vatican delegation will travel to hungary next month or in 
early january to conclude the negotiations 
the next round of talks he said will be to decide on the final 
text of notes the two sides will exchange when relations are 
reestablished the meeting will also allow vatican officials the 
chance to choose headquarters for their envoy in budapest the 
hungarian capital 
the rapprochement with hungary marks another sign of the steady 
improvement in vatican relations with the east bloc underscored by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs scheduled meeting with the 
pope next week 
hungary broke relations with the vatican in 1945 expelling the 
holy sees envoy from budapest the two sides resumed contacts in 
1964 but nagy said the turning point came this year when hungary 
embraced a program of democracy human rights and religious freedom 
nagy said roman catholics make up the largest religious group in 
hungary comprising about 36 percent of the total population of 
106 million 
a major issue of contention between hungary and the vatican has 
been the case of the late hungarian cardinal jozsef mindszenty who 
was tried by the government in 1949 and convicted of treason the 
church said the charges were false and the trial rigged 
mindszenty was freed from prison by hungarian revolutionaries 
during the 1956 antisoviet uprising and took refuge in the us 
mission in budapest when soviet tanks crushed the revolt he left 
his asylum in 1971 under an agreement with the vatican and died in 
vienna in 1975 at age 83 
nagy said government authorities are reexamining the case and 
are expected to announce their findings soon

archbishop robert runcie of canterbury 
said thursday that churches in eastern europe must not seek to 
replace crumbling communist parties as instruments for ideology 
in a speech to the european parliament runcie also urged the 
assembly to continue to question capitalism 
runcie heads the anglican communion a global family of churches 
with 70 million members he is also the spiritual leader of the 
church of england and president of the british council of churches 
while it looks as if at the moment communism has lost the 
battle for hearts and minds in europe it certainly cannot be said 
that capitalism as a total world view has won runcie said 
he said recent events in east germany are as much a 
vindication of protestantism as are the events in poland of 
catholicism 
yet churches there should not seek to replace the communist 
party as an organ for ideological purity 
christian faith is not an ideology the archbishop said 
runcie said that despite recent democratic reform in eastern 
europe we must not shut our eyes or close our ears to the world 
no europe is worthy of the name if it is not open to the 
world 
he cautioned against seeing the changes in europe as an allout 
victory for capitalism 
the nearer capitalism comes to triumphing totally the more 
questions are raised about its capacity to be magnanimous in 
victory to heed the cries of the poor at home and abroad to seek 
the paths of peace and to care tenderly for the earth runcie 
said 
he said urgent solutions must be found to global environmental 
problems 
we are part of our environment if it dies so do we he 
said 
runcie said churches have had to add to the struggle for justice 
and peace the fight for the environment the fight for the 
integrity of creation

an unmanned barge carrying 5 million 
gallons of jet fuel drifted for more than a day near the site of 
the exxon valdez spill before a tug roped the vessel thursday the 
coast guard said 
at one point the 400foot barge drifted within 1 miles of a 
reef but did not run aground guard spokesman ted french said 
the barge broke loose from a tug in stormy weather tuesday 
afternoon 20 miles south of cape st elias in the gulf of alaska 
near the entrance to prince william sound coast guard officials 
said they do not know why the barge broke free 
a tug skipper reported the incident to the coast guard in valdez 
the crew of a coast guard plane spotted the barge wednesday and 
a guard helicopter dropped a radio buoy with a strobe light onto 
it french said by early thursday the tug that reported the 
incident had the barge on a towline and was taking it to port 
etches on hinchenbrook island about 10 miles away the guard said 
once in port hookup adjustments will be made to tow the barge 
about 360 miles to anchorage its original destination guard 
spokesman john baker said the guard initially said the destination 
was whittier about 100 miles away but baker said that report was 
mistaken 
tenfoot seas had prevented crews from making the hookup 
adjustments in open waters baker said 
before the barge was brought under tow officials had considered 
bringing in an army ordnance team to blow up the barge and burn off 
the fuel to prevent it from running aground and spilling its cargo 
the barge went adrift about 20 miles south of prince william 
sound where the exxon valdez hit a reef on march 24 and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil the worst spill in us 
history 
the barge is owned by crowley maritime corp of seattle

prime minister margaret thatcher rebuffed an 
unprecedented challenge to her leadership of the governing 
conservative party by saying in an interview published friday she 
is ready to fight two more general elections 
the times of london quoted her as saying this week by popular 
acclaim in the party i am happy to carry on 
the paper described it as an astonishing move by the 64yearold 
mrs thatcher who on thursday flew to the united states for talks 
with president bush 
she came to power when the conservatives won the 1979 general 
election she is now in her third term after conservative victories 
in the 1983 and 1987 general elections 
but her government is increasingly unpopular due in part to a 
73 percent annual inflation rate interest rates at 15 percent 
planned changes to the free national health service and a widely 
disliked new local government tax 
the conservatives now trail the opposition labor party by up to 
13 points in opinion polls 
mrs thatchers standing as party leader was badly dented when 
nigel lawson resigned as chancellor of the exchequer and sir alan 
walters resigned as her personal economic adviser both on oct 26 
they quit following a row between them over currency strategy 
lawson was incensed by mrs thatchers refusal to heed his demands 
for her to sack walters after the row blew up 
the times said the interview with the prime minister was 
conducted this week but did not state the day 
it said mrs thatchers announcement that she is ready to fight 
two more elections can be expected to goad her opponents in the 
party into new determination to challenge her leadership 
the next general election is due by mid1992 the one after by 
mid1997 in october 1997 mrs thatcher will be 72 
deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe joined party chairman 
kenneth baker and tory elder statesman lord whitelaw on thursday in 
denouncing attempts to unseat her 
they were reacting to an announcement wednesday by rankandfile 
tory legislator sir anthony meyer that he will challenge mrs 
thatcher for the leadership when she comes up for her annual 
reelection 
meyer conceded he was an outsider with no chance of defeating 
her but said he would go ahead with his candidacy unless a 
higherprofile nominee emerged 
meyer said he hoped to provoke sufficient abstentions to send 
her a message of disenchantment and possibly lure a major 
challenger into the race if it goes to a second round of voting 
howe and baker are regarded as possible thatcher successors but 
both made clear their distaste for a contest 
no tory has run against mrs thatcher since she became party 
leader 14 years ago but lately economic troubles her prickly 
personality and her resistance to deeper british integration into 
the european economic community have stirred dissent in the party 
party rules require the leadership election to be held by dec 
19 she must win the votes of at least 57 percent of the 374 tories 
in the house of commons to win outright

hundreds of supermarket shopping carts 
held hostage by the city were released this week after the southern 
california grocers association agreed to donate food to the needy 
the city council passed an ordinance about a year ago allowing 
its crews to impound shopping carts left on streets and sidewalks 
in glendale just north of los angeles the city would return the 
carts worth up to 100 each only after stores paid a 15 fee 
the city had collected about 800 abandoned shopping carts the 
two biggest supermarket chains affected ralphs and vons would 
have had to come up with about 4000 each to get theirs back 
councilman larry zarian suggested the city waive the fee if the 
stores donate food to glendales charitable organizations 
its appropriate during this holiday season to give to the 
poor and needy he said 
grocers association president steven koff said details of the 
food donation plan havent been worked out 
meanwhile the council passed a law tuesday allowing free return 
of carts to markets that agree to test a cartcontrol system for 90 
days the electronic system is designed to automatically lock the 
wheels of carts taken off a grocery stores property

officials threw out thousands of 
parliamentary election ballots thursday as the governing party and 
the opposition traded charges of fraud voter intimidation and 
violence fortyeight people have been killed 
the election commission also ordered an investigation into 
charges of widespread voterigging in the constituency where prime 
minister rajiv gandhi is seeking reelection on the ticket of his 
congress party 
security forces braced for more violence in the 10 states and 
two federally ruled territories that began voting friday the 
second of the threeday polls 
authorities in particular feared violence in northern bihar an 
impoverished state with a reputation for corruption and fistfight 
democracy polls opened friday in bihar and voting was to 
continue on sunday the last day of the election 
at least 92 people including three independent candidates have 
been killed since elections were announced oct 17 the ninth since 
india won independence from britain in 1947 
gandhi appealed to indians to refrain from violence in the final 
two days of voting 
there is no place for violence in our democratic system the 
prime minister said a news conference in uttar pradesh where he 
went to see a former ally critically wounded in a shootout a day 
earlier he later called off the visit fearing tensions with 
opposition supporters 
the national front a looseknit coalition of five opposition 
parties accused gandhi and his congress party of engineering the 
violence 
his intentions are most suspect and he is up to all kinds of 
mischief including murder of individuals and democracy said 
yashwant sinha a spokesman for the janata dal peoples party 
the main force in the national front 
gandhi who was propelled to power hours after the 1984 
assassination of his mother and predecessor prime minister indira 
gandhi has been the main issue in the monthlong campaign the 
oppositions plank has centered around the 45yearold prime 
ministers alleged corruption and ineptitude 
the congress party has sought to portray the elections as a 
choice between stability and chaos maintaining the oppositions 
newly found unity will quickly shatter if it is voted to power but 
opinion polls show gandhi and his party are in serious trouble and 
in danger of losing 
at stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the lok sabha or house of 
the people the lawmaking lower house of parliament several races 
have been postponed because of incomplete voter rolls and 
candidates deaths 
voting ends sunday but the results are not expected until 
sunday night and monday 
the election commission tossed out thousands of suspected 
fraudalent ballots cast wednesday at more than 600 polling booths 
in six states and sent a team to investigate charges of vote fraud 
in the amethi constituency where gandhi is facing raj mohan 
gandhi the grandson of indias beloved independence leader 
mohandas k gandhi 
anand sharma the congress partys chief spokesman labeled the 
opposition charges as another orchestrated drama to malign the 
prime minister and a smokescreeen to cover the brutal and 
ferocious assaults by the opposition 
among those injured in wednesdays violence was sanjay singh an 
opposition leader who was gandhis campaign manager in the december 
1984 elections he defected to the opposition two years ago with 
his wifes uncle and the man expected to become prime minister if 
the opposition wins vishwanath pratap singh 
according to the national front sanjay singh was wounded during 
a shootout wednesday during voting in amethi constituency a remote 
rural area in northern uttar pradesh state two opposition workers 
also were wounded one of them seriously 
the prime minister said he had asked the uttar pradesh 
government to thoroughly investigate the shooting but denied 
congress party workers were responsible for the shooting 
it is not in the interest of the party to introduce violence 
in the polling because the majority of voters are voting for us 
he said 
sanjay singh was unconscious and in critical condition at a 
hospital in the state capital of lucknow following a threehour 
operation to remove bullets from his stomach 
he is still with us but hovering between life and death 
sinha told a news conference in new delhi 
lc jain the campaign manager for raj mohan gandhi said 
congress party goons hoodlums and gangsters took over polling 
booths in amethi constituency and stuffed ballot boxes he and 
other opposition politicians and supporters asked the election 
commission to invalidate the ballots and order another poll 
sharma the congress party spokesman dismissed the request 
the people have voted there is no need to interfere he said 
election commissioner rvs peri sastri said a special team had 
been sent to amethi to investigate allegations of vote rigging 
we will withyhold the results from amethi until the inquiry is 
completed said sastri who noted the commission had received 
complainits of fraud and violence from almost all the 221 
constituencies that conducted polls wednesday no date was set for 
the new polls

possible mediator in peace talks 
perez conferred with officials of president alfredo cristianis 
rightwing government earlier in the week and told reporters

see the whole region covered with democratic regimes he said 
i will say the same things to the representatives of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front that i said to the 
ministers of the cristiani government we need to look for sincere 
solutions perez said 
leftist guerrillas have fought ussupported governments in el 
salvador for a decade and 71000 people have been killed most of 
them civilians 
the venezuelan president said a ceasefire should be a 
precondition to peace talks and cautioned against increased us 
military involvement 
latin americans we have to know how to respond on our own and 
solve our own problems he told a news conference at the 
presidential palace 
members of the palace guard surrounded the presidential beach 
retreat of la guzmania in the port city of la guaira north of 
caracas where the conference presumably would be held 
unconfirmed reports said one of the rebels attending would be 
shafik handal said to be their top military strategist 
guerrilla and government delegations met earlier this year in 
mexico and costa rica and agreed to resume negotiations in caracas 
this week the guerrillas broke off talks earlier this month to 
protest the bombing of a union hall in el salvador that killed 10 
people and began their offensive nov 11

a regional prosecutor said thursday he 
has decided not to indict five executives of a governmentowned 
arms company for illegally exporting antitank weapons 
prosecutor ulf barckholst said in a statement that the five 
current or former managers had reason to believe that the 
government was aware of the sales and that consequently he could 
not prosecute them for violating government regulations 
neutral sweden has strict regulations forbidding the sale of 
weapons to countries at war or in areas of conflict all sales must 
be approved in advance by the governmentappointed war materials 
inspector 
a report by swedens attorney general in february showed that 
since 1963 forenade fabriksverken ffv circumvented the rules by 
exporting weapons via london through an agreement signed with the 
british defense ministry 
with great britain as a middleman ffv sold the carl gustaf 
antitank grenade launcher to several countries in africa and the 
middle east for 20 years 
the attorney general in his report said he expected the five 
executives to be prosecuted but barckholst said that they had 
reason to believe that the so called englandagreements were known 
to the government 
barckholst also was investigating ffvs alleged export of the 
carl gustaf to cambodia via singapore

as skiers around the nation prepare to hit the 
slopes resorts retailers and equipmentmakers are working on new 
strategies to introduce nonskiers to the spirit of the sport 
the message to the public is that skiing can be safe and 
exciting that the costs are exaggerated and that a vacation 
doesnt even have to include schussing down a mountain 
we used to sell ski vacations said peggy wedd a 
spokeswoman for aspen skiing co in aspen colo now we sell 
winter vacations 
according to industry estimates the number of skier visits has 
grown about 5 percent over five seasons to 533 million this past 
year one skier visit represents one person visiting a ski area for 
any part of a day 
theres a feeling that were not growing as much as we would 
like to see said bernard weichsel program administrator for ski 
usa an international marketing firm for us ski resorts 
the industry is not about to die he said but we want to 
undertake a massive effort to get new people 
this fall the national ski areas association joined forces with 
ski industries america which represents manufacturers and 
distributors of ski equipment to form the united ski industries 
association this new umbrella group has launched a multimillion 
dollar marketing campaign to try to attract new skiers 
its a sign of a maturing industry that it must have a well 
thought out strategy said weichsel who was in boston recently 
for a ski show its not being done as an act of desperation 
the campaign is aimed at the millions of americans who are 
considered to be sports and outdoor enthusiasts but who have never 
skied or have tried the sport but did not continue 
resorts however are not relying on the campaign to attract new 
clientele 
the stowe resort in vermont is offering people who have never 
skied a beginning lesson for 40 that also includes a season pass 
for use on a ski lift that serves the beginner slopes 
what our hopes are is that they will get a lot of mileage out 
of this and clearly come back to ski said gary kiedaisch 
president and general manager of mount mansfield co which owns 
stowe 
we really want them on the hill and experiencing the sport 
he said 
at aspen officials have started marketing the resort by placing 
advertisements in nonskiing magazines the ads show simple 
mountain scenes instead of skiers blasting through deep powder 
we went more for the natural beauty of the area wedd said 
sometimes you have a couple where one person skis and one 
doesnt she said both can come and have fun 
by using the areas nonskiing attractions as bait the resort 
hopes people who dont ski will come to aspen and then decide to 
give the sport a try 
part of the goal is to overcome perceptions that skiing is too 
expensive or too dangerous 
christopher leake vice president of merchandising for the ski 
market ltd inc a chain of ski stores in the northeast said 
while equipment can cost hundreds of dollars beginners are 
encouraged to rent equipment and purchase items one step at a time 
lift tickets can run more than 30 for the day but leake noted 
that interest in golfing has exploded in recent years despite green 
fees that are even more expensive 
finally regarding the fear factor leake said theres 
also that general exhilaration factor were trying to 
demonstrate that this is a lot of fun 
if the marketing effort pays off some ski areas could find 
themselves with an overload of customers weichsel said a lot of 
major areas are maxed out 
but stowes kiedaisch said his resort has excess capacity and 
has planned for a surge in beginner skiers we wont get blind 
sided he said

londons advance was largely fueled by the trade report which

betterthanexpected 29 billion in october from a revised 
shortfall of 3 billion in september 
the financial markets had expected a gap of 3 billion 
dealers said the news eased worries that a widening of the trade 
deficit would quickly translate into a sharp drop in sterling and 
trigger another rise in british interest rates which already stand 
at 15 percent

the scandal that forced a prime minister from 
office and has bedeviled the governing party for more than a year 
finally surfaces in court friday with issues that cut deeply into 
the structure of japanese society 
in trying those charged in the recruit scandal prosecutors must 
show when a gift becomes a bribe the determination by the court 
could become a severe test of the close links between business and 
government in japan 
the answers wont be known in full for years given the slow 
pace of justice in japan 
the recruit case is not just another political corruption 
trial but it is a challenge to the way japan inc is set up 
today said hiroshi itakura professor of criminal law at nippon 
university using a term that refers to the close postwar 
cooperation between business and government 
for those implicated in the case it is almost as if they were 
doing what everyone else was doing and one day they woke up and 
found themselves being criminal defendants in one of the largest 
bribery cases in history he said 
the scandal centers on an ambitious entrepreneur hiromasa ezoe 
who showered senior politicians and bureaucrats with huge donations 
and discounted shares in a subsidiary of his conglomerate recruit 
co 
because the alleged corruption was so widespread the scandal 
caused public uproar and forced noboru takeshita to step down as 
prime minister in june takeshita was found to have received 14 
million in questionable yet legal donations from recruit 
the scandal drove dozens of powerful men out of the political 
limelight and directly contributed to the governing liberal 
democratic partys unprecedented defeat in an election for the 
upper house of parliament in july 
the party still is struggling with the influencepeddling 
scandal ahead of elections expected early next year for the more 
powerful lower house the trials starting in tokyo district court 
raise the possibility of further damaging disclosures 
after an eightmonth investigation by the tokyo district public 
prosecutors office two politicians six bureaucrats and four 
recruit executives including ezoe were charged with bribery 
which carries a maximum fiveyear prison sentence 
five separate trials will start between friday and dec 15 with 
the first involving takashi kato a former vice minister of labor 
and masao tatsumi a former recruit executive tatsumi is charged 
with bribing kato with 3000 shares in a recruit subsidiary to help 
recruits publishing business 
defendants whose trials start later include takao fujinami a 
former chief cabinet secretary and hisashi shinto exchairman of 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp japans largest company 
analysts say prosecutors are likely to encounter difficulties in 
substantiating bribery because sending gifts and donations to 
politicians and bureaucrats is a common business practice 
the japanese exchange gifts not only on special occasions like 
birthdays and holidays but also are virtually required to bring 
something when only visiting friends 
guests commonly give 140 to 210 at weddings or funerals 
college students often give gifts to professors according to a 
1988 survey an average japanese family spends 1040 a year on 
gifts 
if you are a japanese and visit your friend emptyhanded your 
friend will probably think you are strange if he does not get 
offended said tetsuro murobushi who has writen many books on 
political corruption 
the question in the recruit case is whether a clear 
distinction between bribe and gift can be established or not 
japanese companies can legally make up to 210000 in political 
donations a year and they have skirted this limit by buying 
tickets to politicians fundraising parties companies also treat 
politicians and public officials to dinners and golf outings 
corporate managers say such treatment is not aimed at winning 
specific favors but to keep close relations with supervising 
agencies and politicians who may make their business easier in the 
long run 
in japan gifts function as a lubricant between business 
partners neighbors teachers and students and politicians and 
businessmen said itakura 
strictly speaking all of them are bribery by western 
standards and i personally think its not a desirable custom he 
said but if you are a businessman and if you dont send gifts 
while everyone else does you are likely to end up losing business 
to your competitors

international business machines corp confirmed 
it has cut radiation emissions in its newest largecomputer 
terminals and will make similar changes in future personal 
computers 
ibm said wednesday there was no evidence that electromagnetic 
radiation from video display terminals was a health hazard but 
said it took the step because of demand from customers 
particularly in europe 
the step was applauded by 9 to 5 national association of 
working women which along with other groups has expressed concern 
that radiation from vdts might contribute to birth defects 
scientific evidence about the health risk of vdt radiation has 
been inconclusive a federally funded study on 8000 women office 
workers at mount sinai school of medicine in new york city is 
aiming to resolve persistent questions 
electromagnetic radiation is different from and generally less 
harmful than the ionizing radiation of xrays 
although ibm is often a pacesetter other computer makers said 
they had no immediate plans to follow the lead of the worlds 
largest computer company 
we havent seen a groundswell of demand for products that have 
lower emissions and we havent seen any strong evidence that 
theres a link between the use of vdts and various health 
concerns said nora rice a spokeswoman for compaq computer corp 
in houston 
ibm found a way to cut radiation from display terminals and 
incorporated the technology into its infowindow displays for 
mainframe and midsized computers which were introduced in 
september 
the company mentioned the radiation reduction in its european 
press materials but not in the us press materials 
ibm plans to incorporate the technology into future personal 
computers as well said paul snayd manager of ibms vdt and 
ergonomics project office he said he could not say when those 
products might reach the market some analysts have predicted a new 
pc or workstation from ibm next year 
ibm will not retrofit existing computers because it believes all 
are safe snayd said 
customers in sweden and denmark began demanding lowerradiation 
displays after a 1986 conference in sweden on the health effects of 
nonionizing radiation snayd said the demand later spread 
throughout much of europe he said 
i would classify it in the us as being an emerging customer 
requirement snayd said 
he said the infowindow displays meet the swedish standard of a 
20 millitesla magnetic field at a range of 50 centimeters he said 
typical personal computers give off from 20 to 200 milliteslas 
ellen bravo 9 to 5s associate director said she hoped other 
computer manufacturers would follow suit ibms move was also 
praised by companies that offer products to protect against 
radiation 
i think its been a long time coming and i am delighted 
said michael hiles president and chief executive of norad corp in 
santa monica calif which makes radiation shields for pcs 
safe computing co of needham mass offers a flatpanel screen 
that does not give off any electromagnetic radiation 
no one knows what level of exposure is harmful and when 
theres zeroradiation technology available that should be the 
obvious choice for people that are concerned about the radiation 
said allen nitschelm the executive vice president

economic and political reforms in the soviet bloc 
have helped boost eastwest trade this year and set the scene for 
greater economic integration in europe a un report said thursday 
the many new developments the more relaxed political 
atmosphere further progress in economic reform clearly indicate 
that eastwest economic relations are entering a new phase said 
the report prepared by the economic commission for europe 
these relations have been characterized by an unprecedented 
confluence of developments set in motion by economic and political 
reforms under way in a number of eastern countries it said 
but the report warned that structural problems and uncompetitive 
industries made prospects uncertain for continued increases in 
exports from the soviet union and eastern europe 
the economic commission for europe predicted that the soviet 
blocs net indebtedness to the west in 1989 would remain at last 
years level of about 99 billion with romanias repayment of 
foreign loans helping to offset a predicted increase in the soviet 
unions debt 
the 34nation commission is the only economic forum bringing 
together eastern and western europe the soviet union the united 
states and canada 
growth in east european exports slowed to 4 percent in the first 
half of 1989 from 6 percent in 1988 the report said 
by contrast after three years of stagnation the increase in 
the volume of imports by east european countries shot up to 13 
percent mainly due to higher purchases by east germany poland and 
hungary 
the report warned that despite increased opportunities to sell 
goods to the west the declining competitiveness of manufactured 
goods makes further expansion of exports from east europe uncertain 
east europes net indebtedness however was expected to decline 
2 billion in 1989 to 71 billion partly because of the 
appreciation of the us dollar 
sales of soviet goods to the west expanded by 9 percent between 
january and june while the growth of imports increased to 11 
percent imports continued to grow in the third quarter of the 
year although exports fell back markedly the report said 
the soviet trade deficit with the west widened during 1989 
despite the favorable price developments caused by stronger oil 
prices and a higher us dollar 
the report called for more measures to encourage foreign 
investment

investor george gillett has been forced to extend 
the restructuring of 507 million in junk bonds for troubled sci 
television inc because of a weak response from wall street the 
company and investors said 
sci said in a brief statement wednesday that virtually none of 
its bondholders agreed to swap their highinterest debt for a 
39percent nonvoting stake in the company 
sci said investors holding just 37000 of the 507 million in 
debt had agreed to gilletts offer sci extended the deadline until 
dec 4 and said further extensions are possible 
if the restructuring fails gillett holdings which has a 55 
percent share in sci could forfeit its 100 million investment in 
the company which it owns with the new york buyout firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co 
sci owns tv stations wsbk in boston wjbk in detroit wjw in 
cleveland witi in milwaukee knsd in san diego and waga in atlanta 
gillett also owns the vail and beaver creek ski resorts but he 
has said he will not sell the resorts 
gillett had proposed extending some loans and cutting the 
interest rates on publicly traded sci bonds in exchange for the 
nonvoting stake in the company but bondholders have said they 
want more equity and faster repayments 
the company is continuing talks with a bondholders committee 
and other debt holders 
according to sources quoted thursday by the denver post 
investors said gillett either will pull off the restructuring or be 
forced to sell more assets 
gillett had tried to sell scis cleveland station earlier this 
year but called off the deal because of a weak market 
last week three sci bondholders filed an involuntary bankruptcy 
petition against sci at the end of a 30day grace period after 
gillett failed to meet an oct 15 interest payment 
a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition would require the company to 
sell off its assets to satisfy creditors the company has 20 days 
to respond to the petition

the first soybean that can be fed 
directly to livestock will be on the market in 1991 and overseas 
shipments may contain a few red white and blue beans to promote 
us farmers 
researchers at the university of illinois this week announced 
the development of the new kunitz soybean which requires no 
expensive processing for use as animal feed 
it could save livestock producers 13 to 14 cents a bushel 
increase soybean demand in countries with limited crushing 
facilities and raise the price paid to farmers for beans said 
lloyd anderson of the illinois soybean checkoff board 
kunitz offers countries the opportunity to improve 
production efficiency and the standard of living for their 
people said anderson 
the key is the lack of a substance called the trypsin inhibitor 
in the new soybeans 
the trypsin inhibitor prevents livestock from efficiently 
digesting the protein in soybeans until now beans had to be 
processed and toasted to cook out the trypsin inhibitor 
but university plant geneticist theodore hymowitz whose work 
was funded with about 230000 from illinois soybean farmers 
identified a south korean variety that lacked the trypsin inhibitor 
using genetic engineering hymowitz combined traits from the 
korean soybean and the williams 82 a commercial us variety 
the seeds are identical with the exception that the williams 
82 has the trypsin inhibitor and the kunitz bean does not said 
hymowitz 
preliminary tests at the university showed that yields of the 
kunitz soybean are as good as popular varieties now grown by us 
farmers 
hogs gained weight as fast eating corn and unprocessed kunitz 
soybeans as they do eating corn and processed soybean meal poultry 
feeding trials yielded similar results 
it will be used by domestic hog producers and by exporters who 
will send it to countries like russia where there are no 
processing facilities and farmers could feed it directly to their 
hogs said peter salm a plant breeder at illinois foundation 
seed inc 
the urbanabased company will raise kunitz soybeans next season 
to multiply the volume of seed and commercial farmers should be 
able to grow the new soybean in 1991 
salm said the new soybeans may be sold overseas in bags that 
contain a few beans that have been tinted red white and blue so 
customers know they are getting a unique product from us farmers 
there are a whole variety of ways to market specialty crops 
said salm we dont do a good job of that now 
soybeans now are crushed at commercial processing plants where 
soy oil used in products like salad dressing and margarine is 
separated from soy meal 
the highprotein meal is mixed with corn and other grain and fed 
to hogs chickens and turkeys none of them can digest the protein 
in raw soybeans but the kunitz soybean will change that 
this is a vehicle through which we can deliver protein without 
processing said robert easter a university animal nutrition 
specialist who supervised the kunitz feeding trials 
this gives farmers another alternative he said they 
can feed it directly to their livestock they can sell it in the 
marketplace or they can process it to get full use of the oil

opec officials on thursday predicted 
demand for the cartels oil would average 215 million barrels a 
day next year well under its current production level 
subroto secretarygeneral of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries released the forecast after a brief 
meeting of a special monitoring panel 
ministers attending the session agreed to huddle privately on 
friday before opening opecs full winter conference on saturday 
morning 
the ministers will try to come up with a new production and 
pricing arrangement that will halt output cheating and keep crude 
prices firm in the months ahead 
with higher output in kuwait the united arab emirates and saudi 
arabia the cartel produced nearly 235 million barrels of crude a 
day last month according to analysts estimates 
that is considerably higher than the current fourthquarter 
ceiling of 205 million barrels a day 
despite the surge prices have held fairly strong but if the 
cartel were to pump more oil than required by consuming nations 
prices could plummet 
subroto said the average price of a basket of crudes monitored 
by opec was 1716 a barrel from january through the third week of 
october when it reached 1776 
opecs target price is 18 a barrel just a year ago the opec 
basket registered 1234 
futures prices for west texas intermediate the benchmark us 
crude have been running about 20 a barrel middle eastern 
varieties have been a few dollars less 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been cheating openly 
pumping as much as double their individual quotas of about a 
million barrels a day according to analysts 
the overproduction is intended to underline their demands for 
bigger shares of opecs total output 
saudi arabia opecs biggest producer and the worlds largest 
crude exporter recently joined in the overproduction a move seen 
by analysts as a negotiating ploy before the talks 
at a september meeting iran offered a proposal to cover the 
demands of kuwait and the united arab emirates the plan received 
considerable attention but failed to gain quick approval by all 
nations 
subroto said the proposal certainly is still there but i 
presume there will be other proposals as well 
irans gholamreza aqazadeh refused to respond when asked if the 
plan were still alive 
but indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said its 
history because things have changed 
in his economic report subroto said opec expected an increase 
in world economic growth of 3 percent next year a bit under the 
33 percent pace of 1989 
total demand for oil excluding such centrally planned 
economies as the soviet union was estimated at 518 million 
barrels a day in 1990 up from 509 million barrels this year 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity said earlier that 
kuwait offered slightly more conservative projections it estimated 
world demand at 515 million barrels a day next year and the call 
on opec oil at 21 million barrels 
subroto said kuwait had gone along with the majority view 
the ministers even usually talkative ones said little upon 
arrival in vienna insisting they needed to talk first to their 
colleagues 
the united arab emirates mana saeed otaiba apparently 
defending his his countrys output said we tackled our quota 
ourselves in accord with the interests of our people and our 
commitment toward opec 
once the ministers set a new production ceiling they will have 
to divvy up the total among all nations 
irans september plan called for lifting the overall supply 
ceiling to 215 million barrels a day to meet the demands of kuwait 
and the united arab emirates for larger shares of the total gabon 
and ecuador would also get more 
algeria indonesia nigeria and venezuela would see their shares 
shrink as would iran and iraq saudi arabia libya and qatar would 
remain unchanged 
saudi arabias minister hisham nazer has said his country will 
not cut its onequarter share of total output 
but one oil official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
other countries would like the oil giant to kick in some too 
it would give credibility to the whole exercise if all are 
seen as having contributed to resolution of the problem he said

some of the biggest stores are in trouble the 
economic expansion is looking creaky and social mores are calling 
for less not more conspicuous consumption 
other than that its your typical postthanksgiving shopping 
season 
faced with some unusual challenges and predictions of a 
lackluster season the nations retailers are trying to add some 
sparkle to give americans extra incentive to do their annual duty 
as the traditional shopping season opens consumers are likely 
to see more sales help behind store counters special services and 
markdowns 
the retail industrys hopes are modest sales will grow just 
slightly more than inflation rising by 55 percent after 1988s 
unexpectedly robust 9 percent gain according to the national 
retail merchants association 
price reductions may be a must for retailers facing a 
makeorbreak season which accounts for almost half of their 
annual business in highly competitive markets retailers who dont 
jump on the pricecutting bandwagon will be left watching their 
customers go elsewhere 
many companies face a cash crunch like campeau corp which is 
struggling to restructure its debts after buying up allied and 
federated department stores the decision by struggling lj hooker 
corp to liquidate six of its seven b altman amp co stores 
threatens to incite a regional price war in the northeast 
its a tough environment its very competitive the only 
things that seem to make people want to spend money are sales or 
special events said rosalind wells chief economist of the 
national retail merchants association thats the way that stores 
are generating business by being promotional
