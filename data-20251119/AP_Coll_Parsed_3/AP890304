every car should yield 42 miles per gallon and 
carbon dioxide emissions should be cut 20 percent to fight the 
greenhouse effect that may threaten earths climate and human 
health a conference recommended friday 
four hundred scientists and public officials from 13 countries 
attended the fourday global climate change meeting that focused on 
the warming of the atmosphere and damage to earths protective ozone 
layer 
the activities of 5 billion people on earth are clearly 
producing changes in the worlds climate said mark harwell 
director of cornell universitys global environment program in 
our lifetimes and certainly in our childrens climate changes and 
other environmental impacts will profoundly affect the way humans 
live 
the participants called for changes in human activities whose 
byproducts are gases that may be causing a rise in atmospheric 
temperatures resulting in hotter summers droughts more violent 
storms rising sea levels and an increase in diseases 
the participants urged congress to pass a more stringent version 
of the clean air act and to stop production by the year 2000 of all 
chlorofluorocarbons which cause the greenhouse effect 
they also recommended that the fuel economy of all new cars be 
increased by 1 mpg per year to at least 42 mpg by the year 2000 
other energy sources including nuclear plants should be used more 
efficiently and with added safety standards the participants said 
the conference also urged that land use and building controls be 
enacted to provide for nature conservation coupled with increased 
mass transit that would reduce automobile congestion 
the conference was convened by gov mario cuomo gov tom keane 
of new jersey gov madeleine kunin of vermont cornell university 
and the national governors association

former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane became the first participant in the irancontra affair to 
be sentenced receiving a 20000 fine and suspended prison term 
mcfarlane placed on twoyears probation friday for misleading 
congress about covert us support for the nicaraguan rebels will 
be a key prosecution witness at the ongoing trial of his former aide 
oliver l north 
leaving the us courthouse with his wife jonda mcfarlane said 
the ordeal left him with strong faith and a terrific wife and a 
free country 
i am looking to the future he said 
mcfarlane admitted he misled congress by denying that north was 
helping the contras raise money and transfer weapons when lawmakers 
had banned us aid 
in a sentencing proceeding that lasted barely five minutes us 
district judge aubrey e robinson jr said mcfarlane must complete 
200 hours of community service during his probabtion 
robinson said the nature of the offense and the totality of the 
circumstances required him to impose a 20000 fine 
mcfarlane could have received a fouryear prison term and a 
400000 fine for pleading guilty to four misdemeanor charges of 
withholding information from congress 
the retired marine lieutenant colonel stood at ease with his 
hands clasped below his waist as he listened to the comments of his 
attorney leonard garment and the judge 
the public servants in this country are not to be found to be 
more decent and more honorable garment said every action on 
his part was taken out of a high sense of duty a strong sense 
of serving his countrys interests 
mcfarlane accompanied north to tehran in may 1986 on an 
unsuccessful armsforhostages mission mcfarlane by this time 
retired from government carried a keyshaped cake and a bible 
signed by president reagan as a show of good faith 
in his emotionless voice mcfarlane said clearly this episode 
in our history has rendered enormous turmoil on our countrys 
processes 
to the extent that i contributed to that i regret it i tried 
to serve my country 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh who negotiated the plea 
agreement with mcfarlane before north and three codefendants were 
indicted last year told reporters outside the courthouse his office 
had made no recommendation about the sentence he refused to comment 
further 
the sentencing took place on a day that norths trial had 
recessed for legal arguments former air force lt col richard 
gadd who provided aircraft for the nicaraguan rebels during the 
secret war that prosecutors say north waged after congress 
banned military aid is scheduled to continue testifying when the 
trial resumes monday 
mcfarlane had asked to be sentenced before he took the witness 
stand against north 
he pleaded guilty march 11 1988 to charges that he misled 
congress in 1985 by stating in three letters that north was not 
helping raise money for the contras or providing military assistance 
the letters were written to the house intelligence committee and 
the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the western hemisphere in 
response to queries about news reports that north was providing aid 
in defiance of the ban imposed by congress 
among the 12 felony charges against north are allegations that he 
made false statement to congress by drafting the false letters that 
mcfarlane signed 
the defense contends that mcfarlane should be held responsible 
for those letters not north who was below his boss on the chain of 
command 
mcfarlane also admitted misleading the full foreign affairs 
committee in testimony after the irancontra affair became public in 
later 1986 by denying knowledge of efforts to raise money from 
foreign governments to help arm the rebels

signs of a blow to the head or any other physical causes for 
amnesia such as epilepsy or alcoholrelated brain malfunction

john towers senate allies struggling to gain 
the offensive in a tense confirmation battle are suggesting that 
the defense secretarydesignate come to the senate floor and respond 
charge by charge to the allegations against him 
if we owe senator tower anything we owe him the right to say 
ive had my day in court senate gop leader robert dole said 
friday as towers confirmation chances dimmed further with two 
additional democrats joining the opposition 
dole stopped short of turning his suggestion into a formal 
proposal and senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
he would be happy to consider any request 
mitchell also said he was troubled by the confirmation 
proceedings in which material from a confidential fbi report that 
is damaging to tower has been leaked in the news media but may not 
be discussed openly on the senate floor he became the second senior 
democrat in as many days to suggest a closed senate session to 
permit a full airing of the allegations contained in the fbi report 
tower has been battling questions of his drinking habits his 
behavior toward women and his lucrative work as a defense industry 
consultant after serving as a us arms control negotiator the fbi 
report contains numerous allegations but republicans say few if any 
of them are corroborated and insist nothing in it disqualifies him 
from the cabinet post 
the senate is in recess until monday when debate is expected to 
resume on the nomination although tower and several senators are 
certain to keep the controversy alive over the weekend with 
appearances scheduled on television interview programs the 
associated press vote count shows 47 democrats and gop sen larry 
pressler either committed or leaning against the nomination and 40 
republicans committed or leaning in favor with the rest undecided 
the democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate 
doles surprise suggestion only six people have ever been 
called to the senate in 200 years to answer charges against them 
came near the end of a day of debate in which two additional 
democrats announced their opposition and a string of republicans 
complained that tower was being treated unfairly 
weve got to even up the score somehow said the senate gop 
leader 
arguing that limitations on public references to the fbi report 
make it impossible to get at the truth dole suggested bringing 
tower to the floor to answer his critics facetoface 
chargebycharge rumorbyrumor and factbyfact 
several republicans defended tower earlier in a long day of 
debate 
the senate has abandoned fairness and the object of that 
abandonment is john tower said sen malcolm wallop rwyo 
sen ted stevens said the evidence in the fbi report was so 
flimsy that no prosecutor would use it for an indictment and said 
of tower he is my friend i thought he was your friend and i want 
some justice for my friend 
sen steve symms ridaho called on a few democrats to swing 
behind the nomination before partisanship overwhelmed the debate 
completely but the only two democrats to announce conservative 
dennis deconcini of arizona and liberal barbara mikulski of maryland 
said they would oppose confirmation 
deconcini had been counted by the white house as a potential 
convert to towers cause but in a written statement he noted the 
allegations against tower and said we cannot take a chance 
an angry sen ernest f hollings dsc called for the release 
of the fbi report noting the republican charge that the democrats 
have based their opposition on allegations not facts 
its our character thats being assassinated here and im sick 
and tired of it said hollings 
release of the fbi report is a decision that only the white house 
can make

tranquility amid a region of increasing violence political 
stability and economic repression

the strike for 60 more days 
bush also warned he would not tolerate sympathy strikes

strike if it involved pilots or postponement of the strike would 
lead to bankruptcy

prevent a major disruption of interstate commerce

the united states is joining its european 
allies in pushing for elimination of all ozonedepleting chemicals 
by the end of the century a sharp acceleration of the schedule for 
ending their use 
president bush said friday he has asked the head of the 
environmental protection agency to join the call to ban 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs by the year 2000 at an international 
conference that begins this weekend in london 
recent studies indicate the 50 percent reduction of cfcs as 
provided by a 1987 treaty may not be enough bush said 
the united states accounts for about onethird of the production 
of ozonedamaging chemicals primarily cfcs which are widely used 
as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a cleaning 
agent for electronic and computer equipment 
scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it 
floats into the stratosphere before it breaks down interacting with 
the gaseous veil of ozone that shields against the suns 
cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
epa administrator william k reilly flew to london on friday to 
take part in the conference to discuss ways to slow down ozone 
destruction representatives from more than 100 nations also will 
take part in the meetings being hosted by british prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
in remarks to a group of high school science contest winners at 
the national academy of sciences the president said the united 
states will support the call for the elimination of cfcs by the 
year 2000 provided safe substitutes are available 
reilly according to administration sources had strongly 
recommended at a white house meeting thursday that the united states 
join its european allies and call for the complete elimination of 
cfcs as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required by 
current treaty 
many scientists have said that a 50 percent cutback would not be 
enough to protect against serious ozone depletion 
on thursday the 12 nations of the european economic community 
announced that they have agreed to a ban on the chemical in their 
countries by the end of the century 
sen al gore dtenn another members of the us delegation to 
the london conference said friday that even quicker action is 
needed because every year of delay implies an additional five to 
10 years that these chemicals will remain in the atmosphere 
gore has called for elimination of all cfcs by 1994 
sen john chafee rri ranking minority member of the 
environment and public works committee called the presidents move 
very encouraging but also urged that cfcs be eliminated well 
before the year 2000 
the 1987 treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations including 
the united states japan most of western europe and soviet union 
but it includes a provision that allows additional measures 
including a complete ban if further ozone damage is found 
the parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an 
accelerated phaseout schedule at a meeting in helsinki finland in 
early may the london meeting which begins sunday is described as 
a dress rehearsal for the helsinki session 
according to the world resources institute the united states 
produces roughly onethird of the worlds cfcs with ei dupont de 
nemours amp co the worlds largest producer there were 750 million 
pounds of cfcs produced in the united states last year and about the 
same amount in western europe according to dupont 
dupont which accounts for about half of the us production has 
announced plans to stop making the chemical perhaps as early as the 
mid1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year

the federal aviation administration issued an 
emergency order on friday requiring all us airlines to reinforce 
latch mechanisms on boeing 747 cargo doors within 30 days so the 
doors are less vulnerable to damage from improper closing 
the emergency airworthiness directive which speeds up the 
timetable of an earlier directive also specifies special 
inspections and tests of the doors that must be done until 
modifications are completed 
the action friday follows the feb 24 united airlines accident 
near honolulu in which a 10by20foot hole was torn in a 747 
fuselage nine people were swept to their deaths 
the cause of the accident has yet to be determined but the 
possible failure of the forward cargo door latch is under 
investigation the door separated from the aircraft with parts of 
the fuselage that surrounded it 
the 747 order affects about 150 airplanes however tom neale of 
the air transport association in washington dc said some 
airlines have already made the required modifications which include 
steel reinforcements to cargo door latches 
the faa issued a directive july 1 ordering the doors inspected 
and modified by the end of 1989 or july 1 1990 depending on the 
type of locking mechanism installed 
that order was issued after a cargo door on a pan am 747 opened 
1 inches at the start of a flight from london to san francisco faa 
officials said at the time the situation did not warrant an 
emergency directive 
the faa also said it soon would issue another airworthiness 
directive requiring improvements in the warning system that alerts 
flight crews when any cargo door is not properly closed and locked 
the directive was expected as soon as the design improvements can be 
delivered and tested 
there were similarities in the events on the pan am and united 
planes the cargo doors in both instances had to be closed by hand 
rather than electrically after they had been malfunctioning there 
were no warning lights to indicate whether the doors were open said 
both flight crews 
additionally the agency has formed a team to review all current 
boeing service bulletins on the 747 cargo door to determine whether 
instructions are complete and understandable the faa said friday in 
a statement issued in seattle 
the team is focusing on the possibility of human error that might 
be associated with specific procedures it is expected to complete 
its work within a week 
boeing spokesman jack gamble said changes made in the latest 
directive from the july 1 1988 order included visual inspection 
of the cargo door latch before each flight new torque limits on the 
door if it is closed manually and shorter timetables for inspection 
for damage and of electrical systems 
he said boeing supported the action by the faa and in fact had 
suggested in service bulletins of march and april 1987 the cargo 
door improvements that were included in the faas directive of july 
1988 
the faa also ordered immediate inspections of dash 8100 planes 
made by de havilland of canada a boeing subsidiary because faulty 
connections were found in fireextinguishing systems on two of the 
canadianmade dash 8100 airliners

the bush administration is heading toward a 
confrontation with senate democrats over sharply differing plans to 
raise the 335anhour minimum wage with the possibility of the 
first increase in eight years in the balance 
425 is it labor secretary elizabeth dole told congress on 
friday warning that president bush would veto any attempt to fatten 
the hourly increase that the administration would phase in over 
three years 
mrs dole said the raise to 425 must also be coupled with a 
subminimum training wage for the first six months employment 
for all newly hired workers and she would expand the current 
exemption from the minimum to all small businesses 
the bush plan puts the administration at odds with sen edward m 
kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
committee and his bill to gradually raise the minimum to 465 an 
hour 
there are slightly fewer than 4 million people working for the 
minimum wage according to the labor department 
the 335 floor has not been raised since 1981 since then said 
kennedy inflation has cut the purchasing power of that wage by 40 
percent 
the labor committee will begin considering the minimum next week 
and senate majority leader george mitchell says he would like to 
bring it to a vote by the full senate by the end of the month 
but mrs doles veto warning on friday what kennedy termed a 
take it or leave it set the stage for a battle like the one 
last year when kennedys increase failed because of opposition by 
the reagan administration 
mrs dole told the labor panel that any rise in the minimum wage 
will cost the nation jobs and that kennedys plan would mean 650000 
jobs lost she said the administrations increase of 30 cents a year 
for three years would balance lost jobs with higher earning power 
for lowincome workers 
any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable 
because it would decrease job opportunities she told the 
committee 
legislation outside those parameters would call for a veto 
she said 
kennedy told mrs dole that if a veto threat is part of the 
administrations proposal then were laying right out for a 
confrontation i hope were not getting a take or leave it 
mrs dole answered the president has signed up for 425 an 
hour and not higher 
425 is it she said waving her hand 
under the training wage all workers hired at the minimum 
could be paid 335 an hour for six months before they are covered 
by the higher standard whether or not it is their first job there 
are no limits such as age on that exemption 
the administration would also expand the tax credit for tips from 
the current 40 percent to 50 percent 
kennedy noting costofliving increases for government workers 
those in the military and others said those at the end of the 
economy ought to get it too 
the administration proposal was attacked by the business 
community after the committee hearing 
a higher minimum wage would deny access to the first rung on 
americas job ladder or those entering the work force the very 
people the increase is meant to help said robert l martin 
director of the us chamber of commerces employee relations policy 
center

a federal judge on friday blocked the 
execution of a man after a defense attorney argued that the 
condemned man was mentally retarded and did not understand his 
rights when he was arrested 
barry lee fairchild 34 was scheduled to die by injection on 
wednesday for the 1983 beating rape and murder of a 22yearold 
nurse us district judge g thomas eisele ordered the stay after a 
twohour hearing 
defense attorney john wesley hall cited intelligence tests 
fairchild had taken which indicated that his client is mentally 
retarded 
i knew the stay would be granted i got the test results at 10 
this morning hall said friday 
the attorney generals office said it would not appeal the stay 
to the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
eisele set a hearing for march 16 to determine if fairchild had 
the mental capacity to understand the nature of his rights and the 
consequences of his action when he waived his socalled miranda 
rights after he was arrested 
he signed and initialed the waiver according to testimony at his 
trial 
the miranda rights include the suspects right to keep silent to 
be informed that anything he says may be used against him to have 
an attorney present when he is questioned by police and to have an 
attorney appointed for him free if he cannot afford to hire one 
questioned about what his miranda rights were fairchild 
described them during the hearing as remain silent whatever say 
can be used against you right to call a lawyer 
hall said fairchild is easily led to give particular answers 
even though he does not realize the implications of what he is 
doing he may not realize what it means for something to be used 
against him hall said 
psychologist judy white johnson testified for the defense that on 
the basis of testing thursday at the prison she would place 
fairchilds iq in the range of 56 to 64 which is considered 
mentally retarded 
the iq statistic differs from the previous figure that was 
determined after a 1986 test that said his iq was 87 which is 
dullnormal an elementary school test given to fairchild some 24 
years ago placed his iq at 65 hall said 
eisele encouraged hall to conduct more indepth tests and told 
the state to conduct any tests it desired 
fairchild was convicted in the death of marjorie l mason a 
little rock air force base nurse she was shot twice in the back of 
the head and her body was found behind an abandoned lonoke county 
farmhouse 
arkansas has had no execution since 1964

the kremlins offer to help cool the furor over the 
novel the satanic verses seems a careful attempt to balance its 
interests in improving relations with iran the west and its own 
burgeoning moslem population 
the soviets have defended iran without condoning the campaign to 
kill the books author as 15 western nations withdrew their top 
diplomats from tehran to protest ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death 
threat against salman rushdie the soviet union edged closer to iran 
while seeking to ease the uproar 
we need calm foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
thursday as he greeted his spanish counterpart the less emotion 
the better for all at the present period we have to extinguish the 
fire because nobody needs a fire 
the soviets have not revealed how the dispute could be resolved 
but with an increasingly restive moslem population of 50 million in 
central asia they can ill afford a misstep 
at first soviet officials declined comment on the dispute 
although shevardnadze was then visiting the middle east with iran 
on his itinerary 
khomeini ordered his followers feb 14 to kill rushdie a 
naturalized british citizen because of his book moslems say the 
book is blasphemous and iranian clergymen have offered a 52 
million bounty for rushdies death 
after shevardnadze discussed the dispute with iranian officials 
during a threeday trip to tehran that ended monday foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the government of 
iran is sincere about finding a settlement of the situation that has 
emerged and the soviet union could have a positive role to play 
in elaborating the soviet unions middleground position the 
official news agency tass said wednesday that western countries were 
justified in their indignation over khomeinis threat 
but the news agency added perhaps imam khomeini the supreme 
religious authority in iran had no choice proceeding from koran 
teachings other than denouncing a man who has insulted islam 
the denunciation was nothing more by the way than the 
position of a religious leader the iranian government has not 
condemned rushdie to death tass said even though iranian 
officials have supported the threat 
the sympathy toward irans religious concerns was unusual in 
light of the kremlins advocacy of atheism but reflected 
sensitivity to its own moslem population 
the soviet unions moslem population is growing much more rapidly 
than ethnic russians who hold the reins of political power based on 
current trends the moslem population will rise to 100 million by 
the year 2000 meaning one in every three soviets will be a moslem 
soviet moslems were unhappy when the red army moved into 
neighboring afghanistan in 1979 to fight moslem rebels siding with 
the west in the rushdie dispute would have angered soviet moslems 
further at a time when they are becoming increasingly vocal 
on feb 3 moslems massed in the uzbek capital of tashkent to 
demand the ouster of their religious leader because they said he 
was not following religious law and was a pawn of the state he 
later resigned and moslems are to choose a new leader march 1415 
in other signs of new sensitivity to moslems the government has 
promised to open more mosques and expand an islamic seminary 
after shevardnadzes meetings in tehran the kremlin sought to 
play down khomeinis death threat even though the united states had 
asked him to raise concerns with the iranians and britain urged 
him to press iran to back off 
for moscow however further improving relations with tehran 
carried the day iran once lumped the soviet union and the united 
states together as the great satan in a sign of the changing 
times shevardnadze became the highest ranking soviet to visit iran 
since its 1979 islamic revolution 
the soviet unions relations with iran have improved markedly 
since it began allowing moslems more religious freedom and 
withdrawing its troops from afghanistan 
iran gratified by the afghan pullout signed an agreement in 
december to supply the soviets with natural gas trade is growing 
between the countries and the soviet union is helping rebuild areas 
of iran devastated in its 8yearold war with iraq 
aside from bringing it closer to iran the soviet offer of 
mediation in the rushdie affair serves a wider foreign policy goal 
it is in line with president mikhail s gorbachevs new political 
thinking which seeks to avoid confrontation and stresses 
compromise and cooperation 
the soviet tabloid arguments and facts said friday the affair 
opens a peacemaking opportunity for the soviet union in such 
cases more than ever assistance is needed from a party that can 
take a sober view of things to help both sides get out of the 
difficult situation they created the newspaper said 
spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez who met 
thursday in moscow with shevardnadze said the kremlin mediation 
effort had not yet begun 
there was no proposal concerning an intermediary role he 
said friday 
shevardnadze is slated to discuss the issue next week in vienna 
with british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe and us secretary 
of state james a baker iii

union mechanics and baggage handlers struck 
eastern airlines at midnight friday after president bush refused to 
order an emergency 60day coolingoff period and union officials 
rejected a lastditch company proposal 
negotiations continued up to the deadline but shortly after 
midnight federal mediator walter c wallace told reporters we 
have not been successful in reaching agreement 
eastern airlines is officially on strike as of midnight said 
charles bryan president of eastern machinists district 100 its 
shut down 
picket lines went up around the country and pilots immediately 
pledged to support the strike 
we voted unanimously to honor the picket lines said jack 
bavis of the air line pilots association that means as far as im 
concerned the eastern pilots are directed as of this moment not to 
fly eastern airplanes 
tom matthews of eastern blamed the strike on the unions 
insistence on an 8 percent increase when the airlines others unions 
accepted a 20 percent wage cut three years ago 
this has to do with a union that has decided that it is not 
going to join with the other employees at eastern who have made the 
sacrifices theyve made he said 
matthews said eastern would continue flying albeit at a reduced 
schedule that he said was set to make sure people could have 
continued confidence in eastern 
the strike was called after eastern made a new offer to the union 
that company officials said protected past wage increases and job 
security for 8500 union aircraft mechanics and baggage handlers 
wallace chairman of the national mediation board said the talks 
between the two sides ended on a professional if not cordial 
note and that both sides were free to resume negotiations at any 
time 
bush in an unprecedented action earlier friday had rejected a 
recommendation from federal mediators to order an emergency 60day 
coolingoff period thirtythree senators and national labor leaders 
also had urged him to name an emergency panel a move that would 
have averted a strike for at least 60 days 
the financially strapped airline said it opposed federal 
intervention 
details of the companys last offer were not disclosed although 
george brennan an eastern vice president said it addresses the 
union concerns the union earlier friday rejected a company 
proposal that would have cut mechanics pay by 15 percent and 
baggage handlers wages by 26 percent 
a federal judge meanwhile ruled that eastern machinists could 
set up pickets against other airlines but he prohibited machinists 
union members at those airlines from joining the strike aflcio 
officials had said members of all unions should honor the secondary 
pickets 
wallace speaking to reporters outside a hotel where talks were 
under way said of easterns initial offer friday the other side 
evaluated it and rejected it it was a fizzle 
eastern on thursday had offered to reduce the size of the wage 
takebacks it has been demanding for the past 17 months from 8500 
members of the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers 
the first offer friday would have reduced hourly topscale wages 
from 1883 to 16 for aircraft mechanics and from 1560 to 1154 
for baggage handlers 
in a nonstrike action that could put pressure on all the 
nations airlines the air line pilots association announced that in 
the event of an eastern strike it would instruct its 40000 members 
beginning next tuesday to precisely adhere to flying procedures that 
would cause substantial delays at the nations airport 
eastern said it would operate despite a walkout in an effort to 
trim by 150 million a year the wages paid to members of the 
machinists union 
bush in a statement released at the white house said the 
national mediation board has for many months attempted 
unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement and i have no 
reason to believe that an additional investigation or the 60day 
delay that would be entailed would produce such an agreement 
he warned union officials against disrupting the nations 
transportation systems through secondary boycotts against other 
airlines or transportation companies 
bush said that if strikes against other transportation outlets 
occur he will seek emergency legislation to stop them 
transportation secretary samuel skinner told a news conference 
friday that federal aviation administration inspections of eastern 
were already being increased 
easterns service will be on planes that are safe and 
airworthy and we will not tolerate any threats of sabotage or 
other forms of physical harm that threaten the health and safety of 
people on the ground or in the air skinner said 
the union has said it has no plans for any such actions or 
threats 
skinner said in answer to a question that bush retained the 
power to call the emergency panel and prevent a strike even after 
the deadline but he indicated that was unlikely 
congress could also invoke the emergency panel provision of the 
act a panel would examine the dispute for 30 days and report to the 
president a 30day coolingoff period would follow before the 
company or union could take any action affecting jobs 
eastern had said earlier that either a strike if it involved 
pilots or presidential intervention delaying the strike would 
likely lead to bankruptcy the company which flies 100000 
passengers a day with more than 1000 flights says it is losing 1 
million a day and has lost 1 billion over the past decade 
pilots and flight assistants have said they will refuse to work 
behind machinists picket lines 
as the strike deadline approached eastern sent machinists union 
members home for a paid vacation day the airline acted after 
telling a federal judge that the union planned lastminute sabotage 
that threatened passenger safety 
this is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect the 
bargaining said airline spokesman joe leonard 
in us district court in washington judge john h pratt said he 
was ruling that machinists union members at other airlines could not 
honor eastern machinists picket lines there in view of the fact 
that there are nostrike clauses noslowdown clauses in their 
contracts with the other airlines 
during the hearing the attorney for usair and piedmont airlines 
thomas reinnert said the two airlines are total strangers to the 
dispute and we want to keep it that way 
also included at the hearing were representatives of northwest 
airlines twa and united airlines

the secret service is having a difficult time 
recruiting minority group members because it cant keep up with 
salaries offered elsewhere the agencys director says 
if i were a minority getting out of college i would be heavily 
recruited by xerox and ibm and all the major corporations secret 
service director john r simpson told the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on treasury postal service and general government on 
friday 
and the problem isnt just limited to minority recruitment he 
said 
were offering 18000 to incoming agents simpson said 
the los angeles police department is starting in the vicinity of 
33000 
one agent who had been with the secret service for three years 
recently left to take a job with the suffolk county police force in 
new york where hell earn 55000 a year simpson said 
you train them for other places said sen barbara mikulski 
dmd youre the farm team 
the treasury department agency which protects the president the 
vice president and presidential candidates among others will face 
a crisis when the next president campaign rolls around simpson said 
in 1992 when onethird to onequarter of our law enforcement 
personnel will be eligible to retire the potential applicant pool 
of men and women between the ages of 21 and 30 will be at its lowest 
point since world war ii simpson said without the ability to 
attract and retain their replacements now the future of our 
operations is very seriously threatened 
secret service uniformed officers whose jobs dont require 
college education begin at 23000 but their salaries cant 
eventually increase as much as those of actual agents who must have 
college degrees simpson said in an interview after the hearing 
there are about 1950 agents and 1000 uniformed officers in the 
secret service 
stephen e higgins director of the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms indicated his bureau faces the same situation because 
of starting salaries of 15000 to 18000 
ms mikulski noted they start at the same level as a paralegal 
in the office of attorneys defending the drug dealers 
the national advisory commission on law enforcement a panel 
created at the urging of subcommittee chairman dennis deconcini 
dariz is considering calling for salary increases for the 
officers the senator said 
such a decision would have to be made by congress so the budget 
requests for the agencies for fiscal 1990 the topic of the 
subcommittee hearing did not include money for increasing salaries 
the secret service request for fiscal 1990 is 3684 million an 
increase of 109 million over 1989 
deconcini noted that in the year after a presidential election 
historically your budget requests are down 
asked why the budget request had increased this year simpson 
said some of the campaign protection funds for last years election 
had been distributed to the agency in advance of fiscal 1989 and 
the elimination of nonrecurring costs was not enough to offset 
inflation 
in order to stay ahead of the bad guys you have got to have 
some flexibility in the budget simpson said 
the atf bureau did not include a specific budget request during 
the hearing

here is the text of president bushs statement 
friday on the eastern airlines situation 
the national mediation board has recommended that i appoint an 
emergency board before march 4 pursuant to section 10 of the 
railway labor act as amended to investigate the dispute between 
eastern airlines and the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers i have decided not to accept this recommendation 
the national mediation board has for many months attempted 
unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement and i have no 
reason to believe that an additional investigation or the 60day 
delay that would be entailed would produce such an agreement 
in light of the wellpublicized threats of a strike and related 
activities the department of transportation will monitor the 
situation and will in addition take whatever steps are needed to 
protect the safety of the traveling public 
i urge responsible labor officials not to try to influence 
resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nations transportation 
systems through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties such 
boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens not only 
preventing necessary travel but also affecting shipment of consumer 
goods and the ability of many workers to earn a living for these 
reasons secondary boycotts are not permitted in any other sector of 
the economy 
accordingly if secondary boycotts threaten to disrupt essential 
transportation services i will submit and urge that congress 
promptly enact legislation making it unlawful to use secondary 
picketing and boycotts against neutral carriers we cannot allow an 
isolated labormanagement dispute to disrupt the nations entire 
transportation system

a laser weapon shot down a supersonic target 
last week in a test that the navy hailed as proof the experimental 
weapons can be used against cruise missiles 
the service said friday the classified test was conducted feb 23 
at the white sands nm missile range using a laser that is being 
tested both by the navy and the star wars program 
the test was an extremely important one the navy said because 
for the first time a highenergy laser system successfully engaged 
and destroyed a missile flying low and fast in a cruise missile 
profile 
never before had the laser been tested against a target flying 
faster than the speed of sound the navy said 
the laser destroyed a supersonic missile in a test designed to 
show that a laser system could acquire track and deposit enough 
energy on a supersonic target to destroy it the navy continued 
at the same time the navy released an unclassified videotape of 
the experiment the tape shows the target missile flying across the 
desert floor then just a brief sharp burst of light near its tip 
that sends it out of control 
the laser used in the test nicknamed miracl for midinfrared 
advanced chemical laser proved for the first time in the fall of 
1987 that it could shoot down a target flying below the speed of 
sound a jetpowered drone was used in those tests 
in the latest experiment the laser was fired against an old 
talos antiaircraft missile that was flying more than two times the 
speed of sound or roughly 1500 miles per hour on a path meant 
to simulate that of an attacking cruise missile the navy said 
unlike the star wars organization which has been investigating 
the feasibility of laser weapons to shoot down ballistic nuclear 
missiles in space the navy has been experimenting with miracl to 
see if such a laser could reliably defend a warship against missile 
attack 
the navy program is known as the balanced technology initiative

airports railroads and seaports nationwide braced 
friday as eastern airlines machinists went on strike a walkout 
that threatened secondary action against the nations transportation 
system 
airports that handle heavy eastern traffic boosted police 
patrols designated picket areas and mapped contingency plans to 
keep operations running normally after the machinists went on strike 
at 1201 am est saturday 
machinists quickly established that they intended to shut eastern 
down storming the gate at miami international airport police in 
riot gear helped push them back 
at approximately 1210 am the 3400 eastern pilots voted 
overwhlemingly to honor the machinists strike 
j b skip stokes spokesman for eastern members of the air 
line pilots association said early saturday we will honor their 
picket 
referring to the pilots who dont honor the picket line he said 
a shadow would be cast over them for perhaps the rest of their 
careers at eastern 
negotiations between the airline and eastern collapsed despite an 
undisclosed offer by the carrier at 10 pm two hours before the 
deadline and machinists officials offering to extend talks at the 
mediators request 
defensive activities were especially evident at airports in south 
florida the miamibased easterns home region security also was 
beefed up at many airports including atlanta washington seattle 
philadelphia and newark nj 
preparations took on new urgency friday afternoon when president 
bush announced he would not intervene in the bitter labor dispute 
an action that would have stalled a strike by triggering a 60day

the shoreham nuclear power plant could have 
an operating license in about a month the chairman of the nuclear 
regulatory commission said after the commission ejected the affected 
state and local governments from its proceedings 
the commission voted 40 friday to remove the governments of new 
york state suffolk county and the town of southampton on the 
grounds they willfully defied commission orders to produce 
documents and witnesses at licensing hearings the federal action 
was unprecedented in more than 30 years of overseeing the nuclear 
industry 
nrc chairman lando zech said there are no further roadblocks to 
licensing the 54 billion plant on new yorks long island if 
everything were to go well i suppose in a month would be the 
earliest for licensing he said 
new york gov mario cuomo vowed an appeal in federal court 
the nuclear regulatory commission seeks to deny the state and 
local governments our statutory right to protect the health and 
safety of our citizens he said in a statement the nrcs 
position is absurd 
officials of the long island lighting co which owns the plant 
were predictably pleased by the nrc decision 
the nrc has proclaimed clearly and definitely that shoreham is 
a safe plant said lilco spokesman joseph mcdonnell 
lilco and cuomo announced feb 28 they had reached an agreement 
under which the utility would sell the plant to the state for 1 and 
it would be dismantled by the state power authority 
in return lilco would be eligible for rate increases which have 
yet to be specified fridays ruling has clearly put lilco in a 
better position to hold out for the highest rate increases it can 
get under the shutdown agreement 
lilco has also retained the right to continue seeking an 
operating license but agreed not to operate the plant even if one is 
granted as long as all necessary approvals of the pact are in place 
by april 15 
the state and local governments had stalled licensing of the 
reactor by refusing to participate in an emergency evacuation plan 
they contended that the area around the long island plant could not 
be evacuated in the event of an accident

investigators of a nuclear weapons plant 
accident in south carolina have concluded that measures needed to 
prevent a recurrence will not delay plans for resuming production 
there of a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads 
the investigators in a report released by the energy department 
on friday blamed the jan 22 accident on significant and 
longstanding weaknesses in operations at the savannah river plant 
which includes three nuclear reactors 
the reactors are owned by the energy department and run by a 
private contractor 
the report said the troubles at savannah rivers k reactor where 
the accident occurred are symptomatic of problems throughout the 
complex that must be corrected before the reactors resume production 
of tritium a gas needed in the manufacture of american nuclear arms 
all three reactors have been shut down since last spring 
crippling the nuclear weapons production program a restart of the k 
reactor has been planned for late this year with the two other 
reactors to resume operation in 1990 
there had been concern that the jan 22 accident might delay the 
restart schedule the energy department has said that unless tritium 
production were resumed by the end of the year the nations nuclear 
arsenal could be put in jeopardy 
we do not see any significant schedule delay as a result of 
this leonard c sjostrom an energy department health and safety 
official said in a telephone interview from savannah river he was 
one of the official investigators 
sjostrom said the department still expected to announce a 
specific restart schedule for the k reactor sometime this month he 
said he could not be more specific 
the energy department report said operators of the reactor and 
its support systems were unprofessional and lacking in discipline 
it blamed their managers for this 
the conclusions of the 131page report go to the heart of safety 
technical and managerial problems at savannah river that have 
virtually shut down the complex 
several valves in k reactors backup cooling system were damaged 
in the accident but because there was no fuel in the reactor the 
health and safety of plant workers and the general public were not 
in danger the report said 
the problem began when a pipe valve was inadvertently left open 
before the start of the cooling system test this prevented the 
usual buildup of pressure in the pipes during the test instead of 
halting operations to determine the cause of the problem du pont 
technicians pumped more water into the pipes this caused the open 
valve to slam shut with extraordinary force creating what is called 
a water hammer that damaged several other valves 
a final assessment of the extent of damage has not yet been 
completed officials said 
the investigators report was strongly critical of the e i du 
pont de nemours amp co management team that runs the reactor complex 
under an energy department contract it also criticized plant 
operators and energy department officials on the site 
the investigative team reached a consensus that this event was 
a direct result of significant and longstanding weaknesses that 
continue to exist in the conduct of plant operations the report 
said 
the investigators cited du ponts initial report of the incident 
which happened on a sunday the companys report was a routine 
accounting of what had taken place at the plant over the weekend it 
said there had been no incidents while later mentioning the 
reactor accident only briefly 
the du pont report included 10 events listed ahead of the 
reactor accident were such things as the spilling of one quart of 
diesel fuel and an operator falling off his chair

skinheads and white supremacists refused to 
back down from a rally on a private ranch today but they abandoned 
plans for a whitesonly aryan woodstock rock concert that a 
judge said required a permit 
we can sing we just cant play instruments said bob heick 
the san francisco head of a white supremacist group called american 
front who represented concert organizers in court friday 
im not angry he said i expected this obviously 
napa county superior court judge w scott snowden describing the 
issue as politically and emotionally charged deemed the event a 
public gathering he issued a restraining order prohibiting the 
concert because organizers had failed to obtain a permit required by 
county ordinance 
but snowden allowed a public gathering rejecting the countys 
argument that the assembly would be a public nuisance and saying it 
demonstrated no clear and present danger to the public 
six skinheads linked arms around heick and escorted him out of 
the courthouse using lighted cigarettes to make their way through a 
throng of reporters heick vowed to get a concert going 
elsewhere 
leaders of the groups said they would gather today to party and 
discuss their white liberation movement the site is a private 
ranch about 40 miles north of san francisco 
the physican who owns the land and leased it for the gathering 
said he was told the meeting was to be about environmental concerns 
the skinhead subculture and style of dress emerged in london in 
the 1960s segments of the movement later took on nazi overtones and 
since have been associated with the white supremacist groups 
county attorney robert westmeyer said the ruling didnt surprise 
him adding that it might prompt the county board of supervisors to 
change the law 
i think they may consider revising the ordinance to apply to 
large public gatherings rather than just rock concerts he said 
before the hearing an naacp official warned that the gathering 
was an effort to win support for an unpopular cause which advocates 
racial violence 
however regional director james l martin said the national 
association for the advancement of colored people would not 
dignify the existence of this group or their planned event with 
our presence tommorrow 
we can ignore a rock concert by skinheads but we cannot ignore 
what they represent in terms of potential danger he added 
the jewish defense league and the anticrime guardian angels 
civilian patrol group indicated they would demonstrate at the rally 
heick who sports 16 tattoos including skins inked inside his 
lower lip said during fridays hearing that our intention was to 
comply with the law he said a check with the county some time ago 
indicated no permit was needed 
in no way would we want a public event he said we wanted 
to keep out of peoples way where we could all be alone and have a 
little party 
the concert was to feature skinhead bands midtown boot boys from 
oklahoma the hammerheads from wisconsin and hakenkreuz from detroit 
organizer tom metzger a former ku klux klan leader and currently 
head of a group called white aryan resistance argued earlier that 
since the concert was to be held on private property and admission 
was by invitation only no permit was needed 
although metzger earlier had predicted as many as 2000 people 
might attend the concert heick on friday said he expected about 200 
attendees

angry eastern airlines machinists screamed on 
strike an some stormed company gates saturday after rejecting a 
final contract offer and starting a walkout that immediately began 
to frustrate air traffic nationwide 
the strike is on eastern spokesman robin matell said just 
after 1201 am est the financially troubled carriers pilots and 
flight attendants joined the strike which president bush refused to 
halt by invoking emergency powers 
its the most overwhelming support i have seen in the history 
of the labor movement said machinists union local president 
charles bryan after federally mediated talks collapsed in washington 
and unionists threw up pickets 
the walkout instantly disrupted easter flights at miami the 
airlines headquarters one of the first eastern poststrike 
flights about to depart for puerto rico was canceled after the 
flight crew walked out at midnight 
they say theres another eastern flight said passenger ron 
adams 51 but im going to try to get my ticket endorsed for 
another airline ive been traveling for 3 days and im too tired 
to wait around 
from atlanta to los angeles carloads of pickets careened into 
airports by the midnight deadline reporters for the associated 
press in those areas said 
at newark nj an important eastern hub the last eastern 
flight arrived at 1157 pm from tampa fla and passengers were 
clearly relieved three others scheduled to san juan atlanta and 
ford lauderdale were cancelled 
the strike capped an emotional 17month feud between the union 
and eastern that has come to symbolize the problems faced by one of 
the nations largest and most unprofitable airlines 
in miami about 3000 workers charged across the street from the 
local union hall to corporate headquarters chanting and carrying 
placards some hurled rocks bottles and concrete blocks over the 
barbed wiretopped fence 
they tore up effigies of texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
the hardline boss who bought eastern three years ago 
riot police turned back some workers who tried to storm eastern 
gates matell said some union members apparently did crash through 
gates but he had no details 
estamos en huelga we are on strike shouted union local 
aide marty urra speaking in spanish later he added its a 
shame it could have been avoided 
police cars with sirens screaming and some officers in riot gear 
took their places at miamis airport and eastern implemented strike 
contingency plans it said could keep the carrier flying 
indefinitely 
matell said a proposal made less than two hours before the strike 
deadline guaranteed job security for the 8500member union but 
union members said the company offered scant improvements over its 
demand for 150 million in wage concessions 
wally haber a machinists general chairman reported strong 
support from easterns pilots and flight attendants and predicted 
support from other unions across the nation 
its no longer a fight between machinists and eastern its a 
fight between labor and corporate america haber said 
in a related action the airline pilots association announced its 
40000 members next tuesday would begin to precisely follow flying 
procedures causing substantial airport delays 
the aflcio has urged all members to honor picket lines and the 
machinists have vowed to picket trains ports and other airlines 
joseph leonard easterns chief operating officer said the 
carrier slashed weekend flights by up to 75 percent but could keep 
flying service will be maintained to about 50 cities including 
most flights from miami and on the airlines northeast shuttle and 
latin american routes he said 
in washington us district judge john h pratt ruled that 
machinists at other airlines could not honor eastern machinists 
picket lines in view of nostrike noslowdown clauses in their 
contracts with other carriers 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told a news conference the 
transportation department will monitor the situation and will in 
addition take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety of 
the traveling public 
eastern said it had contracted with 1100 nonunion mechanics to 
service its planes leonard said eastern could fly indefinitely with 
200 management pilots and those who cross picket lines if pilots 
honor a walkout 
leonard told reporters in miami the machinists were sent home 
early in the day after a federal judge said it was necessary to 
ensure passenger safety he denied it was a lockout move 
bushs refusal to invoke an emergency mediation panel and impose 
a 60day coolingoff period in the 17monthold dispute marked his 
first major laborcrisis decision 
to easterns machinists it signaled a major dimming of hope 
the reaction here is we would just as soon get it over with 
said rick iacino a machinists general chairman our people are 
pumped up theyre ready war has been declared 
the airline which says it is losing 1 million a day has been 
seeking 150 million in concessions from the machinists the union 
that includes mechanics baggage handlers and other ground workers 
eastern flies about 100000 people a day with an average of 1040 
daily flights it has 250 airliners 
the 60yearold miamibased carrier owned by texas air corp 
wanted bush to stay out of the dispute claiming it could not afford 
any delay 
easterns pilots rejected an appeal thursday by lorenzo for them 
to sign a new contract and cross machinists picket lines 
eastern flight attendants said they would honor picket lines 
although lorenzo who in 1983 took continental airlines into 
bankruptcy reorganization to end a labor confrontation has warned 
that the action could land eastern in the corporate graveyard 
airports nationwide strengthened security and made contingencies 
for dealing with the strike other airlines some of which have 
declined to promise to honor eastern tickets have reported surges 
in sales this week 
we will do our best to assist eastern passengers should there 
be a work stoppage stated delta air lines which arranged to 
accept eastern tickets 
leonard said the company had experienced significant amounts of 
vandalism and got permission from us district judge c clyde 
atkins in miami to send workers home atkins said it was necessary 
for passenger safety 
workers were given a paid holiday and told to report back to work 
at 1201 am saturday one minute after the strike deadline 
leonard said 
leonard said the company had reliable information that machinists 
planned at midnight to deploy emergency chutes on all eastern 
planes threatening equipment and causing lengthy flight delays 
frank ortis machinists local 702 vice president denied the 
claim 
our people are professionals there is no sabotage ortis 
said while hundreds of union members wearing black tshirts some 
with skullandcrossbones warnings to scab strike replacement 
workers awaited news at the local union near eastern corporate 
headquarters 
the company contended that machinists set at least four fires in 
recent days at miami international airport and atlantas hartsfield 
international airport atkins ruled there was credible evidence 
that at least one fire was set by machinists beneath a concourse at 
miami international 
the machinists vowed to picket other airlines ships and 
railroads and aflcio officials have said they want their 14 
million members to support the eastern machinists 
in st paul minn a federal judge on thursday issued an order 
barring northwest airlines 21000member machinists union from 
staging a sympathy strike in the event of a walkout pending a march

the united states and other western 
nations are putting together emergency loans to help venezuela 
weather an economic crisis that sparked nationwide riots and the 
deaths this week of at least 300 people 
president carlos andres perez on friday linked the bloodiest 
civil unrest in venezuelas history to the burden of its foreign 
debt he said debt payments threaten the newest democracies in latin 
america 
he accused foreign debtors of inflexibility by demanding 
repayment of the regions 420 billion foreign debt without regard 
to a nations ability to pay venezuela owes international banks and 
lenders 33 billion fourth largest in latin america after brazil 
mexico and argentina 
i hope this painful sacrifice by our country will serve for the 
leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not 
exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious the 66yearold 
leader said 
president bush announced friday that the united states would 
provide venezuela with a 450 million bridge loan to help venezuela 
meet its shortterm financial needs spain also friday said it would 
loan venezuela 50 million 
us officials said bush was making the loan to help ease the 
financial crisis facing perez monthold government 
the loans are part of an overall package from countries including 
west germany and japan as well as from international lenders the 
new york times said in todays editions quoting government and 
banking officials it said the emergency loans will total nearly 2 
billion 
the rioting and looting in caracas and seven other cities was 
touched off by governmentimposed hikes in bus fares and fuel which 
appeared to release pentup frustration over the countrys austerity 
program 
perez on friday confirmed at least 300 people had been killed and 
2000 injured since the unrest flared monday he put the number of 
arrests at barely 1000 
the caracas daily el nacional today quoted unofficial sources as 
saying an estimated 350 to 500 people had died in four days of 
rioting the newspaper said more than 2000 had been arrested in 
caracas 
curfew hours were shortened friday from 6 pm to 6 am to 8 
pm to 5 am as the rioting ended although early today soldiers 
and police exchanged sporadic gunfire with snipers in some 
lowincome caracas neighborhoods 
the federation of university students said 31 people were missing 
and alleged that national guard patrols had executed people dragged 
out of homes the student group accused police of conducting 
indiscriminant searches and arrests of student and labor leaders in 
areas where no riots were reported 
there was no immediate government response to the charges 
speaking at his news conference friday perez said whether 
venezuela can continue to make principal and interest payments on 
its foreign debt depends on the success of his austerity program 
the crisis latin american nations are undergoing has a name 
written with capital letters foreign debt he said other 
nations facing similar economic crises include argentina where a 
battle in january between rebels and the army claimed 39 lives 
perez said 
in a questionandanswer session with reporters the president 
appeared to indicate that venezuela had already suspended the debt 
payments 
however venezuelan officials later friday said there had been 
differing interpretations of his remarks and that the payments would 
be kept up at least until the end of the month 
perez was referring to economic austerity measures required under 
an agreement with the international monetary fund in exchange for a 
43 billion loan over the next three years 
earlier this week the government asked the international 
monetary fund to include provisions allowing venezuela to suspend 
all payments on its debt until september 
venezuela is one of the few developing nations that has been 
servicing foreign debt perez said complaining that western banks 
had not recognized the effort by granting new loans 
oilproducing venezuela has for decades been one of the 
wealthiest and most politically stable nations in latin america but 
a fall in world oil prices since 1981 combined with debt payments 
has depleted monetary reserves 
real wages have fallen by a third since 1981 and inflation is 
expected to double this year to 70 percent

a surprise birthday party for the chief of 
israels intelligence agency has caused a flurry with a reported 
reprimand from the prime minister and an allegation that top 
security service officials got drunk 
parliament member elie benmenachem said he demanded an 
investigation of the party for the shin bet chief whose name is 
kept secret benmenachem alleged the party could amount to a 
security breach 
the legislator said friday that arab waiters served the guests 
and at the end of the party some of the guests got drunk among 
them senior shin bet officials 
benmenachem told the associated press he sent a telegram to 
prime minister yitzhak shamir demanding an investigation 
particularly on the report that arab waiters served the party 
since the identity of the shin bet head is secret this if 
proven true could lead to a serious breach of security and to the 
exposure of his identity benmenachem of the leftleaning labor 
party wrote in the telegram 
benmenachem said his information was based on a number of 
sources and that their reports were identical 
shamir a former agent for israels mossad intelligence agency 
reprimanded the shin bet chief for the party the hebrew daily 
hadashot reported 
despite the secrecy surrounding the security chief hadashot 
wrote many ministers legislators and reporters were invited to the 
surprise party to celebrate the shin bet chiefs 45th birthday it 
was organized two weeks ago by the guest of honors longtime 
companion a jerusalem woman 
the weekly magazine yerushalaim also gave a detailed description 
of the party 
the shin bet head took his famous trumpet and gave them full 
five minutes including the inevitable summertime it reported 
the party lasted from 930 pm till 3 in the morning 
the party was held at the israel museum cafeteria 
hadashot reported that shamir who was an agent in europe during 
his 10 years in the mossad reacted with amazement and shock to 
media reports describing the party 
the prime ministers office declined comment saying in a 
statement that this is an issue between the prime minister and the 
shin bet 
yossi sarid of the leftist citizens rights movement said he did 
not feel the party was improper 
i was invited to the party and went because he is a friend of 
mine sarid said nobody among the guests could cause any 
damage they all knew who the shin bet head is 
the party could prove damaging to the prestige of shin bet which 
has been trying to rehabilitate itself since a 1987 judicial

five nuns protesting the 
liberalization of their order plan to spend a sixth month barricaded 
in their monastery unless they are convinced of the legitimacy of a 
vatican directive to stop 
the nuns have refused since oct 4 to leave the monasterys 
infirmary until the vatican ruled in the dispute the nuns said they 
feared their mother superior would evict them before the vatican had 
a chance to review their case 
a spokeswoman for the nuns said friday they didnt believe the 
ruling delivered to them by roman catholic bishop frank rodimer of 
the paterson nj diocese was legitimate and that they would 
continue their protest 
nothing came here with a vatican seal on it said betty 
sutton the spokeswoman its the bishops final trick to get them 
out 
the rev timothy dolan a spokesman for the vatican embassy in 
washington said an appeal to the vaticans highest court the 
apostolica signatura could take two weeks or more to be decided 
two of the women whose temporary fiveyear vows expired during 
the protest were told they must leave the monastery of the most 
blessed virgin mary of mount carmel the paterson roman catholic 
diocese announced 
two others were told they should seek residence in a different 
convent and the fifth a 71yearold nun who suffers heart 
problems was told she would be allowed to stay at the monastery 
said tim manning a spokesman for rodimer 
the five nuns were among 13 cloistered members of the order of 
discalced carmelites at the monastery 
the nuns said they wanted the monastery returned to the 
carmelites traditionally austere lifestyle they had objected to 
the introduction of such modern elements as television and candy 
despite the difficult situation created by some of the 
religious the fundamental principles of religious life were firmly 
retained with prudence and charity read the ruling from cardinal 
jerome hamer the head of the vatican congregation for the 
religious which oversees religious communities 
manning said he did not know if the five nuns would be forcibly 
removed if they refused to leave 
the mother superior prioress mother theresa hewitt called the 
standoff a scandal when the nuns took over the infirmary and 
criticized the unruly members of her order for disrupting the 
cloistered lifestyle 
mother hewitt and rodimer have said the controversy centered on 
the rebel nuns inability to follow their mother superiors orders 
sister eliane a nun who has acted as a spokeswoman for those not 
involved in the protest said she had no immediate comment 
not now not yet she said adding that the others did not 
want to comment 
mrs sutton said all five women still considered themselves nuns 
and part of the order and that they planned to stay until they heard 
from the vaticans highest court 
we entered the monastery for a particular lifestyle and what 
these other liberal nuns did is change these rules sister john 
of the cross one of the barricaded nuns whose temporary vows 
expired said in a telephone interview shortly after the nuns took 
over the infirmary we wouldnt be doing this unless we were 
desperate

atwater as a trustee of the university 
about 2000 students protesting atwaters the selection took 
over an auditorium stage friday and forced officials to move a 
convocation including presentation of an honorary degree to comedian 
bill cosby 
the convocation was moved to an art gallery where there was a 
brief ceremony to give cosby an honorary degree before he left the 
campus 
the students at howard university have a tradition of being 
activists university spokesman alan hermesch said later when 
they feel stongly about issues they demonstrate 
the students said their main complaint was the schools decision 
last month to name atwater whom they identified with controversial 
ads during george bushs presidential campaign last year featuring 
willie horton a murderer who attacked a maryland couple while he 
was on furlough from a massachusetts prison 
the horton issue contributed to the rising antiblack sentiment 
of the american people said michael lewis a spokesman for a

commissioner for refugees after vietnam promised not to prosecute 
the returnees

thailand has been redirecting vietnamese boat people away from

a federal judge has sided with blacks 
who claimed that the town of starkes atlarge voting policy has 
effectively shut them out of local government 
us district judge w terrell hodges noting that the starke 
charter still contains a residential segregation clause concluded 
in his 42page order filed monday that blacks have suffered from 
pervasive racial discrimination 
he gave each side 30 days to propose remedies 
city attorney terence brown had argued during trial in june that 
the atlarge system benefited all starke residents and the north 
florida town of 5300 people was too small to divide into districts 
but attorneys representing a group of black residents and the 
bradford county branch of the naacp who filed the lawsuit in 1986 
said citywide voting for city commission members has shut out 
starkes black residents who represent 32 percent of the voting 
population 
hodges found that although city services have not been denied to 
blacks political opportunity has been in both elective and 
appointive positions 
perhaps the clearest example of citysponsored discrimination 
can be found in the city charter of 1927 the judge wrote the 
provision still on the books but not enforced for years requires 
that blacks reside in the northeast section of the town known 
locally as reno 
the lingering effects of this historical racial discrimination 
are evident by the fact that blacks today continue to be segregated 
by custom in the northeastern quadrant of the city the judges 
order said 
if starkes atlarge voting system is allowed to remain it 
will continue to deny blacks equal access to the citys political 
process he wrote 
starke has held atlarge elections for its five city 
commissioners one of whom serves as mayor and for the city clerk 
and police chief 
were hoping we can settle as far as drawing the lines up 
without any further battle said carolyn spooner a member of the 
bradford county naacp and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit 
i would hope that both sides can sit down and work out an 
agreement that is acceptable to both and get down to running city 
government said city commissioner ed wall 
the next local elections are scheduled for fall

and south american routes leonard said 
at new yorks kennedy international airport alan rosen a 
businessman from woodmere ny arrived on an eastern flight just 
before the strike was announced and said he believed the walkout 
means the end of the airline

off flight 194 from west palm beach which landed at 1150 pm 1 
hours late 
leonard said most flights will be suspended at easterns atlanta 
hub 
eastern ticket offices were extending their hours to help rebook

possible leonard said

nonunion mechanics and technicians to augment management 
maintenance workers leonard said

a bid to take the nations largest and 
bestknown legal brothel public through a 233 million stock 
offering has become an international affair says the head of the 
company handling the sale 
when youve got the most unusual offering in the history of 
wall street you get calls from all over the world eric walloga 
president of the tampa flabased american wallstreet securities 
inc said friday

broker in canada whos called in for a very very large order 
walloga represents mustang ranch inc an investors group made 
up primarily of reno businessmen and attorneys who want to raise the 
money to buy the brothel 10 miles east of reno from owners joe and 
sally conforte 
the confortes would receive 13 million for the brothel and 5 
million for promising not to set up a competing bordello walloga

working capital prostitution is legal in most of nevadas rural 
counties

cat stevens once sang about peace but disc 
jockeys nationwide are having a less than peaceful reaction to his 
support of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death threat against 
satanic verses author salman rushdie 
stevens was a leading pop balladeer of the 1970s putting out 
such hits as moon shadow peace train wild world and 
morning has broken 
but its been years since his last hit and the singersongwriter 
whose gentle style fit in so well during the last years of the 
hippie generation has long since abandoned his music career to 
follow the moslem faith 
the britishborn stevens who now goes by the moslim name yusuf 
islam leaped back into the spotlight last week when he created an 
international controversy by telling moslem students in england that 
khomeinis call to kill rushdie was supported by the teachings of 
islams holy book the koran 
radio stations around the united states responded almost 
immediately by banning stevens records from their airwaves 
the koran makes it clear if someone defames the prophet then 
he must die the singerturnedteacher said 
stevens in a statement released friday denied he wants to see 
the author killed however adding that he simply stated the 
islamic ruling on the rushdie affair 
my only crime was i suppose in being honest stevens said 
in the statement released in london i stood up and expressed my 
belief and i am in no way apologizing for it 
he also said the novel insults god and his prophets including 
those prophets honored by christians and jews as well as moslems 
meanwhile officials at radio stations across the united states 
said friday they have pulled the singers records from their play 
lists 
stations such as wbzyam in new castle pa kzpsfm in dallas 
wcxrfm in washington dc webefm in westport conn and klsxfm 
in los angeles have dropped his records from their programming 
in detroit albumrock purveyor wriffm promoted a no cat 
stevens weekend by cutting into his songs with explosions or the 
sound of a punch in the mouth right after a very optimistic and 
nonviolent line of dialogue program director marty bender said 
were doing the no cat stevens weekend to make a point about 
one human being advocating the death of another this guy carries 
a lot of weight a lot of people grew up listening to his stuff 
bender said 
a spokesman for wcxr in the nations capital said that station 
pulled the records off the air feb 28 after serious discussion of 
listeners complaints that they felt uncomfortable hearing cat 
stevens 
we didnt do this to generate publicity or to scream our call 
letters out said promotion director mark lapidus were trying

midnight struck and pat mcgarry took a swig of beer 
thrust up a sign promising punishment for scab workers and walked 
across the street separating union headquarters from eastern 
airlines property 
the third strike against the airline in 31 years had begun 
they wanted it and now they have it said mcgarry 22 an 
aircraft mechanic whose father russ is coordinating national 
strike activities for the 8500member machinists union 
the union went on strike at midnight friday when talks in 
washington collapsed 
mcgarry was one of the first to reach the gates locked and 
topped with barbed wire before him stood police in riot gear 
behind him more than 2500 redshirted machinists and supporters 
quickly filled the narrow entrance way in front of eastern hangars 
for nearly 15 minutes the chainlink fence took the brunt of the 
frustration and anger union members say has been building since 
texas air president frank lorenzo acquired the airline three years 
ago the fence bent under the push but did not give the padlocked 
gates rattled and police raised tear gas guns 
were just letting off steam said bob santos 41 an eastern 
baggage handler of 21 years hey we just want to let them know 
were here 
a few paper cups were lobbed over the fence soon they were 
replaced by rocks and bottles the crash of a cinder block startled 
some officers the chips were quickly gathered up and hurled toward 
several eastern management workers who retreated inside 
get back get back across the street cried a union official 
we want to keep this legal were going to set up pickets but 
were not going to break any laws 
a few union members lurched for the fence but were pulled back 
by union leaders 
then car horns blared workers heading back to union headquarters 
blocked traffic for nearly 10 minutes as an effigy of a scab 
worker was torn apart the legs of the dummy were tossed above the 
crowd the head rested on the hood of a pickup truck 
i hope frank lorenzo is watching said santos the message 
is pretty obvious 
after the display police moved in and herded workers back onto 
union property twentyfive minutes after midnight the first of the 
workers began to leave 
i think we made our point said ray fernandez a 21year 
mechanic suspended without pay for a month following wildcat 
walkouts in february it was really just for show 
it was loud but pretty peaceful said miami police 
spokeswoman myriam royale 
no arrests were made no injuries were reported and no damage was 
found she said 
two hours into the strike most of the workers had left the union 
headquarters and pickets were under way at eastern headquarters 
terminals and cargo facilities 
were going to keep this peaceful said wally haber senior

a founder of a leading group of 
communist rebels today called president corazon aquino a 
figurehead and claimed the military actually runs her government 
jose maria sison cofounder of the outlawed communist party of 
the philippines made his remarks in a telephone interview from the 
netherlands where he has sought political asylum manila radio 
station dzrh reached him at offices of the philippine rebel national 
democratic front in utrecht 
the front is the umbrella organization for 14 filipino marxist 
groups including the communist party of the philippines and its 
military arm the new peoples army the rebels have been fighting 
the manila government for 20 years 
sison said mrs aquino has a different relationship with the 
countrys 160000member armed forces than did former president 
ferdinand marcos who she ousted in a civilianbacked military 
rebellion in february 1986 
marcos controlled and manipulated the military as an 
instrument sison said mrs aquino on the other hand is being 
controlled and manipulated by the military aquino is a 
figurehead president 
sison said defense secretary fidel ramos a retired armed forces 
chief of staff holds sway in the military while mrs aquinos 
brother rep jose cojuangco controls money matters he did not 
elaborate 
col oscar florendo the armed forces spokesman who was 
interviewed on the same radio program said sison is wrong 
i think sison is losing his mind florendo said he has a 
very rich imagination maybe that is the effect of the good life in 
the netherlands because he is not thinking of problems there 
sison was on a speaking tour in europe when his passport was 
revoked in september by the government 
military officials accused sison of engaging in subversive 
activities against the government in his travels abroad the 
military has also charged that sison had resumed his post as leader 
of the clandestine communist party 
sison said nothing of his relationship to the rebel group during 
his radio program he also did not say whether dutch authorities 
have granted his application for asylum 
sison who led a handful of university intellectuals in founding 
the banned party in december 1968 was jailed for nearly 10 years 
until mrs aquino set him free

the state board of parole says bernhard goetz 
must serve the full oneyear prison sentence he got for illegally 
carrying the gun he used to shoot four teenagers on a new york city 
subway in 1984 
releasing goetz after just two months in jail would deprecate 
the seriousness of the crime and undermine respect for the law 
the board said friday 
monday was the earliest goetz could have been released 
edward elwin executive director of the parole board said the 
decision meant goetz would have to serve his full oneyear sentence 
minus any time off for good behavior unless he can persuade a court 
to overturn the boards ruling 
goetz 41 was convicted on the gun charge but acquitted of 
attempted murder assault and reckless endangerment charges the 
case drew international attention 
some people called the white radio technician a racist vigilante 
for shooting four black young men who were panhandling 
others hailed goetz as a hero who resisted a robbery 
goetz maintained the men were about to rob him and that he was 
acting in self defense 
goetzs attorney mark baker said he might try to have the 
decision overturned and called the boards decision outrageous 
anybody in power is afraid to do something that favors bernhard 
goetz for fear of being labeled a racist by the fringe elements 
he said so he sits and rots 
hes angry hes frustrated baker said of goetz he 
doesnt belong there 
goetz began serving his sentence jan 13 after appeals in the 
state courts failed on monday the us supreme court refused to 
reverse the conviction

the federal aviation administration has issued an 
emergency order requiring all us airlines to reinforce latch 
mechanisms on boeing 747 cargo doors within 30 days 
fridays emergency airworthiness directive which speeds up the 
timetable of an earlier directive also specifies inspections and 
tests of the doors that must be done until modifications are 
completed 
the action friday follows the feb 24 accident involving a united 
airlines jet that had taken off from honolulu in which a 10by 
20foot hole ripped in the fuselage and nine people were sucked from 
the craft they are presumed dead 
though the cause of the accident has yet to be determined the 
possible failure of the forward cargo door latch is under 
investigation the door was separated from the aircraft with parts 
of the fuselage that surrounded it 
the order affects about 150 airplanes however tom neale of the 
air transport association in washington dc said some airlines 
have already made the required modifications which include steel 
reinforcements to cargo door latches 
the faa had issued a directive last july 1 ordering the doors 
inspected and modified by the end of 1989 or july 1 1990 depending 
on the type of locking mechanism installed 
that order was issued after a cargo door on a pan am 747 opened 
1 inches at the start of a flight from london to san francisco faa 
officials said they didnt believe at the time the situation 
warranted an emergency directive 
the faa also said it planned to issue another airworthiness 
directive in the near future requiring improvements in the warning 
system that alerts flight crews when any cargo door is not properly 
closed and locked that order was expected as soon as the design 
improvements can be delivered and tested

eastern airlines passengers today contended with 
canceled weekend flights bus companies geared up for extra business 
and commuter railroads readied to become the next target of the 
striking machinists union 
eastern machinists hoping to bolster their bargaining position 
said they would set up picket lines at commuter railroads in the new 
york city area that serve 320000 people daily 
this thing will really take off on monday when we take out the 
railroads and were prepared to do that said michael oconnell 
president of local 1894 at new yorks kennedy international airport 
after the machinists strike against eastern began early today 
eastern responded by cutting up to threequarters of its weekend 
flights including most flights out of its atlanta hub and nearly 60 
other cities the carriers pilots and flight attendants said they 
would honor the picket lines 
the miamibased airline however planned to maintain service to 
nearly 50 cities including most flights out of miami and on 
easterns northeast shuttle and latin american routes 
eastern also said other airlines were honoring its tickets 
but the strike probably ruined a trip to disney world for phyllis 
and alan zisser of oceanside ny and their 3yearold son they 
arrived at kennedy airport as the strike began and their eastern 
tickets to orlando fla werent much good at the moment 
even 48 hours ago they told me dont worry were not going on 
strike said mrs zisser now i cant get on half the flights 
because theyre all booked and dont have enough money to pay the 
difference some other airlines want 
the machinists union has contended that its union can picket any 
transportation company covered by the railway labor act which 
includes airlines railroads and some shipping concerns 
but other airlines insisted their machinists and other airline 
workers would be violating nostrike clauses in their contracts if 
they honored picket lines set up by eastern strikers 
on friday a federal judge in washington agreed with the 
airlines and prohibited machinists union members at other airlines 
from joining the strike 
but in newark nj gene hoffman general chairman of district 
100 of the machinists said union members at other airlines were 
expected to walk out 
theres a good possibility some of the other airlines will go 
on sympathy strike with us such as twa united northwest and 
usair he said 
in the new york city area union leaders at the long island rail 
road metronorth commuter railroad and new jersey transit say they 
will honor eastern picket lines on monday 
robert kiley chairman of the metropolitan transportation 
authority which oversees the long island rail road and 
metronorth predicted absolute chaos next week and the fact is 
theres not a lot we can do 
ramses hernandez a striking new york machinist said he 
understood that commuters would be upset if the strike expanded to 
railroads 
but were fighting for all working people he said we 
already have agreed to lower our salaries but thats not enough 
people just dont understand that this strike is not just for us if 
eastern does this to us other companies will try to do it to them 
in washington the head of amtrak said the national passenger 
railroad could continue limited operations for only a few days if 
picketed by workers supporting a strike against eastern 
elizabeth hale a spokeswoman for greyhound lines inc in new 
york said they would be using 200 additional buses to run extra 
nonstop service between boston new york philadelphia and 
washington beginning monday 
travel agents said many eastern passengers may be stranded 
because a lot of other airlines and railroads were fully booked 
ida cartazo coowner of the mediterranean agency in lodi nj 
said she had a group of 18 college students scheduled to fly to fort 
myers sunday for spring break the students made their reservations 
including hotel four months ago 
the only thing i could do is tell them to drive down she

bodies are lying in morgues sometimes for years 
while their survivors negotiate for money and jobs as compensation 
from the dead relatives workplace an official daily said today 
for example the china daily said survivors of a worker at the 
beijing theater troupe have refused to let the body be cremated 
until the troupe agrees to provide two apartments and a job for one 
of the children 
a second case was cited in the report of the body of a woman that 
has been kept at one hospital for more than five years because the 
family and her work unit cant agree on compensation 
it also said in another hospital run by the military that 100 of 
the 500 bodies in the morgue had been there more than two months 
the daily quoted a labor ministry official as saying staterun 
work units must pay pensions to children too young to support 
themselves if their parents die or are seriously injured on the job 
however there are no regulations saying children can take their 
parents job the report said 
the official was quoted as saying chinese people are too 
dependent on the government and their work units he said the 
chinese should develop their abilities to support themselves in 
society

an oil tanker that ran aground floated free when 
salvage workers lightened the ships load to prevent more crude oil 
or fuel from spilling into the pacific ocean and washing up on 
hawaiis beaches 
the 800foot exxon houston suddenly just started floating 
coast guard spokesman david goff said friday night 
officials had planned to wait until high tide early today but 
workers who pumped off more than 9400 tons of ballast water and 
some of the remaining 38 million gallons of crude oil lightened the 
ship enough so that it floated free on its own said scott 
hartvigsen another coast guard spokesman 
he said the ship was being towed to deeper water and two ships 
would stay with it overnight but everythings going great so far 
officials today were to assess the damage to the ship as well as 
the extent of the oil spill already in the thousands of gallons he 
said 
meanwhile state and federal agencies launched a cleanup of the 
thick smelly oil washing in along a 2mile stretch of littleused 
shoreline 15 miles west of honolulu and famed waikiki beach 
high winds and rough seas tore the vessel from its offshore 
mooring thursday night it ran aground on a coral reef and ruptured 
a fuel tank 
a local oil spill cleanup cooperative called the clean islands 
council was on the scene said les rogers spokesman for exxon co 
usa the houstonbased domestic oil and gas division of exxon corp 
the coast guards pacific area strike team was en route to help in 
the cleanup 
exxon co usa will pay for the costs of the cleanup according 
to exxon attorney leonard alcantara 
the exxon houston had unloaded 400000 barrels of alaska crude 
oil at an offshore mooring a mile off the hawaiian independent 
refinery when it tore free said capt gordon piche commanding 
officer of the coast guards marine safey office 
the skipper captain kevin dick notified the coast guard there 
was no need for assistance but 2 hours later the ship radioed it 
had run aground in 27 feet of water about onethird mile offshore of 
barbers point located on the southwest corner of oahu hawaiis 
main island piche said 
when the ship tore away from its mooring floating hoses 
unloading the oil pulled free spilling about 25000 gallons of 
crude oil into the sea 
although valves automatically closed the oil spilling from the 
hoses created a threemilelong oil slick spreading parallel to the 
shore to the east toward honolulu by friday night it was 
dissipating and posed no immediate threat to the shoreline 
officials said 
when the ship ran aground one of the vessels fuel tanks 
ruptured spilling about 92000 gallons of the thick black oil much 
of it washing ashore fouling the sand and coral rocks 
libert k landgraf deputy director of the department of land and 
natural resources said there was no immediate evidence of injury or 
death to marine life or birds 
oil washed up on a beach where a popular tourist luau is held 
prompting the state department of health to post polluted waters 
signs and at other areas as far as two miles to the north said 
coast guard spokesman dennis hubbard 
meanwhile in the florida keys an oil slick about 2 miles long 
and a quartermile wide was reported friday about 10 to 12 miles off 
the north key largo coast said to coast guard spokesman joe dye 
the origin of the oil had not been determined but coast guard 
marine safety office spokeswoman lynn mountcastle said it could have 
been bunker oil released by a ship

president pw botha says he is 
determined to serve out the rest of his current term despite 
derision and attacks following his stroke 
the 73yearold botha in an interview published today by major 
afrikaanslanguage newspapers said it was too early to speculate 
whether he would seek another term after his fiveyear term expires 
in september he plans to return to work in april 
botha suffered a stroke on jan 18 and has spent most of the time 
since then recuperating at his coastal vacation home while his 
duties are carried out by an acting president constitutional 
development minister chris heunis 
botha said in the interview he would complete the term despite 
calls for him to step aside 
the fact that i am still subject to derision and attacks shows 
that i am in the way of some people he was quoted as saying i 
have a task to perform and as my strength increases i will proceed 
with that task 
calls from his resignation have come from liberal and farright 
opposition parties as well as from some members of his national 
party a former cabinet minister hendrik schoeman said at a 
national party rally wednesday that botha should make way for fw 
klerk who took over as party leader a month ago and is heir 
apparent for the presidency 
schoeman has said out loud what all other nationalists are 
thinking president botha must go now business day a leading 
financial newspaper said friday in an editorial 
although de klerk shares bothas views on most major policy 
issues he has been depicted as more flexible during bothas 
convalescence both de klerk and heunis have suggested in speeches 
that the government is willing to lessen its reliance on racial 
classification as the foundation for political and social structures 
however de klerk has told white voters he will not betray them 
and has affirmed his commitment to segregated residential areas for 
whites who want them like botha de klerk has given no indication 
he is willing to consider full voting rights for the countrys black 
majority

an immigration and naturalization service official 
described as irresponsible an audit that claimed thousands of 
citizenship certificates worth as much as 155 million on the 
black market were lost from the miami office 
these are dangerous allegations that now show those who 
investigate need investigation said perry rivkin ins district 
director in miami 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the governments 
audit was conducted at the request of attorney general dick 
thornburgh runkel would not comment on specific findings of the 
report adding that it wont be made public until ins has had an 
opportunity to review and comment on it 
the audit claimed 23000 citizenship certificates which are as 
good as a passport had been misplaced 
about 14000 of the supposedly missing documents belonged to new 
citizens sworn in by thenchief justice warren burger in a widely 
publicized july 1986 ceremony at the orange bowl said rivkind 
this is the most irresponsible statement i have ever heard in 
all my years of service rivkind said friday the fact is they 
never were missing all they had to do was to look into the 
computer 
all but 1200 of the certificates were discovered in one computer 
bank and the rest were expected to be located after a check of a 
second rivkind said 
rivkind said he wrote washington two weeks ago about problems in 
the report and asked that the auditors be investigated 
there were false statements made he said when i first saw 
that document it took 60 seconds to ascertain through computer 
records that those certificates were not missing 
earlier friday us immigration and naturalization commissioner 
alan nelson was asked about the certificates at a senate judiciary 
immigration subcommitte hearing in washington 
nelson told the panels chairman sen edward m kennedy 
dmass he first learned of the supposedly missing certificates 
from the justice audit the commissioner said he didnt know about 
the finding until he read the audit 
in friday editions the washington post reported that justice 
auditors found serious instances of mismanagement including the 
episode involving the missing certificates 
the audit said ins couldnt account for them more than a year 
after investigators discovered them missing and the agency took no 
steps to prevent further losses 
the report also said that two years after investigators found at 
least 61500 naturalized citizens hadnt turned in their permanent 
resident alien cards the agency had not tried to recover them

physicians treating a snakevenom 
researcher whose need for rare medicine prompted white house 
intervention were awaiting a shipment of serum from iran today to 
counteract a deadly viper bite 
in an unusual effort initiated by stephen studdert special 
assistant to president bush antivenins effective against the bite 
of a pakistani pit viper were located in iran england and the 
soviet union and us customs rules were waived to place the 
shipments quickly on flights to the united states 
the antivenins were sought for william e haast 78 who was in 
serious but stable condition at the university of utah health 
sciences center today after being bitten in the left hand by the 
viper earlier in the week 
the british shipment from the english national poison unit in 
london arrived friday night but doctors did not administer it to 
haast deciding instead to wait for the more effective iranian 
serum said nursing supervisor rick taylor 
the one from tehran is the best one i understand because of 
its properties taylor said we will not give the london one 
unless mr haasts condition deteriorates 
haast was being given plasma intermittently to replace 
coagulating elements of his blood the snakes venom prohibits blood 
from coagulating and victims often bleed to death 
haast director of the miami serpentarium laboratories at the 
universitys research park has been bitten 148 times by snakes and 
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles but he had no immunity 
to withstand the vipers bite and checked himself into the hospital 
wednesday 
the pakistani pit viper or sawscaled viper is one of 1000 
exotic poisonous snakes haast keeps at the lab where their venom 
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for 
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins 
haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from californias 
san diego zoo including one shipment obtained through an unusual 
airport relay involving zoo personnel a helicopter and a departing 
jetliner 
studdert of salt lake city said he became involved thursday night 
when he received a call from an associate of haasts the associate 
who had read accounts of a speech studdert gave in utah describing 
bushs kinder gentler approach to human problems said the 
serum could only be located in the soviet union and iran and asked 
for the bush administrations help 
studdert said he immediately set up conference calls with people 
around the united states and in other countries after doctors and 
specialists advised the white house that the serums haast needed 
were unavailable in the united states 
using an american interpreter who speaks farsi studdert put 
haasts representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists 
in iran 
two different serums were needed he said one for young pit 
vipers and another for older snakes of the same breed 
vials of the iranian serum were due to arrive in utah this 
afternoon 
the serum found at the london institute was the antivenin used 
for younger vipers 
another supply of the serum was obtained through the tashkent 
institute of vaccines in the soviet union that serum was being 
flown to frankfurt for eventual shipment to the united states 
when i decided i should get involved i clearly did not want to 
disturb the president studdert said but i decided this is 
what the president would have wanted us to do

a senior swiss ski federation official 
has accused prince charles of being reckless by skiing off marked 
trails where a year ago an avalanche killed a close friend of the 
heir to the british throne 
the official made the accusation after a newspaper printed a 
photograph purportedly showing charles skiing in a restricted area 
on mount gotschna near warning signs printed in four languages 
including english 
there are those who learn from a mistake and there are others 
who dont wednesdays frontpage picture shows clearly that neither 
the prince nor his entourage heed the warnings of the responsible 
local officials sepp scheibert said in a letter published today 
in the newspaper blick 
scheibert chief of the federations mass sports section 
stressed in his letter to the mass circulation paper that the 
princes group also was off trails when an avalanche killed a former 
queens aide maj hugh lindsay 34 and broke both legs of another 
member of the party patricia palmertomkinson 
in addition scheibert wrote the davos institute for avalanche 
research said snow conditions on the day the photograph was taken 
were identical with those prevailing a year ago when the killer 
avalanche struck 
what can the local officials do when such an illustrious 
party ignores all rules and recommendations he asked 
such conduct turns to ridicule all advisory bodies he said 
charles 40 arrived at klosters on monday for a skiing vacation 
at the resort where the tragedy occurred march 10 1988 
he narrowly escaped injury on that day when the avalanche roared 
down on a group of skiers he was leading on a steep run off marked 
trails 
swiss authorities ruled the sixmember group caused the avalanche 
but that nobody could be held personally responsible 
mrs palmertomkinsons husband charles who was with the skiing 
party in 1988 also accompanied the prince this year 
the group has been reported skiing mostly on a face of the 
8000foot mount gotschna several miles south of the site of the 
earlier avalanche

the british government today reaffirmed its support 
for author salman rushdie and warned that continued agitation over 
his novel the satanic verses could do serious harm 
home secretary douglas hurd said he understood the hurt and 
insult being felt by moslems over the book but said most britons 
accept that in a free country people have the right of freedom of 
expression 
rushdie 41 who was born a moslem in india has been in hiding 
since irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered his death on feb 
14 and iranian clergy offered a bounty of up to 52 million for the 
killing 
hurd spoke to reporters at a local government conference of the 
governing conservative party it came one day after prime minister 
margaret thatcher said she believes the novel has deeply offended 
islam 
earlier today irans official islamic republic news agency said 
that mrs thatchers comment was the first expression of sympathy 
with moslems over the book later today tehran radio released a 
lengthy commentary saying mrs thatchers acknowledgement must be 
followed up with concrete actions 
if britain accepts that the book is insulting the staterun 
radio said it cannot object to the death sentence on the writer 
which has been issued in line with sharia islamic law 
the radio called on mrs thatchers government to clarify 
whether or not freedom of expression and writing can be a license 
for defamation and insult if the british government does not 
see the freedom of expression as a license for defamation then 
legal prosecution of the author prevention of further publication 
of the book and removing already published copies are reasonable 
requests which can remove much of the friction in the present 
situation tehran radio said in a report monitored in cyprus 
irans parliament said on tuesday it would cut diplomatic ties 
with britain in a week unless it disavows the contents of rushdies 
novel which has been held as blasphemous by moslem protesters 
around the world 
britain insists khomeini withdraw the death sentence on rushdie 
who is now a naturalized briton rushdie telephoned a parliamentary 
aide on friday to express concern that britain was backing down in 
its support for him 
asked whether the government was changing its attitude to 
rushdie hurd said theres no vacillation lets for heaven sake 
let the thing settle lets not keep the agitation going it could 
do serious harm 
irna also said mrs thatchers statement was a clear attempt to 
defuse the row between britain and iran before next tuesdays 
deadline that the iranian parliament gave to london to alter its 
attitude or face the consequences of a complete cut in diplomatic 
ties 
the dispute has led the 12member european economic community and 
several other countries to withdraw their ambassadors from iran 
in halifax in northern england about 80 teenagers broke away 
friday from an antirushdie demonstration by 1600 people and 
damaged several cars police said a policeman fell and bruised his 
leg they said 
moslems who organized the protest immediately apologized and 
offered to pay for any damage police said 
one death was reported friday in clashes between police and 
antirushdie protests in the northern indian city of srinagar 
police reportedly fired on moslem demonstrators killing at least 
one person and injuring more than 100 
eighteen other people have been killed in protests over the book 
in india and pakistan 
demonstrations by moslems occurred today in bangladesh where 
about 400 people marched through dhaka shouting death to salman 
rushdie and in thailand where about 700 protesters in bangkok 
burned an effigy of rushdie

of jewish settlers a defense ministry official said the army was 
concerned clashes would break out between jewish settlers and jewish 
peace activists

saying peace now was one of five groups that left four israeli 
cities to meet west bank residents in different locations to talk 
peace today the army blocked them all israel radio said 
as the jerusalem convoy made its way north from the city 
military jeeps drove into the middle of the road 
im sorry but i must inform you this is a closed military 
area a soldier identified as col chai said you cannot 
proceed 
we werent planning any assemblies or marches or demonstrations

leaflet in ramallah saying we call on the masses of palestinians 
not to attack cars with peace now signs

there are dead and wounded on both sides but he wont let even one 
day go by in which the two sides talk to each other cohen said 
if anyone is killed or wounded today it is his fault

city high school students are taking lessons in 
fear these days and their teachers are the decepticons a loosely 
organized gang of young thugs who have assumed nearmythical status 
while the gang which preys largely on fellow teenagers is 
responsible for only a small part of youth crime in the city 
educators say its impact goes far beyond its reality 
the idea of the decepticons has a lot of power over the kids 
its a symbol of something bad like the boogey man is coming the 
decepticons are coming said patricia black formerly a bronx 
principal and now the superintendent of manhattan high schools 
the drug rings that have gradually replaced most of the citys 
old neighborhoodbased youth gangs are more violent and make a lot 
more money but the decepts who emerged about three years ago 
and named themselves after a group of cartoon characters have 
gained a unique hold on the imagination of high school students as a 
horde of rowdies preying on easy victims near schools taking 
anything from earrings to expensive sneakers 
black said the mere rumor that the decepticons were going to 
invade her south bronx high school a couple of years ago brought the 
police out and prompted many parents to keep their children at home 
the decepts failed to show up in fact theyve never been known to 
actually invade a school building 
a group of students leaving the park west high school on 
manhattans west side several days ago all knew of the decepticons 
reputation and said many teenagers feared them 
they steal bus passes sneakers gold jewelry anything said 
one boy who declined to give his name but he and the other youths 
said they had never actually encountered the decepticons and knew no 
one who had 
there are 56 known members of the decepticons including 14 girls 
who call themselves deceptinets police said gang members who come 
from all over the city and range in age from 15 to 22 typically 
hang out near a school during lunch breaks or after classes and 
occasionally mug a vulnerable youngster 
they generally gather first at a brooklyn high school and then 
commute to manhattan where they can seek victims around several high 
schools along the east side or west side subway lines said edward 
muir head of the united federation of teachers safety committee 
the decepticons have attained their notoriety largely because 
theyre the only game in town muir said drug rings with their 
tremendous profits lure most of the youths who would have been 
drawn to the oldstyle gangs and their turf battles authorities say 
you can certainly make a lot more money by selling drugs to 
kids than by stealing their sneakers muir said 
during the early 1970s the city had some 400 youth gangs with 
nearly 20000 members the police now know of 37 gangs with about 
1000 members said sgt john galea head of the police departments 
youth gang intelligence unit 
the decepticons named for fiendish missilehurling cartoon 
characters on televisions the transformers are the largest and 
by far the most notorious of the remaining youth gangs 
the decepts wear no insignia or gang colors and dress like many 
other teens in designer clothes expensive leather basketball shoes 
and lots of gold jewelry they dress like other city youngsters 
galea explained because they steal the other kids clothes 
they arm themselves with ax handles hammers box cutters 
occasionally knives but they rarely carry guns galea said almost 
exclusively their victims are their peers 
five decepticons were arrested on assault charges last year and 
gang members were charged in 43 robberies mostly involving thefts 
of clothing and jewelry police said 
the reality of the gang is that it exists the mythology is that 
it is everywhere in large numbers galea said we have reports 
that theyre going to invade schools in manhattan the bronx 
queens all in the same day 
galea says the decepticons are responsible for only a very 
very small portion of youth crime 
but the gang has a strong hold on the imaginations of many 
students who use the term decepts for any group of violent teens 
their name is by far the most infamous it does elicit fear 
galea said as the kids travel throughout the city this is the 
name they hear

theres a new face among the cows in 
the feedlot at robert gravelles farm 
a 500pound elk joined the herd last november and gravelles 
family named her elsie and kept quiet about her until hunting season 
was over 
elsies not a secret anymore but no one in this lake champlain 
town near the canadian border can figure out where she came from 
once we saw her coming out of the water coming out of the 
lake gravelle said that kind of makes me think she came from 
vermont she might have crossed the lake 
lake champlain separates new york from vermont 
wildlife officials say elsie probably escaped from captivity but 
so far no one has reported her missing a tag in the animals ear 
carries a number but no information about her home 
whatever her origin elsie should be safe among gravelles cows 
if anyone even looks at her the wrong way they could be in big 
trouble said lt charles reynolds of the state department of 
environmental conservation there is no open season on elk in new

oliver norths lawyers have been complaining 
since the former white house aide was indicted that national 
security concerns were imposing unfair restrictions on the defense 
last week they found an outlet for their frustration 
norths courier to the contras robert owen wrote memos 
outlining the military needs of the guerrilla force and the names of 
some central american officials assisting them 
the government censored portions of some of the memos for use at 
norths trial but last monday night norths lawyers found out that 
uncensored versions of the memos had become public eight months ago 
in a civil case 
adding fuel to the fire was the fact that two lawyers and the 
security chief in the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh 
had been told feb 10 about the dissemination of the uncensored 
memos 
on tuesday norths lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the 
indictment based on prosecutorial misconduct and renewed old motions 
that the classified information procedures act should be declared 
unconstitutional as applied to norths case 
on friday instead of the trial us district judge gerhard 
gesell held a hearing on norths motions on constitutionality he 
plans to rule this week 
at the hearing gesell both criticized norths lawyers for 
demanding too much disclosure and sought to reassure them 
there can be crossexamination without disclosing every name 
every security technique every secret code thats in the case 
said gesell 
at another point he said 
i dont want to kill anybody but beyond that you have 
an open door to disclose a substantial amount of sensitive 
material a comment that should give us intelligence agencies 
pause 
the tension between national security concerns and norths right 
to a fair trial promises to plague the former white house aides 
case to the end the trial in which opening statements were feb 
21 could last up to five months 
tuesday afternoon found one of the prosecutors in the case 
michael bromwich sitting in the witness box trying to explain what 
happened after owens lawyer mentioned to him feb 10 that he had 
given uncesored copies of the memos last june to the christic 
institute an activist group opposed to us policy toward central 
america 
bromwich said he informed the security officer in his office and 
then never gave the matter another thought the other prosecutor 
present in the meeting also moved on to other matters said john 
keker chief of the prosecution team in the north case the security 
officer allen stansbury said he decided to wait until after the 
justice department security chief returned from vacation before 
taking any action to retrieve the memos no one else was told 
including norths lawyers 
north attorney brendan sullivan had been crossexamining owen on 
monday and had objected to the prohibition of the use of a high 
costa rican officials name in one of the owen memos owen met with 
the official while on an inspection trip for a possible site for an 
airstrip 
the prosecution found out late monday night that the news media 
was getting uncensored versions of the memos prosecutors quickly 
obtained approval from intelligence agencies to authorize 
unrestricted use at trial of the ones deemed relevant to norths 
defense 
however the damage was done 
an evidentiary hearing should be held to determine when the ic 
was first aware of the production of documents to the christic 
institute what efforts if any the ic made to prevent disclosure to 
the institute why the fact of public disclosure was withheld from 
the defense and the court while these matters were being hotly 
litigated in the course of mr owens crossexamination and all 
other relevant information said sullivan 
problems have arisen repeatedly in the case in connection with 
classified material and the law that governs its use 
the prosecution was forced to seek dismissal of the conspiracy 
and theft counts in the indictment because attempting to prove them 
in court would have required disclosure of more classified material 
than intelligence agencies were willing to allow 
the prosecution has been helped somewhat by the pretrial 
disclosure provisions of federal law concerning use of classified 
material at trial norths lawyers have been required to notify the 
government of all the classified documents they plan to use in 
court also required was a 162page summary of classified testimony 
the defense plans to present 
when the defense declined to explain what counts of the 
indictment to which it planned to tie the material gesell declared 
he was unable to rule on its admissibility and said he would rule as 
the trial proceeds 
that approach triggered such serious concern in the intelligence 
community that on feb 9 the justice department began trying to 
delay the trial while prosecutors declared their intention to 
proceed the impasse was resolved when walshs office agreed to 
establish a notification mechanism under which the justice 
department would be told anytime particularly sensitive information 
was about to be presented by the defense in court the procedure 
would provide the government an opportunity to object

the blood bath triggered by venezuelas 
attempt to revive its economy underscores the gravity of latin 
americas 420 billion foreign debt 
venezuela the worlds eighthlargest oil producer has long been 
regarded as an oasis of prosperity and stability in a region swamped 
by poverty and political upheaval 
but last week rioting left at least 300 people dead 
venezuelans accustomed to three decades of democratic rule 
witnessed the specter of soldiers and tanks patrolling the capital 
under martial law 
the disturbances broke out monday when bus fares rose 30 percent 
by government decree at the same time prices on a range of basic 
goods and services such as gasoline bread and electricity rose 
sharply under the governments economicadjustment program which 
also provided for a rise in interest rates and a currency 
devaluation 
to offset price increases the government doubled the mininum 
wage to the equivalent of 110 a month but for many venezuelans 
the wage increases were cut in half by higher transport fares alone 
president carlos andres perez announced the measures feb 16 two 
weeks after taking office to satisfy requirements of the 
international monetary fund and western creditor banks the main 
requirement was that venezuela lift government subsidies that had 
kept prices artificially low for years 
had the government not imposed the price increases perez said 
friday it would have had no chance of obtaining 48 billion in 
loans from the imf 
he linked the civil unrest directly to venezuelas 33 billion 
foreign debt saying interest payments were consuming 70 percent of 
oil revenues and undermining the nations ability to provide for its 
18 million people 
moreover the president said debtburdened nations throughout 
latin america were vulnerable to similar uprisings spawned by 
economic hardship 
i hope this painful sacrifice by our country will cause the 
leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not 
exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious perez said 
according to a study last year by the caracasbased latin 
american economic system a regional think tank the region spent 
139 billion from 1982 to 1987 in servicing foreign debt not only 
did that not dent the obligation debt actually grew over the 
period mostly because of more loans just to pay interest 
if the trend continues the organization said the standard of 
living of latin americans will not return to levels of the 1970s 
until the year 2000 
venezuela is the regions fourthlargest debtor behind brazil at 
114 billion mexico at 106 billion and argentina at 54 billion 
venezuela however is one of the few developing countries that 
has been trying to repay debt dipping into reserves built up before 
the collapse in world oil prices in 1986 the others simply 
reschedule their debt 
peru with a foreign debt estimated by the world bank at 19 
billion has paid almost nothing on its debt since president alan 
garcia in 1985 imposed a ceiling on debt payments of 10 percent of 
the nations export income its foreign reserves have since run out 
and the country has entered into a steep recession 
venezuelas government is seeking to defer further interest 
payments on its foreign debt until september perez said any 
decision on delaying payment beyond that will depend on the success 
of his new economic program 
the major debtor nations have been urging creditor nations for 
years to come up with a comprehensive plan for solving the debt 
crisis but no formula has emerged 
a us banker based in caracas said the latin debt crisis could 
be traced mainly to illconceived government economic policies 
he said brazil had dealt with its huge debt by printing more 
money creating an annual inflation rate of 3000 percent 
in venezuela the banker said successive governments have tried 
to win popular support by maintaining low prices through subsidies 
the fact is they have pursued policies that would have brought 
them to the edge of economic ruin regardless of debt he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
for example gasoline which rose in price 80 percent had been 
selling for 6 cents a gallon 
the crunch started in the early 1980s as an oil glut forced 
prices down and the standard of living of most venezuelans fell oil 
revenues account for 90 percent of venezuelas foreign exchange 
earnings 
for many venezuelans the governments austerity measures 
confirmed that the days of prosperity were over years of pentup 
frustration were vented in the bloodiest rioting the country has 
seen 
perez said venezuelans could expect at least six more months of 
economic hardship before the economy begins to expand

up to the midnight hour federal mediators were 
holding out a glimmer of hope that eastern airlines might settle 
with its machinists union but in the end a 17month deadlock 
remained unstuck 
the two sides were about as far apart as labor and management can 
get 200 million 
the airline facing 1 millionaday losses wanted its biggest 
union to take a 15 percent to 26 percent pay cut totaling 150 
million the union wanted 8 percent salary increases for its 9100 
members at a cost of 50 million but offered in the final hours to 
start with a 15month freeze chief negotiator charles bryan said 
saturday 
each side characterized the others position as outrageous 
accusations flew back and forth the company was out to bust the 
union organized labor wanted a strike to test president bush 
parent company texas air head frank lorenzo wanted to chop up and 
sell off the 60yearold airline the union wanted a better deal 
than other employees who already had taken cuts management wanted a 
better deal than other airlines who operated at a profit without 
cutting salaries 
overshadowing the charges and countercharges was already shaken 
public confidence in air travel because of recent accidents and 
terrorism controversy over corporate takeovers such as the one that 
absorbed eastern into the nations largest airline company and 
questions about bushs relationship with organized labor in the 
first months of his administration 
these and other issues affecting aviation loomed over the final 
negotiations leading up to 1201 am saturday when bryan the 
president of the eastern local declared its shut down 
pressure on both sides to reach a settlement came mostly from the 
national mediation board which handles labor disputes in the 
transportation industry federal negotiator harry bickford had spent 
more than a year trying to get the two sides together 
other pressures early on pointed to a strike organized labor 
declared strong support for the union including pledges to honor 
picket lines no matter where they are set up eastern advertised the 
editorial support it was getting in its efforts to prevent bush from 
stepping in to stop a strike 
on thursday mediation board chairman walter c wallace had 
expressed strong optimism over the first new eastern proposal in 
months enthusiastically telling a news conference it offered a 
possible breakthrough in the talks 
it became clear on friday however that there wasnt going to be 
a breakthrough 
about three hours before the midnight friday end of a federally 
imposed 30day coolingoff period wallace said the union had 
rejected the new offer which only slightly toned down the proposed 
salary cuts 
but that was not the end of the negotiation in what was supposed 
to be a secret washington location 
reporters photographers and television crews gathered in the 
final hours on the sidewalk in front of the downtown radisson park 
terrace hotel to buttonhole negotiators as they entered and left 
hotel officials ushered journalists out of the hotel lobby but 
periodically sent out hotel personnel to serve free coffee 
easterns team already had set up shop at a different location 
which did remain secret much of the final bargaining was over the 
phone said wallace 
but a half dozen times during the evening eastern negotiators 
arrived and then left refusing to talk with reporters 
members of the air line pilots association which represents 
easterns 3500 pilots also walked in and out of the meetings but 
said little about the talks after issuing a statement threatening 
what they said would be safe and legal steps that would 
substantially delay flights nationwide 
union negotiators remained silent to the outside world 
later eastern chief negotiator tom matthews told reporters the 
company made several offers in the last hours but accused the union 
of never waivering from its original demand he said the company had 
modified its proposals to soften pay cuts 
its major new offer would have reduced hourly topscale wages 
from 1883 to 16 for aircraft mechanics and from 1560 to 1154 
for baggage handlers with no hope of increases for five years 
the cuts were a few cents kinder than the offer eastern stuck 
with during months of talk but they were still too harsh for the 
machinists bryan said easterns bargaining demands were virtually 
the same as they had been since the beginning the union on the 
other hand offered a 12month wage freeze then a 15month freeze 
in its final efforts to avert a strike 
union demands included sweeping measures such as guarantees from 
eastern that it would rebuild itself to its former size lorenzo has 
sold off some of its assets and is awaiting federal aviation 
administration approval to sell easterns lucrative northeast air 
shuttle services to new york developer donald trump 
company officials have accused the union of trying to run the 
business 
aflcio president lane kirkland in declaring national support 
for the machinists before the strike accused lorenzo of trying to 
destroy eastern 
what the facts will show said kirkland is that mr 
lorenzo has found it worth his while to purchase a good comapny and 
strip its assets rather than operate it fairly and decently 
bush foreclosed the surest way to averting a strike when he 
announced nine hours before the deadline that he would not call an 
emergency panel that would have delayed a walkout by at least 60 
days his decision came despite recommendations from the national 
mediation board 33 senators and labor unions that he step in 
in what was viewed by many in organized labor as the first major 
test of his dealings with the union movement bush did exactly what 
management had asked nothing 
it was clear that when bush made his decision he knew settlement 
was unlikely transportation secretary samuel skinner shortly after 
meeting with bush said all the information he had pointed to a 
strike 
it is time for this dispute to come to an end it makes no 
sense whatsoever to let these skirmishes and drawn out negotiations 
continue for another 60 days skinner said 
one of easterns offers in the final 90 minutes said the union 
could walk off the job for 48 hours and get full pay for employees 
while they vote on whether to ratify the strike 
that too was rejected 
after it was all over easterns mathews declared we will 
continue to bargain strikes are not the end they are the 
beginning of another period of time

in his 83rd year samuel beckett has emerged from a 
studied silence with a brief novella a meditation on old age that a 
reviewer praised as another of becketts nihilistic mantras best 
mumbled aloud 
only 200 copies of stirrings still the 1801word new work 
by the nobel prizewinning author of waiting for godot are 
being printed they are offered for sale at 1720 each 
the way theyve gone this morning theyll be gone by next 
week publisher john calder said friday after the entire novella 
was published in the guardian newspaper 
the signed limited edition includes illustrations by the irish 
artist louis lebrocquy who also illustrated an edition of james 
joyces dubliners calder said a massmarket edition will be 
published he said but not for a couple of years 
calder said stirrings still was written in response to pleas 
from becketts american publisher barney rossett formerly of grove 
press inc though there are no immediate plans to print it in the 
united states 
it is a tale reviewer frank kermode wrote in the guardian that 
is typical beckett of a featureless man in a virtually 
featureless world expressing a condition in which everything that 
characterizes some of our normal assumptions about human existence 
is virtually annulled in prose rich only its unmatched 
parsimony 
given the price kermode said purchasers can henceforth 
meditate the destitution of their existence and simultaneously take 
pleasure in their privilege 
this paragraph is typical of the style of the opus 
a clock afar struck the hours and halfhours the same as when 
among others darly once died and left him strokes now clear as if 
carried by a wind now faint on the still air cries afar now faint 
now clear head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the 
halfhour would not and half fearing that it would not similarly 
when the halfhour struck similarly when the cries a moment ceased 
or merely wondering or merely waiting waiting to hear 
born in dublin and educated at trinity college cambridge 
beckett went to paris in 1928 and became acquainted with james 
joyce the irish novelist and poet who became the subject of 
becketts first published essay a year later 
beckett eventually decided to live in france saying he preferred 
france in war to ireland in peace he has continued to live in 
france writing both in french and english 
his last work calder said was a novella titled worstword ho 
in 1982 
stirrings still is hardly becketts most concise work 
breath a 1969 theater piece consisted of a pile of rubbish a 
breath and a cry lasting no more than 30 seconds

returning to his capitol hill office one night 
last week sen arlen specter jokingly told a reporter this is 
the last time im riding in an elevator with a woman whos not my 
wife 
black humor remarks like those of the pennsylvania republican 
spawned by the controversy over john towers alleged drinking and 
womanizing were common in the corridors of power and underscored 
the ticklish nature of the debate over president bushs nominee for 
defense secretary 
so sensitive were senators that one telephoned a reporter at 
night simply to make sure it was clear his comments about a 
colleagues fondness for bimbos and booze were made in jest 
times have changed in the senate said sen ted stevens 
ralaska a tower defender who vowed to put the spotlight on any 
senator thought to be engaging in improper behavior in the future 
tower a 24year senate veteran who is facing an uphill battle in 
his drive for confirmation tried to turn the tables on his former 
colleagues by demanding that congress articulate what its own 
standards are on drinking as well as accepting honoraria campaign 
contributions and vacations from special interest groups 
towers challenge did not fall on deaf ears 
some senators said the historic debate might lead to reforms in 
campaign financing and even produce a stricter ethical climate in 
the nations capital where social habits have already changed over 
the last decade 
tower raised the money issue as a counterpoint to critics who 
said he was too cozy with the defense industry because his 
consulting firm accepted about 1 million in consulting fees from 
defense contractors over the past two years 
i accept that the secretary of defense must adhere to a higher 
standard than members of the senate tower said but my question 
is how much lower an acceptable standard is there for members of 
the senate 
senators drew a distinction between money and drinking issues 
and in general they defended their colleagues behavior 
ive been here 16 years and ive never seen one senator drunk 
on the senate floor said sen joseph biden ddel responding 
indirectly to towers implication that such activities took place 
others disputed bidens claim 
ive seen senators come to the senate floor intoxicated said 
sen jesse helms rnc a teetotaler helms refused to identify 
those hed seen drunk 
there have been abuses no question about it said sen paul 
simon dill 
and sen alan k simpson rwyo said some senators continue to 
have grape and grain on their breath when they come to work 
but on capitol hill as in society as a whole heavy drinking is 
not as common as it was in the past observers say the 
healthconscious yuppie generation is different said manager 
nick selimos at the monocle restaurant a favorite watering hole for 
lawmakers lobbyists and aides 
selimos who was interviewed by fbi agents about towers habits 
said that when senators come to the bar half the time they drink 
soft drinks 
jane ikard a washington hostess said the new capital mores stem 
in part from the advent of the power breakfast where politicians 
have to be fresh early in the morning 
you can hardly get people to eat now to say nothing about 
smoking and drinking mrs ikard said 
that wasnt always the case according to robert parker the 
retired maitre d of the senate dining room in a 1986 book entitled 
capital hill in black and white parker wrote of widespread 
drinking and womanizing 
first elected to the house in 1974 simon said hed noticed a 
gradual improvement in the ethical climate in congress with 
the notable exception of campaign financing he supports public 
financing of senatorial campaigns 
i think it might said sen carl levin dmich when asked 
whether the tower debate might lead to reforms in rules governing 
how campaigns are financed and what types of outside income they are 
allowed to earn in office 
the furor over the tower nomination might spur congress to press 
forward on campaign reform said biden chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee 
common cause the selfstyled citizens lobby said the 100 
senators kept a total of 23 million in honoraria in 1987 in the 
twoyear election cycle 19871988 the 33 senate winners in the 
1988 election collected about 31 million from political action 
committees 
sen howell heflin dala chairman of the senate ethics 
committee said it was too early to tell what longstanding changes 
might occur as a result of the tower debate 
i just have to evaluate it when it simmers down he said 
but specter said he hopes the biggest change will be a new 
reluctance on the part of politicians to say im not going to 
answer personal and irrelevant questions

with senators feeling little pressure from back 
home to support john tower backers of the embattled nominee for 
secretary of defense are blaming the white house for failing to 
generate grassroots political heat on behalf of the former texas 
senator 
they never put a campaign together said lyn nofziger who 
orchestrated grassroots campaigns as ronald reagans white house 
political director 
it has never been reduced to an ideological issue out in the 
country said republican consultant roger stone so democrats 
from conservative states say howell heflin of alabama for example 
they feel no pressure from rank and file voters to vote for tower 
it has never been posed in an ideological framework were 
voting over whether this guy is a drunk and womanizer or not 
one indicator of the lack of pressure is the volume of mail 
reaching the capitol 
an aide to sen edward m kennedy said the massachusetts democrat 
had received a total of 260 letters on the tower appointment most 
of them opposed to confirmation by contrast during the fight over 
the nomination of robert bork to the supreme court kennedy received 
more than 55000 letters and telegrams 
a similar report came from the office of sen lloyd bentsen the 
texas democrat still listed as undecided an aide said that during 
the past week bentsen had received 1978 letters telegrams and 
phone calls opposed to tower and 1649 supporting him 
the political pressures on this are pretty much a wash said 
jack devore bentsens press secretary 
scott maxwell a spokesman for sen sam nunn the georgia 
democrat leading the fight against tower said the volume of mail 
is not anything like it was with bork and nunn has a much higher 
profile on this one 
bork was an ideological fight said david keene chairman of 
the american conservative union and one of a group of conservative 
leaders urged by president bush at a white house meeting on 
wednesday to try to generate support for tower 
there was no cover on bork said keene there was no 
subterfuge bork was being deprived of confirmation to the supreme 
court because of what he believed 
in the tower debate continued keene senators are saying thats 
not the case its these personal problems he said that may 
be only partially true but at least it gives them the cover 
the bork thing was much more intense out in the hinterlands 
said steve roberts republican national committeeman from iowa 
there hasnt been a great groundswell out here on tower or 
really any great contact from the republican national committee 
said roberts 
perry hooper a party official from alabama said im all for 
john tower but at the same time its not that traumatic im 
all behind the president getting his way but if we lost it you 
just go to somebody else 
eddie mahe a republican political consultant said he just 
returned from a trip to several states you know what never comes 
up john tower maybe three people brought it up with the 
american people it as an issue that has no impact on them one way 
or the other 
the past week the president stepped up his efforts to generate 
support for tower 
at this late date said nofziger when youve drawn the 
political lines its awfully hard to get any significant democratic 
votes 
the former reagan aide speculated that the white house never 
took the thought that john tower might be in trouble seriously 
in addition nofziger and others noted that conservative 
activists are split on the tower nomination 
paul weyrich chairman of the free congress foundation was the 
first witness before the senate armed services committee to allege 
that tower had a drinking problem 
there was a series of things that suggested to conservatives 
that this was not a fight to get into because nobody in the 
administration really cared that much about it said keene 
was that an accurate impression 
no i think it was reflection of the fact that they the white 
house may not have it together yet he replied

the great american apple baked in a pie and 
teamed with motherhood as the symbol of all that is wholesome is 
once again under attack for health risks 
alar a chemical used to make apples crisper and more colorful 
was labeled a possible carcinogen last week by the natural resources 
defense council adding more fuel to nationwide concerns 
that is an ironic twist for an industry that spends millions of 
dollars each year promoting the healthful aspects of apple 
consumption 
most growers have voluntarily halted the use of alar fearing bad 
publicity more than bad production but many are bitter over a furor 
they say is unnecessary and unfair 
there is absolutely no imminent health risk in eating apples or 
apple juice or apple sauce or any other apple product said 
charles st john a spokesman for the washington apple commission 
which has a growerfinanced 14 million annual budget to promote 
apples around the world 
alar is the trade name for daminozide a chemical growth 
regulator marketed by uniroyal chemical co the us environmental 
protection agency announced last month that it intends to ban alar 
by 1990 but for now it is still legal to use the cancer risk from 
alar was not so bad as to warrant an immediate ban the epa said 
apples are a huge business in washington where 5000 growers 
produced more than 300 million worth of apples last year 
washington grows half the nations supermarket apples with 
thousands of workers employed in packing and shipping the fruit and 
making juice applesauce and other products 
the industry feels threatened by last weeks nrdc report warning 
that eating alartreated apples increased cancer risk especially in 
children 
the report found that children who consume large amounts of fruit 
and fruit juice face a cancer risk of about one case for every 4200 
preschoolers exposed to alar 
the report has been attacked by some scientists and the acting 
epa head as misleading and promoting hysterical fears it is also a 
frustrating public relations problem for washington growers and the 
industry is launching a counterattack 
its not illegal and not in any way harmful to anybodys 
health said marv sundquist who coowns 600 acres near yakima 
there are so many other things we consume every day that have so 
much greater risk than this would have 
the washington apple commission contends only about 5 percent of 
the acreage is sprayed with alar the state department of 
agriculture puts the figure at about 7 percent 
the nrdc estimates are somewhat higher but no one really knows 
for sure how much alar is sprayed because its use is not regulated 
uniroyal has said alar sales are down 75 percent since alar fears 
were first raised in 1985 
alar is not a pesticide and it cant be washed off the apples by 
the consumer it is sprayed on trees in the spring and acts to keep 
apples on the tree longer that makes harvesting easier improves 
the apples color and firmness and extends their shelf life 
the most recent reports about alar are already hurting apple 
sales which were showing a decline by the end of the week 
shipments are slow said jay grandy president of the snokist 
apple cooperative in yakima on friday adding that alar fear is 
the only thing i can point to 
the alar dispute hits growers in the pocketbook in more ways than 
one us consumers want crunchy colorful apples and they simply 
cannot be produced in national volume without chemicals st john 
said 
when you ask the consumer will you buy something that is not 
as appealing or crunchy but not treated with chemicals theyll 
tell you yes i would he said but we know from actual 
practice in supermarkets that they dont 
americans have been so preconditioned that everything we 
purchase must be the biggest and best he said our lower grades 
of apples arent as appealing and we are not able to sell them 
nevertheless many major grocery store chains like safeway 
contend they accept no alartreated apples 
major juice makers like tree top inc based in the yakima suburb 
of selah say the same but a recent consumer reports study found 
alar residues in 23 of 32 applejuice samples it tested the 
magazine did not identify which brands it tested 
the chemical first came under a negative spotlight in 1985 and 
by 1986 the washington apple commission was recommending that 
growers not use it 
the industry has hoped that the completion of extensive tests on 
alar would clear it for use but the epa announcement last month 
that it planned to ban alar on the basis of preliminary testing 
was viewed as a major setback 
it is only the latest apple industry chemical to come under fire 
earlier this century growers sprayed orchards with lead arsenate 
in an effort to kill codling moth that drew the ire of the food and 
drug administration and overseas customers nicotine was later 
tried but was expensive and made applicators sick when ddt came 
into use in 1947 it was considered a miracle but was ultimately 
banned by the epa

about 20000 of 37000 united methodist churches have placed more 
than 277 million orders for the book which will be released this

decision always to keep the church aware of the product that was 
coming out hymnal editor carlton young said last week 
the 25member hymnal revision committee evoked controversy when 
it decided to drop the song onward christian soldiers because of 
militaristic references but the panel voted three months later to 
retain it in response to complaints 
the 960page hymnal uses god in many references instead of 
he masculine references to people also were avoided

the bush administration has decided to proceed 
with a controversial deal under which a major us defense 
contractor would work with japan in developing and producing an 
advanced version of the f16 fighter congressional sources said 
saturday 
they said that following an interagency review the 
administration was expected to send formal notification of the 
technology transfer agreement to congress on march 13 
there is opposition on capitol hill to the plans to transfer to 
japan 7 billion in advanced american aircraft technology that would 
enable japan to build a proposed fsx fighter to upgrad its air 
capabilities by the late 1990s 
under the pending agreement st louisbased general dynamics 
would join forces with japans mitsubishi heavy industries to 
codevelop and coproduce the nextgeneration fighter 
a congressional source who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified said there are going to be some changes in the 
agreement to control and monitor what type of technology flows 
the source said that chances appear to be slim that congress 
would be able to block the deal by passing resolutions of 
disapproval 
its really long odds to stop it he said its possible 
but it would be tough very tough 
a group of 21 senators introduced last month a 
senseofthesenate resolution declaring they have strong 
reservations about the fsx deal 
in the house 24 congressmen have sent a letter to president bush 
saying that they intend to fight the agreement when it goes to 
capitol hill 
the new york times reported saturday that commerce secretary 
robert a mosbacher who had led opposition to the fsx within the 
administration has now been mollified by the compromise worked out 
in the review process 
proponents of the fsx deal say it is the best that could be 
negotiated in view of japanese refusal to buy wholly 
americanbuilt planes and that it fosters beneficial technology 
transfer in both directions with japan while generating income and 
jobs for us industry 
critics however contend that the agreement amounts to a 
technological giveaway that will enable the japanese to compete more 
effectively against this country in the global aviation market they 
argue that tokyo should purchase americanmade fighters to help 
offset the 50 billion us trade deficit with japan 
general dynamics this countrys no 2 defense contractor has 
said that under the deal it and other us companies will receive 
35 percent to 45 percent of the 12 billion being spent on 
development of the fsx as well as a comparable share of the 5 
billion production program

said he decided to stop taping the show friday when the artist began 
showering downey with sand 
the artist mark kostabi 30 also threw paint on a studio camera 
as part of the show on artists defending their art

doing something funny but really hurting people boggs said 
everything was under control except that he kostabi hurt mort

a class in christian protest where the 
final exam may involve being arrested is teaching prospective 
deacons in the episcopal church how to translate their faith into 
action 
primarily im hoping to get across that worship and liturgy 
are always inherently political because it has to do with ordering 
of life in the community said the rev william wyliekellerman 
the united methodist pastor from detroit discussed the course on 
a recent winter saturday as he led a halfhour protest at the 
university of michigans school of public health where scientists 
have conducted research involving mustard gas and nerve agent 
weapons 
even though the class of about 25 members drew little attention 
as they sang hymns and read from the bible wyliekellerman said the 
protest was important 
impact is often more than what is immediately visible he 
said 
the course is offered for credit to students in the episcopal 
deacon program of the whitaker school of theology in detroit or to 
anyone else who wants to transform religious beliefs into activism 
each class includes a bible study and a protest worship service 
against activities such as an institutions military research 
weapons construction or investments in south africa 
the class has been called a course in protest but 
wyliekellerman refers to it as a liturgical response to militarism 
liturgy is always political because theres a fundamental 
pledge of allegiance worship and liturgy declare an allegiance to 
the sovereignty of the word of god 
worship can take on a whole new meaning when a setting changes 
he said 
the same identical prayer service done in a cathedral moved to 
the gates of williams international youre going to hear the call 
for repentance in a different way he said referring to the 
cruise missile engine plant in walled lake where he will conduct a 
pentecost service may 13 
its the same commitment and allegiance but it just cuts you 
deeper one of my clearest personal senses involved doing an easter 
vigil liturgy at wurtsmith air force base cutting the fence and 
walking down the runway toward the highsecurity area looking down 
at the b52s and renouncing satan renewing my commitment to 
christ 
members of the class say public witness is important 
were talking about taking the gospel and trying to live the 
gospel in such a way that what we do in worship really makes a 
difference in the way we live our lives said joan mcdonald of 
huntington woods were trying to make a connection between sunday 
and the rest of the week 
we need to go out of that beautiful little cocoon a church 
onto the streets where people are killing and raping making weapons 
that are going to kill in terms of protest or marking particular 
sites its making a public witness of our belief 
its an issue of peace and justice said dave carlson of 
madison heights who hopes to become a deacon candidate bill has 
taught me how to relate scripture to contemporary society 
wyliekellermans course will conclude in may when members of 
the class may participate in civil disobedience and could be 
arrested at williams international as many other protesters have 
were programmed to feel we dont make a difference that type 
of thinking can immobilize you mcdonald said its good to be 
nurtured within a group as small as it is

after years of bewailing the disintegration of 
the nations historic records librarians and archivists say they 
are beginning to see progress toward preservation of documents 
ranging from the declaration of independence to fashion sketches 
from the 1920s 
i think its beginning to come of age after all these years of 
talking about it peter sparks director of the national 
preservation program of the library of congress said after a 
threeday conference on statewide preservation programs that ended 
friday at the library 
the national endowment for the humanities says it has been 
estimated that more than 80 million volumes in american research 
libraries and more than 25 billion pages in state archives are in 
danger of being lost because of the papers acid content 
most book paper manufactured since the middle of the 19th century 
has a high acid content which helps prevent the ink from running 
but also makes the pages turn brittle in less than 100 years they 
fall apart 
custodians of books and records have been concerned about the 
problem for years but often have had trouble getting state and 
federal money to deal with it 
state legislators are interested in potholes they are 
interested in environmental problems they are interested in nuclear 
waste sites said carolyn morrow sparks deputy it is not that 
they dont care about history but they sometimes have to be 
educated as to why the records are important 
apparently the message is getting through 
in 1987 for example the new york legislature provided 500000 
to assist libraries historical societies archives and similar 
agencies preserve books manuscripts photographs maps and other 
material 
one grant went to new yorks fashion institute of technology to 
treat its collection of 5568 pencil ink and watercolor drawings 
done by anonymous studio artists from 1915 to 1929 they were 
dismounted from brittle paper mended labeled and stored in 
acidfree folders and boxes 
other grants went to preserve such items as farmers account 
books and tavern records from the 19th century a fordham university 
collection including orderly books of george washington the 
juilliard schools collection of early and first editions of the 
compositions of franz liszt records of the black history of 
smithtown ny and a yeshiva university collection detailing the 
history of three organizations that helped jews during two world 
wars 
among other states with active programs are california 
connecticut illinois maine new jersey south carolina utah 
virginia and wisconsin ms morrow said 
meanwhile congress has increased funds for the national 
endowment for the humanities office of preservation from 45 
million in fiscal year 1988 to 123 million for the current fiscal 
year which began last oct 1 the office supports cooperative 
microfilming projects and preservation of collections 
the national historical publications and records commission the 
grantmaking body of the national archives has a current 
appropriation of about 4 million and has funded more than 100 
projects to develop government archives and records management 
programs in states counties and cities 
we have had a very very good record on this in congress this 
past year despite deficitcutting pressures to keep spending 
down sparks said 
the national archives also has installed an imaging system 
designed to monitor the condition of the declaration of 
independence the constitution the bill of rights and other basic 
documents an archives fact sheet distributed at the conference said 
the system takes pictures so precise that comparisons over time will 
detect the subtlest changes in a document 
meanwhile the library of congress expects to be finished in a 
month or two with an experimental program at a houston pilot plant 
on technology to remove acid from books 
the technologies are starting to come up and people are 
starting to get into the mode for buying them and pretty soon were 
going to be doing it sparks said 
with all the progress however he said if you look at the 
general problem its something that we are behind on only because 
we just dont have the effort level high enough not everybody is on 
the bandwagon yet but people are beginning to realize this is a 
problem

the economic and social turmoil that rocked 
venezuela last week has put pressure on the bush administration to 
review secretary of state james a bakers plan for dealing with the 
international debt crisis facing many latin american countries 
time is running out said sen bill bradley dnj a member 
of the senate finance committee and a specialist on international 
debt todays crisis is with venezuela tomorrows could be 
mexico 
meanwhile the administration is moving to arrange a temporary 
loan to help ease venezuelas plight in which at least 300 people 
were killed and 2000 injured in riots in response to an economic 
austerity program designed by the new government of president carlos 
andres perez 
he is faced with a crushing 33 billion foreign debt owed to 
international banks and other lenders 
treasury department officials are putting the final touches on a 
450 million emergency bridge loan to help the south american 
nation weather its economic crisis us officials have told the 
associated press 
the loan is part of an international package from countries 
including west germany and japan and other lenders such as 
commercial banks the new york times reported saturday quoting 
government and banking officials it said the emergency loans could 
total nearly 2 billion 
the bridge loan is designed to replenish venezuelas depleted 
reserves over the next few months until longerterm loans from the 
international monetary fund and the world bank can be worked out 
under an agreement with the imf venezuela agreed to adopt its 
austerity measures in exchange for a 45 billion loan over a 
threeyear period the international body is composed of 151 member 
nations but its largest contributor is the united states 
critics in venezuela and elsewhere have pointed to the imfs 
austerity requirements as being partly to blame for the turmoil but 
its defenders contend the requirements amount to bitter medicine 
that is long overdue 
the country has its back to the wall and it has no other choice 
than to strengthen its economic situation at once said an imf 
official who would speak only on condition of anonymity we can 
send a signal to the rest of the world that by working to solve its 
problems venezuela is doing the right thing 
the official praised venezuelas new government for taking action 
swiftly and emphasized that the austerity measures were of 
venezuelas own design and not imposed by the imf he said that in 
other situations critics of the imf have used it as a whipping 
boy to deflect criticism 
they have no choice but to swallow the medicine but if it 
tastes bad do you blame the doctor for that he asked 
one treasury official who also spoke privately said that 
despite the criticism directed against the imf and other western 
lenders venezuelas officials have been sincere about working out 
an economic reform plan 
in this case we have a real commitment on the part of perez to 
stick with this the official said the adjustment is painful 
no doubt about it he said of the bloodiest civil unrest to strike 
the country in 31 years 
but bradley and other latin american experts argue that emergency 
measures on the part of the us and the imf while welcome 
arent adequate to deal with the financial nightmares facing 
venezuela and other heavilyindebted latin american nations 
besides an urgent review of us debt policy several called for 
socalled debt relief or a reduction of the debt burden venezuela 
is the fourth largest debtor in the region which has accumulated 
some 420 billion in foreign debt 
debt relief is not part of the baker plan put forward when the 
secretary of state ran the treasury department he suggested 
economic reforms in the debtor nations coupled with assurances of 
new private and public lending 
the plans critics point out that latin leaders have lost faith 
in the scheme since it appears to help commercial banks while 
forcing debtor nations to adopt policies that severely strain living 
standards and put their democracies in peril 
i think there is no way that you can expect these countries to 
dig themselves out of a debt crisis through economic growth and 
without some debt reduction bradley said friday we need a plan 
for debt reduction i have high hopes the administration will 
move away from that plan to a new one 
sen chris dodd dconn a member of the senate foreign 
relations committee and its subcommittee on the western hemisphere 
agrees there are many things the latin american nations must do to 
refocus their economies saying he does not disagree with some 
elements of the baker plan 
but the administration must do a more effective job both 
politically and economically on the debt question he said 
dodd faults the reagan administration for placing too much 
emphasis on the contra battle against the sandinistas of nicaragua 
and not paying enough attention to the debt crisis 
venezuela should be a reminder to policymakers in washington 
of not addressing the underlying problems of the latin american 
nations dodd said 
both the present us ambassador to venezuela otto reich and a 
former envoy viron vaky voiced hopes in separate interviews that 
the venezuelans will overcome the most recent turmoil 
it is surprising the volatility said vaky who served as 
us ambassador during perez earlier term of office in the late 
1970s they probably didnt prepare the people well enough for 
these price hikes but i believe theyll be able to ride this out 
vaky echoed bradleys call for debt relief calling it latin 
americas basic problem 
reich speaking in a telephone interview from caracas emphasized 
venezuelas importance to the united states pointing out that it is 
the source of 7 percent of all us oil imports 
we definitely want to help reich said noting that bush had 
telephoned perez on friday to voice support for his reform plans 
the presidents call was an indication of how close our 
relations are and how we want to be of assistance it is a 
vital link that cant be ignored

a supreme court justice on saturday blocked at 
least until march 17 the partial merger of detroits two daily 
newspapers that was to begin monday 
justice william j brennan in an unexpected move said the 
detroit free press and the detroit news may not start the partial 
merger until the full supreme court considers the issue at its next 
regularly scheduled closeddoor conference march 17 
chief justice william h rehnquist on friday had refused to 
postpone the partial merger and lawyers for opponents to the deal 
then turned to brennan for help 
reporters initially had been told that brennan was not going to 
act on the emergency request before monday 
a federal appeals court panel here voted 21 to uphold 
thenattorney general edwin meeses decision to allow the detroit 
papers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal 
newspaper preservation act 
the 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially 
failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws 
under the joint operating agreement the two detroit newspapers 
would combine their business advertising and production departments 
but maintain separate news and editorial staffs 
by a 54 vote last month the full appeals court refused to 
reconsider the threejudge panels jan 27 ruling the appeals court 
blocked the partial merger until march 6 so opponents could seek a 
longer delay from rehnquist 
that delay was denied friday 
but brennan in a threeparagraph order issued saturday said he 
was referring the matter to the full court 
his order added it is further ordered that the order staying 
implementation of the joint operating agreement issued by the 
appeals court is continued pending further order of the court 
a group of michigan readers and advertisers who sued to stop the 
partial merger contend that the free press a morning newspaper 
owned by knightridder inc is not a failing newspaper even though 
it lost 10 million a year between 1981 and 1986 
the opponents calling themselves michigan citizens for an 
independent press say the free press and news which lost 50 
million in the same period were unprofitable solely because both 
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out 
of business 
gannett co which owns the news is the nations largest 
newspaper publishing group knightridder is the second largest 
knightridder has threatened to close down the free press if the 
joint operating agreement is not approved 
the opponents emergency request said the agreement threatens 
the independence of daily newspapers in 25 cities where like 
detroit competing newspapers still exist 
the case is michigan citizens for an independent press vs 
thornburgh a695

two passenger trains collided outside london today 
in an accident that killed up to 12 people injured about 50 and 
sent carriages careening into the gardens of trackside homes 
authorities and witnesses said 
authorities said one train hit the back of the other near the 
purley station in surrey on the southern outskirts of the capital 
one train remained on the track but seven cars from the other 
fell down an embankment into the gardens the fire brigade said 
there was no indication anyone was hurt in the houses but 
firefighters had to cut dozens of passengers free from the wreckage 
there were conflicting casualty reports 
about five hours after the 139 pm crash the emergency room 
chief at nearby mayday hospital kambiz hashemi said four people 
died there and six at the scene the bodies of two women were 
reported at nearby st helier hospital but it was not clear whether 
they were included among those dead at the scene 
the fire brigade and british rail said two people died fire 
officials put the injury toll at 50 british rail said 32 people 
were injured 
a spokesman for british rail southern region said it appeared 
that one train traveling north to london from horsham west sussex 
had been crossing from the local line to a fast track when it 
collided with a train bound for london from littlehampton on the 
south coast of england 
we presume at this stage that the other littlehampton train 
was already on the fast lane but we do not know how they impacted 
the spokesman said 
on dec 12 a threetrain crash near londons clapham junction 
station 10 miles to the north of todays accident killed 35 
people railroad officials blamed malfunctioning signals for that 
crash 
in todays accident one train ran into the back of another 
plowed to one side and slid down the steep embankment fire brigade 
divisional officer ian park said seven carriages slid away and 
turned over he said 
samantha muggeridge 16 who was waiting on the purley platform 
said a slow train was coming toward purley station a faster one 
came up behind it and seemed to clip the back of it 
three carriages from the first train rolled down the embankment 
and others stayed on the tracks but they were twisted and tilted 
there was a very loud crash after the collision followed by an 
eerie silence then doors of the train started to open and there 
were shouts from inside the carriages 
people ran from their homes and helped evacuate some of the 
injured other injured made their own way to safety some apparently 
driven to hospital by a man who had his car parked in the street 
ambulance crews raced to the scene and hospitals went on alert 
prime minister margaret thatcher was very distressed to hear 
of the train crash and was being kept informed of developments said 
a spokesman for her 10 downing st office 
a public inquiry is currently under way into a dec 12 crash 
staterun british rail has blamed its own flawed system in 
installing new signaling equipment for the crash 
railway officials believe malfunctioning signals led one commuter 
train to slam into the rear of another that was stopped on the 
tracks an empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed into 
the wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had scrambled 
onto the tracks 
the clapham crash was the worst train wreck in britain since 
1975 when 43 people died in a subway train that crashed in a london 
tunnel

you think funny a newspaper columnist 
once told don parker 
the escambia county sheriffs deputy took that observation to 
heart and has turned his funny thoughts into a secondary career as a 
cop humorist 
while some officers moonlight as security guards or bar bouncers 
parker now a captain has found an offduty niche as a talkshow 
personality on local radio and cable television a traveling 
convention and banquet speaker and an author 
parker himself is the butt of the joke in most of his yarns like 
the one about getting his foot stuck in a door that splintered when 
he tried to kick it in for a search other officers had to go 
through another door to help extricate him 
its not supposed to happen that way but it always has at 
least to me parker said i think all of us make mistakes in the 
profession the difference is i write about mine 
he started by giving a humorous tone to official police reports 
and now has written a book youre under arrest im not 
kidding 
the cover illustration depicts the bald gawky and bespectacled 
deputy confronting a hulking bad guy 
parker admits to bearing an uncanny physical resemblance to 
comedian don knotts perhaps best known for portraying bumbling 
deputy barney fife on televisions andy griffith show 
after getting nothing but rejection notices from bigtime 
publishers parker and his wife carol formed their own company 
named it caroldon books after themselves and published the 
autobiography on their own 
the book has sold 1800 copies in little more than two months 
and is starting to find its way into bookstores along the gulf coast 
the book is a rapidfire collection of true stories parkers 
favorite is about the terrified woman who reported her house had 
been invaded by an alligator when parker arrived he discovered a 
harmless 6inchlong lizard 
another story is about the drunk pedestrian who flagged down 
parker off duty in civilian duds and driving his private car to 
ask for a ride the man said he had just wrecked his car and was 
trying to avoid being caught by a state trooper at the accident 
scene which parker had just passed 
brother this just isnt your day parker said flipping open 
his badge case after inviting the man inside and doing a uturn 
most laughs however are at parkers expense he recounts 
helping a motorist change a flat tire only to discover later that 
the car had been stolen and the guy he had helped was the thief 
another time he was off duty looking over magazines at a 
neighborhood drug store while it was being robbed something parker 
didnt realize until a squad car siren blaring screeched to a halt 
outside by then the robber was long gone 
parker said the late pat lloyd a columnist for the pensacola 
news journal was accurate when she said he thinks funny 
im always struck by the sheer incongruity of what happens 
to us as law enforcement officers parker said its frequently 
so unlike what you see on tv 
barney miller is the exception 
he said the comedy was the most accurate of television police 
shows 
the job is occasionally dangerous frequently monotonous and 
often filled with moments of hilarity which occur at the most 
unexpected times

hundreds of police occupied hospitals 
in the countrys four main cities on saturday to keep regular 
medical services running during a fiveday strike by hospital 
workers 
president jose azcona hoyo sent police armed with tear gas and 
m16 rifles into the hospitals late friday and ordered 4000 nurses 
cooks and administrators to return to work by monday or lose their 
jobs no violence was reported 
our purpose is to open the hospitals so that the employee who 
wants to work can do so azcona hoyo said friday the ones who 
dont do it will be sanctioned or fired and immediately replaced by 
someone who wants to work for the benefit of the people 
he said the strikers who are demanding higher wages were 
violating the constitution by not attending to the public health 
he and public health minister ramon villeda bermudez said the 
workers would lose their jobs if the strike did not end by monday 
morning 
celeo alvarez casildo president of the medical and hospital 
workers union said the strike would continue since tuesday 
employees have been giving only emergency care while hundreds of 
people wait outside for nonemergency attention 
we will continue defending our rights to the end he said 
the government promised to increase our salaries and it 
tricked us 
workers are demanding salary increases totaling 26 million 
annually the average honduran hospital worker earns about 200 a 
month 
the health minister said the government can only give the workers 
annual total increases of 15 million because of the grave 
economic crisis facing honduras 
he said the medical workers have declared some 36 strikes in the 
past two years to demand what he called exaggerated salary 
increases

the distributors of rock star madonnas new single 
like a prayer decided not to release the video immediately on 
italian television because of protests from a roman catholic group 
news reports said saturday 
the conservative catholic group famiglia domani charged the video 
was blasphemous and it threatened to go to court to block the 
broadcast newspapers said 
the video was to be shown tuesday on the popular program notte 
rock rock night on staterun rai television 
officials of madonnas italian record company wea announced 
after a meeting with rai officials friday they had decided to 
suspend the television distribution of this video for some days to 
keep any more controversy from arising 
representatives of famiglia domani acknowledged they had not seen 
the video first shown in italy on friday at press screenings 
according to italian journalists who saw the video it shows the 
following 
the singer witnesses an attack on a girl by a group of white 
boys who then escape a black man who arrives on the scene is 
accused of the assault 
madonna wearing a slip seeks refuge in a baptist church and 
pauses before a statue of a black saint whose face becomes that of 
the accused man the statue cries tears of blood and comes to life 
the rock singer develops cuts in her hands resembling the wounds 
of the crucified body of jesus 
madonna gives the statue a kiss then goes to police and tells 
them the accused man is not guilty 
several newspapers said the screening should put to rest rumors 
the video would show madonna as a nun romantically involved with a 
crucified christ 
the milan daily corriere della sera said state prosecutor alfredo 
rossini had asked to see a copy of the video friday famiglia domani 
has threatened to seek court action to block broadcast of the video 
newspapers said 
in reality this scandal should deflate like a bubble the 
romebased la repubblica said but we are in italy and before a 
problem racism so ably raised by the puritan moralism of the 
americans we can be sure that the sexy slip that madonna wore into 
the church will be enough to irritate those who at all costs seek a 
public scandal

while the house ethics committee deliberates 
behind closed doors over a series of ethics charges against house 
speaker jim wright its complex probe is but part of a growing web 
of political intrigue surrounding the texas democrat 
some republicans are complaining that wright has intervened in 
the house intelligence committees business to hamper a second 
ethics investigation into whether the speaker last september 
improperly disclosed a covert cia operation in nicaragua 
and republican political operatives have set wright up as their 
no 1 target in the 1990 elections and are using the speaker as 
a centerpiece in their longrange efforts to split the democratic 
party and recapture control of congress 
the house speaker traditionally has been a target of the minority 
party which seeks to use him to personify the evils it sees in the 
majority but with wright the attack has taken on personal tones 
while the ethics committee has given little outward hint of the 
results of its independent counsels expensive ninemonth probe of 
the speakers finances talk in house cloakrooms and corridors is 
that the investigation has been extremely thorough and the outcome 
will cause wright severe political problems if not legal ones 
wright is alleged to have abused his office for personal 
financial gain this includes using a congressional aide to help 
compile a book on which wright earned some 55000 in royalties and 
using a condominium in his hometown of fort worth without paying 
full market value 
he also is alleged to have lobbied federal officials improperly 
on behalf of texas savings and loan institutions and lobbied for a 
gas venture in which he had a financial stake 
wright has steadfastly denied violating any law or rule of the 
house although he has conceded he might have dome some things 
differently if he had them to do over 
soon after the outcome of that probe is known expected sometime 
the week of march 13 the ethics panel will turn its attention to 
the other lessnoticed case against wright its inquiry into 
whether the speaker violated house rules against disclosing 
classified information 
in an offhand remark last sept 20 wright said he had clear 
testimony from cia people that the agency had sought to stir up 
public unrest in nicaragua to provoke an overreaction by the leftist 
sandinista government the remark appeared to violate rules against 
publicly disclosing intelligence committee testimony although 
wright later denied doing so 
that case is now on the back burner said ethics chairman 
julian dixon dcalif but has not been ignored interviews have 
been conducted with intelligence committee staff members on the 
subject he said 
but republicans are concerned that a classified report on a trip 
to central america by four panel members in december has not been 
forwarded to the ethics panel in part because the lone democrat on 
the trip rep dan glickman of kansas disagreed with the document 
and declined to sign it 
the report according to sources includes a conclusion that 
wrights comments had a severe chilling effect on nicaraguas 
internal political opposition effectively shutting down public 
political dissent and leading to threats of imprisonment for some 
opposition leaders 
committee member rep bob livingston rla declined to comment 
specifically on the report which under committee rules is a 
classified document but he said his conversations with opposition 
leaders made it clear that they were dealt a setback by news stories 
about wrights comments 
it seemed to be common knowledge he said in an interview 
there was a great deal of intimidation there doesnt appear to 
be much more desire to demonstrate for fear of repercussions 
glickman acknowledged that he did not sign the report because he 
disagreed with the weight given to the impact of wrights comments 
saying he saw that as a minor portion of the trip but he appeared 
flabbergasted at the charge that the document was being improperly 
withheld from the ethics probe 
thats totally off the wall he said the committee has 
been given everything they need i dont think this report is 
relevant 
dixon would not say whether he had known about the committees 
report but he said i think all material is relevant to the 
ethics investigation in these instances damage assessment 
evaluations are routinely made i would think that would be 
relevant 
in recent weeks the line between the speakers ethics problems 
and house politics has become increasingly blurred in large part 
because of the political targeting of the speaker by the republican 
party and the admitted antiwright agenda of the speakers chief 
accuser rep newt gingrich rga 
gingrich leader of a band of rightwing house republicans sees 
his attempts to paint the speaker as a villain as a necessary step 
in creating a new political climate in the united states that could 
lead to a gop takeover of congress 
gingrichs analysis has found that most of the five major 
political realignments in us history there have been serious 
internal splits within the majority party and a shift in public 
perceptions that portrayed the majority as corrupt and illegitimate 
the attack on wright is aimed at helping create those conditions

eastern airlines jets sat idle in the fog at the 
nations secondbusiest airfield saturday but not because of the 
weather 
striking mechanics virtually paralyzed eastern airlines here and 
normally bustling concourses were vacant except for pickets and 
clusters of frustrated fliers 
many wouldbe passengers were trying to get to miami for 
connections to the caribbean where they had paid reservations on 
cruise ships others were students heading for warmer climes over 
spring break 
eastern which handles about a third of the traffic through 
hartsfield atlanta international airport originally had 278 
departures scheduled for saturday by noon only two planes had 
left both for miami one eastern flight had arrived 
planes from other airlines roared on and off the runways past 
row on row of eastern jets sitting idle 
airport spokesman john braden said the effect of the heavy fog 
which could have backed up departing flights was lessened because 
of the canceled eastern flights 
but that was no comfort to the passengers holding eastern 
tickets in the terminal some played cards to pass the time while 
others snoozed using carryon luggage for pillows many complained 
they werent told of flight cancellations until the last minute 
i was on the phone with eastern every day since monday and 
they kept telling me its going to fly its going to fly said 
dick tunner of charlotte nc who was scheduled to meet a cruise 
ship in jamaica with his wife grace and had made his reservations 
two months ago 
we were on the phone three hours yesterday trying to get 
through to them and when we did they told us at 430 pm that 
maybe it wont he said 
a frantic scramble ensued to get other tickets as far as atlanta 
later saturday morning the tunners managed to get on one of the two 
eastern planes leaving for miami and were hoping theyd make it to 
jamaica 
tunner said he was sorry for those on strike but if we miss 
the ship whos going to repay the 3000 we paid for the cruise 
he asked 
it was suspenseful for the tunners and the relatively few other 
travelers who managed to get on an eastern plane strikebreakers 
loaded luggage onto a boeing 727 for flight 843 bound for miami 
while eastern waited to see if a crew would report waiting 
passengers applauded when one pilot arrived 
later the luggage was taken off and put on a smaller dc9 which 
requires a smaller crew the flight finally left for miami at 1115 
am an hour and 45 minutes late leaving many passengers behind 
see you on the ship one couple called to lessfortunate 
friends who didnt get on board 
i hope youre right came the reply 
a second flight for miami and jamaica left a few minutes later 
with those who didnt get on board the first plane but airport 
officials said they did not know if eastern would be able to get 
more planes out after that 
machinists and pilots picketed outside the terminal and in 
concourses where eastern has flights nails were spread in an 
eastern employee parking lot overnight braden said but he said 
they were swept up and there was no damage 
and most eastern travelers were not going anywhere 
eastern was invisible complained kris kiessel a college 
student from greensboro nc who was on her way to bahamas with a 
friend 
we called and they said everything was normal she said 
after the strike canceled her flight she and her friend were able 
to use their eastern tickets to get as far as atlanta on a delta 
flight 
when we got here they said they could send us back home

ed broadbent whose new democratic party won a 
record number of seats in the last election but who failed in four 
tries to become prime minister resigned saturday after nearly 14 
years as party leader 
now is the time for renewal now is the time to pick a new man 
or a woman to take us the next step broadbent said as he 
announced his resignation in an hourlong speech to leaders of the 
opposition party 
his voice breaking with emotion broadbent called on the 
leftofcenter new democrats to fight the new conservatism he said 
is sweeping canada and widening the gap between rich and poor one 
party member attending the caucus shouted no as broadbent said 
he was quitting 
it was not immediately clear when the popular politician will 
leave or when a party convention will be held to replace him 
broadbent 52 who has represented oshawa southern ontario in 
parliament since 1968 spoke to 120 members of the partys federal 
council or governing body his announcement followed months of 
speculation about his political future in the wake of nov 21 
general election 
although the new democrats won a record 43 seats they remained 
in third place among the national political parties and failed to 
win a single seat in quebec even though broadbent learned french 
and campaigned vigorously there 
only a year earlier the party had led in public opinion polls 
after a bitter election campaign dominated by the freetrade 
agreement with the united states brian mulroney was reelected 
prime minister and his rightofcenter progressive conservative 
party won 169 seats in the house of commons the liberal party 
finished second with 82 seats 
both opposition parties opposed the freetrade agreement which 
was supported by mulroney broadbent said he favored amendments that 
would protect canadian jobs he believes will be threatened by the 
accord 
during his long tenure as party leader broadbent was credited 
with leading his party toward the political mainstream 
as in the past when ive reached a decision im very happy 
and convinced that the decision i made is the right one he said 
broadbent whose personal popularity always was higher than his 
own partys had indicated earlier he might step down 
after the election he appeared tired and demoralized he 
questioned publicly whether he had the energy to continue in his 
position 
you have to have your whole heart and soul in terms of 
commitment especially in national politics he said in january 
in terms of my disposition at this stage of my life am i going 
to go out there and give it 100 percent of my energy and whatever 
talents i have unless a person is willing to do that they ought 
not lead a political party

labormanagement tensions that erupted into a strike 
saturday have been building inexorably for years at eastern 
airlines and both sides are dug in for what could be a fight to the 
end not just to their conflict but to the 60yearold airline 
itself 
its a tremendously unfortunate set of circumstances that has 
been developing for a while said an emotional james ashlock an 
eastern company spokesman and lobbyist for 22 years at some 
point we had to come to this 
management says the company losing more than 1 million a day 
just cant make it with its highpriced demanding labor unions the 
workers deny that theyre overpaid and say management is tearing the 
company apart anyway so they might as well stand and fight 
our people have been frustrated theyve been provoked theyve 
been brutalized theyre ready for something forceful to show their 
feelings charles e bryan eastern machinists union district 100 
president who joined the company as a mechanic in 1956 said before 
what he predicted would be a wingding of a strike 
after a 17month contract dispute easterns largest union walked 
out at 1201 am est saturday and was quickly joined by pilots and 
flight attendants with the carrier virtually shut down company 
officials admitted they were surprised by the solidarity of the 
pilots with the machinists 
i think this has been building and everybody understands the 
company wants to divide the pilots and the machinists eastern 
pilots union spokesman ron cole said its not a machinists issue 
its a frank lorenzo issue 
bankrupting the airline is a very real possibility cole 
said but thats where the airline is headed anyway so we can 
face the music now when we have some leverage or we can face the 
music later when theres nothing left 
lorenzo the texas air corp chairman who bought eastern three 
years ago has solidified his antiunion reputation at a carrier 
that already had some of the airline industrys most recalcitrant 
unions his new management in 1987 demanded 30 percent wage 
concessions it said was necessary to keep eastern bought on the 
brink of bankruptcy with nearly 25 billion in debts alive 
the balking unions were hit with thousands of layoffs firings 
and suspensions a flight attendant was fired after allegedly 
pocketing 2 in drink money her union said and another was 
disciplined for repeated absences after she was raped 
machinists horror stories included a firing for refusing to work 
overtime on christmas while the pilots said their ranks shrank by 
more than 1000 because of stress and forced overflying 
the management said it was time for eastern workers to face 
reality they were being paid too much and were used to lax rules 
that were puttin eastern out of business 
the company led for more than two decades by world war i flying 
ace eddie rickenbacker and then for a decade by apollo 8 astronaut 
frank borman was slow to react to the jet age and slower still to 
adjust to airline deregulation 
borman tried a number of innovative programs and at times seemed 
a model of enlightened management in his dealings with eastern 
unions 
but labor leaders said he couldnt keep his promises and 
workers decided that wage givebacks they made in return for eastern 
stock and profits were going down the drain 
eastern has been a cashflow generator for its lenders for 
years and has never been designed to make a profit said cole an 
eastern pilot for 19 years and the son of a pilot who flew with the 
airline for 38 years 
ashlock said the company in happier times was excessively 
generous to unions that only became more militant a major turning 
point came with the 1980 election of bryan to head the machinists 
he said 
bryan depicted by management as an egodriven man with a 
nearmad vision of running the airline himself believes giving 
employees company decisionmaking power improves productivity and 
service he also says the workers have more pride in eastern than 
management does 
he has tried to organize an employee takeover of the company or 
attract white knights to buy out lorenzo he and the other 
unions have fought lorenzo at every turn with myriad lawsuits 
grievances and lobbying in congress 
but bryan said recently the actions turned out to be only a 
delay of the inevitable showdown as he claimed lorenzo tried to 
break the unions while cannibalizing eastern and leaving only a 
shell 
texas air made easterns computer reservations system a 
subsidiary reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in management 
fees and loans from eastern and sold its profitable northeast 
shuttle service to new york developer donald trump a sale that is 
awaiting final federal approval 
while borman was able to elicit some concessions the unions 
looked at texas airs record and refused to give in to lorenzo 
he beat a strike at tiny texas international two decades ago and 
then ended a labor rebellion after his bitter takeover of 
continental by sending the carrier into bankruptcy reorganization in 
1983 labor contracts were abrogated 
no one believes frank lorenzo will stop trying to ruin the 
unions if we dont fight said mary jane barry flight attendants 
union president at eastern they have continued to ask employees 
to make concessions to fund mismanagement it worked once it worked 
twice it cant continue to work any longer 
this is really make it or break it she said

transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
saturday the bush administration would seek emergency legislation 
if necessary to prohibit striking eastern airlines employees from 
broadening their protest to hold american industry hostage 
skinner asked about prospective union plans to establish 
secondary picket lines at other airlines and commuter railroads 
declared a secondary boycott will hurt our ability to compete in 
the world well take action if labor shuts down industry in 
this country were not going to tolerate that 
skinner interviewed on the cable news network acknowledged that 
a recent supreme court decision allowed secondary boycotts in the 
transportation sector unlike other industries 
i hope the machinists dont use this anomaly in the law to shut 
down american industry and hold american industry hostage he 
said its not fair 
union officials said saturday they were examining a number of 
potential targets airlines and railroads included for secondary 
picketing probably to begin monday 
william winpisinger president of the international association 
of machinists accused skinner and president bush of attempting to 
confine this dispute to a narrow arena where eastern owner frank 
lorenzo can bring all his resources to bear against the striking 
employees 
winpisinger said we apologize to all of those who may 
ultimately be affected we have a wide range of options and well 
consider those one at a time 
winpisinger said the prospect of a widespread secondary boycott 
was no greater a threat than somebody daring us to do it as the 
administration clearly has 
he referred to bushs refusal a day earlier to establish an 
emergency factfinding board and thereby postpone any job actions 
for 60 days 
but skinner said this dispute has been going on for 17 months 
its time we get it resolved there was no guarantee that in 60 days 
were going to be any better off than we are now 
moreover said skinner we cant afford to let a company go 
bankrupt in the next 60 days eastern doesnt have enough cash to 
operate 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio noted that 34 members of the 
senate urged bush to establish the emergency board a procedure that 
has resolved 26 of 34 previous cases without a work stoppage in 
this case hes been wrongly advised said metzenbaum 
skinner said it appears that eastern has been flying some 
flights today and i think that with 2200 faa federal aviation 
administration inspectors all over the country we can make sure 
that those airplanes to do go up are safe theres no question that 
all the pilots and mechanics all have to be faa licensed 
later skinner went by the faa command center in washington to 
check on the situation while there he telephoned faa regional 
headquarters around the nation to give employees a pep talk 
as for plans to head off any secondary boycott with special 
legislation skinner said on cnn why should commuters in chicago 
and in new york and auto workers in detroit be involved in this 
dispute they should not

theres only one catch to the free home 
robert k stirling is offering in central indiana the new owner 
has to cart away the 1100squarefoot house with a twocar garage 
sterling bought the house and property for about 26000 so he 
could enlarge the medical offices of his parents robert and marie 
stirling and his sister nancy stirling who practice podiatry in a 
building next door 
for us to just demolish it and throw it away would cost 2000 
before i do that i should see if it will work out for someone 
else stirling said 
he admitted the house needs a lot of work 
the sagging roof needs shoring up and new shingles and the 
interior of the building has been stripped stirling said 
the plain cardboard sign that has been standing since monday has 
attracted plenty of attention motorists drive around the block for 
second peeks and some pull up to get a closer look he said 
stirling said he wants to have the house off the lot this month 
weve had a lot of people ask us about it maybe 15 calls so 
far theres been no firm takers he said

soviet truck convoys carrying 
emergency food and fuel reached the afghan capital on saturday 
radio kabul said 
the relief convoy had been stranded at hairatan an afghan 
village on the border with the soviet union after bad weather 
closed the 250mile salang highway said the radio monitored in 
islamabad pakistan 
it did not say how long the convoy had been stuck or when the 
snow hit the highway which is afghanistans key overland link to 
the soviet union avalanches periodically shut the highway which 
cuts through the hindu kush mountains 
it was along the salang highway that moscow moved the remainder 
of its troops out of afghanistan on feb 15 after nine years of 
military intervention 
in a bid to preempt afghan rebel attacks on departing soviet 
soldiers soviet and afghan fighter jets bombed both sides of the 
highway in the last week in january 
as many as 600 civilians died in the bombing raids said a 
publication distributed by the jamiatiislami guerrilla group 
which operates extensively along the highway 
afghan moslem guerrilla fighters called mujahedeen have 
besieged the capital kabul and blocked most roads into the city 
since late last year the fighters are backed by the united states 
pakistan china and several arab states 
there are serious food and fuel shortages in kabul caused as 
much by an unusually bitter winter as by the rebel siege 
a un program to airlift food and fuel from islamabad for 
refugees in kabul has been stalled because airlines refused to fly 
into the city saying it was not safe 
radio kabul reported that indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
promised economic and humanitarian assistance to afghan foreign 
minister abdul wakil who is visiting the indian capital for 
meetings with top officials 
on the battlefield radio kabul reported government troops in 
the past 24 hours killed 14 criminals a word the state radio 
uses to describe the guerrillas 
meanwhile a key rebel commander in the kabul area said in a new 
report that workers last month finished building a helicopter 
landing pad between presidents najibs palace and the ruling 
partys headquarters abdul haq said najib had the heliport built 
for a speedy escape from the capital should rebels overrun the city 
haq also said explosives have been planted at some military and 
communications installations in the city to be detonated by remote 
control by retreating government troops 
there was no independent confirmation of haqs claims

a federal drug agent whose murder touched 
off a nationwide manhunt was eulogized saturday as a teddy bear of 
a man who fell victim to the violence he sought to prevent 
about 4000 mourners turned out for the funeral of drug 
enforcement agency agent everett hatcher of boonton hatcher was 
unarmed when he was shot to death tuesday by a man whom officials 
say has ties to organized crime 
thousands of dea and fbi agents and policemen from as far away as 
canada lined up in the parking lot outside st christophers church 
when the hearse pulled up 
the strains of a single bagpipe from the new york police 
departments emerald society pipe band cut through the chilly air 
while the flagdraped coffin was carried up the steps 
also present at the heavily guarded 1hour service were fbi 
head william sessions dea chief john lawn new york mayor edward i 
koch and sen alfonse damato rny 
father frank ferraioli the family priest described hatcher as a 
gentle and kind man who would live on in the memories of those who 
met him 
he was not a man of violence the priest said 
a former dea agent and close friend of hatchers joseph 
degenaro recalled the slain agent as a teddy bear of a man who 
loved to make people laugh and whom he remembered grinning from 
ear to ear 
he has touched all of us and we are sad hes gone he said 
but he lives on in our minds and our hearts 
at the service were the slain agents wife maryjane hatcher and 
the couples two children joshua 3 and zachary 9 
mrs hatcher said friday that people who use drugs must share the 
blame for her husbands death 
even through the grief and our loss i must ask the question 
who really killed everett emerson hatcher she said who are the 
ultimate guilty parties who create the market for the poison which 
he valiantly tried to remove from our society 
dea officials said the investigation of hatchers killing was 
continuing satisfactorily 
a van that was driven by the main suspect costible farace 28 
of new yorks staten island was found late friday in staten island 
officials believe farace a paroled killer shot hatcher four 
times during a meeting in a secluded area along an expressway on 
staten island hatcher who was wearing a radio transmitter had 
previously met with farace several times 
the dea has undertaken a nationwide search for farace he had not 
been charged with murder but a warrant was issued for his arrest on 
narcotics charges 
new york police department spokesman jim coleman said farace 
appeared to have loose ties to the bonanno crime family and was 
involved in a ring that transported cocaine from florida to new york 
stutman said officials had gotten calls from hundreds of people 
trying to cooperate with the investigation but as any tedious 
investigation it will take time to build a case 
we will locate mr farace you can rest assured of that he 
said 
stutman has ordered new yorks 500 dea agents to focus on the 
murder until farace is found a nationwide search was underway 
president bush will visit the dea in new york this week a visit 
expected to boost what he said was low morale in the wake of the 
murder stutman said dea head lawn said bush also planned to meet 
with hatchers family

prime minister aneerood jugnauth has 
escaped the second assassination attempt in four months local 
newspapers reported saturday 
police said they arrested a man who tried to attack jugnauth with 
a razor friday night but they refused to release any details about 
the attack or the assailant 
authorities said this indian ocan island which boasts one of 
africas few multiparty democracies was calm 
during a nov 6 religious ceremony a hindu priest attempted to 
shoot jugnauth with a pistol the priest was disarmed and the prime 
minister who also is a hindu like most mauritians was not injured 
motives for the attack on which the priest faces charges of 
attempted murder remain unclear 
jugnauth came to power in 1982 parliamentary elections and faces 
a militant opposition but he has presided over an economic boom 
that has virtually wiped out unemployment in this sugarproducing 
island with its growing tourist industry 
most of mauritius 1 million islanders are indiandescended

it will be four years on march 11 that mikhail s

restructuring the soviet system and bringing about a greater 
openness of that closed society following is the second of a series 
of reports by ap correspondents in moscow essaying those four years

jetliners daily carry soviets to visit relatives in 
the united states and roam the shops in central russia resident 
us inspectors verify the scrapping of soviet missiles new yorkers 
along broadway cheer the kremlin leader 
in four years president mikhail s gorbachevs new thinking 
has brought style and substance to soviet foreign policy largely to 
plaudits from the west once the domain of frowning apparatchiks 
with a penchant for saying nyet kremlin diplomacy now proclaims 
its willingness to consider any complaint and to compromise 
while still beset at home by a stagnant economy ethnic unrest 
and a growing impatience for more food and a better life gorbachev 
can cite a string of impressive achievements in world affairs since 
he was named communist party chief march 11 1985 
a ussoviet treaty signed in december 1987 banning 
mediumrange and shorterrange nuclear missiles it was the first 
negotiated reduction in superpower nuclear forces 
an end to the nineyear military intervention in afghanistan 
that soured eastwest relations and left up to 13000 red army 
soldiers dead 
five superpower summits plus good prospects for a meeting soon 
with president bush 
the narrowing of differences with china and agreement to hold 
the first chinesesoviet summit in 30 years in beijing in may 
when prime minister margaret thatcher of britain first met 
gorbachev in december 1984 she judged we can do business 
together her verdict sums up the wests attitude toward the 
energetic pragmatic communist who succeeded leonid i brezhnev 
yuri v andropov and konstantin u chernenko 
in a recent public opinion poll in the conservative bastion of 
orange county calif the soviet leader scored a higher favorable 
rating than bush 70 percent to 67 percent when gorbachev and his 
wife raisa got out of their limousine near a broadway theater 
during a december visit to new york americans cheered from the 
sidewalks 
gorbachev 58 says his brand of diplomacy forms a seamless web 
with perestroika his drive for economic and social reform at 
home we say honestly for all to hear that we need a lasting 
peace to concentrate on the development of our society and tackle 
the tasks of improving the life of the soviet people he said in 
1987 
in other words reduced world tensions mean the need for fewer 
guns and that means more bread and apartments for soviet people a 
cut of 500000 men and 10000 tanks in the countrys armed forces 
announced by gorbachev in december appears motivated as much by 
soviet economic pressures as by a desire to ease eastwest 
confrontation in europe 
conversely gorbachevs domestic reforms have led to improved 
relations abroad and often appear motivated to dispel what he refers 
to as the soviet unions enemy image some examples the 1987 
release of nobel peace prize laureate andrei d sakharov from 
internal exile the freeing of more than 300 imprisoned political 
and religious activists and a marked increase in the number of 
soviets permitted to emigrate and visit relatives abroad more than 
35000 visas were granted last year for soviets to visit the united 
states twice the 1987 figure 
the new face of soviet foreign policy was personified by 
gorbachevs appointment of eduard a shevardnadze to replace andrei 
a gromyko as foreign minister the dour gromyko nicknamed mr 
nyet by those he faced across the negotiating table for nearly 
three decades was elevated to a ceremonial post less than four 
months after gorbachev came to power to make room for the debonaire 
shevardnadze who pointedly has criticized the way the soviets used 
to deal with the outside world 
in july shevardnadze announced that the classstruggle basis 
of soviet diplomacy under which the kremlin for decades labored for 
the triumph of socialist revolution abroad has given way to 
universal human values such as the banning of nuclear weapons 
and renunciation of military force in favor of negotiation to settle 
international disputes 
such a switch in emphasis implies a cutback in soviet commitments 
to client states including afghanistan ethiopia angola and 
mozambique the passage to socialism by such countries was trumpeted 
as a major kremlin foreign policy success in the 1970s but their 
unproductive economies cost the soviets dearly in economic and 
military aid 
in april gorbachev is to travel to cuba where he is expected to 
outline new limits on the soviets largess to bolster the islands 
economy and to signal to its neighbors that the kremlin no longer 
will bankroll socialist revolutions in latin america gorbachev also 
has indicated that economics played a role in the kremlins decision 
to end the afghan intervention which one estonian newspaper 
estimates cost the soviets 100 billion 
however the new way of thinking in some respects may be only 
a new way of talking on some issues the new leadership has yet 
to address 
despite gorbachevs repeated calls for construction of a common 
european home for instance the berlin wall still divides the 
german city and symbolically the continent into communist and 
noncommunist camps 
the kremlin is seeking to become a major player in asia a role 
that is impossible without better relations with japan but the 
soviets so far have failed to satisfy japans condition for 
improving ties renegotiation of the status of the kuril islands 
which the red army occupied at the end of world war ii 
gorbachev has acknowledged that putting his new thinking into 
action is a longterm effort but he takes visible pride in his 
successes to date we believe that the situation has changed for 
the better that a window of hope has opened up a little he said 
last year

gus palacias didnt have to walk the machinists 
picket lines that went up saturday outside eastern airlines 
headquarters 
he no longer works there 
but i felt i couldnt turn my back said palacias 62 who 
retired in december 1987 after 22 years as a machinists union 
aircraft mechanic this is a showdown i truly believe we have 
right on our side it may just be a showdown to the death 
faced with a foe already accused of breaking one unionized 
airline many in the 8500member eastern machinists union vow never 
to swap their red strike shirts for white surrender flags in the 
fight over wages and work conditions 
their fervor is not directed at the company where many union 
members have worked since the last strike in 1966 but on its boss 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo who acquired miamibased eastern 
in 1986 three years earlier he forced continental airlines into 
bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 to end a labor confrontation and 
abrogate collective bargaining pacts 
frank demaria chief steward of the machinists local in bayonne 
nj said while walking the picket line saturday the labor of 
this country is aware of what a terrorist frank lorenzo is they 
consider the dispute not only against eastern but a dispute for all 
labor 
its a war said miami baggage handler larry burgess there 
are a lot of people here ready to pay any sacrifice to win this 
one 
yet many fear the price may be high as the strike could drive 
under the 60yearold company with lorenzo attempting the same 
unionbusting strategy used at continental 
we said we wouldnt worry until the strike came said pat 
ditzler whose husband has worked as an eastern stock clerk for 20 
years its time to worry 
wally haber general chairman of the machinists eastern local 
said workers will receive a paycheck friday then wait two weeks for 
100aweek strike payments 
haber however said a decision by pilots and teamsters to honor 
picket lines could force a quick resolution possibly by white house 
intervention 
i predict a 10day strike with the pilots on our side said 
haber who fought eastern management during strikes of six weeks in 
1958 and seven weeks in 1966 i hope we wont kill the airline 
but lorenzo was trying to kill us said haber 
eastern management which claimed the airline has been losing 1 
million a day due to high labor costs was demanding nearly 150 
million in machinists concessions the union rejected the demand 
the emotions usually die down after the first week said russ 
mcgarry the unions strike coordinator then we are faced with 
the issues of trying to make ends meet at home 
the possible loss of paychecks holds different significance for 
the union workers who include mechanics baggage handlers and other 
groundservice workers 
david barr 26 who started as an eastern mechanic three years 
ago said hed move on to another job if eastern fails 
well take the company down if we have to said barr its 
come down to that

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzos reputation 
as one of americas toughest bosses is being tested with the eastern 
airlines strike but so is his image as a successful airline builder 
since houstonbased texas air and its chairman took over eastern 
when it was on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago the view of 
texas air as the model for taking advantage of airline deregulation 
has been shaken for all its costcutting texas air has been 
posting record losses 
lorenzo warned easterns workers last week that their company 
cant survive a strike by machinists with the pilots and flight 
attendants joining in the unions are gambling that texas air cant 
survive either and that lorenzo will either yield or sell eastern 
to protect his parent corporation 
they concede the possibility though that he may finish 
stripping away eastern assets and leave a shell or take the company 
into bankruptcy 
the workers willingness to fight lorenzo even at risk to their 
future underlines his unpopular management style although he bought 
eastern in february 1986 with the slogan we arent unionbusters 
were airlinebuilders lorenzo added there aint no santa 
claus 
the man recently called one of the nations toughest bosses 
and a corporate loose cannon rolling on deck by fortune 
magazine was born francisco antonio lorenzo 48 years ago to spanish 
immigrants in queens ny three miles from la guardia airport 
at one point young frank drove a truck and belonged to the 
teamsters union 
lorenzo whose schoolboy nickname of frankie smooth talk was 
unearthed by eastern labor leaders who also sport stop lorenzo 
buttons graduated from columbia and harvard business school worked 
at trans world airways and eastern then in 1971 helped buy 
moneylosing texas international which became texas air in 1980 
with an inner circle of ambitious harddriving executives 
wellversed in the ways of wall street and washington lorenzo has 
built houstonbased texas air with a takeover of continental and its 
swallowing of such carriers as people express new york air 
frontier airlines and other small carriers 
continental has been predominantly nonunion since he got labor 
contracts abrogated in 1983 bankruptcy reorganization 
he had mounted unsuccessful efforts to take over national 
airlines and twa when easterns 1986 financial and labor crisis gave 
him an opening to buy the major carrier he gave easterns board a 
takeitorleaveit offer which it accepted after the machinists 
union refused to make major wage concessions 
lorenzo at first wouldnt deal directly with eastern union 
leaders but late last year had dinner with combative machinists 
union head charles e bryan the meeting led only to more disputes 
he made direct appeals to pilots and flight attendants in a homey 
videotape sent to their homes last week 
a nonsmoker ardent jogger and married father of three daughters 
and a son lorenzos description of himself as a honest 
hardworking family man doesnt persuade eastern workers who call 
him a corporate terrorist they are determined to fight

buried deep beneath the village of sharapova southeast of moscow 
are bunkers designed to allow kremlin leaders to survive a nuclear 
war 
contrast those shelters with statements by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and should 
never be fought and you face the imponderable dilemma of the nuclear 
age 
why do the superpowers have atomic weapons and how will they use 
them 
in the kremlin and at the white house the superpowers are 
reviewing their own nuclear doctrines national security adviser 
brent scowcroft is directing the us effort one that is expected 
to change the defense budget the shape of the us nuclear arsenal 
and american positions in arms control talks 
us and soviet theories on the use of atomic weapons have 
evolved over the decades from the construction of the first bombs 
in the 1940s until the widespread acceptance now that nuclear 
weapons are too dangerous to use in war 
we are profoundly devoted to the idea of a nuclearfree 
world gorbachev wrote in perestroika 
if the huge stockpiles of nuclear chemical and other weapons 
that have been accumulated are unleashed nothing will remain of the 
world what we are talking about is the survival of humanity 
such statements are welcomed in the west 
but scrape away the rhetoric and some disturbing facts remain 
since 1980 the soviet union has modernized its arsenal by adding 
landbased missiles with about 1000 warheads including two new 
mobile classes the ss24 and ss25 which are not matched by the 
united states 
the united states has 12683 boms and warheads compared with 
10358 for the soviet union according to the center for defense 
information a liberal washington lobbying organization 
the us and soviet arsenals are designed largely for use against 
the other superpower and although they have never used them against 
each other the threat is always there summed up in the byword of 
the nuclear age deterrence 
deterrence according to the americans equals mad mutual 
assured destruction 
over the years the soviets have taken a somewhat different view 
as early as 1977 thesoviet president leonid i brezhnev 
enunciated the tula doctrine which states that a nuclear can 
never be won and should never be fought that doctrine has been 
adopted by gorbachev 
but many red army officers writing in theoretical journals and 
training manuals argued otherwise leading many western analysts to 
conclude that soviet war plans included a possible first strike 
against the united states 
and many believed at the time that the soviets might use tactical 
nuclear weapons to try for an early victory during a war in europe 
a view that was buttressed by the deployment of mediumrange soviet 
ss20s in central europe in the late 1970s the ss20s are being 
destroyed under the intermediaterange nuclear force treaty signed 
by gorbachev and president reagan in december 1987 
the ss20 deployment which was criticized by soviet journalists 
like aleksandr bovin and reformist scholars in civilian thinktanks 
was part of a massive military buildup under brezhnev giving the 
soviets parity with the united states in nuclear weapons and near 
parity or superiority in conventional and naval forces 
the soviets now say they have adopted the new thinking of 
gorbachev and want to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of the 
century 
but us officials say the soviets have made no move to dismantle 
their longrange nuclear forces or the bunkers where kremlin leaders 
could hide in the event of war 
the pentagon said in its annual report the soviet threat 
that the first bunkers were built 40 years ago and that yet 
another round of construction on these complexes began in the early 
1980s when soviet leaders were publicly emphasizing that a nuclear 
war would be so catastrophic that attempts to achieve victory or 
even seriously limit damage in such a war no longer made sense 
the bunkers are a manifestation of the old thinking said one 
of the thinktank scholars who is backing gorbachevs campaign to 
trim the military he asked that his name not be used because the 
bunkers are considered a statesecret 
yet many american critics of the pentagon are persuaded that the 
new thinking has taken hold in moscow 
john steinbrunner director of foreign policy studies at the 
liberal brookings institution in washington said the bunkers are 
not evidence of a duplicitous soviet nuclear doctrine rather he 
said they are similar in concept to the airplanes that the united 
states keeps at andrews air force base near washington waiting to 
whisk top leaders out of danger in the event of war 
there are very good reasons to have those bunkers in order to 
stabilize your command said steinbrunner if your central 
command can be eliminated by preemptive attack you can be knocked 
out 
in addition to its plan to keep the president airborne during the 
initial stages of a nuclear attack the us military also maintains 
secure underground facilities in colorado and other states largely 
as communications installations the distinction is that the us 
system of underground facilities is not as extensive as that of the 
soviets in terms of the number of officials they would house or the 
length of time they might remain in them 
soviet leaders have claimed that they developed nuclear weapons 
in response to such bombs in the us arsenal but the memoirs of 
soviet physicists published in the 1980s give evidence that the 
kremlin secretly sought to be the first to develop the bomb 
soviet work on the bomb began in the late 1930s through spies 
the soviet leadership learned in 1943 of the us manhattan project 
and ordered physicists to speed up their work 
after the united states dropped an abomb on hiroshima in 1945 
the soviets redoubled their efforts 
provide us with nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time 
you know that hiroshima has shaken the whole world the balance has 
been destroyed provide the bomb it will remove a great danger 
from us stalin told the physicists 
four years later the soviets tested their first bomb according 
to david holloway a scholar at stanford university and author of 
the book the soviet union and the arms race 
the united states nevertheless retained a significant edge in 
the number of weapons and means to deliver them unable to afford 
the cost of maintaining a full land army in europe the united 
states adopted the less expensive alternative of balancing soviet 
military might with nuclear weapons that remains the fundamental 
principle of us nuclear doctrine in europe 
although the red army occupied most of central europe after the 
defeat of nazi germany the american abomb denied them superiority 
on the continent 
during the cold war us and soviet politicians and physicists 
engaged in a game of geopolitical chess maneuvering to place each 
others cities military bases and allies at nuclear risk 
through the 50s and 60s the soviets struggled to keep pace 
with the us nuclear arsenal but were hamered because unlike the 
americans they did not have bases near their adversary on which to 
base bombers and missiles 
the launching of the first manmade satellite the soviet sputnik 
in october 1957 signaled that the russians had the means to build 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and helped prompt john f 
kennedy to warn of a missile gap during his successful 
presidential campaign in 1960 
in 1962 kremlin leader nikita s khrushchev tried to put soviet 
missiles within striking distance of the united states by deploying 
them in communist cuba 
the soviet failure in the missile crisis spurred them to achieve 
strategic parity with the united states

a newspaper saturday quoted a plo spokesman as 
saying informal talks with us officials are beating around the 
bush and that serious dialogue focusing on an international 
peace conference should begin 
the comments by yasser abdrabboo the plos information 
department chief were reported by the alanbaa newspaper 
abdrabboo was quoted as saying the palestine liberation 
organization notified washington a week ago that it was time to 
resume a serious and in depth dialogue to prepare for an 
international conference 
dragging on with informal contacts that have been taking place 
in tunis is beating round the bush and will not help bring about a 
settlement the newspaper quoted him as saying 
abdrabboo could not be reached directly for comment according 
to an aide in tunis who demanded anonymity there was no immediate 
reaction from the state department it did not return telephone 
calls from the associated press 
the newspaper article was picked up by radio monte carlo whose 
report was then repeated on israels staterun radio and television 
saturday 
israeli media reported that abdrabboo said the plo was not 
willing to continue the dialogue with the united state under current 
conditions but such comments did not appear in the alanbaa report 
seen in kuwait 
alanbaa also quoted jamal sourani a member of the 15man 
palestine executive committee as saying the plo expects the 
dialogue to resume and take its natural course in march or april 
after the crystalization of the american attitude on palestinian 
rights 
the united states launched a dialogue with the plo late last 
year ending a 13year boycott of such talks after plo chairman 
yasser arafat renounced terrorism and recognized the state of israel 
israel which considers the plo a terrorist organization 
repeatedly has urged washington to end the talks citing what it 
calls continuing plo attacks 
the state department warned friday that recent clashes between 
palestinian guerrillas and israeli troops in south lebanon could 
have a negative impact on the dialogue israel said the palestinians 
were trying to infiltrate israel 
palestinian leaders say military operations against israel were 
not included in arafats commitment renouncing terrorism 
arafat said friday that palestinian guerrillas will continue to 
strike back during israeli raids on their bases in south lebanon 
arafats closest aide salah kahlaf was quoted as saying saturday 
that washington is still hesitant about its dialogue with the 
plo and that was the reason for its warning 
radio monte carlo based in paris also quoted him as saying 
military operations are not acts of terrorism 
our definition of terrorism is very clear any operation abroad 
outside israel in which civilians including israelis are killed 
is terrorism said khalaf cofounder of arafats fatah faction 
the radio did not say where he was interviewed

throngs crowding a downtown street 
covered with truckedin snow cheered saturday as 49 mushers and 
hundreds of dogs charged off on the first leg of the 1168mile 
iditarod trail sled dog race from anchorage to nome 
the 17th annual race over the alaska range across desolate 
stretches and along the stormraked coast began in clear windy 
weather at 9 am with veteran musher jerry austin of st michael 
first out of the chute 
susan butcher aiming for her fourth consecutive win and the 
50000 winners share of the 250000 purse was 19th to leave in 
the succession of departures spaced two minutes apart rival rick 
swenson of two rivers the only person to win the race four times 
was no 22 
i feel great i feel great butcher 33 of manley said with 
a laugh as she hugged a wellwisher before the start of her 12th 
iditarod last year she finished in just under 11 days and 12 hours 
i think that i can take the pressure she said i know that 
everybodys gunning for me i know that everybodys after me but i 
dont see how they can be more after me than they were last year 
a temperature of 13 degrees and winds gusting to 46 mph combined 
for a wind chill of minus 22 degrees at the races start stronger 
wind and clear skies were reported along the first stretch of the 
race route 
the snow was trucked in because the streets had been swept 
some observers crowded into a fastfood restaurant to stay warm 
while awaiting the start children outside hawked iditarod 
newspapers and a man wearing a sandwich sign advertised iditarod 
photographs 
the race inspired by a sleddog relay of serum to nome for a 
diptheria outbreak in 1925 began in 1973 
the number of competitors dropped this year in part because the 
record cold spell of january and february prevented mushers from 
giving their dogs enough training said race manager jack niggemyer 
there were 53 competitors last year 
the racers will stop at 25 checkpoints along the route where 
they will get food for themselves and their dogs along the way 
they will camp out or stay in homes or lodges 
commercial subsidies for the race have grown substantially over 
the years with money coming from a variety of sources including 
television rights dogfood companies and manufacturers of 
coldweather gear 
joe redington the 72yearold father of the iditarod stood 
by his dogs early saturday as he waited to compete for the 15th time 
im a little more serious this year than i have been before 
said redington who has never won the race i usually go out and 
have a good time ill be a little more serious now 
libby riddles whose 1985 victory made her the first woman to win 
the iditarod is back after missing two of the last three races and 
dropping out of a third 
im just real anxious to get on the trail said riddles 32

excessive zeal in pursuing president mikhail s 
gorbachevs antidrinking drive caused the destruction of 16 percent 
of soviet vineyards many of which werent intended to produce wine 
a newspaper said saturday 
the labor daily trud said table grapes rather than wine grapes 
suffered the most during the systematic uprooting of vines spurred 
by the interest in promoting soviet sobriety 
in 198587 533000 acres of soviet vineyards or 16 percent of 
the total were destroyed trud said the official tass news agency 
called it a human folly 
gorbachev launched the antialcohol campaign in may 1985 raising 
the price of vodka and other alcoholic beverages and cutting 
production within two months of being named communist party chief 
since then the soviets have admitted they erred in treating all 
alcoholic beverages alike and have liberalized the sales of wine 
cognac and some other beverages 
trud said the 198587 drive to uproot vineyards had especially 
hit the southern republic of moldavia one of the soviet unions 
most celebrated winegrowing regions the ukraine the russian 
federation and the caucasus republic of azerbaijan 
to compound the damage vines killed in severe winters during 
those years were not replaced and the establishment of new 
vineyards was halved trud said

tow trucks hauled away the charred 
husks of buses saturday and a shortage of coffins was reported 
following nationwide riots that killed at least 300 people and left 
thousands injured 
hospitals were crammed with victims of the four days of 
disturbances the bloodiest in venezuelas history the riots were 
touched off monday by bus fare increases and evolved into nationwide 
demonstrations against a government austerity program 
authorities loosened a curfew in the capital and reduced the 
number of national guard units on the streets tow trucks cleared 
burned buses from intersections long lines of people stood outside 
distribution centers and the few food stores open for business 
residents near caracas central morgue said the smell of about 
250 dead bodies was leading to fears of disease news reports said 
some coffins were arriving with two bodies inside because there 
werent enough caskets to go around 
the director of the largest hospital in the city said morgue 
officials called on medical officials to help them with the bodies 
the hospital director dr carmen chirinos said 1881 injured 
people crowded her 700bed hospital perez carreno she said most of 
the injured were young men with bullet wounds 
weve been doing very well under the circumstances she said 
president carlos andres perez said at least 300 people were 
killed and 2000 injured in the riots and looting news reports have 
said several thousand people were detained 
insurance companies estimated damage to their clients was about 
76 million but that many looted businesses had no coverage 
according to news reports 
authorities pushed back a 6 pm curfew to 8 pm friday in 
caracas and suspended it altogether in several regions of the 
country 
the military had airlifted 50 tons of food into caracas in the 
last three days news reports said 
soldiers guarded vital roads gasoline stations food 
distribution centers and government buildings but there were fewer 
armored personnel carriers and tanks in the streets 
however many caracas residents still were not convinced the 
violence was over 
i dont know where this is going to end but im sick of it 
said marisabel perez standing in the doorway of a housing project 
oilproducing venezuela was for decades one of the wealthiest and 
politically stable nations in latin america but a fall in world oil 
prices combined with debt payments has depleted monetary reserves 
creating the economic crisis 
real wages have fallen by a third since 1981 and inflation is 
expected to double this year to 70 percent 
perez said venezuela could expect six months of economic hardship 
in a letter saturday to international monetary fund president 
michel camdessus perez said his country would continue to follow an 
imfmandated austerity program but complained the fund did not take 
into account local economic conditions and low world prices for 
third world exports 
the austerity measures are required under an agreement with the 
imf in exchange for a 43 billion loan over the next three years 
perezs letter thanked camdessus for his personal statements of 
support for venezuela following recent violence but he complained 
that the imfapproved reforms were like trying to give medicine to 
a patient without taking into account his organic conditions 
he said the reforms gravely affect the impoverished sectors of 
the country that explode in desperation in the horrifying violence 
that we saw unleashed on the streets of caracas

more than 150 firefighters and 
volunteers saturday battled a forest fire in the monte pascoal 
national park the last great wildlife reserve of brazils atlantic 
coastal forest and home to about 1000 indians 
firefighters have been unable to contain the blaze which entered 
the park friday fire chief solange borges of the brazilian forestry 
institute said 
borges said the fire had already destroyed more than 62 acres of 
the park which is 900 miles northeast of rio de janeiro he spoke 
by telephone from the city of salvador 1055 miles northeast of rio 
the park is the last untouched sanctuary for rare wildlife and 
vegetation on the brazilian coast and is home to 1000 pataxo 
indians who live on a reserve in it 
the situation gets more critical by the minute said borges 
were on the brink of a real emergency 
the fire began 28 days ago as a series of brush fires throughout 
the northeastern state of bahia it has destroyed more than half 
brazils atlantic forest sweeping south through more than 80000 
acres of virgin wilderness 
the cause of the fire was not known but borges said indians 
often set fire to their land at the edge of the forest this time of 
year to renew pastures 
our biggest worry is that the fire will grow so strong that it 
takes over the reserve borges said the fire is a lot stronger 
than it was a week ago 
civil defense workers and local residents battled the fire friday 
with helicopters tractors and sprinkler systems borges said 
but their efforts have been hampered by dry weather in addition 
the indians resisted the intrusion of firefighters on their land 
were trying to isolate the fires which are buring in four 
different areas of the forest right now said borges but under 
these circumstances it hasnt been easy 
just 3 percent of the atlantic forest which once covered about 
170000 square miles along a 3000mile coastal strip remains 
standing today 
some of the forests rare monkeys birds and trees many found 
nowhere else in the world face extinction one of the trees near 
extinction is the paubrasil which gave the country its name

five nuns entered their sixth month 
barricaded in their monastery infirmary despite a vatican opinion 
that calls for an end to the protest and evicts two women from the 
religious order 
the vatican told two of the women whose vows expired during the 
protest that they they must leave and are no longer considered 
members of the order of discalced carmelites the paterson diocese 
announced friday 
two others were told they should seek a different convent a 
fifth a 71yearold nun who suffers heart problems would be 
allowed to stay in the monastery of the most blessed virgin mary of 
mount carmel said tim manning a spokesman for bishop frank rodimer 
the nuns said through a spokeswoman that the letters are a 
lastditch effort by the bishop to get them to leave 
nothing came here with a vatican seal on it said the 
spokeswoman betty sutton its the bishops final trick to get 
them out 
five of the 13 nuns at the monastery locked themselves in the 
infirmary oct 4 they said they feared their pending eviction for 
protesting liberalizations such as television and candy which were 
initiated by the new mother superior prioress mother theresa hewitt 
mother hewitt has called the lockin a scandal and criticized 
the rebel nuns for disrupting the cloistered lifestyle at the 
convent 
perhaps the nuns most unwanted notoriety came last week on an 
episode of hooperman which featured its star john ritter 
falling in love with a nun one of five on the program barricaded 
in their monasterys infirmary protesting liberalizations at the 
convent 
rick kellard executive producer for the abc series said staff 
from the show saw news reports about the standoff and thought it 
would be a good way to have ritter who plays san francisco 
detective harry hooperman fall in love with a nun 
basically the episode is about him being very attracted to 
someone he cant have kellard said 
the rev timothy dolan a spokesman for the vatican embassy in 
washington dc said it could take two weeks or more before an 
appeal is heard by the vaticans highest court the apostolica 
signitura 
mrs sutton said the nuns were surprised the controversy has 
continued into its sixth month but said they feel that indicated 
the vatican is taking the case seriously

the leader of the machinists union faced down 
eastern chairman frank borman and then the airlines board and his 
refusal to give in to new owner frank lorenzo spurred saturdays 
strike at eastern 
charles e bryan 55 is depicted by eastern management as a 
hatefilled nearmaniacal union boss in a recently published 
redcolored booklet called charlie says the company warns 
that he will destroy the airline 
borman the former eastern chairman and apollo 8 astronaut who 
admits he was driven to tears by bryan recently compared him to 
peoples temple cult leader jim jones who led a mass suicide in 1978 
but bryans union members trust him and follow him implicitly 
many other eastern employees have come to admire his persistent 
ofteninnovative strategies which bryan credits to an extensive 
selfeducation that included study of the bible zen yoga the 
ancient chinese handbook the art of war and the philosophies of 
gandhi and martin luther king jr 
bryan says he has learned from studying their philosophies that 
resistance based on inner good and following the right way will 
triumph his critics say bryans philosophy is based on egotism and 
stubbornness or worse 
bryan has charged repeatedly that the lorenzo management wants 
only to bust the unions and strip away easterns assets before 
abandoning the carcass 
joseph guerrieri jr a veteran washington labor lawyer who 
represents the machinists says bryan never ceases to impress him 
with his drive and creativity 
the divorced father of three grown children appears to have 
unlimited stamina and is equally comfortable in corporate 
boardrooms courtrooms running news conferences or leading fiery 
union rallies 
borman says bryan has a certifiably insane dream of running 
eastern himself 
deregulations full impact on easterns fortunes and charlie 
bryans rise to power as a union leader arrived on the scene 
virtually in tandem twin omens of our troubled future borman 
wrote in his autobiography countdown 
bryan an eastern mechanic since 1956 and elected to head its 
largest union in 1980 has been trying to spur employee control of 
the company he says workers would be more productive and provide 
better service if they had more say in the company which he says 
has been pushed into financial desperation by years of poor 
management 
bryan threatened a strike in 1983 and borman gave in with a 32 
percent raise for the machinists borman says eastern then didnt 
have enough cash to withstand a strike and that the pay demands 
were irresponsible because bryan knew eastern couldnt afford them 
in 1986 easterns board demanded 20 percent wage concessions 
from its unions saying the company would go into bankruptcy without 
them the pilots and flight attendants agreed bryan said no 
concessions unless borman was fired 
the board said it couldnt allow such a demand and voted to sell 
to texas air bryan sent lorenzo a conciliatory telegram he got no 
answer and instead was stripped of his seat on the board and of 
other privileges 
that began a struggle bryan describes as between workers whose 
home has been invaded by a hostile force even a battle between good 
and evil

the government assured novelist salman rushdie of 
its unwavering support saturday and iran suggested london could 
defuse the crisis over rushdies new novel by banning the book and 
prosecuting the writer 
the indianborn author questioned government support for him 
friday after prime minister margaret thatcher and foreign secretary 
sir geoffrey howe said rushdies the satanic verses has offended 
some britons as well as moslems 
tehran radio welcomed their statements saturday but demanded 
britain take concrete action 
the british government by accepting that the book is 
insulting cannot object to the death sentence on the writer which 
has been issued in line with sharia islamic law it said 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani considered leader 
of the pragmatist camp within the iranian hierarchy said the rift 
over the book seems difficult to heal 
even if the apostate rushdie is executed if britain apologizes 
or if the book is withdrawn the rift remains part of a global 
arrogance plot the radio quoted rafsanjani as saying he offered 
no suggestions as to how the controversy could be resolved 
britain repeatedly has demanded irans spiritual leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini rescind his feb 14 death sentence on 
rushdie for writing the novel which some say insults islam 
the foreign office reiterated saturday that britain will not 
discuss the rushdie affair with iran until the death threat is 
withdrawn 
rushdie 41 who was born into a moslem family in india is in 
hiding on friday he telephoned the office of paddy ashdown leader 
of the centrist social and liberal democratic party and said he was 
worried about the commitment of the governments support for him 
asked to comment saturday on rushdies misgivings mrs thatcher 
said i want to say that the government has not changed its 
position at all on this 
the sunday times reported that some british artists had 
succumbed to the climate of fear caused by widening moslem 
intimidation 
it said an unnamed bbc broadcaster acting on police advice 
withdrew an article on the controversy from the sunday times it 
also said a painting featuring khomeini in a critical light which 
has been on display throughout britain has been dropped from a 
forthcoming exhibit at londons covent garden 
the weekly observer reported that at the british library the 
satanic verses is locked on a shelf reserved for rare books and 
pornography and can only be read in a highsecurity reading room 
home secretary douglas hurd who joined mrs thatcher at a 
conservative party conference in london was asked about reports 
that rushdie fears for his continued police protection 
the protection is afforded to him by the police not because 
he requests it not at my direction but because its their 
professional assessment that he needs that protection he said 
hurd said he understood the hurt and insult being felt by 
moslems over the book but the overwhelming majority of britons 
accept rushdies right to free expression 
tehran radio called on the british government to clarify 
whether or not freedom of expression and writing can be a license 
for defamation and insult 
if the british government does not see the freedom of 
expression as a license for defamation then legal prosecution of 
the author prevention of further publication of the book and 
removing already published copies are reasonable requests which can 
remove much of the friction the state radio said in a commentary 
the official vatican newspaper on saturday condemned whatever 
is irreverent and blasphemous in salman rushdies the satanic 
verses but said its author should not be killed 
in a frontpage editorial losservatore romano said that 
millions of moslems had found the novel offensive 
however it is not difficult to understand that the sacredness 
of the religious conscience of every individual cannot override the 
sacredness of the lives of other people the paper said 
britains chief rabbi lord jakobovits said in a letter in the 
times of london on saturday that rushdie and khomeini both had 
abused freedom of speech the one by provocatively offending the 
genuine faith of many millions of devout believers and the other by 
a public call to murder 
it should be illegal to allow either provocation to be 
published or broadcast he wrote 
moslems demonstrated against rushdie in at least four countries 
saturday in west germany 5000 protesters marched peacefully 
through downtown bonn but police in india lobbed tear gas to 
disperse protesters who stoned cars in northern anantang town about 
25 people were injured in the clash in jammukashmir indias only 
majority moslem state 
in bangladesh 400 people marched through dhaka shouting death 
to salman rushdie and in thailand 700 protesters in bangkok 
burned an effigy of rushdie 
nineteen people have been killed in protests over the book

physicians treating a snakevenom 
researcher received a shipment of serum from iran to counteract a 
deadly viper bite saturday but a hospital spokesman said doctors 
may elect not to use it 
antivenin was flown in saturday afternoon for william e haast 
78 who remained in serious but stable condition at the university 
of utah health sciences center after being bit on the left hand by a 
pakistani pit viper earlier in the week 
the doctors are evaluating it said john dwan hospital 
spokesman were hopeful that its not needed but that remains to 
be seen 
in an unusual effort initiated by stephen studdert special 
assistant to president bush antivenins effective against the bite 
were located in iran england and the soviet union and us customs 
rules were waived to place the shipments quickly on flights to the 
united states 
the british shipment from the english national poison unit in 
london arrived friday night but doctors did not administer it to 
haast deciding instead to wait for the more effective iranian 
serum said nursing supervisor rick taylor 
studdert said the shipment from the soviet union was being 
arranged through direct governmenttogovernment contacts but in 
iran peopletopeople nongovernment contacts were used there 
are no formal ties between the united states and irans 
fundamentalist moslem government which has repeatedly referred to 
america as the great satan 
meanwhile haasts fibrinogen level an element in the blood that 
regulates how the blood coagulates and is destroyed by the snake 
bite venom has been improving although it remained far below 
acceptable levels according to hospital spokesman john dwan 
we have been replacing fibrinogen through transfusions and his 
body appears to be making fibrinogen dwan said 
the iranian antivenin arrived at midafternoon and one of haasts 
friends transported it to the hospital before it is used dwan said 
doctors would monitor haasts condition and run checks on the 
antivenin 
these antivenins are not miracle curealls he said there 
are negative side effects that we have to guard against he said 
antivenins which are made from horse serum can cause lung and 
kidney problems 
haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from californias 
san diego zoo and from a lab in los angeles but dwan said he had 
not been given antivenins for about 24 hours 
the supply of the serum from the soviet union was being sent from 
the tashkent institute of vaccines that serum was being flown to 
frankfurt and was expected to get to the united states late sunday 
haast director of the miami serpentarium laboratories at the 
universitys research park has been bitten 148 times by snakes and 
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles but he had no immunity 
to withstand the vipers bite and checked himself into the hospital 
wednesday after being bitten tuesday 
the pakistani pit viper or sawscaled viper is one of 1000 
exotic poisonous snakes haast keeps at the lab where their venom 
is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for 
use in research and the manufacture of antivenins

the recently ousted communist party 
chief of the restive kosovo province was a leader of an outlawed 
group seeking secession of the region from yugoslavia a staterun 
newspaper alleged saturday 
the daily vecernje novosti claimed azem vlasi who headed 
kosovos ruling politburo from 198688 was a staff officer of a 
provincial counterrevolutionary group working to unite kosovo 
with neighboring albania 
vlasi was among about 20 leading ethnic albanian party officials 
or company directors in kosovo who have been arrested since thursday 
in a crackdown on ethnic albanian dissent there 
most allegedly belonged to the illegal group that reportedly 
planned to destabilize the province by strikes and protests and then 
carry out an armed uprising that would secede the predominantly 
ethnic albanian region from yugoslavia 
vecernje novosti reported what it said were initial results of 
the police investigation underway after the massive arrests and 
detentions of prominent kosovo public figures 
the arrests came after widespread protests by ethnic albanians in 
kosovo against planned constitutional changes they fear will limit 
autonomy of the region which administratively belongs to the 
republic of serbia 
last monday emergency measures were introduced in kosovo in an 
attempt to prevent possible clashes between the ethnic albanian 
majority and the slav minority there 
serbias ambitious communist party boss slobodan milosevic 
vowed on tuesday at a counterdemonstration by over 500000 serbs in 
belgrade that the organizers of the ethnic albanian protests 
would be punished and arrested 
vlasi 41 was the chief opponent of milosevics centralist 
policies and is one of the most popular leaders among about 2 
million ethnic albanians in kosovo 
for his consistent opposition to serbias policies toward kosovo 
he was voted out of the countrys 165member policysetting central 
committee in february 
vecernje novosti said that vlasi was arrested while planning to 
travel to west germany along with his wife his two brothers are 
reportedly living there 
belgrade newspapers said saturday that about 50 prominent public 
figures including several provincial party officials may face 
criminal prosecution in connection with their alleged role in recent 
ethnic albanian unrest 
meanwhile the official serbian press is increasingly implying 
that yugoslavias liberal slovenian republic was allegedly 
instigating the ethnic albanian unrest in kosovo 
it has alleged that vlasi secretly visited slovenia last month 
and that he was planning to become the director a slovenian bank in 
the provincial capital of pristina 
slovenia which itself fears alleged serbian hegemony has 
supported ethnic albanian demands for guarantees that the autonomy 
of their province will not be curtailed by changes of the 
constitution

some communist party members are resigning because 
they dont want to be associated with former leaders josef stalin 
and leonid brezhnev pravda said saturday in an article urging 
communists to face up to their painful past 
for decades the soviet government hid sordid chapters of its 
history and even glorified stalin during his lifetime but under 
president mikhail gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness the 
national press has been full of reports on repression and death 
under stalin and corruption under brezhnev 
many older communists have reacted with shock and dismay at the 
denigration of their heroes 
pravda the official communist party newspaper specifically 
cited electrician sergei k chapayev and m zapodoinikov a teacher 
both from the gornoaltai region in western siberia as members who 
had dropped out because they were disillusioned 
it said others have done the same but gave no figures 
all my life appears to be worthless chapayev who was a 
party member for 19 years before quitting recently was quoted as 
saying 
all my life i believed and now all is gone to ashes and not a 
blessed thing remains stalin molotov voroshilov we were 
singing songs about them we believed in them more than we believed 
in ourselves he said 
vyacheslav m molotov foreign minister during the prewar pact 
with nazi germany and kliment e voroshilov were two of stalins 
closest aides during the years when the stalinist secret police 
killed millions of soviet citizens 
pravda quoted zapodoinikov as saying i cannot remain a member 
of the party which had brezhnev kunayev nasriddinova and other 
scum in its ranks 
dinmukhamed kunayev and vadgar nasriddinova are former regional 
party officials named in corruption scandals 
pravda correspondent e solomenko said the two disaffected party 
members from gornoaltai were not isolated cases but part of a 
larger problem dating back years 
he said he remembered leningrad party members quitting during 
brezhnevs time saying its because we cannot live anymore in 
lies and hypocrisy 
the newspaper said that although some might argue that the 
shameful portions of the partys history should be kept quiet true 
party members should be able to stand up and face the truth 
admitting the truth pravda concluded is painful but necessary 
this is a pain similar to that which occurs when light strikes 
the eyes of a man who has long been in darkness and finally emerges 
into the sun or when a doctor restores sight to a blind man and 
takes from his eyes the black blindfold thus goes the revelation 
the newspaper said

slurs at reporters and got into a shoving match with a televison 
reporter who asked duke about his connection to jones 
the threeday convention that began friday at a downtown hotel 
was attended by about 200 people some of whom identified themselves 
as ku klux klansmen and neonazis 
i think jesse jackson needs to back off his racist politics 
throughout the city duke told reporters he called affirmative 
action minority setaside programs and integration of schools 
racially discriminatory 
setaside programs ensure that a certain percentage of federal 
state and local government contractors are minorities

showing support for striking eastern airlines workers declined 
comment on dukes statements except to say i dont think its an 
american point of view

a passenger train struck the back of another train 
outside london on saturday sending rail cars careening into the 
yards of nearby homes and killing at least five people police said 
at least 80 people were hurt 
earlier death tolls in the capitals second major rail accident 
in less than three months ran as high as 12 but could not be 
confirmed 
scotland yard put the confirmed death toll at five dead and 80 
injured earlier it had said six died it did not explain the change 
st helier hospital reported two deaths there and mayday 
hospitals emergency chief kambiz hashemi said three people were 
dead at that hospital 
reports of deaths reached 12 earlier in the day when hashemi 
reported four dead at mayday and six more dead at the scene of the 
crash a claim that could not later be confirmed there also was 
apparent confusion over the number of times the two deaths at st 
helier had been counted 
hashemi said his hospital admitted 52 casualties 20 of them in 
serious or critical condition twentyfour were discharged and three 
transferred to hospitals specializing in head and spinal injuries 
firefighters had to cut dozens of passengers from the wreckage of 
the trains and authorities said some were trapped for hours after 
the 139 pm collision near the purley station in surrey 
both trains originated in southeast england cities and were 
traveling north to london 
a british rail spokesman said it appeared a train that originated 
in horsham west sussex was crossing from the local line to a main 
track when it ran into the back of a train that originated in 
littlehampton 
littlehampton is about 50 miles south of london and horsham is 
about 30 miles south of the city 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said it was 
not known why both trains were on the northbound track at the same 
time 
the trains collided a few hundred yards outside the station on 
londons southern outskirts sending several cars hurtling down an 
embankment into the yards of homes witnesses said it was not known 
if anyone was hurt in the houses 
several rail cars came to a precarious rest on the steep slope 
and residents were advised to leave their homes until the wreckage 
could be cleared 
witnesses heard a deafening bang followed by silence then shouts 
and screams as passersby and residents rushed to the rescue 
firefighters arrived and cut victims from the wreckage 
british rail estimated fewer than 100 people were in the trains 
the normal low volume for a saturday 
a threetrain crash at londons busy clapham junction on dec 12 
killed 35 people and the latest disaster brought immediate 
accusations by the opposition labor party that neglect of the 
stateowned rail system was to blame 
prime minister margaret thatcher was very distressed and 
following developments her office said queen elizabeth ii was said 
to be shocked 
i heard a loud bang said alan long a nearby resident my 
son and i brought a sledgehammer and ran over to the train there 
was blood everywhere and people screaming 
passenger derek pearson said his car was tipping down an 
embankment i was trapped where i landed and showered with glass 
he said his train traveling from english channel town of 
littlehampton was going about 60 mph 
tania lawrence and her father were in the other train from 
horsham england watching a couple across the aisle from them 
she flew through the air and was knocked unconscious and he was 
thrown into my lap with blood pouring out of his head he had glass 
in his eyes said ms lawrence 
british rail said engineers began a probe into the cause 
samantha muggeridge who was waiting on the purley platform said 
a slow train was headed for the station when a faster one came up 
behind it and seemed to clip the back of it 
the dec 12 crash in clapham 10 miles north of purley has been 
blamed by british rail on flaws in its system of installing new 
signaling equipment 
railroad officials believe malfunctioning signals led one 
commuter train to slam into the rear of another stopped on the 
tracks an empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed into 
spillover wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had 
scrambled onto the tracks 
the clapham crash was the worst rail wreck in britain since 1975 
when 43 people died in a subway train that crashed in a london 
tunnel

jesse jackson began a threeday fast saturday to 
urge mayor eugene sawyer and mayoral candidate timothy evans to 
unite and preserve the coalition formed by former mayor harold 
washington 
harold washington died and our ship wrecked jackson told a 
rally at the headquarters of operation push the civil rights group 
he founded 
rather than pick up the pieces we chose to bomb the ship 
jackson said now we must build a new ship in five weeks 
evans a black democratic alderman running as an independent 
refused to endorse sawyer in last tuesdays democratic mayoral 
primary which was won by cook county states attorney richard m 
daley 
jackson endorsed sawyer who is also black in the primary and 
now supports evans 
sawyer has so far declined to endorse evans for the general 
election april 4 
division is our problem unity and coalition are our 
solution jackson said an evanssawyer summit is essential 
washington the citys first black mayor died in november 1987 
the election this spring is to fill the remaining two years of his 
second term 
after washingtons death sawyer a former alderman was selected 
acting mayor by the city council daley who is white is the son of 
the late mayor richard j daley who ruled chicago for 21 years 
former alderman edward vrdolyak who was washingtons archrival 
while a democrat won the republican primary tuesday vrdolyak is 
white 
there are those who say the only issue in the campaign is 
race jackson said thats not true but its a major issue the 
issue is not black and white its backward and forward 
sawyer was out of the country and could not be reached for 
comment but spokesman monroe anderson said he doubted jacksons 
appeal would persuade sawyer to endorse evans 
the mayor has indicated that hes going to remain neutral 
anderson said he just wants to remain above the fray 
evans spokesman rene camargo said the alderman was campaigning 
and could not be reached for comment 
jackson defended his support of evans over daley the democratic 
nominee saying that daley did not support washington in the 1987 
election campaign and that daley did not support jacksons own bid 
for the presidency 
i support fairness i support coalition jackson said but 
i am not a masochist i support fairness and reciprocity in return 
daley spokeswoman avis lavelle said daley was out of town and 
could not be reached for comment but said daley had asked sawyer to 
support the democratic nominee 
we see that reverend jacksons influence was not very 
persuasive when he asked tim evans to support eugene sawyer ms 
lavelle said it remains to be seen what effect his appeal will 
have on mayor sawyer

james taylor had just watered his chrysanthemums 
and left his greenhouse saturday when two passenger trains collided 
and half a dozen railroad cars hurtled down an embankment behind his 
home 
i had only been gone a few minutes when there was an almighty 
bang it was like a thunderbolt i looked at my greenhouse and it 
was flattened he said 
rail cars had pitched down the steep embankment behind a row of 
houses and come to rest upside down one of them in taylors 
backyard 30 feet from the house 
at least five people were killed and scores injured when the two 
londonbound trains from southern england collided at suburban 
purley about 12 miles south of central london the reason for the 
crash was not immediately known 
i went into my garage and i got out two sets of ladders and we 
used them to try and get up to the carriage doors taylor said 
but it was difficult because one of the coaches looked as if we 
put any weight on it at all that it might topple 
taylors 46yearold son andrew ran out to help 
people who were injured were asking can you come and help me 
please help me he said 
i worked on one carriage rail car the one in my fathers 
garden a girl was trapped in a luggage rack and together with a 
neighbor i helped her free i also gave assistance to an elderly 
lady who had been badly injured and stayed with her until the doctor 
arrived he said 
one man watched the collision from his bedroom window shouted to 
his wife to call the police then grabbed a sledgehammer and headed 
out back with his young son 
other neighbors gathered up sheets and blankets and clambered up 
the high embankment to try to reach the injured 
one woman named annette saidmy husband went along the gardens 
and began smashing windows to get people out 
we used ladders as stretchers to carry the people out said 
fred williams the people were just in a big jumble one on top of 
the other 
police soon were on the scene using their truncheons to break 
windows the sides of the high embankment were so steep that 
emergency teams had to haul each other up using ropes secured at the 
top 
doctors had to climb into the rail cars to treat the trapped 
while firefighters cut them free 
because of the difficulty of getting stretchers to the scene 
rescuers used anything flat to carry the injured away ladders 
even a shed door 
british rail rescue workers in bright orange coats and 
firefighters in brilliant yellow dotted the muddy rail line 
meesha footer 18 said she saw injured people being brought from 
the mangled railroad cars 
i could hear people shouting and groaning she said there 
was a lot of blood and i saw one body covered with a blanket and 
there was one man with his leg hanging off 
trees growing between the embankment and the houses appeared to 
have prevented at least three of the cars from tumbling further down 
the embankment into peoples homes 
about 20 muddy survivors limped into the nearby jolly farmer pub 
there was not much i could do for them except make gallons of 
coffee and let them use the telephone said proprietor nora 
oconnor

however the laotians may have been irritated when the united 
states earlier this week criticized them for allegedly failing to 
cooperate in the war against narcotics 
an annual report that secretary of state james baker sent to 
congress lists a handful of countries that it declares ineligible 
for us aid because of their support for drug trafficking 
in the report which was released wednesday president bush 
recommended that burma and laos be added to that list 
the report said us officials believe opium production is 
expanding in laos and that heroin is being refined there for export 
through thailand vietnam and china 
us officials have said there is evidence that laotian officials 
are involved in the processing and smuggling of drugs when that 
charge surfaced in last years narcotics report to congress the 
laotian government issued a stern denial 
the united states is trying to account for 547 americans listed 
as missing in action in laos during the vietnam war many were 
airmen who flew reconnaissance and bombing missions 
laos had conducted four joint excavations with the united states 
the first one was in feb 1985 
the pentagon said the latest excavation was to have been 
conducted in an area in southern savannakhet province which a 
uslaotian team had surveyed last december however the united 
states has no record of a us plane crashing there 
petzing said the us team had planned to work 810 days at the 
site

a senior official on saturday said 
hungary was reduced to a kind of servility to the soviet union 
during the regime of soviet leader leonid brezhnev 
the comments by central committee secretary matyas szueroes came 
a day after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was reported as 
approving of budapests plans to introduce a multiparty system 
szueroes in an interview in the magyar nemzet daily first 
praised the soviet unions 1945 liberation of hungary to remove 
one of the most backward and poorest feudalcapitalist regimes 
however he was reported as saying after 1948 relations no 
longer developed in the spirit of equal rights and mutual benefits 
the brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty of moscows 
allies caused a further deformation accompanied by great power 
aspects on the one side and a kind of servility on the other as 
well as insistence on certain dogmas until the mid1980s szueroes 
was quoted as saying 
hungarys servility was not explained but under the 
leadership of former premier janos kadar hungary heeded a soviet 
call to join in the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the 
shortlived prague spring reforms spearheaded by then party 
leader alexander dubcek 
romania was the only warsaw pact country that refused to take 
part in the military intervention 
szueroes also said the antipathy and reservations with which 
the soviet union and in general the socialist world followed the 
reform process in hungary was a fundamental cause of the halt to the 
reform 
one victim of kadars halt to the economic reform was reszoe 
nyers its chief architect who was ousted from the politburo in 
1973 as kadar was removed in may last year nyers joined the 
politburo again and now serves also in the government 
szueroess comments were an indication of gradually increasing 
openness in exposing the political shortcomings and economic 
failures during kadars 32year tenure 
word that gorbachev does not oppose hungarian moves toward 
introducing a multiparty system came from premier miklos nemeth as 
he was traveling back to budapest from a visit to the soviet union 
the general secretary of the soviet communist party welcomed 
the idea of pluralism in hungary since he considers the process 
of representation institutionalization and confrontation of 
opinions and interests to be at the core of democracy nemeth 
was quoted as saying by the state news agency mti late friday 
according to nemeth gorbachev said the soviety union seeks 
pluralism within a oneparty system yet he would not reprimand the 
hungarian leadership for its decision to introduce a multiparty 
system 
but gorbachev reportedly stressed that a multiparty system 
should not be seen as a panacea 
in the interview with magyar nemzet szueroes made clear that 
hungarys political links with the soviet bloc alliance system must 
not prejudice its economic interests 
the hungarian economy has serious interests in its cooperation 
with the soviet union szueroes was quoted as saying 
this however must be based on economic advantages and 
affiliation with the same warsaw pact alliance system must be 
clearly separated from asserting the economic interests 
before he went to moscow nemeth bluntly stated that comecon the 
sovietdominated eastern trading alliance brings more disadvantages 
than advantages for member countries 
nemeth quoted gorbachev too as saying that comecon should 
undergo a drastic transformation

former czechoslovak communist party chief 
alexander dubcek has sued a longtime rival for slander stemming from 
the sovietled invasion of two decades ago sources revealed 
saturday 
dubcek filed a lawsuit last summer against former politburo 
hardliner vasil bilak but wellinformed sources say the case has 
yet to come to court 
dubcek was 46 when he took over as party chief jan 5 1968 he 
was ousted in the wake of the sovietled invasion of seven months 
later that crushed the prague spring reforms in czechoslovakia 
he alleges that bilak slandered him by saying that dubcek had 
signed a statement in 1968 saying that czechoslovakia was threatened 
by counterrevolution 
the charge by bilak would run counter to dubceks image as a 
visionary reformer who presaged the openness and reforms now 
embraced by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
bilak a longtime party ideologist associated with the policies 
of former soviet leader leonik brezhnev resigned from all his 
political offices on dec 15 
he was strongly believed to have been opposed to sweeping 
economic reforms favored by former czechoslovak premier lubomir 
strougal who stepped down in october 1988 
bilak was one of three senior party officials reputed to have 
asked the soviets to intervene in order to crush dubceks liberal 
reforms the other two were the late drahomir kolder and alois 
indra who is still on the 13man prague politburo 
according to the sources in bratislava with direct contact to 
dubcek the onetime popular leader filed the slander charges in 
summer 1988 when bilak was still a senior member of the prague 
leadership 
dubceks action was reportedly based on interviews published in 
the west in which bilak alleged that dubcek at a 1968 meeting with 
warsaw pact leaders had signed a document saying that 
czechoslovakia was threatened by counterrevolution 
dubcek was said to have denied the claim insisting he had never 
seen such a document 
both bilak and dubcek who worked as a forestry employee in 
bratislava until his retirement now live in the slovak capital as 
pensioners 
should the case ever reach a courtroom it would be the first 
known lawsuit involving two former topechelon communist 
functionaries

crews worked saturday to remove thick oil that 
had washed in along a 2mile stretch of shoreline while the coast 
guard checked damage to a tanker that spilled 33000 gallons of oil 
when it ran aground authorities said 
coast guard officials said it appeared no more oil would come 
ashore and made a major revision in the estimate of the amount of 
oil spilled which originally had been put at 117000 gallons 
the 800foot tanker exxon houston floated free of a reef friday 
evening about 24 hours after a storm drove it aground off a 
littleused stretch of coast 15 miles west of honolulu and its famed 
waikiki beach 
coast guard spokesman david goff said that of 92000 gallons of 
bunker fuel oil feared lost from the tankers ruptured fuel tank 
84000 were found in the tank saturday meaning 8000 gallons were 
lost 
about 25000 gallons of crude oil spilled into the ocean thursday 
when the ship tore away from its mooring and floating hoses 
unloading the oil pulled free 
some of the spilled oil washed to sea during the night said 
randal ogrydziak with the coast guards marine safety office in 
honolulu 
for the most part it looks pretty good ogrydziak said 
mother nature overnight has through some tide changes done away 
with a lot of the petroleum product 
he said cleanup crews worked to remove oilsoaked vegetation 
soak up oil in water pools in the coral reef and rake the affected 
beaches 
the state department of health had closed beaches along the 
soiled shoreline ogrydziak said 
libert k landgraf deputy director of the state department of 
land and natural resources said there was no immediate evidence of 
injury or death to marine life or birds 
coast guard spokesman keith spangler flew over the tanker and 
shoreline saturday morning and said no more oil was visible around 
the ship or off the coast 
i really think most of its ashore spangler said 
coast guard lt brad nelson said officials at the scene believed 
the pollution would be limited to the shoreline already affected 
theyre saying if you have to have an oil disaster this is 
the one to have nelson said 
the coast guards pacific area biologicalchemical strike team 
arrived from san francisco late friday and was standing by with a 
floating boom that skims oil off the ocean surface nelson said 
he said the team had not decided whether to use the 612foot 
boom which is towed between two ships 
the clean islands council a hawaii oil spill cleanup 
cooperative was contracted to perform the cleanup by exxon co usa 
the houstonbased domestic oil and gas division of exxon corp exxon 
co usa will pay for the costs of the cleanup according to exxon 
attorney leonard alcantara 
officials had planned to wait until high tide early saturday to 
attempt to remove the tanker from the reef 
but it floated free on its own late friday after workers pumped 
off more than 9400 tons of ballast water and some of the remaining 
38 million gallons of crude oil lightening the ship to prevent 
more crude oil or ships fuel from spilling said scott hartvigsen 
another coast guard spokesman 
the tanker was moved to deep water five miles offshore and a navy 
ship and three tugboats had lines attached to the vessel nelson 
said a coast guard cutter and navy salvage ship also were with the 
ship 
there was no problem keeping the tanker afloat nelson said

tore it from its offshore mooring 
the exxon houston had unloaded 400000 barrels of alaska crude 
oil at the mooring a mile off the hawaiian independent refinery at

bangladesh on saturday asked un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to help mobilize 
international support for solving the countrys perennial flood 
problems an official said 
perez de cuellar who has visited india and will fly to nepal on 
monday as part of a tour of the region met foreign minister anisul 
islam mahmoud and responded favorably according to a source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the source who is close to the talks gave no further details 
more than 1400 people were killed and 25 million were left 
homeless last summer when floods submerged threefourths of this 
country of 110 million people 
bangladesh has been seeking a regional approach involving india 
and nepal for solving the flood problems india has repeatedly 
rejected the idea saying bangladesh was trying to 
internationalize a bilateral matter between the two neighbors 
bangladeshs major rivers originate in india and nepal during 
the monsoon season the rivers are swollen by rains and cascade down 
from the himalayan mountains and foothills 
although parts of india also are prone to floods the surging 
rivers greatest fury usually is unleashed on the lowlying nation 
of bangladesh 
un and bangladeshi environmental and development officials have 
said deforestation in india and nepal contributes to the problem 
because of a decline in soil retention of water 
the independent sangbad newspaper and other dhaka dailies

time inc and warner communications inc have 
agreed to combine in an oldfashioned merger creating an 18 
billion company that would be the worlds largest media and 
entertainment empire it was announced saturday 
the resulting conglomerate time warner inc would include 
publishing film and music interests with estimated annual revenue 
of 10 billion the companies said 
the company would surpass rupert murdochs australianbased news 
corp as the worlds biggest company in the field of media and 
entertainment which are two of the united states most successful 
exports 
theres never been a deal like this in the media business this 
is going to be a frighteningly powerful company said john s 
reidy an analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
some of americas most famous names would combine forces if the 
deal which requires shareholder and regulatory approval is 
consummated 
time is the nations leading magazine company with such titles 
as time people and sports illustrated along with timelife books 
and the bookofthemonth club 
time also owns two of the nations largest paycable television 
networks hbo and cinemax 
warner has major movie and television production interests 
including warner brothers and warner brothers television and warner 
cable communications 
clint eastwood and barbra streisand are regulars with warner and 
steven speilberg makes some of his movies for the studios warners 
recording artists include madonna zz top u2 fleetwood mac 
prince and paul simon 
warner through its 12 billion acquisition of lorimar 
telepictures corp in january owns such tv programs as knots 
landing dallas peoples court alf and falcon crest 
the companies cable television properties combined would be the 
second biggest in the country behind telecommunications inc of 
denver 
the deal is a merger of equals rather than an acquisition and 
thus cannot be directly compared to such megadeals as the nearly 
25 billion leveraged buyout late last year of rjr nabisco inc by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co a manhattan investment firm 
the new company will have cochief executive officers and a board 
of directors made up of equal numbers named by each company 
by merging in what is legally a taxfree pooling of interests 
the companies avoid the financial drain that usually accompanies 
huge acquisitions glenn britt times chief financial officer 
called it an oldfashioned merger 
i think we can contrast this to a lot of other transactions we 
see going on in america where companies end up being overleveraged 
and so constrained they cant do anything britt said 
this is a very important business for this country and we think 
its significant that were forming what will be the largest global 
media company and that its americanowned and usbased britt 
said 
time executives have been predicting recently that there will 
eventually be about half a dozen global powers in the media and 
entertainment business and have vowed to make their company one of 
them 
to compete in our particular business media and entertainment 
the ability to product materials in the various forms of media and 
to distribute them on a worldwide basis is critical britt said 
time warner would be jointly led by j richard munro chairman 
and chief executive officer of time inc and steven j ross his 
counterpart at warner according to a statement from both companies 
our complementary organizations are a perfect fit munro and 
ross said in a statement together we will be a worldwide leader 
in all our businesses enabling us to create and innovate in ways 
each could only dream about before 
besides murdochs news corp other big world media companies 
include west germanys bertelsmann ag and gulf amp western inc and 
capital citiesabc inc of the united states 
the merger of the companies would continue a trend of 
consolidation in the media business marked by such deals as sony 
corps 2 billion purchase of cbs records inc in 1987 
the deal would also help protect each company against unwanted 
suitors time has occasionally been the subject of speculation as a 
takeover target and warner has had uneasy relations with its 
largest shareholder herbert siegels chriscraft industries inc 
britt said the companies would be stronger together than apart 
but declined to give details on plans we have lots of ideas but 
we feel at this point its not appropriate to discuss things he 
said 
time would benefit from warners strong international 
distribution while warner would benefit from the strong 
programming reidy said 
time and warner are headquartered within one block of each other 
in manhattans rockefeller center and the top advisers to each firm 
are also within a block or two 
britt said negotiations on some form of business communication 
such as a merger of cable interests had proceeded off and on for 
two years he said intense negotiations including several allnight 
sessions occurred in the last few weeks 
legally the deal calls for warner shareholders to receive 0465 
share of time for each share of warner they own since there are 
potentially 1772 million warner common shares and time closed 
friday at 10912 a share that puts a value on warner of about 9 
billion if the deal had closed friday 
in addition there are 566 million shares of time outstanding 
giving it a market value of a little more than 6 billion based on 
fridays close 
debt and preferred shares account for the balance of the 18 
billion market value of the proposed new company 
reidy said he doubted that another suitor would enter to bust up 
the deal by bidding for warner even though the time stock they 
would receive comes to less than 51 per warner share not much 
above warners close of 4587 on friday 
warner stock rose 87 cents friday to a 52week high 
among other things because it is a true merger shareholders of 
the companies do not have to pay any capital gains tax on the deal 
any wouldbe acquirer would have to pay a substantial premium to 
make up for that tax reidy said 
the companies did not give a timetable for completion of the deal 
in a lockup agreement designed to block outsiders from 
attempting to break up the deal with a higher offer for either 
company time and warner agreed to exchange about 12 percent of each 
others stock without waiting for shareholder approval

the moslem and christian cabinets in 
lebanons dual government on saturday issued statements voicing 
concern over a reported plan by israel to expand its selfdeclared 
security zone in southern lebanon 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet 
told lebanons envoy to the united nations rashid fakhoury to 
draw the worlds attention to israels intentions an official 
statement said 
the rival christian cabinet of gen michel aoun in a statement 
published by the independent daily annahar expressed deep 
concern over the statements made by some israeli military commanders 
which clearly revealed israels intention to widen the area of what 
it calls the security zone 
maj gen youssi peled israels northern front commander was 
quoted thursday as saying he was considering expanding the security 
zone 
voice of the south radio the mouthpiece of the israeliallied 
south lebanon army militia that operates in the zone said peled 
wanted to include five druse villages in the strip 
the broadcast said the move was requested by unnamed leaders of 
the mimes khalwat ein senta kfir and ein ata villages located in 
the central bekaa valley a few miles north of the security zone 
the moslemrun voice of the nation radio based in west beirut 
broadcast statements issued in the five villages that denied making 
such a request or having contacts with the israelis in the security 
zone 
peleds statement reflects his intention to widen the security 
zone the broadcast said 
israel kept control of a 6to10mile deep zone when it withdrew 
the bulk of its occupation army from south lebanon in summer 1985 
the strip extending from the mediterranean coast in the west to 
the slopes of mount hermon in the east serves as a buffer against 
crossborder guerrilla attacks on northern israeli settlements 
lebanon has had rival moslem and christian governments since last 
september when outgoing president amin gemayel appointed aoun to 
head an interim military cabinet after parliament failed to elect a 
new president 
moslems refused to accept aouns appointment and pledged loyalty 
to hoss who served as prime minister in the gemayel administration

opposition leaders agreed saturday to 
seek the resignation of president roh taewoo in a referendum on his 
performance the government promised to hold in april 
leaders of south koreas three rival opposition parties kim 
daejung kim youngsam and kim jongpil issued a joint declaration 
after narrowing differences on key political issues 
the three agreed on a common approach to the referendum roh had 
promised in december 1987 just before he won presidential elections 
the declaration issued saturday urged roh to hold a promised 
referendum after bringing about sizable results in redressing 
corruption and power abuses left over from his predecessor chun 
doohwan 
otherwise we will launch a noconfidence campaign to push for 
rohs resignation it said 
the three kims accused roh of insincerity in introducing reforms 
the opposition agreement came as the government began preparing 
for the referendum aimed at seeking an early settlement of thorny 
political issues without damaging its credibility 
senior government leaders agreed saturday to hold the referendum 
in early april but they suggested that in the referendum voters 
should assess the administrations handling of specific issues 
rather than its overall performance 
the government party lacks broad public support but party 
leaders have said roh is confident of victory in a referendum 
despite broad reforms roh has introduced since taking office in 
february opponents have staged protests demanding his ouster 
recent surveys show many south koreans believe the government 
failed to take firm action to deal with past government abuses 
dissidents and radical students identify roh with chuns 
authoritarian government 
roh has asked the nation to pardon chun since the former 
president went into rural exile last november after making an open 
apology for misdeeds during his sevenyear administration 
in saturdays meeting government leaders reaffirmed their 
rejection of an opposition demand that chun be made to testify 
before the oppositioncontrolled national assembly on human rights 
violations and other abuses

a schoolteacher in town for a seminar became 
entangled in a controversy over the use of an american flag in an 
art exhibit saturday when she was arrested for walking on the stars 
and stripes 
susan willhofft 40 of arlington va was charged with 
desecrating the flag a felony in the first such arrest resulting 
from the exhibit at the school of the art institute of chicago 
the arrest came as two dozen critics of the exhibit picketed the 
art school and a state senator picked the flag up removing it from 
the work for the second day in a row 
willhoffts attorney acknowledged that she stepped on the flag 
but said she had no criminal or political motive 
attorney david e steinberg said the charge constituted 
harassment by the man who filed the complaint homer choate 47 
of suburban lockport who opposes the work 
and i would think the states attorneys office would have 
something better to do than prosecute an innocent tourist 
steinberg added 
at issue is a work by art student scott tyler titled what is 
the proper way to display a us flag which is part of a minority 
students exhibit 
the work features a montage of photographs depicting flagdraped 
coffins and south koreans burning the american flag plus a book 
that invites viewer comments 
a us flag is positioned on the floor in front of the book in 
such a way that viewers are likely to step on the flag to write in 
the book 
the exhibit was closed to the public last weekend after veterans 
groups complained it was illegal and disrespectful to the flag and 
sued to try to force the school to remove it from the floor 
following a circuit judges ruling thursday the show reopened 
on friday state sen walter dudycz was detained briefly by 
officers after he picked the flag up from the floor 
he did it again on saturday and asked the cook county states 
attorneys office to decide whether the exhibit violates laws 
against desecrating the flag the flag was put back in the exhibit 
willhofft who teaches grades 68 was attending a conference of 
the national association of independent schools said another of her 
attorneys lawrence s schaner 
she had a free day she was going to have lunch she was going 
to shop at marshall field schaner said she had no intention of 
making a political protest she just went to see the famous art 
institute of chicago 
she stepped on the flag he said she wanted to see what 
was in the book

the fractious greens party on 
saturday elected a slate of new leaders to replace radicals ousted 
from power last year and one of its most famous radicals announced 
she is quitting the party 
the greens who have been trying to heal ideological rifts among 
opposing factions elected three new top leaders who represent a 
broad section of party interests 
the 39000member party sprang from radical environmentalist and 
leftist peace movements in the 1970s 
the last party leadership was dominated by radicals including 
jutta ditfurth who stunned the party congress in duisburg by 
announcing before the vote she plans to quit the party she bitterly 
denounced moderates who want to put the greens on a new political 
course 
ms ditfurth charged the party was practicing policies of 
exclusion against the left and was adapting a traditional 
political structure 
the greens new leaders are ruth hammerbacher from the partys 
moderate realos realists faction verena krieger who 
represents interests further to the left and ralf fuecks whose 
views fall between those of his two colleagues none of the former 
leaders ran for reelection 
ms ditfurth is head of the fundis fundamentalists who are 
locked in a bitter ideological struggle with the realos 
the dispute centers on the pragmatists willingness to work 
within established political procedures and the fundamentalists 
insistence that the party steer clear of wooing the mainstream 
parties 
in her speech ms ditfurth said the party had been compromising 
too many of its principles 
the goal of this is apparently the formation of a government 
with the social democrats ms ditfurth said 
the social democrats are west germanys main opposition party 
and will be going up against chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democrats in next years federal elections 
polls indicate the christian democrats have lost support over the 
last few months opening the possibility the party might not be able 
to put together a parliamentary majority after federal elections 
ms ditfurth said she will probably leave the greens following 
the 1990 elections 
she also denounced the alternative list al the greens west 
berlin sister party for its plans to join a coalition government in 
that city saying it had abandoned principles it had shared with the 
greens for years 
the christian democrats were ousted from power in west berlin 
elections last month and the victorious social democrats are now 
negotiating with the alternative list about forming a new government

most americans believe the senate should 
reject the nomination of john tower as defense secretary according 
to a poll published in sunday editions of the los angeles times 
the nationwide telephone poll of 1046 adults conducted as the 
senate debate on tower began last week also shows that most people 
dismiss the argument that a president should be able to appoint 
anybody he chooses to a cabinet post 
the poll which was done wednesday and thursday found that 44 
percent of those interviewed believe that tower should be rejected 
by the senate while 35 percent believe he should be confirmed the 
remaining 21 percent were unsure 
the poll also found that 82 percent of those surveyed rejected 
assertions by the bush administration and republican leaders that 
the president should be given a free hand to pick whoever he 
chooses for his cabinet 
the poll indicates that people are less concerned about towers 
alleged heavy drinking and womanizing than about his impartiality in 
dealing with defense contractors because of his prior work as a 
defense consultant 
however 64 percent of those surveyed said they did not believe 
tower would abide by his pledge to forsake all liquor during the 
duration of his service as secretary of defense 
the poll showed that president george bush continued to enjoy a 
relatively high job rating 59 percent approval to 13 percent 
disapproval 
while 61 percent said that bushs nomination of tower had not 
influenced their overall impression of the president 29 percent 
said that the appointment had caused their opinions of bush to fall 
the poll found that 44 percent disapproved of the tower 
nomination and 38 percent werent sure while just 18 percent 
approved of president bushs nomination 
the times poll directed by ia lewis had a margin of error of 
4 percentage points in either direction

defense secretarydesignate john tower has 
moved out front in the bush administration effort to salvage his 
nomination pleading the case publicly and setting the stage for a 
possible lastditch stand on the senate floor 
a white house official insisted saturday the effort is not a lost 
cause 
weve still got some good prospects among democrats who 
would be needed to provide a majority vote in towers favor said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
we could still pull it out the official said i admit its 
very tough 
tower in comments published in sunday editions of the washington 
post said the senate would be damning the presidents judgment 
if it rejects his nomination and said he will not withdraw unless 
requested to do so by the president 
the important thing is a majority of the senate is going to 
subordinate the presidents judgment to its own in the selection of 
people that the president feels he can rely on tower said in the 
interview with a small group of reporters 
tower who has pledged to abstain from alcoholic beverages if he 
becomes defense secretary reiterated his contention that he does 
not have a drinking problem but said he has not stopped drinking 
entirely 
i still have a glass of wine in the evening with dinner 
although its not on a daily basis he said 
as the number of democrats on record against the nomination grew 
senate minority leader bob dole raised the prospect of bringing 
tower to the senate floor to answer allegations against him 
the request would be that john tower be allowed to come to this 
chamber to stand in this well and to answer his critics 
facetoface chargebycharge rumorbyrumor and factbyfact 
the kansas republican said friday 
dole did not formally ask permission for tower once a senator 
himself to speak from the floor but said he was considering 
introducing such a motion 
if we owe senator tower anything we owe him the right to say 
ive had my day in court dole said 
senate majority leader george mitchell said he would be happy 
to consider any request by the minority leader but gave no 
indication on how the proposal would fare 
if tower came to the floor to answer questions it would be the 
first such instance for a cabinet nominee and only the sixth time in 
senate history for a nonmember to be questioned 
on three occasions in the 1800s newspaper reporters were called 
before the senate to answer questions about where they obtained 
leaked information from closed senate proceedings which appeared in 
their stories 
in 1933 the senate sergeant at arms was called before the 
chamber to answer questions about an article he had published 
alleging that senators were selling their votes and in 1934 three 
airline officials were called to answer questions about government 
contracting with airmail carriers 
in the meantime tower planned to appear on a major network 
interview show cbstvs face the nation the national 
television appearance follows a week in which the embattled nominee 
pledged to abstain from alcohol if confirmed and lashed out at the 
doublestandard that existed in the senate all attempts to help 
his faltering cause 
the need for lastditch efforts came in the wake of president 
bushs inability to convince a single democrat to support the 
nominee the administration conducted two days of intensive lobbying 
with the president holding oneonone oval office sessions with 
swing democrats and vice president dan quayle courting senators on 
capitol hill 
quayle on a weekend ski trip to new hampshire said saturday 
that once senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga 
came out against the nomination we knew that it would be an 
uphill battle 
this nomination hinges really on one individual in the senate 
and that is the chairman of the senate armed services committee 
quayle said once he decided to go against the president we knew 
that it was going to be difficult 
the numbers against the nomination continued to rise on friday 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said the nation cannot take a 
chance with tower 
deconcini who met privately at the white house with bush earlier 
this week and had hinted he might support the nominee said tower 
is not the proper person for this sensitive position in these 
critical times 
an associated press survey of senators showed 47 democrats and 
sen larry pressler rsd either solidly against the nomination 
or leaning against and 40 republicans either solidly committed or 
leaning toward confirmation the democrats hold a 5545 majority in 
the senate 
on friday republican senators phil gramm of texas and trent lott 
of mississippi huddled on the senate floor over a major 
administration concern pressler 
among the other senators republicans hope to convince is 
conservative democrat joseph lieberman of connecticut 
jim kennedy an aide to lieberman said the senator planned to 
take the weekend to get away from the washington distraction and 
give it serious consideration in private

a federal judge reserved judgment saturday on 
whether to block sympathy strikes by railroad workers ready to honor 
eastern airlines machinists picket lines the metropolitan 
transportation authority said 
us district judge robert patterson told lawyers for the new 
york area commuter rail lines and the striking machinists at 930 
pm that he would not make a decision saturday said mta spokesman 
john cunningham 
the judge advised the lawyers to be prepared to come back 
tomorrow sometime after 10 am to possibly answer further 
questions he said 
cunningham said it was unclear if the lawyers would be summoned 
to meet with patterson on sunday but said mta lawyers were prepared 
to meet with him 
the mta parent company of the long island rail road and the 
metronorth commuter railroad joined by new jersey transit asked 
patterson earlier saturday to issue a temporary restraining order 
against the threatened sympathy strike cunningham said 
union mechanics and baggage handlers on strike against eastern 
airlines have said they plan to mount secondary picket lines at 
commuter railroads on monday morning particularly in the northeast 
in philadelphia officials of the southeastern pennsylvania 
transportation authority have already obtained a court order aimed 
at preventing a sympathy strike septa officials said the authority 
hoped its court order issued friday night would keep railroad 
union workers on the job even if the machinists union sets up 
pickets monday 
according to the complaint filed friday septa maintained that 
under their contract its nine railroad unions and their 1000 
members can honor picket lines set up by other unions only if those 
unions have contracts with septa 
in boston the massachusetts bay transportation authority said it 
was taking steps to assign extra buses monday morning to help move 
commuters in case of a strike amtrak which operates the rail 
system on behalf of the mbta had no immediate plans to seek a court 
order to stop the expected walkout a spokeswoman in washington 
said about 25000 people travel by mbta commuter railways on a 
typical workday 
in their request for an injunction the new york area transit 
systems made an argument similar to septas saying the employees 
are contractually obligated to work and thus must cross any picket 
line established by the international association of machinists 
said simon gourdine director of labor relations at the mta 
union leaders at the metropolitanarea rail lines had said they 
would honor the picket lines and bring to a halt the trains that 
carry some 320000 commuters into manhattan each weekday 
ed yule general chairman of the united transportation union for 
the lirr the nations largest commuter railroad said he could not 
immediately say how he would advise his workers if patterson issued 
a restraining order 
its a union leaders dilemma he said 
should the strike go on mta chairman robert kiley predicted 
absolute chaos even though officials made plans for such things 
as extra buses and traffic control people to try to handle the crush 
of commuters 
no transit job actions were reported saturday 
the lirr has about 135000 daily riders metronorth carries 
95000 people from the northern suburbs and nj transit carries about 
90000 the port authoritytransit hudson line or path which 
carries commuters from northern new jersey into new york city did 
not take part in the request for the injunction officials said

about 500 protesters jeered at up to 100 
neonazi skinheads attending a white supremacist rally that had been 
billed as an aryan woodstock and some demonstrators scuffled 
with a ku klux klansman 
about 200 police some in riot gear kept the demonstrators in a 
soggy field about a mile from the whitesonly gathering in napa 
county about 40 miles northeast of san francisco 
as a cold rain fell protesters yelled nazis go home and 
other taunts and wielded placards with such messages as my family 
died because of facism 
the protesters became enraged when a man who identified himself 
as bill albers of the modesto chapter of the klan tried to walk 
through the crowd albers and some of the demonstrators scuffled 
gravel and sticks flew until law enforcement officers using 
nightsticks brought the crowd under control 
no arrests or injuries were reported earlier but william 
herrell 88 of san jose was slightly injured earlier when he was 
dragged across a barbedwire fence by demonstrators when he tried 
unsuccessfully to enter the rally 
asked about the skinheads herrell said i think theyre 
wonderful people 
i dont want to destroy other races i just want to keep them 
separate bob spittler a member of the aryan national socialists 
said as the rally began friday night 
among the protesters saturday was irv rubin of los angeles 
national chairman of the jewish defense league 
people of good will cannot ignore this rubin said no 
matter how small their number there has to be a statement against 
their ideology this is a battle of humanity versus the forces of 
evil if we dont expose it its kind of like letting a cancer 
grow on the body politic 
organizer tom metzger a former klan leader who heads a group 
called white aryan resistance had estimated that 2000 people would 
attend but law enforcement officials estimated attendance at 30 to 
100 
associated press photographer pete leabo who flew over the rally 
site in a helicopter said he saw about 20 skinheads many of them 
under a tarp 
nazi flags decorated the rally leabo said 
the event was initially billed as an aryan woodstock because 
organizers had hoped to present performances by the skinhead bands 
midtown boot boys from oklahoma the hammerheads from wisconsin and 
hakenkreuz from detroit 
however napa county superior judge w scott snowden ruled that a 
permit was needed for the musical portion of the event snowden 
rejected the countys argument that the assembly would be a public 
nuisance 
metzger who had argued a permit was not needed because the 
concert was to be held on private property and admission was by 
invitation only decided to go ahead with the political portion of 
the rally 
officials closed nearby state highway 12 at interstate 80 in 
fairfield and a road near highway 29 to head off trouble 
the scene was tense as demonstrators leaned over barbedwire 
fences screaming at a handful of skinheads watching them from atop 
a nearby hill at one point about six skinheads who tried to get 
into the rally got caught between police lines and protesters 
yelling insults 
the white power rally was held on land owned by dr howard c 
lonsdale of nearby vallejo lonsdale fled nazi germany in 1937 with 
his jewish family when he was 4 years old family friend leo coon 
told the sacramento bee 
lonsdale a prominent 55yearold specialist had been told the 
gathering was to be an environmental rally but did not back out when 
he learned its true nature because he feared reprisals said coon 
acting as lonsdales spokesman 
would you like your house pushed over the hill thats why he 
hasnt spoken out against them said coon 
he was told by the group that if he canceled out of this lease 
theyd sue him theyd ruin his practice coon added

a jewish group met with gen andres 
rodriguez on friday and said the military ruler promised to find two 
nazi war criminals believed living in this country 
rabbi martin m rosenthal director of bnai brith 
antidefamation leagues department of latin american affairs said 
rodriguez pledged to investigate locate detain and expel the 
two war criminals 
he said he would not identify the men for fear they would be 
alerted to the search and flee to avoid capture 
he reiterated that paraguay will not be a ship for pirates or a 
cave for thieves and said they would rid the country of garbage 
such as nazi war criminals rosenthal said after a 25minute 
meeting with rodriguez 
rodriguez who seized power in the feb 3 coup that unseated 
president gen alfredo stroessner made no public comment following 
the meeting 
rosenthal noted that rodriguez pledge of assistance contrasted 
sharply with the cold reception given to such requests by the 
stroessner regime in 1984 the newspaper of the ruling colorado 
party mocked the efforts of nazi hunter beate klarsfeld to locate 
josef mengele 
under the 197683 military government in argentina requests for 
information or arrest of alleged nazi war criminals were ignored 
but since civilian president raul alfonsin took office three have 
been arrested rosenthal said

participate in may 1 national elections even if some of its 
electoral demands are denied laino after meeting rodriguez told 
reporters that the response to some of the terms of this package 
can be positive and others negative and that does not mean we will 
refuse to participate 
we know we cannot reach the perfection of democracy overnight 
but we do want some reasonable conditions under which we can 
participate he said we only want these elections to be an 
improvement over the past 
during the nearly 35year military stroessner dictatorship 
several opposition parties refused to participate in elections 
claiming they were fraudulent 
the national accord alliance of three opposition parties has 
asked rodriguez to delay elections until at least sept 1 to give 
them time to register supporters and organize campaigns they also 
hope to eliminate a statute that allots twothirds of the seats in 
congress to the party that wins a majority of votes 
the colorado party in power since 1947 is widely expected to 
dominate the elections rodriguez is the partys presidential 
candidate

gramm has said that he does not use the property for hunting but 
that he does feed ducks occasionally dunkle at the time said gramm 
asked him to keep him advised if people broke the law on his 
property

distributing cocacine according to w douglas gow an fbi spokesman 
lewis will be arraigned on the caribbean island the fbi 
officials said 
lewis 48 is a central figure in the investigations of barry 
the two men are friends 
after lewis arrest barrys office issued a statement saying 
barry was surprised 
to my knowledge he charles lewis has never been arrested or 
involved with any illegal activities barry said i would be 
shocked if these allegations about him turn out to be true 
barry said he was also aware that lewis arrest would also 
raise the specter that something illegal happened when barry 
visited lewis at a downtown hotel dec 22 i want to repeat again 
that i never saw any drugs or drug paraphernalia during my visits 
with lewis 
lewis was the target of a police investigation in december when a 
maid at the washington hotel alleged that he offered her drugs in 
exchange for sex two district police officers were at the hotel 
attempting to buy drugs from lewis but the drug buy was called off 
when the officers realized that barry was visiting lewis 
a federal grand jury is now looking at the circumstances 
surrounding barrys visit to the hotel 
a second investigation involving both lewis and barry focuses on 
the citys joint personnel project with the virgin islands 
lewis was in the charge of the project but was fired last april 
when officials in st thomas became concerned about cost overruns 
barry and other top district officials ran up hotel and restaurant 
bills of more than 37000 in connection with the project

two men in custody friday in the 
1981 kidnapping and killing of an 11yearold girl were linked to 
the crime by a third man who confessed in a letter mailed after his 
death police said 
christine anderson was last seen getting into a car on aug 31 
1981 her disappearance set off a widespread search in the fort 
lauderdale area but no trace of her was found until her body was 
found in a field six months later 
police had been unable to come up with any clues in the case 
since then 
on dec 16 a man named frank maxwell died in an automobile 
accident in texas and his brother complied with his request to mail 
a sealed letter to fort lauderdale police 
the letter confessed to maxwells involvement in christines 
disappearance and death and linked two other men to the case 
police said 
i would imagine throughout the years maxwells conscience was 
bothering him said sgt tom carney of the broward county 
sheriffs homicide unit 
gilbert anthony hall 26 of oakland park was arrested on monday 
and is being held in the broward county jail anthony rodriguez 29 
was arrested on thursday in kinnelon nj police said they were 
charged with kidnapping and firstdegree murder 
there was no inkling at all that these people had anything to 
do with christines death said fort lauderdale police spokesman 
ott cefkin 
maxwells letter said hall picked up christine and took her to 
his mobile home where she was sedated and apparently raped numerous 
times according to a court document 
questioned by detectives hall admitted to picking up the girl 
taking her to the trailer where he lived with maxwell and rodriguez 
to have sex with her but said rodriguez and maxwell killed her 
sheriffs spokesman al gordon said 
hall said that he gave christine several drinks and that maxwell 
gave her pills the arrest warrant says the letter said the girl 
was suffocated and her body was dumped 
the letter was given to police in january but they would not 
release its contents on thursday 
christines mother karen green said she has continued to think 
about her daughter but tried to live a normal life 
i wondered always about the details and how many people were 
involved she said i think knowing will help a little bit it 
will help to know that two others the suspects will be sweating it 
out

investors soon may be offered the chance to buy 
into the bush administrations savings and loan bailout plan but 
will the 50 billion in bonds proposed to fund the program be a wise 
investment 
its a fairly secure security said carol a stone a senior 
economist at nomura securities international inc she said she 
thinks the bonds will be attractive to investors 
but bruce lakefield an executive vice president at shearson 
lehman government securities inc was more skeptical 
i dont think enough information is out in the marketplace at 
the present time to get a good feel he said last week we 
havent gone through congress were just speculating on the way it 
was presented along the way 
the bush plan envisions another new government agency the 
resolution funding corp or refco to be set up to float the 50 
billion in 30year bonds over three years proceeds from the 
securities would be added to other government monies to rescue or 
close ailing thrifts which make up about a third of the nations 
3100 sampls 
the principal on the bonds would be repaid through increased 
insurance premiums paid by the sampl industry most of the interest 
payments on the bonds are expected to come from taxpayer money 
its expected that refco would buy zerocoupon treasury bonds in 
the open market to collateralize the 50 billion debt 
analysts said theres no doubt the refco bonds will be safe but 
how attractive their yields will be remains to be seen 
theyre intangibles that are very difficult to quantify at this 
point said william brachfeld an executive vice president of 
daiwa securities inc 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady told congress last month 
that he expeced the refco bonds to be traded at a premium of about a 
quarter of a percentage point over 30year treasury bonds which are 
now yielding around 915 percent 
but lakefield said he expected the premium to be slightly higher 
as is the case with other agency bonds he noted that a bond the 
government issues to back military loans to israel is about a third 
of a percentage point over comparable treasuries 
government agencies have been issuing bonds over the years to 
finance anything from farm loans to home mortgages although theyre 
backed by the us government they are not considered direct 
obligations and thats why their yields are slightly higher than 
treasuries 
ms stone said the refco bonds would appeal to almost anybody 
who is interested in a longterm investmentsuch as retirees 
pension funds and life insurance companies 
lakefield predicted the market would easily absorb them despite 
the large volume 
the marketplace is a big international marketplace he said 
under bushs plan 10 billion of the bonds would be sold in 
fiscal 1989 25 billion in fiscal 1990 and 15 billion in fiscal 
1991

the copper bulls are at it again buying up copper futures 
driving up prices and talking up the possibility of new record highs 
in a market that is proving to be as resilient as it is volatile 
some of the recent developments supporting the current rally 
such as labor strife in peru and shipping problems in zaire are 
familiar to those who have followed copper on its mostly upward 
course during the past two years 
other factors the fear of aids in africa for example have 
not been widely cited before 
but underpinning the gains are the same basic circumstances that 
prompted coppers runup from around 65 cents a pound in the spring 
of 1987 to the record high of 16475 a pound set last dec 8 on new 
yorks commodity exchange strong demand and tight supplies 
the supply tightness appeared to be easing earlier this year 
following the settlement in middecember of a 57day miners strike 
in peru the worlds sixthlargest copper producer 
a subsequent increase in supplies of copper deliverable against 
commodity exchange contracts contributed to a selloff that dropped 
the price of spot copper on the exchange to 1257 a pound by 
valentines day 
but world demand for copper remained strong a function of the 
economic growth of industrialized nations then shipping 
difficulties resurfaced in zambia and zaire respectively the 
worlds fourth and seventhlargest copper producers sparking new 
waves of speculative buying 
the rally continued in the past week on fears of another extended 
strike in peru after miners there called for a 3day work stoppage 
beginning march 26 to protest managements failure to comply with 
the terms of the december agreement 
copper for spot delivery on the commodity exchange jumped 56 
cents friday amid persistent supply concerns to 153 a pound 
fred demler metals economist with drexel burnham lambert inc 
said the copper market looks strong on all fronts 
the consumption numbers show very strong growth the 
fundamentals look good the technical signals look good physical 
stocks are low its beginning to look like a replay of 1987 and 
1988 he said 
the shortage of copper was underscored by the small amount of 
copper available for delivery against the commodity exchange 
contract due to expire on march 29 
as of the beginning of trading on friday exchange inventories of 
deliverable copper totaled 17446 tons open interest in the march 
contract the number of contracts still to be settled by either an 
offsetting trade or physical delivery was 9427 contracts the 
equivalent of 117838 tons 
the vast majority of futures contracts are settled by offsetting 
trades not physical delivery but analysts say the unusually wide 
imbalance is one indication of extreme supply tightness 
the united states and canada produce nearly 30 percent of the 
worlds refined copper but much of the remainder comes from third 
world countries where political upheavals labor disputes terrorist 
bombings crumbling transportation systems and equipment 
malfunctions occasionally disrupt mining and refinery operations 
the frequency of such interruptions seems to have increased along 
with the demand for and price of copper during the past year major 
disruptions occurred in peru chile zambia and zaire all major 
copper producers 
market analyst george anagnos of thomson mckinnon securities inc 
in new york contends african production also has been hampered by 
the flight of mining engineers from the continent due to fear of 
aids 
the deadly disease has spread rapidly in some part of africa 
concerns over the disease are particularly prevalent among the 
europeans primarily belgian engineers who have been hired to 
operate the mines in zaire anagnos wrote in a recent report 
the decision by many of the engineers to leave the nation has 
exacerbated prevailing diplomatic problems between belgium and zaire 
formerly a belgian colony and resulted in supply losses 
the aids angle may seem trivial but it doesnt take much to move 
a market made nervous by supply tightness 
given the right conditions you could see new highs said 
craig sloane an analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham 
amp co a lot of things are possible in a market like this

for every man woman and child in america there 
are 15 square feet of retail space in shopping centers and malls 
count the area in neighborhood stores and the figure becomes even 
bigger 
the relentless development of new shopping sites probably will 
ease as the babyboom bulge of the us population grows older but 
it still continues 
too many of the stores springing up are the same lacking the 
flare theyd need to stand out in an overpopulated retail landscape 
analysts say and not enough stores that supply doityourself 
household gear or cater to the needs of older people are being 
built contrary to what demographic trends indicate are needed they 
note 
karen sack a retailing analyst with standard amp poors corp 
says the nations big retailers went on an expansion binge in the 
1960s and 70s boosting growth by opening more and more stores 
growth no longer works as a way of winning market share says 
sack who came up with the us per capita estimate of retail space 
using figures from the international council of shopping centers 
price is the highest priority for many consumers when choosing 
where to shop service also is important but probably less so 
the success of discounters that are threatening to topple sears 
roebuck and co from the head of the retail league table such as k 
mart corp and walmart stores inc illustrates the significance 
consumers attach to finding what they feel are fair prices 
periodic markdowns even drastic ones arent a guarantee of 
gaining a faithful customer following either 
sales dont work anymore sack says nobody pays full price 
for things anymore and a lot of stores have lost credibility by 
announcing sales and then not having the goods available so they 
have to give rain checks 
promising a sale that never ends sears opened its doors on a 
new lowprice policy this past week 
advertising on television radio and in newspapers dramatized the 
unprecedented shift in strategy by the retailer which now is in its 
second century of operation 
the retailing giant shut down all of its stores across the 
country for 42 hours to mobilize thousands of workers to slash price 
tags on 50000 items 
when the more than 800 sears roebuck stores across the country 
reopened at noon wednesday customers flocked in to see for 
themselves what the hoopla was about as human nature would have it 
some were thrilled by the bargains others werent 
sears hopes to keep them coming back by pursuing an everyday 
low prices policy it has vowed to meet competitors prices if 
customers bring in another stores advertisement with a lower price 
than sears has on an identical item sears will match it 
supervisors have been ordered to shop at rival retailers to 
determine what they are charging 
it wont be clear for months whether sears ideas for maintaining 
its preeminent position in the retail industry is working 
shoppers even more costconscious now that interest rates are on 
the rise will cast the deciding vote 
the consumer is very smart says sack theyll decide 
whether they really feel if theyre getting good value 
in other business this past week 
morton thiokol inc manufacturer of the solid rocket motors for 
the challenger space shuttle which exploded after liftoff jan 28 
1986 killing seven astronauts announced a major realignment its 
thriving specialty chemicals business including the morton salt 
business will be spun off from its troubled aerospace operation 
rjr nabisco inc snuffed out its smokeless cigarette after

shelves ending fivemonth trials in test markets the premier brand

terrible 
a series of reports suggested the economy remains strong but

it has been a long wait for wall streeters 
looking for signs of a muchpredicted slowdown in the economy 
the script written by most bulls on the stock market for 1989 
called for business activity to cool off allowing interest rates to 
top out and turn downward 
that in turn would ease the competitive pressure on the stock 
market that comes from virtually riskless moneymarket securities 
such as treasury bills yielding close to 9 percent 
but approaching the end of the first quarter of the year there 
is little evidence at hand that the economy is yielding to 
credittightening by the federal reserve 
on friday for example the commerce department reported that the 
index of leading economic indicators rose 06 percent in january 
after posting a 07 percent increase the month before 
if a slackening of growth is in the offing it hasnt shown up 
yet in that statistical earlywarning system 
but many adherents to the slowdown view still insist the 
picture is likely to change before long 
we will soon see softer economic numbers and a peaking of 
rates declares john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc 
there is a myth that the federal reserve has not been tough 
enough two years ago the prime rate was resting at 7 percent now 
it is 11 percent thats 400 basis points or an increase of over 
50 percent 
there should be little doubt that a doubledigit prime coupled 
with doubledigit mortgage rates will be reflected in economic 
activity 
maury harris economist at painewebber said the fed stepped up 
its credittightening in november after it concluded that growth had 
been restrained to some extent but not enough to satisfy the 
central banks inflationfighting goals 
given lags between changes in monetary policy and the ultimate 
effects on the economy it was too soon to expect the recent crop of 
january economic statistics to show very much effect from the 
tightening since november harris stated 
however because tightening worked last year it should do so 
again 
hopes on that score helped the stock market achieve some grudging 
gains in the past week recouping some of the previous weeks steep 
losses 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2875 to 227429 
rebounding from a 7928point drop the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 218 to 
16390 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 403 to 40399 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 473 at 32622 
volume on the big board averaged 15566 million shares a day 
against 15403 million in the preceding week 
some observers of course worry not that the fed has been too 
cautious but that it has gone too far setting the economy on course 
for a recession 
in the view of hugh johnson at first albany corp there are good 
reasons to worry about inflation 
inflation rates are likely to strengthen federal reserve 
policy should remain taut and interest rates may back up further 
johnson said 
by midyear the economy should begin to slow and the rate of 
inflation should begin to recede 
the federal reserve has not tightened enough to cause a 
recession although the risk that they will over the near term 
should be taken seriously

gibraltar financial corp one of 
the nations 10 biggest savings and loan companies revealed friday 
it had agreed with federal regulators to restrict its activities in 
hopes of stemming continued losses 
the company also said it would require a substantial investment 
from outside or a merger to maintain federally required capital 
levels 
the company parent of the 86branch gibraltar savings amp loan 
with assets of 15 billion has been losing money since late 1987 
and recently disclosed it expected 1988 losses to reach 71 million 
to 76 million 
additionally profit in the first quarter of 1989 will be cut by 
a 20 million writeoff from the closing of gibraltar moneycenter 
which makes loans out of state the company said in a news release 
that closure is part of the supervisory agreement with the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp the company said 
the supervisory agreement had been expected since january when 
the company revealed that federal regulators had declared gibraltar 
to be in unsafe and unsound condition that finding was made 
despite the fact gibraltar met federal capital requirements which 
govern how much cash the company must have available to back its 
loans 
the agreement with regulators restricts gibraltar to making home 
loans in california florida and washington state the company said 
a previous agreement to restrict growth remains in effect 
it is evident we will be unable to maintain required capital 
levels without a merger with or major investment by a third party 
james thayer gibraltar chairman president and chief executive 
officer said in a news release any such transaction will require 
significant fslic assistance there is no assurance that we will 
be successful in these efforts 
gibraltar started on its slide with losses on real estate loans 
recently it has been hurt by rising interest rates which force it 
to pay more to attract deposits than it earns in interest on 
fixedrate loans it made in the past

the government released more data pointing to continued strength 
in the economy with reports that its key economic forecasting gauge 
rose sharply in january and that factory orders were strong that 
month except for a fallback in transportation equipment 
but neither report released on friday had a major effect on the 
financial markets 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 858 
to 227429 bond prices were narrowly mixed while the dollar 
declined against most major currencies 
meanwhile the nations big three automakers reported friday that 
car and truck sales fell 179 percent in february compared with the 
same period last year 
usmade cars sold by general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp sold at an average daily rate of 26062 during the 
period this year that compares with an average of 32297 cars sold 
daily during the same period last year sales of light trucks 
averaged 15561 a day in late february compared with a daily rate 
of 18419 during the same time last year 
januarys 06 percent rise in the index of leading economic 
indicators followed a 07 percent increase in december and provided 
fresh evidence that 1989 opened on a strong note despite widespread 
expectations of an impending slowdown 
the index designed to foretell economic activity six to nine 
months into the future was up and down during much of last year 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
januarys rise in the index shows a moderate level of growth which 
we believe is conducive to a healthy economy 
however analysts cautioned that the latest signs of robust 
economic activity could heighten concerns that the economy is 
speeding ahead too quickly to contain inflationary pressures that 
they said could increase the risk of a recession by causing the 
federal reserve to act too aggressively as it pushes up interest 
rates to slow the economy and restrain inflation 
i think there is a risk that well overreact to the data and 
push ourselves into a recession in the latter part of this year or 
in 1990 said economist john hagens of the wefa group a 
forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
a second report friday from the commerce department offered 
additional evidence of strength in the economy 
although orders to us factories for manufactured goods were 
down 13 percent in january the decrease was attributed to a 
fallback in demand for transportation equipment from record levels 
set in december 
excluding transportation factory orders were up 02 percent 
during january and orders in the key category of nondefense 
capital goods considered a good barometer of industry investment 
plans were up 16 percent in january
