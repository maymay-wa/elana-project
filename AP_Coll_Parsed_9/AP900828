a research team has tracked down and isolated 
the chemical basis for that olfactory offense known in crowded 
elevators and packed buses as body odor 
george preti a scientist at the monell chemical senses center 
in philadelphia said he and his laboratory team for the first time 
have identified the natural chemical that gives aromatic fame to 
sweaty underarms 
the chemical preti announced monday at a meeting of the 
american chemical society is 3methyl2hexenoic acid 
researchers at monell isolated the compound after collecting 
sweat from the underarms of a group of male volunteers who wore 
pads for 24 hours to absorb the stuff preti said the compounds on 
the pads then were chemically analyzed 
there were three dozen compounds isolated that can be 
odoriferous he said we picked this one because it seemed to 
have the most odor based on seven noses in the laboratory 
the compound was then synthesized and vials of the chemical were 
left on a bulletin board for the entertainment of passing noses 
most people agreed he said that 3methyl2hexenoic acid was the 
genuine article pure eau de locker room 
further testing said preti showed that the compound has some 
strange properties 
some people about 5 percent of the population he said cannot 
even detect the odor others say it offends but only faintly 
but to people with sensitive noses such as preti 
3methyl2hexenoic acid is the odor equivalent of a lightning bolt 
striking 20 feet away followed immediately by thunder 
he waved a closed test tube of the compound through the air 
made a face and noted i can smell it even when its covered 
preti said the chemistry that results in body odor starts with 
secretions from a gland called the apocrine this gland is most 
common in the armpit but is also present in the groin and in the 
breast 
its only known purpose is apparently to create scent said 
preti 
two types of skin bacteria that live in the armpit feast on the 
apocrine secretions and then give out several dozen compounds one 
of them is 3methyl2hexenoic acid 
preti said studies by dermatologists show that a microorganism 
called lipophilic diphtheroids produces the strongest and most 
pungent odor 
about 90 percent of all men have this bacteria in their armpits 
but it is present in only about 67 percent of women he said and 
women he said produce a milder underarm odor 
knowing what causes underarm body odor eventually may lead to 
new products to help people avoid social offense 
preti said fragrance manufacturers are interested in obtaining 
the 3methyl2hexenoic formula so they will have a model or 
actual chemical example of what causes body odor using the model 
the companies can test new chemical formulas for deodorant 
ingredients that more effectively block the natural aroma of 
underarm sweat he said 
for those with sensitive noses said preti help is on the way

supreme court nominee david h souter cannot 
be confirmed by the oct 1 start of the courts 199091 term even 
if he sails through his senate confirmation hearings sources say 
that means the high court will start a new term one justice shy 
for just the third time in the last 20 years 
its a matter of timing said a senate judiciary committee 
aide who requested anonymity the aide added the earliest committee 
vote on souters nomination would be sept 27 two weeks after the 
sept 13 start of his confirmation hearings 
if all goes smoothly for the federal appeals court judge from 
new hampshire his nomination likely will reach the full senate the 
week of oct 1 or oct 8 
diana huffman the committees staff director rebuffed 
questions about the timing of any committee vote im just not 
going to speculate on it at all she said 
but other committee aides both democrats and republicans said 
no committee vote on souter is likely before sept 27 even if his 
hearings before the judiciary committee last only three days 
president bush nominated souter to replace justice william j 
brennan 84 who retired in july for health reasons 
at the supreme court plans for a sept 25 swearingin ceremony 
for souter have been quietly shelved 
if souter is confirmed his late arrival would not necessarily 
hamstring the court he would have the option of reading legal 
briefs and listening to tape recordings of oral arguments in the 
cases already heard by the justices 
there are historic precedents 
more than a year passed before justice harry a blackmun joined 
the court in 1970 to fill the vacancy created by abe fortas 
resignation in the interim the senate rejected president nixons 
nominations of clement f haynsworth jr and g harrold carswell 
justice anthony m kennedy did not take his seat until february 
1988 in replacing lewis f powell who had retired the previous 
june the senate had defeated president reagans nomination of 
robert h bork and a second nominee douglas h ginsburg withdrew 
after news reports of his past marijuana use

the war on drugs must not be sidetracked by 
other budget priorities say national drug policy director william 
bennett and top prosecutors from several states 
we cannot be diverted from this bennett said monday after 
meeting with members of the national association of attorneys 
general criminal law committee 
this should not be viewed as a temporary or sixmonth or 
yearlong enthusiasm on the part of the congress bennett said 
they have made the case to their constituents theyve made the 
case to me at i dont know how many hearings that this is an issue 
of fundamental national priority 
he said he will fight for the drug war budgets he has submitted 
and we will keep their attention on this issue whether they want 
to keep attention on it or not 
the house appropriations committee recently cut 231 million 
from bennetts proposed 252 million increase in funding for drug 
treatment and education the money was restored on the house floor 
after bennett blasted the committee in numerous media interviews 
mississippi attorney general mike moore said he believed it was 
realistic to expect the drug war to get more money despite the 
budget crunch 
i dont think we can afford not to said moore chairman of 
the attorneys generals criminal law committee weve got kids 
being shot in schools nowadays we didnt have that when i was 
growing up 
i just had a 13yearold girl beaten to death over crack 
cocaine in my hometown in jackson miss we didnt have that when i 
was growing up yeah i think its a priority and i think its 
saving lives moore said 
massachusetts attorney general james m shannon added this 
has to be a sustained effort if budget problems result in 
inadequate funding then all of this talk about a war against 
drugs for the last year has just been hot air 
bennett and the prosecutors also urged the country not to forget 
about the war on drugs as it focuses on hostilities in the persian 
gulf 
we are here partly to remind you that this effort goes on and 
that this represents something every bit as important as what is 
going on anywhere else in the world bennett said 
it is possible for a great nation to take care of its own kids 
and its own principles in more than one place at one time he 
said 
said pennsylvania attorney general ernest d preate jr we 
can do two things at once we can help our boys overseas and we can 
fight the drug pushers here at home 
the committees recommendations to bennett for the updated drug 
strategy due in early 1991 included 
encouraging increased funding for multijurisdictional task 
forces both those involving federal agents and local forces 
consisting of city county and state officials 
urging states with grand jury charging requirements to enact 
legislation creating state grand juries and encourage spending 
federal funds to create and operate such state grand juries 
using asset forfeiture provisions and civil racketeering 
statutes more often in pursuit of drug traffickers 
bennett said the attorneys general also urged that states be 
required to have comprehensive drug strategies to receive federal 
funds however preate said they did not go that far and only 
encouraged states to develop such plans 
also attending the meeting were attorneys general robert t 
stephan of kansas robert del tufo of new jersey don hanaway of 
wisconsin and robert butterworth of florida

the agriculture department says farm families 
have finally caught up with their city cousins in terms of annual 
income 
as a group farm operator households have entered the us 
mainstream says a report by the departments economic research 
service they no longer have low income relative to nonfarm 
households 
there are lots of reasons for the catchup including a decline 
in farm families over many years outside jobs and other factors 
one of the underpinnings of support in congress for expensive 
farm programs has been the traditional income gap between rural and 
urban people 
back in the 1930s when farm commodity programs were 
initiated average farm family income was about half of that of all 
us families the report said by the late 1950s the share 
was still only about 60 percent 
today however farm household income the total for all family 
members is on a par with nonfarm people 
this challenges the popular view that farm commodity programs 
now assist a relatively disadvantaged group the report said 
some farm families continue to have serious income problems 
it added but the drop in farm numbers and rise in average income 
mean that these problems are not as pervasive as they once were 
the report is in the september issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine overall it said farm poverty rates today are low by 
historical standards and represent a small part of the us poverty 
population 
this contrasts sharply with 195960 the first years for which 
poverty data were calculated when over half of the us farm 
population was poor and one if five poor people lived on a farm 
the report said 
economist ken deavers one of the reports authors said monday 
in a telephone interview that the slide in the nations farm 
population has been an important factor 
as the number of families declined those that were left often 
expanded holdings and boosted production 
in 1950 for example there were about 586 million farms in the 
united states by 1959 those had shrunk to just over 37 million 
today usda estimates there are about 214 million farms 
you couldnt have had the rise in household incomes and have 
had as many people stay in the farm sector as were there 
originally deavers said its a combination of improved 
technology better organization better marketing a whole bunch 
of things 
but one of the important messages has been that the original 
very high rates of poverty among farm households arent there any 
more he said 
offfarm income from jobs has been critical to the 
improvement in farm family incomes over the years deavers and 
colleague tom carlin said in their report nonfarm investments 
also have helped 
one recent study shows that about half of all farm households 
depend primarily on offfarm income for family living the report 
said nine out of 10 of these households operate farms with 
annual sales of less than 40000 
these are small farms whose annual sales of crops and livestock 
total less than 40000 a year generally considered insufficient 
by itself to support a household 
for 45 percent of all us farm operators farming is a second 
job the report said many are machinists manufacturing 
production workers or lawyers first and farmers second 
thus it added a growth in job opportunities has helped boost 
the incomes of farm families perhaps more so than commodity 
programs this is important because only about one in three farms 
participate in commodity programs

last years drop in us milk production 
helped trigger higher prices all along the marketing pipeline says 
an agriculture department report 
the price increase were generated mainly by a declining milk 
supply strong domestic cheese demand and heavy nonfat dry milk 
exports the departments economic research service said monday 
dairy farmers failed to boost 1989 production to a record level 
as feed prices increased and supplies of droughtreduced 1988 
forage were exhausted 
output per cow fell below a year earlier by mid1989 the 
agency said in a preliminary report production declined 
substantially in the large milkproducing regions the great 
lake states and northeast where forage problems were most 
pronounced 
at the same time large export commitments for nonfat dry milk 
along with strong domestic demand and low commercial cheese 
inventories made the dairy industry vulnerable to declines in milk 
production 
retail prices of milk and other dairy products as a group 
climbed an average of 66 percent in 1989 compared with a 24 
percent gain in 1988 according to usda figures 
milk production last year dropped about 1 percent to 1443 
billion pounds from the record level of 1452 billion pounds in 
1988 
this year according to recent agency projections milk 
production may climb to another record level of around 1477 
billion pounds and could go to 1496 billion pounds in 1991

day after day in baking afternoon heat 
and by the light of cooking fires refugees from kuwait and iraq 
huddle miserably in national groups at this chaotic border crossing 
at a rate of about 20000 a day they stream across the desert 
from iraq with bulging fiber suitcases and shapeless bundles of 
possessions in most instances the last remains of years of work in 
the occupied oilrich emirate 
this is all said miralam bashir mihmir a bangladeshi 
laborer spreading his hands to take in his cotton shift and 
sandals he abandoned eight years of savings 
like his friends he had little idea how he would get back home 
let alone find work but he had had enough of kuwait 
too much fighting he said 
among a wealthier indian contingent five engineers interrupted 
one another to describe their hardships 
but really concluded one indians probably suffered the 
least 
an estimated 235000 people have crossed at ruweishid since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 less than 100000 have left for their 
homelands 
egyptians are by far the most numerous from destitute clusters 
of hungry families to a lone bachelor in an elegant black 
trenchcoat overseeing a tidy mound of cases and sacks 
but many other countries are represented 
early monday chinese stood in stoic formation their bundles 
slung cooliefashion on wooden poles a van festooned with a 
malaysian flag finally pulled onto the road 
yugoslavs jostled with thais to get close enough to the harried 
immigration officer who stood on a bench in the doorway and droned 
out names like a cattle auctioneer 
a few managed to scramble past the officers legs to get inside 
for attention but no one manned the counters 
officers pawed among towers of passports shouting to be heard 
while puffing cigarettes whose smoke obscured the no smoking 
signs 
like vegetables wailed a distraught indian salesman 
imploring a visiting reporter to alert his embassy they treat 
our passports like vegetables in a market they just let them lie 
there 
uncounted thousands slept among their belongings amid rising 
heaps of garbage 
women struggled to comfort screaming infants 
toilet facilities designed for perhaps 50 visitors a day were 
quickly overwhelmed health workers doused the open ground with 
disinfectant but made only a dent in the stench 
most refugees spend two days on the road from kuwait through 
baghdad at the jordanian border clearance takes anything from a 
few hours to three days and then the odyssey starts again 
egyptians and sudanese go to the red sea port of aqaba to wait 
for a backedup airlift or ferryboat home the others load back 
into groaning buses to drive on to amman 150 miles to the 
southwest 
in amman 35000 people are camped amid squalor at two auto 
exhibition halls others crowd into mosques at one center 5000 
people lie sidebyside on the floor sharing five toilets the 
rest sleep in the open 
jordanian officials reported at least four children have died of 
digestive disorders since the refugee tide began in earnest aug 8 
three adults succumbed to illness at ruweishid 
in the same period three new babies were born 
were not exactly sure of figures said dr ahmed dagens at 
the jordanian red crescent first aid station at the border there 
was such chaos at first we had trouble keeping track 
now said dagens doctors treat refugees for headaches and other 
effects of the heat that hits 110 degrees as well as stomach 
problems from bad food but few serious ailments 
the jordanian army set up a 30bed field hospital to support the 
civilian hospital at ruweishid but neither is full 
two swiss nurses from the international committee of the red 
cross make regular rounds but find little to do most problems 
appear to be psychological rather than medical 
volunteer workers report serious depression among some laborers 
who forced to leave everything behind in kuwait are headed home 
to unemployment and hungry families 
at ruweishid refugees seemed less disturbed by the conditions 
than relieved to be out of iraq 
daniel frieneza decided to go back to quezon city in the 
philippines when an artillery shell blew a hole in his apartment 
last week 
every night theres an exchange of gunfire kuwaitis making 
hitandrun attacks said frieneza an audiovideo technician who 
is now penniless and looking for work 
but he said at least he has something to wear a friend lent 
him a tshirt reading california life is a beach

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee advises against an american attack to liberate kuwait 
arguing that us forces should be committed to a ground war there 
only as a last resort 
it would be a very bloody event and we would lose a lot of 
people even though in the long run i think wed prevail sen 
sam nunn dga said monday in a telephone interview from saudi 
arabia i dont want to see that happen 
nunn part of a senate delegation that met with us commanders 
and soldiers in saudi arabia said economic sanctions already in 
place against iraq should be given a chance to work he said the 
international community should use the embargo to tighten the 
screws on iraq 
i think its important for us to have some patience he 
said its worth having patience to avoid the loss of american 
life 
nunn said iraqi president saddam hussein would be committing 
an act of supreme folly if he attacked saudi arabia now but it 
that happened he said the united states should launch air strikes 
against iraq 
we have an air force in place that could cause tremendous 
damage to iraq nunn said in my opinion there should be no 
sanctuaries if he attacks 
the senate delegation headed by republican leader bob dole of 
kansas had planned the trip to the middle east before iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 dole invited nunn to join the group last weekend 
when saudi arabia was added to the itinerary 
the senators planned to travel to egypt today for a meeting with 
president hosni mubarak nunn said the group would encourage 
mubarak to increase his countrys commitment to the saudi defense 
buildup 
its very important to get heavy forces in there and i think 
the preferable country for that is egypt he said 
while the presence of egyptian heavy forces in saudi arabia 
would be important militarily nunn said it would be even more 
important psychologically for arab forces to be in the forefront of 
the battle against saddam

the national endowment for the arts says 
grants for four avantgarde theater performers were vetoed because 
agency chairman john e frohnmayer decided their work would not 
enhance public understanding and appreciation of the arts 
the four performers karen finley and holly hughes of new york 
and tim miller and john fleck of los angeles who appealed 
frohnmayers decision were told friday that their appeals had been 
denied 
the nea confirmed the action in a statement monday 
when frohnmayer vetoed the four grants on june 29 he refused to 
give any reasons citing a longstanding endowment policy against 
discussing grant rejections the nea statement monday represented 
an unusual departure from that policy in a case that has attracted 
widespread publicity 
public performances by the four each of whom had received nea 
grants in the past involve monologues and other stage routines 
that generally deal with politics racism and sexual oppression and 
frequently include strong sexual content 
the performers have been singled out by conservative members of 
congress as examples of the neas willingness to subsidize works 
that might be offensive 
federal grants for the four performers were approved last spring 
by an nea peer review panel of artists but frohnmayer took the 
rare step of overruling the panels recommendations 
he acted after a majority of the endowments presidentially 
appointed advisory body the national council on the arts urged 
him to veto the four grants because they were not appropriate for 
federal support the nea statement said 
the arts endowment is charged by congress with determining 
among other criteria whether a work will enhance public 
understanding and appreciation of the arts the statement said 
the chairman deciding that these would not accepted the 
councils recommendation 
lawyers for the four rejected grantees announced friday they 
will sue the nea in federal court charging that frohnmayers 
decision was based on political rather than aesthetic grounds and 
that it violated their freespeech rights under the first amendment 
the rutherford institute in charlottesville va a nonprofit 
legal services organization specializing in first amendment and 
religious freedom cases said it will file a lawsuit against the 
arts endowment in us district court in washington on wednesday 
the institute refused to discuss details of its suit in advance 
the nea already is the target of separate federal lawsuits in 
new york and los angeles challenging frohnmayers requirement that 
grant recipients sign an antiobscenity pledge as a condition for 
receiving federal funds

verbal scores on the sat have dropped to their 
lowest level in a decade and a testing official says thats 
because too many students are watching music videos and playing 
video games instead of reading 
combined scholastic aptitude test scores totaled 900 for the 
198990 school year 476 on the math section 424 on the verbal 
the college board reported monday the highest possible score is 
800 on each section for a combined 1600 
math scores were unchanged among the 103 million high school 
students who took the test but the verbal average was down three 
points from the previous school year marking a steady decline 
since the recent peak of 431 in 1986 
verbal scores are now at their lowest point since 1980 and equal 
to the worst levels since national averages were first compiled in 
1971 
students must pay less attention to video games and music 
videos and begin to read more said college board president 
donald m stewart 
reading could become a lost art unless parents and schools 
make it a priority he said in an interview 
each section of the multiplechoice sat is scored on a scale of 
200800 the predominant college entrance exam in 22 states it is 
sponsored by the board and administered by the educational testing 
service in princeton nj 
the annual sat averages have become a widely cited indicator of 
how schools are doing but education experts say it is probably too 
soon for the sats to reveal the progress of widespread school 
reforms enacted in the mid1980s 
most children affected by the reforms are still years away from 
the sat which is usually taken during the junior year of high 
school 
in addition federal programs such as head start and chapter i 
which in the 1960s and 1970s tried to boost achievement among the 
poor and minorities took years to pay off in higher sat scores 
those programs are credited with steady sat gains by virtually 
every minority group most notably last years average scores 
among american indians rose a combined 13 points to 388 verbal and 
437 math 
verbal scores among blacks rose one point to 352 and now stand 
20 points higher than 1976 levels math averages were down one 
point to 385 but are still 31 points better than 1976 scores 
some critics question the ability of a single statistic like the 
sats to summarize accurately the performance of 40 million students 
attending kindergarten through 12th grade in 83000 schools in 
15000 school districts 
the board claims its a good predictor of success in the college 
freshman year but critics such as fairtest in cambridge mass 
insist the sat favors whites males the wealthy and those adept at 
standardized testtaking 
statistics seem to bear out the wealth claim testtakers last 
year from 151485 families earning 70000 or more averaged 468 
verbal 527 math the 41845 testtakers from families earning less 
than 10000 averaged 357 verbal 419 math

diplomacy played out through the media is not 
new whats new is the speed by which it happens live by satellite 
when president bush speaks in kennebunkport maine presumably 
iraqi president saddam hussein is listening 6000 miles away in 
baghdad and vice versa 
diplomacy used to be by cable and now its by satellite 
said steve friedman executive producer of nbcs nightly news 
i think its fraught with danger in terms of televisions 
live incapacity to really interpret some of these events said 
reid collins cnn anchorman in washington 
the problem is that communication is instant reaction is 
instant and everybody needs to just slow down said anchorman 
jim lehrer of the macneillehrer news hour on the public 
broadcasting service 
diplomacy by television was born in the middle east when the 
1967 arabisraeli war divided the principals behind battle lines 
when you are unable to have diplomatic contact the reporter 
is the one who is able to get the message said barbara walters 
who covered the middle east for abc in the 70s 
i would go and interview egyptian president anwar sadat 
then i would have to go to israel by way of cyprus because the two 
countries had no direct links and were technically at war and i 
would talk with prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel she 
said 
i remember the feeling of responsibility and i would think 
how ironic and how sad it was that a reporter was going around 
delivering messages between people who could not speak 
the role of television and the tv journalist as mediator reached 
its high point in 1977 when cbs anchorman walter cronkite 
simultaneously interviewed sadat and israeli prime minister 
menachem begin 
on the neutral ground of television cronkite asked sadat if 
he would visit israel yes sadat would go to israel would sadat 
be welcome in jerusalem cronkite asked yes was the answer 
the next day israels invitation arrived in cairo it was 
cnns collins said the genesis of the camp david accords and 
egyptianisraeli peace 
wire services and newspapers have been doing this for a long 
time probably more than a century said robert macneil 
coanchor of the macneillehrer news hour its just that 
television has speeded it up 
satellite diplomacy was an occasional phenomenon before the 
creation of nightline during the iran hostage crisis said abc 
news vice president richard c wald then it became almost 
institutionalized he said 
american television created a dialogue for south africans in 
their country in a 1985 broadcast wald said a representative of 
the ruling white minority debated with a member of the 
unrepresented black majority 
they were engaging in a debate on the air not facetoface 
but electronically for the first time ever and it was viewed in 
south africa wald said 
tv diplomacy can hinder the understanding of events collins 
said and televisions desire to know the end of the story and to 
summarize events that most often defy summarization can be 
dangerous he said 
if every man and woman in television who did a standup left 
off the last line the world would be much better served collins 
said 
this is not a television show this is a realworld 
confrontation said lehrer 
but wald said satellite diplomacy may function as a safety valve 
clearly you could misspeak but you can misspeak anywhere 
clearly you could give the wrong signal but you could give the 
wrong signal anywhere he said to talk is better than not to 
talk quoting winston churchill jaw jaw is better than war

the government estimates that defaults on 
student loans will cost taxpayers nearly 2 billion this year and

loan defaults a plan for action 
behind the default statistics are students who are either 
unable or unwilling to repay their loans says education

involved in student loans students postsecondary institutions

a perception that tensions have eased in the middle east 
the basic sentiment toward the dollar remains weak said 
toshiaki kamisaka a dealer with mitsui taiyo kobe bank 
kamisaka said the dollars slide was accelerated by a us

a sheriff opposed to warehousing 
prisoners has inmates plowing and fertilizing plots of land for 
gardens tended by the elderly with the harvest going to the jail 
kitchen or to charity 
were just so grateful we have this opportunity to do it 
said elizabeth burke 85 one of the gardeners honored monday at a 
ceremony marking the programs third year 
mrs burke said she had no qualms about taking part in a program 
with prisoners theyve got two eyes and a nose and a mouth just 
like me she said these boys have just gone wrong 
the program was started by hampden county sheriff michael ashe 
whose unorthodox style caused controversy in february when he 
seized a national guard armory in nearby springfield to house 
overflow inmates from the county jail 
the inmates were later moved to an armory in holyoke until a 
new bigger jail is built some of those inmates are among those 
doing the heavy work at the jail farm generally out of sight of 
the senior citizen gardeners 
to ease community objections to the temporary jail in holyoke a 
town of 45000 in western massachusetts inmates have patched 
streets swept gutters and mowed lawns 
when you think of a jail you think of something thats very 
isolated sort of a fortress in the woods ashe told the group of 
29 senior citizens who work a halfacre at the farm about two miles 
from the county jail 
its a joy for us to see you involved ashe said its 
great to have you participate and i know the inmates make comments 
to us that they feel good about their own selfrespect 
fifteen inmates with good records who have almost finished their 
sentences work on eight acres of corn tomatoes and other 
vegetables enough produce to save the county about 30000 a 
year surplus food goes to charity 
on monday the first golden globes from a pumpkin patch planted 
for poor children were showing 
the older gardeners often cooped up indoors said the program 
has given them the kind of space they havent had in years 
i think its tremendous said ed morytko 71 i think its 
a healthful sort of thing not only for the seniors but also for 
the inmates 
morytko who has been in the program for a year admitted that 
at first i didnt know what to expect but a friend who had 
already gardened at the farm told me not to be foolish and 
morytko said hell be back next year 
sandra smith acting director of the agawam senior center said 
the popularity of the farm project has grown i have people on 
the waiting list now that want to come in next year she said 
inmates said they relish the chance to work outdoors rather than

the irish government worked painstakingly 
behind the scenes to persuade iran that hostage brian keenan is a 
citizen of a small country whose only political mission in the 
middle east was one of peace 
but the goverment said it was only after iran decided to improve 
relations with the west that dublins persistence paid off with 
keenans release friday after four years and four months in 
captivity 
irans ambassador to ireland said monday that iran would like 
keenans release followed by freedom for all hostages in lebanon as 
quickly as possible westerners as well as hundreds of palestinians 
and iranians 
we are trying everything we can to do away with the problem 
once and for all ambassador bahram ghassemi said in an interview 
but he said the west must help by pressuring israel to release 
certain prisoners such as sheik abdulkarim obeid an official of 
the moslem extremist group hezbollah captured in south lebanon on 
july 28 1989 
iran has influence in lebanon but we dont dictate 
everything he said if we can have the good will of the west 
it would give a freer hand to us 
he stressed that iran would continue working for the release of 
all hostages on humanitarian grounds without any preconditions but 
western help would speed the process 
ghassemi said iran had responded to repeated requests from the 
irish government and good relations between the two countries 
in seeking help from lebanese groups to free keenan 
ghassemi said iran only opened a dublin embassy in 1983 and he 
arrived in 1986 as his countrys first ambassador since then 
commercial ties mainly meat exports have expanded 10 times and 
relations are at the best possible level now he said 
prime minister charles haughey said persistent skillful 
diplomacy had secured keenans release and pledged that ireland 
would do everything possible to win freedom for other hostages 
still held in beirut 
thirteen westerners are believed held by extremist moslem groups 
in lebanon including six americans four britons two west germans 
and an italian the longestheld hostage associated press 
correspondent terry anderson was abducted march 16 1985 
irish foreign minister gerry collins has said several times that 
there was no deal to secure keenans release 
no money was paid there was no ransom he said 
much of the irish and british news media praised irelands 
successful diplomacy but former cabinet minister conor cruise 
obrien said that far from a gesture of iranian good will keenans 
release was a calculated move intended to increase pressure on 
britain and the united states 
the keenan case was unusual from the start he was born in 
protestantdominated and britishruled northern ireland but 
although a protestant he chose a passport from the overwhelmingly 
roman catholic irish republic a document to which irish people 
from the north are also entitled 
keenan now 39 disappeared while walking to work at the 
american university of beirut april 11 1986 
an irish diplomat in beirut john rowan found his passport 
within hours and circulated pictures on lebanese news media showing 
keenan was irish not british 
a foreign ministry spokesman who by custom was not identified 
said this may have saved keenans life four days later the united 
states bombed libya using britishbased fighters and two britons 
were slain in beirut shortly afterward 
from the earliest days after keenans kidnapping the spokesman 
said irish diplomats in the middle east stressed that he had gone 
to beirut as an educator not in an exploitative capacity 
the governments message was that irelands involvement in the 
middle east was benevolent nonaggressive and purely a 
peacekeeping one the spokesman said ireland has contributed 750 
troops to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon near the 
israeli border 
every time the irish spoke about keenan they spoke of all 
hostages the spokesman said for this reason ireland did not 
stress its neutrality and nonmembership in nato which would have 
singled keenan out 
collins not only pressed keenans case around the globe but made 
several comments recently which pleased the iranians 
he condemned israel for bombing hezbollah targets and for its 
treatment of hezbollah prisoners in southern lebanon 
all this was happening at a time when iran after a costly 
eightyear war with iraq was trying to restore political and trade 
relations with the west

some mohawks fled their reservations after 
quebecs premier ordered the army to tear down road and bridge 
barricades that indians built in a sevenweekold armed standoff 
with authorities born of a land dispute 
premier robert bourassa also told reporters he was breaking off 
talks with the mohawks and accused them of not negotiating in good 
faith 
in comments carried live on canadian television on monday 
bourassa said he was obliged to assume his responsibility for 
public order 
we quebecers and canadians cannot tolerate groups of citizens 
living in quebec choosing which laws they want to respect and which 
they want to ignore the premier said 
to back a claim on land the indians had first barricaded a road 
to a golf course that local officials wanted to expand onto what 
the mohawks claimed were tribal lands warriors then blocked a 
bridge that links montreal with its southern suburbs adding hours 
to daily commutes and angering residents 
bourassa said he had asked the canadian army to take down the 
barriers and i hope in the coming days we will have a resolution 
to this crisis 
in a statement issued monday night the mohawk nation said 
members of the two mohawk communities involved were prepared to 
stand and fight 
now that war is being forced upon us we will turn our hearts 
and minds to war and it too we will wage with all our might the 
statement said 
but in kahnawake just south of montreal at least 100 women and 
children were evacuated by boats over the st lawrence river monday 
night 
several residents were also reported fleeing the kahnesatake 
reservation near oka 18 miles west of montreal and site of the 
golf course dispute 
those who left kahnesatake were not allowed to return monday 
evening soldiers setting up checkpoints around the community said 
they had instructions to bar access to everyone but those carrying 
food and medicine 
gen john de chastelain chief of staff of the canadian forces 
said in ottawa that soldiers would refrain from force against the 
indians unless obliged to do so by the warriors 
a week ago troops replaced quebec provincial police at the 
indian barricades 
chastelain did not say how or when the army would move but 
indicated it would be soon he said he hoped the mohawks would 
simply abandon their positions at the barriers and allow the army 
to cart away the pieces 
part of the problem with the negotiations has to do with the 
confused nature of mohawk politics various groups vie for 
leadership on the numerous reserves some claim the militant 
warrior society has usurped authority from elected native officials 
mohawks from the kahnesatake reserve at oka had set up a 
barricade across the main road into the reserve to protest the 
towns plan to expand the golf course onto territory they claimed 
on july 11 provincial police attempted to storm the barricade 
but were repulsed a policeman was shot and killed in the attempt 
although it was not clear who killed him 
after the police action mohawks from the kahnawake reserve set 
up a sympathy blockade at chateauguay cutting off the mercier 
bridge across the st lawrence river that links montreals southern 
suburbs with the city 
that blockade caused a major disruption of traffic forcing many 
people to make long detours it also led to rising tempers among 
local residents against both the police and the indians 
the issue of the golf course was resolved early on when the 
federal government agreed to buy the land and turn it over to the 
natives but since then the mohawks have used the situation to air 
a much wider series of demands including sovereignty 
bernard roy the federal governments negotiator said monday 
that the mohawk demand for immunity from prosecution for those 
involved in the july 11 shootout was unacceptable 
the mohawks had agreed in what they called a gesture of good 
faith to open one lane of the mercier bridge to traffic that was 
rejected by bourassa who termed the offer not serious

pogos home swamp is so dry that 
overcrowded alligators are starting to eat each other 
a summer drought has turned the okefenokee swamp into a 
tinderbox with water levels at their lowest in 20 years said don 
perkuchin manager of a 396000acre national refuge in the swamp 
fire danger and a wildlife crisis forced the refuges closure to 
fishing enthusiasts and boaters 
a lot of the canoe trails have no water perkuchin said 
were very dry and its been a cumulative effect over the last 
decade what its going to take is a major tropical system to dump 
a 5 or 10inch rain or a long period of substantial rain to turn 
things around 
okefenokee swamp encompassing about 700 square miles mostly in 
southeast georgia is the reallife wetland the serves as the 
fictional home of comic strip character pogo created by late 
cartoonist walt kelly 
okefenokee national wildlife refuge workers are using a 
helicopter to spot small fires most sparked by lightning 
perkuchin said 
weve had lightning strikes and weve had to go out and dump 
water on those he said in a recent phone interview from his 
folkston office 
a fire discovered july 7 burned 4500 acres of swamp land before 
it was doused if things continue to stay dry the fire hazard 
can get worse perkuchin said 
much of georgia has been plagued by drought since june farmers 
have suffered up to 350 million in crop losses and some 
communities in the atlanta area have had to restrict water use 
bill cribbs a biology professor at valdosta state college who 
has made a lifelong study of the swamp said the crisis is hitting 
wildlife 
younger gators are being eaten by other gators he said 
fish resources are really taking a beating both from consumption 
by other animals and reduced habitat a lot of the bird life youd 
normally see you just dont have around the swamp 
the suwannee river one of two rivers that originate in the 
swamp is almost dry cribbs said 
its not 6 inches deep in some places and you have to drag the 
boat he said adding that september and october are usually the 
swamps driest months followed by a threemonth wet season that 
typically begins in december 
im expecting it to get much drier before it gets better 
unless we have a hurricane he said 
alligators feeding on each other might actually be a good thing 
he said 
when you have a drought period and all the water recedes to 
these small areas the alligators eat turtles snakes smaller 
alligators and even the raccoons that come to feed he said if 
they didnt eat their own population thered be nothing to hold 
the alligator population in check 
jimmy spikes assistant manager of okefenokee swamp park near 
waycross said his park is still able to offer guided 25minute 
boat tours but had to cancel its twohour tours deep into the 
swamp because of low water 
attendance is down because many tourists assume that all boat 
trails are closed spikes said adding that the park featuring 
wildlife exhibits snake shows and historical attractions usually 
draws up to 125000 visitors a year 
the swamp is home to more than 25 species of birds including 
the sand hill crane and the endangered red cockaded woodpecker 
other residents include black bears armadillos at least two types 
of rattlesnakes water moccasins and endangered eastern indigo 
snakes

the earth is heating up faster than 
previously documented and it is imperative that nations agree to 
reduce gases responsible for global warming say scientists at a 
conference on climactic change 
we face warming trends faster than at any time in 10000 
years mostafa k tolba head of the un environment program 
said monday in an opening speech outlining the results of a 
twoyear international climate study 
the conclusion that the earth is heating by onethird of a 
degree celsius each decade is among the conclusions of a draft 
document being debated at the fourday conference 
about 300 government officials lawyers and scientists from 70 
countries are hoping to adopt a final report that would be a basis 
for united nations action on fighting the greenhouse effect 
the united states represented by a 25person delegation has 
objected to some preliminary conclusions of the report which was 
prepared by 1000 atmospheric experts from industrialized and 
developing countries 
in the past us officials have resisted a worldwide ceiling on 
emissions of carbon dioxide the gas that scientists believe causes 
60 percent of the greenhouse effect increasing levels of 
carbon dioxide are believed to trap heat from the sun gradually 
warming the planet 
the united states produces more carbon dioxide than any country 
and 75 percent of all greenhouse gases are emitted by the 
western industrialized nations 
president bush is among leaders calling for more exact 
measurements of the effects of carbon dioxide and precise 
predictions of the result of emission reduction before he would 
consider mandatory ceilings 
the united states the soviet union and japan are the major 
industrialized countries which have not imposed voluntary ceilings 
on carbon dioxide production within their borders 
the preliminary draft report by the scientists says emissions 
resulting from human activities are substantially increasing 
concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere 
tolba called for immediate negotiations on a treaty providing 
controls of carbon dioxide emissions 
gop obashi secretarygeneral of the world meteorological 
organization said to solve the problem of greenhouse gases 
requires the industrialized countries to change their 
overconsuming ways 
it also requires that development in the less industrialized 
world goes forward in a sustainable manner he said and this 
will require a large flow of assistance both financial and 
technological from north to south 
the fourday conference in sundsvall 240 miles north of 
stockholm is expected to make specific recommendations on what the 
world should do about climate change 
a second world climate conference will follow in geneva in 
october and a framework convention of climate change is scheduled 
in washington dc in february

for the third consecutive trading day today while the dollar 
closed sharply lower 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues rose 56900 
points or 226 percent to close at 2571076 the index gained 
97600 points monday following a 42813point gain last friday 
dealers attributed the nikkei indexs gain to an overnight 
advance on wall street declining oil prices and the yens 
appreciation against the dollar 
share prices are recovering almost across the board said 
kazuyuki suzuki an analyst with daiwa securities 
since the middle east crisis erupted after iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 the nikkei index had lost a total of 623987 
points or 2023 percent as of last thursday 
suzuki said a decline in the nations interest rates though 
marginal also provided a favorable factor to the stock market 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bond closed at 8268 points up from mondays 
close of 8254 the yield stood at 8190 percent down from 8225

close of 14480 yen after opening at 14355 yen the currency 
ranged between 14295 yen and 14355 yen 
currency dealers said the dollar remained weak throughout the 
day because of falling oil prices and traders perceptions that 
tensions have eased in the middle east 
the yenselling factor is dwindling because of the decline in 
crude oil prices said masahiro sahara a dealer with industrial 
bank of japan 
persian gulf crude oil prices were below late monday new york

kuwaits border with saudi arabia and that opec will allow its

japan is nearing completion of a package to assist 
the multinational blockade of iraq and it will include sending 
medical personnel and financial assistance to the middle east 
government officials said today 
a foreign ministry official said the package expected to be 
announced on wednesday will include assistance for the 
multinational force arrayed against iraq and aid to middle east 
countries suffering economic hardship because of the blockade 
according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
while the united states has poured tens of thousands of troops 
into saudi arabia to halt further aggression by iraq after its aug 
2 invasion of kuwait tokyo has been slow to decide on further 
measures beyond its participation in the global boycott on trade 
with baghdad 
government officials have been promising unprecedented steps 
to punish iraq but have been slow to respond because of debate 
over the legality of sending military units to the gulf and of 
providing the usled naval blockade of iraq with direct financial 
aid 
the japanese constitution adopted after world war ii bars the 
use of force in settling international disputes 
tokyo also is concerned about the safety of the more than 450 
japanese nationals still in iraq and kuwait including about 20 who 
were whisked away from their baghdad hotel to undisclosed 
destinations 
a government source speaking on condition he not be identified 
further said tokyo is very likely to send a medical team of up 
to 100 people to saudi arabia to help care for refugees in the 
crisis 
japan also plans to use civil aircraft to transport nonmilitary 
material and food for the multinational force the source said the 
government is expected to charter two cargo planes from japan 
airlines one source said 
transportation of military personnel and weapons is acceptable 
according to our interpretation of our domestic laws said a 
senior government source also speaking on condition of anonymity 
however there are difficulties to ask a commercial airline 
company to carry lethal and heavily military products 
foreign minister taro nakayama returned saturday from a tour of 
the middle east in which he assessed the needs of oman jordan 
egypt turkey and saudi arabia while government officials have 
declined to estimate how much money tokyo will offer the 
assistance required by the regions countries could run into the 
billions of dollars

ali fallahiyan irans minister of security and intelligence 
told reporters monday that those arrested were members of the 
association for the defense of the iranian peoples sovereignty and 
freedom movement 
he did not say when they were detained 
the freedom movement headed by former iranian prime minister 
mehdi bazargan is the only visible opposition inside iran 
bazargan 83 was the first prime minister of the islamic 
republic after it was established in 1979 by the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini he is known to be a pious moslem with a large following 
among tehrans powerful merchant community 
eight members of the freedom movement were arrested in june 
after 90 followers signed a scathing open letter to president 
hashemi rafsanjani calling for the restoration of constitutional 
rights 
a source at the time said the letter which shook the 
government called bazargan the only voice of conscience inside 
iran 
earlier this month one of those arrested in june appeared on 
television reading a statement that said the group had been 
directed by the us central intelligence agency 
fallahiyan said monday that confessions obtained from those 
arrested would lead to more being rounded up according to irna 
which was monitored in nicosia 
he said those arrested aimed to wage psychological warfare 
against the islamic republic officials by repeating information 
disseminated by counterrevolutionaries abroad and the voice of 
america 
besides being linked to the outside world they were involved 
in efforts to wage psychological warfare and create dissatisfaction 
among people the minister was quoted as saying 
he said irans security service had identified and crushed 
us espionage networks in the country irna said

contra courier eugene hasenfus jailed in nicaragua 
while the us government disavowed knowledge of a clandestine 
rebel supply network is due no damages because he knew the risks 
involved a jury decided 
the federal court jury on monday denied damages to ruled 
hasenfus his wife and the family of pilot wallace sawyer jr who 
was killed when sandinista troops shot down their supply plane in 
1986 
jurors agreed hasenfus and sawyer were working for miamibased 
southern air transport and had been hired by retired air force gen 
richard secord but ruled the men were independent contractors well 
aware of the risks 
hasenfus his wife and sawyers family sought to recoup lost 
wages and other damages resulting from the crash in a civil lawsuit 
against southern air transport and secord who helped supply the 
contra rebels 
hasenfus of marinette wis was dejected after the decision 
ive had so much taken from me already he said this is a 
disappointment 
hasenfus sought 57000 in back pay and his wife sally sought 
66000 reimbursement for legal expenses involved in extricating 
her husband from the nicaraguan jail where he was held for three 
months after the crash 
mrs hasenfus said us state department officials had assured 
her that they would help pay for her husbands legal expenses while 
he was in jail in nicaragua 
but hasenfus attorneys were unable to link secord and southern 
air to those state department officials explained one juror 
if we could have proved the state department employees were 
agents of secord and southern air we would have given them 
money juror ivis charbonier said 
we did feel there was a secret operation said juror wade 
harris we tried very hard to live by the evidence that they gave 
us but there wasnt any proof of any oral agreement 
hasenfus had claimed in the lawsuit against secord an 
irancontra figure and southern air that they controlled the 
illegal network and were responsible for damages suffered as a 
result of the supply plane crash in nicaragua 
attorneys for the defendants argued that hasenfus and sawyer 
knew the risks of the operation but were acting on their own and 
were owed no special responsibility by the defendants 
we do intend to appeal if we can raise the funds said brian 
strange an attorney for hasenfus 
a defense attorney said secord was overseas and unavailable for 
comment secord is currently on probation after a guilty plea on 
charges of lying to congress about the irancontra affair 
before deliberations began last tuesday us district judge c 
clyde atkins ruled in favor of secord and southern air that the 
jury should only consider claims for back salary for hasenfus and 
death benefits for sawyers wife in magnolia ark 
the plaintiffs had sought payment for legal bills lost income 
mental stress and other damages but were unable to prove their 
claims of corporate and us government responsibility for 
their actions 
they removed their fingerprints quite well from everything 
a shaken hasenfus said afterward we won a war here but we lost 
a battle in a way

allure of the middle east to drum up business when he added a 
roadside genie and changed the name of his miniature golf course to 
treasures of baghdad 
the changes made well before the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait have not proved popular in the vicinity of myrtle beach air 
force base 
weve had this place for eight years and up to this year it 
was known as the golden dragon dweck said of his 36hole course 
at a prime location across from a water park now we dont have 
anybody at all during the day and only an occasional person at 
night when its supposed to be the most crowded 
dweck spent 15000 on a fancy treasures of baghdad sign and 
added a roadside turbaned genie sitting crosslegged with a bobbing 
head 
around town one of the hottestselling souvenirs is a tshirt 
featuring a likeness of iraqi leader saddam hussein above the line 
public enemy number one the air force base sent several a10 
jets to saudi arabia

sri lankan troops were held up at a 
minedamaged causeway today in their advance to relieve the 
besieged jaffna fort top defense officials said 
as soon as the army can advance from the small islands in jaffna 
lagoon across the causeway to the mainland it intends to clear the 
tamil tiger rebels from a onemile perimeter around the fort 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne said in an interview 
the tigers have kept the fort under siege for the past 10 weeks 
the government assault now in its seventh day is the biggest 
operation against the tigers northern stronghold since the current 
round of fighting erupted june 11 
we are crossing the causeway now wijeratne said its 
been heavily mined our troops will repair that and get 
across 
however the defense secretary gen cyril ranatunge indicated 
the task may be difficult a 17foot gap in the 1500yard causeway 
must be repaired possibly under fire from rebel mortar positions 
he told the associated press 
the starshaped 17thcentury dutch colonial fortress dominates 
jaffna the fort is the governments only stronghold in jaffna town 
jaffna 185 miles northeast of colombo is the headquarters of 
the rebels seeking tamil independence from the sinhalesedominated 
government 
an army helicopter landed inside the fort on monday with eight 
relief soldiers and food and evacuated seven wounded policemen 
wijeratne said 
it was only the second time a helicopter reached the fort since 
the siege began the 250man garrison has been supplied by 
highaltitude air drops including blocks of ice for drinking water 
on aug 22 the government launched an offensive to seize three 
islands west of the fort and open a corridor across the causeway to 
the outpost wijeratne initially predicted the operation would take 
two or three days 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
army had committed two battalions or about 2000 troops to secure 
the fort area 
these sources said the army would have trouble holding the 
builtup perimeter areas in jaffna town which is separated from 
the fort by 500 yards of nomans land we have to hold it 
otherwise the tigers will come back wijeratne said 
ranatunge was more cautious admitting it would take a lot of 
manpower well see how it goes he said 
wijeratne seated below two pinstudded maps marking troop 
deployments on this indian ocean island said he would offer 
civilians in jaffna a chance to evacuate the line of fire 
once we open the corridor options are there for the civilians 
if they want to escape the onslaught theres an escape route 
for them he said 
despite the delays he said the rebel resistance was lighter 
than expected they are cracking up he boasted they are now 
getting mauled by the sri lankan army 
he said the objective of the operation was to open jaffna 
hospital which has been closed since the fighting began 
military officials claim more than two tiger guerrillas have 
been killed in the weeklong offensive 
the tigers who rarely admit casualties while battles are in 
progress have acknowledged no losses and claim most of the victims 
were civilians 
at least 14000 people have been killed since tamil guerrillas 
embarked on their separatist war in 1983 
militants say they need their own homeland to preserve the 
culture of their ethnic minority and protect it from discrimination 
by sinhalese in jobs and education tamils comprise 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people while sinhalese make up 75 percent 
there is also a moslem minority

the kgb and other soviet agencies have for the 
first time agreed to open their files to help determine whether 
raoul wallenberg really died in a moscow prison in 1947 
a group that believes the swedish diplomat who saved tens of 
thousands of hungarian jews at the end of world war ii may still 
be alive said monday it had secured the soviet unions cooperation 
in determining his fate 
wallenberg vanished after being arrested by the soviets in 
budapest on spying charges in 1945 
soviet authorities have long maintained he died in the kgbs 
lubyanka prison in 1947 but wallenbergs relatives say they have 
received reports he is alive and detained in the soviet union he 
would now be 77 
the evidence is incontrovertible that raoul wallenberg did not 
die in 1947 compelling that he was alive in the 50s and 60s and 
credible that he was alive thereafter said irwin cotler a 
canadian lawyer who has spent 10 years investigating wallenbergs 
fate 
cotler told a news conference that an international commission 
is working on the premise that wallenberg may still be alive 
though possibly under another identity and unknown even to soviet 
prison authorities 
besides cotler commission members include wallenbergs 
halfbrother guy von dardel several soviet journalists and 
historians and two former soviet political prisoners cronid 
lubarski an editor and marvin makinen chairman of the university 
of chicagos biochemistry department 
what you have here is a joint cooperative initiative for the 
first time that we hope will ultimately discover the fate and 
whereabouts of raoul wallenberg cotler told reporters at the 
swedish embassy 
he said the kgb the foreign ministry and the interior ministry 
had all agreed to help the commission 
we have been told that we will be given access to all files on 
the wallenberg affairs he said therefore i interpret all 
files to include kgb files 
cotler said the commission has also asked the kgb for files 
belonging to smersh a defunct soviet security agency that killed 
real suspected or potential opponents of the soviet government 
cotler praised the soviet cooperation as a step forward in 
glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness 
the soviet position has been historically since 1957 that 
raoul wallenberg died in 1947 he said from 1957 to 1987 they 
basically did not address this issue 
cotler said the commission was granted permission to travel 
monday to vladimir prison 12 miles outside moscow where 
wallenberg allegedly has been sighted 
prison officials have agreed to allow commission members to 
examine their archives including 10000 registration cards and 
interview present and former inmates guards and administrators 
cotler said 
last october soviet officials expressed remorse for the first 
time over the stalinera arrest of wallenberg a lutheran who saved 
an estimated 20000 jews from nazi gas chambers by sheltering them 
and issuing them false passports 
wallenberg a member of a prominent family of bankers and 
industrialists repeatedy risked his life by hiding jews in houses 
he bought or rented often with his own money in the final days 
before the liberation of budapest wallenberg persuaded the nazis 
to cancel a plan to kill 70000 jews who were still living in the 
citys ghetto 
last fall kgb deputy chief vladimir pirozhkov returned 
wallenbergs passport drivers license address book calendar and 
cash to his family saying they had been found in kgb headquarters 
the previous month 
however the only proof offered of wallenbergs death was a 
doctors letter released in 1957 saying wallenberg suffered a 
fatal heart attack and was cremated

connecticut and wyoming got the best grades in 
a statebystate report card of educational performance released 
today by a parents group 
the american association of parents and children prepared the 
report card after an earlier study found nine out of 10 teachers 
think parents dont care about education 
the groups executive director scott stapf said the reports 
should be a wakeup call telling parents they play an important 
role in education 
its a disastrous message to create the impression with 
parents that when you look at the national education crisis the 
only people who need to be concerned are teachers and school 
administrators and state lawmakers stapf said 
unless you create a picture that includes parents in the 
equation as well youre really missing a big part he said 
the aapc a yearold independent research group compiled 
dozens of studies by the department of education the carnegie 
foundation and others for its report card 
the group graded states on their statistical performance in six 
broad areas parental apathy head start participation 
studentteacher ratios perstudent spending graduation rates and 
standardized test scores it then averaged them for an overall 
grade 
connecticut and wyoming were the only states to receive an 
a hawaii texas south carolina georgia tennessee and 
louisiana got an f 
nearly nine out of 10 teachers believe parents are apathetic 
about education a carnegie foundation study found last this year 
the aapc is trying to remedy that with a pamphlet of 10 simple 
steps for parents to become more involved with schools stapf said 
the pamphlet is available by mail from aapcs herndon va 
headquarters 
a study for the national parent teacher association earlier this 
year also found that most parents involvement in school is low 
president bush noted the study in a speech to the ptas 
legislative conference in march education is a national mission 
that must include parents he said 
but arnold fege the ptas governmental relations director on 
monday faulted bush and the nations governors for not making 
increased parental involvement an education reform goal 
parents are frequently the orphans in education policy he 
said 
since its study pta leaders began developing strategies to 
increase parents role fege said he said schools need to create 
more flexible opportunities for parental participation 
the schools have to recognize that the families have some 
unique needs today that they didnt have 10 years ago fege said 
he noted there are more single parents and more families where both 
parents work now than in 1980 
at the same time we recognize that the home frequently makes 
it easier for the teacher to operate fege said 
the aapc timed the release of its report card to be near the new 
school year stapf said classes in some states began monday many 
states start school after labor day

dependents of us diplomats in kuwait seemed in 
good spirits and good health when they touched down in paris 
today on a stopover on their flight home a us official said 
i talked to the doctors everyone was in great shape said 
us embassy spokesman paul kozelka who met with some of the tired 
americans at charles de gaulleroissy airport 
two american doctors were accompanying the 52 women and children 
on the flight which left the nato base at incirlik turkey for 
the united states earlier in the day 
the dependents are headed for andrews air force base in 
washington their transcontinental charter flight stopped over for 
about two hours in paris to refuel the flight was unlisted in 
normal air traffic logs and the plane kept away from the main 
airport terminal buildings 
reporters were not given access to passengers on the aircraft or 
others shuttled to the terminal to use airport facilities 
they all seemed to be in good spirits and good health the 
kids were playing around like kids do kozelka said 
there were six infants and another dozen or so small children 
among those permitted to leave kuwait city by iraqi troops the 
dependents were among about 100 people evacuated from kuwait when 
the us embassy there was reduced to a skeleton staff iraq 
eventually let the women and children in the group leave baghdad 
but detained about 50 diplomats in the party as hostages 
those allowed out traveled from baghdad the iraqi capital 
overland through mountains and desert to turkey where they boarded 
a flight for home 
it was long nights drive and they were disturbed by tv 
cameras and flashes while they were trying to sleep said kozelka 
when the group reached the turkish border three young men in 
the party were forcibly removed and taken back to baghdad the 
three unidentified by name were sons of us diplomats over the 
age of 18 us officials said 
the ordeal of the dependents coupled with iraqi actions 
against diplomats remaining in baghdad and kuwait city have 
angered the united states 
the state department retaliated by ordering the iraqi embassy in 
washington to reduce its staff from 55 to 19 remaining iraqi 
diplomats were ordered to stay within a 25mile radius of 
washington 
about 10 us diplomats remain in the us embassy in kuwait 
city despite an order by iraq that all embassies in the city must 
close iraq has cut off the electricity water and phone lines to 
many of the embassies but so far has not used force to empty and 
close the missions

the united states military buildup in saudi arabia 
has brought a rush on some recruiting stations by wouldbe 
soldiers including many too young or too old to fight 
sgt bob armstrong at the army recruiting center in rochester 
ny said he has seen the number of potential enlistments rise 
from three or four people a day to five or six since the persian 
gulf crisis began 
qualified is another story armstrong said monday we got 
maybe one contract this month out of it 
most of the people coming to the recruiting center say they want 
to serve in the middle east but nearly all have been unqualified 
because they are not high school graduates or have criminal 
records he said 
most of the interest seems directed at the army air force and 
navy officials reported little change in the number of wouldbe 
recruits since iraq invaded kuwait and thousands of us troops 
were deployed to the persian gulf 
absolutely weve been getting more calls said sgt first 
class rick henager an army recruiter in hyannis mass were 
talking about an increase of 1000 percent on some days 
henager took a call from a young man who had won a fouryear 
college scholarship but still wanted to be a medic in the middle 
east if war broke out 
he said look im all set with my education but if we do go 
to war i want to be a part of it another kid said ive lived in 
this country 19 years its time i started helping with the rent 
the army national guard in toms river nj is getting a flood 
of people who have already served their country in battle 
we have vietnam vets wanting to go over said sgt carl 
tucker especially since they heard about the reserves being 
called in a lot of prior service people are calling us they 
figure if they can get in a reserve unit they can get called over 
americans are not the only ones gung ho on getting in on the 
action canadians are contacting new york recruiting stations to 
put in a bid for active duty 
just last week alone its been about 20 to 25 canadians 
calling said sgt antony byrd an army recruiter in niagara falls 
before in a weeks time we used to get maybe five 
in order for canadians to join the us military they must hold 
green cards or dual citizenship either through being a member of 
certain indian tribes or having a parent who is a us citizen 
officials at the army recruiting office in little rock ark 
didnt wait for people to come to them they announced last week 
that they needed experienced soldiers for reenlistment and they 
got what they asked for 
recruiters said they were seeking reenlistments and not 
freshfaced first timers just to speed up the readiness process 
if you take a young person in now who has never been trained 
its going to be a while before theyll be ready to do anything 
youre looking at a period of maybe six months down the road 
said john moss chief of advertising and public affairs for the 
little rock office 
still even those who know they are too young to serve or well 
beyond the age for military action just wanted to know what they 
could do to help and i think that was great moss said

the soviet union criticized the united states 
today for expelling iraqi diplomats from washington and warned that 
such action could lead to a spiral of escalation in the 
conflict 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov also indicated that 
some of iraqs arab neighbors have failed to put enough pressure on 
baghdad in response to its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
regarding the nearly 200 military advisers the soviet union has 
in iraq gerasimov said their presence does not violate un 
sanctions against iraq but that the soviet government is looking 
into the situation 
arab countries have to be more energetic in their efforts 
aimed at eliminating the crisis he told reporters a lot 
depends on the arabs themselves they can make certain efforts 
to find a way out of that situation 
the united states has ordered 36 iraqi embassy personnel to 
leave washington by thursday and has imposed travel limits on the 
19 envoys allowed to remain the united states has so far been 
unable to persuade its allies to expel iraqi diplomats from other 
capitals 
the move followed iraqi demands that foreign countries close 
their embassies in kuwait iraq also had briefly prevented 52 
dependents of us personnel from leaving its country the group 
eventually was allowed to go to turkey and were headed home today 
gerasimov said the soviet union had no plans to expel iraqi 
diplomats from moscow 
we would not want any steps that can aggravate the already hot 
situation in the gulf which will make difficult the way out of 
that crisis he said 
he was asked whether the united states action had aggravated 
the conflict 
i dont believe that we have to add fuel to the fire in this 
explosive situation of course iraqs actions to close embassies in 
kuwait are illegitimate but if you use a titfortat policy in 
this question you risk falling down the spiral of escalation and 
aggravating the situation 
i believe we have to mostly make use of diplomatic efforts 
asked whether the soviet union was being more helpful in efforts 
to resolve the conflict gerasimov said diplomatically yes 
because we talk to iraq you dont but the aim is the same to 
stop this aggression and to punish the aggressor 
a group of 240 soviet women and children arrived in moscow today 
after being evacuated from iraq a second group planned to leave 
either late today or early wednesday and all 983 dependents were 
to be home by saturday 
the soviet union had 7791 citizens in iraq mostly oil workers 
diplomats and dependents officials have said 
that number includes 193 military advisers whom soviet 
officials say are under contractual obligation to continue working 
for iraq 
gerasimov denied accusations that the soviet union had violated 
un sanctions against iraq by keeping its military advisers there 
the soviet union iraqs largest arms supplier cut off weapons 
shipments after the invasion 
gerasimov said un sanctions did not cover the military 
experts who teach iraqi soldiers to use modern sovietbuilt 
weapons they also maintain and repair the hardware 
legally there is no problem but there is a moral aspect to 
that problem so we recognize that and will try to resolve it he 
said

a federal reserve survey shows us banks have 
continued to tighten their lending standards in the last three 
months because of a weakening economy and problems in several 
industries 
domestic respondent banks indicated that since may they have 
further tightened lending standards and terms with respect to 
nonmergerrelated business loans according to the survey 
released monday 
it found that the tighter standards were particularly noticeable 
for mediumsized firms but also significant for small and large 
businesses 
the survey polled senior loan officers at 60 domestic banks and 
18 branches of foreign institutions 
branches and agencies of foreign banks reproted that on 
balance they too have moved to restrict the availability of 
business credit the survey found 
by far the most important reasons domestic respondents gave 
for tightening their credit standards in the last three months were 
a less favorable eocnomic outlook and industryspecific problems 
the survey said 
other reasons included more stringent money supplies due to 
problem loans and regulatory pressures 
about threequarters of respondents reported that they had 
imposed tighter credit standards for applications to finance 
commercial office buildings in the last three months the survey 
said 
most banks reported their willingness to make general purpose 
and consumer installment loans to individuals was unchanged 
fed chairman alan greenspan acknowledged in congressional 
testimony on july 12 that credit problems were emerging the 
following day the central bank lowered the federal funds rate from 
825 percent to 8 percent in part to offset the tightened credit 
the federal funds rate is that charged to banks for overnight 
loans

sen sam nunn urged egypts president 
today to send more troops to saudi arabia to show the world it is 
with the united states in its showdown with iraqs saddam hussein 
nunn the georgia democrat who chairs the senate armed services 
committee sen bob dole the senates top republican and six 
other republican senators spent 90 minutes with president hosni 
mubarak 
the us delegation is touring the middle east on monday they 
were in saudi arabia and met with some of the tens of thousands of 
us troops arrayed against iraqi troops across the border in 
kuwait 
now that we have that deterrent force in place i think we 
need to get more arab forces on the ground i emphasized that to 
the president nunn said of the meeting with mubarak 
i think it would help back in the united states with the 
american people to see that we have more help from egypt and from 
other countries on the ground in saudi arabia he said 
nunn said that would make it clear that its not the united 
states vs iraq but the arab world and the world at large vs 
iraq 
at a news conference after meeting the senators mubarak did not 
mention nunns request for additional troops he has said egypt has 
2000 soldiers in saudi arabia but egyptian military sources say 
the figure is closer to 4000 
mubarak and senior egyptian officers say they would send more if 
the saudis ask for them 
about 60000 us troops are in saudi arabia and the gulf 
region as well as dozens of fighter planes warships from the 
united states britain france the soviet union and other 
countries are in the persian gulf and red sea 
us forces deliberately are being kept a good distance behind 
saudi and other arab troops support for the deployment in the arab 
world might collapse if americans fired the first shots in the 
conflict 
in addition us support for the deployment might waver if the 
first casualties were americans 
several senators said they came away from the military briefings 
convinced a formidable deterrent force was in place 
its not all in place nunn said of the continuing us 
buildup but an iraqi attack on saudi arabia would be national 
suicide 
several senators conceded iraqs holding of american hostages 
complicated us planning but said the hostage situation could not 
be the driving force behind policy and military decisions 
you cant run foreign policy on hostages said gop sen jake 
garn of utah if you did no american would be safe anywhere in 
the world 
other senators making the trip all republicans were don 
nickles of oklahoma steve symms of idaho alfonse damato of new 
york connie mack of florida and john warner of virginia

the five permanent security council 
members have agreed on a plan for a truce in cambodia and un 
administration of the country diplomats said today 
the plan which would involve the united nations deepest 
involvement in any regional conflict was worked out by the 
american british french chinese and soviet envoys in two days of 
private talks on the details of a transitional administration to 
guide cambodia to peace and democracy 
we have gone as far as we can as the five permanent members 
said a us diplomat involved in the talks now it is up to the 
four cambodian parties the communist khmer rouge its two 
noncommunist guerrilla allies and the hanoiinstalled government 
in phnom penh 
the question is can the four cambodian factions agree he 
said 
those factions are due to meet in jakarta indonesia in 
september to indicate whether they will accept the plan 
however the agreement of the five permanent members means that 
the backers of the warring factions the united states soviet 
union and china have reached accord on a peace plan 
the question now is whether the soviets and chinese can bring 
their people on board said the diplomat 
the khmer rouge receives its weapons and supplies from china 
the soviets back the current cambodian government of prime minister 
hun sen which was installed by their ally vietnam and washington 
backs the two noncommunist guerrilla factions led by prince 
sihanouk and former premier son sann 
the united nations will have very broad authority to 
administer and to control cambodia said the diplomat speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
this will be the most significant un involvement in this 
regional conflict that we have ever seen he said adding that 
it would far exceed the world bodys role in guiding namibia to 
independence 
the namibia settlement cost the united nations over 750 million 
the key issues now he said were to organize a ceasefire and 
elections so a new government can be established that is not 
dominated by the khmer rouge or the current provietnam government 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to oust the khmer 
rouge who presided over the deaths of up to a million cambodians 
from starvation and executions during their brutal rule that began 
in 1975 
the five security council members said they approved five 
documents that would be forwarded to the cambodian factions by 
france and indonesia the cochairmen of the cambodian conference 
on adopting a peace plan 
the cambodian factions are supposed to meet to form a supreme 
national council to represent cambodia during the transitional 
period however the respective roles and powers of the hun sen 
government and the khmer rouge in the coalition have long been 
disputed by the parties and their allies 
the documents adopted today call for a ceasefire to be in 
place for the warring parties to disengage disarm and settle in 
unmonitored cantonments and for un peacekeepers to take 
over security on the ground 
the united nations would also organize elections and verify that 
all vietnamese forces have left cambodia as hanoi announced they 
had a year ago 
the cambodian guerrillas claim many vietnamese troops remained 
in the uniform of the cambodian army or as militias and civilian 
administrators 
the draft documents being sent to the cambodian parties call for 
the united nations to supervise and control if necessary 
five key cambodian ministries various diplomats said 
those are the defense foreign affairs finance public security 
and information ministries they would be administered for as 
long as necessary said a british source

smitherman who has been at the center of the controversy 
the compromise announced monday sets up a school board with 10 
voting members five black and five white and a white chairman 
carl barker who would vote only on litigation involving the board 
and stemming from the protests 
a resolution approved by the city council on monday calls for 
the city to drop about 130 arrest cases against black demonstrators 
who have camped out at schools and municipal buildings in 
exchange protest leaders would agree to drop lawsuits against the 
city 
once the legal wrangling is completed barker will resign and be 
replaced by a black giving the 11member board appointed by the 
city council its first black majority from that point on the 
school board will be rotated racially with a black majority one 
year and a white majority the next 
selma schools reopened aug 20 after summer break with blacks 
now making up about 80 percent of the student body of 6000 the 
city of about 27000 people is roughly half black and half white 
the five black school board members walked out dec 21 after the 
six whites voted to fire the citys first black superintendent 
norward roussell the remaining board members continued to meet and 
hired an interim superintendent james carter who also is black 
the five black board members will be on the new panel one of 
them freeman walker said he was looking forward to returning to 
work 
the war has been fought and the victors are the boys and girls 
of our school system said walker a teacher in the separate 
dallas county school system i personally think the events of the 
past eight months have strengthened our dedication toward our 
responsibility 
smitherman who has carried the brunt of criticism by black 
protesters announced the school board agreement to a packed city 
council chamber that included one of the protest leaders state 
sen hank sanders whose wife rose was among those faced with 
criminal charges 
people have asked me how the board can operate with a 
fiveandfive split well youre going to operate with the art of 
compromise said smitherman flanked by black and white school 
board members and about 30 members of two black civic clubs that 
helped negotiate the agreement 
the city council approved the resolution by a 71 vote the 
first full school board meeting is scheduled sept 13 
smitherman spent hours over the weekend conferring with white 
and black school board members city council members black leaders 
and even birmingham mayor richard arrington who called to offer 
his assistance 
among other results of the racial tension gov guy hunt sent in 
the national guard and state troopers in february and about 300

the us armys heaviest ground firepower 
reached saudi soil today for deployment behind arab forces manning 
the front line in the monthlong standoff with iraq 
dozens of m11p tanks and m2 bradley armored infantry fighting 
vehicles and scores more heavy support vehicles rolled off two 
huge transport ships at a port in northeastern saudi arabia and 
were readied for the trip north into the desert 
the m1s are by the far the biggest ground weapon in the 
burgeoning us arsenal in saudi arabia weighing an imposing 60 
tons and carrying a 105 mm cannon said to be accurate at 6600 feet 
or more 
the huge but speedy tanks which can travel about 45 mph left 
the 24th infantry mechanized divisions home in georgia two weeks 
ago 
the 24ths heavy firepower will be deployed in front of most 
other us ground forces in saudi arabia but still a good distance 
behind the saudiled arab forces which are just miles from the 
border with occupied kuwait 
the us buildup which could reach 200000250000 ground 
forces is not expected to be completed until october transport 
planes are arriving around the clock but the m1s and the 24ths 
other heavy weaponry have been long awaited by us military 
commanders until now the usled multinational saudi defense 
force has been short on heavy ground firepower 
this is boss sgt ronald ruff said as he showed off his m1 
to a group of reporters this is the cadillac model this is the 
top of the line 
up to now the only us tanks in saudi arabia have been vietnam 
era m60s brought by the 7th marine expeditionary brigade and even 
smaller m551 sheridans iraq has a formidable force of sovietmade 
tanks primarily the export versions of its t64 and t72 models 
the t64 is comparable in armament and armor to the m1s that 
arrived today the t72 is equivalent to the more modern m1 the 
m1a1 
the us tanks are considered to have superior weapons sighting 
and guidance systems and the strategy for any tank war with iraq 
is to use the air superiority of the american saudi and british 
forces to inflict heavy early damage on iraqi tanks 
theres no doubt in my mind that well succeed here if we have 
to said lt col barry willey 
bring them the iraqis on ruff said weve the training 
and technology theyve got the numbers well take them out 
several m1 crews said they will have to clean and change the 
m1s filters more often because of the talcumlike sand of the 
saudi desert

a death row inmate has told authorities 
he helped strangle a fellow convict with a jump rope in a prison 
recreation yard a sheriffs department spokesman says 
officials were questioning david earl gibbs 29 convicted of a 
1985 rape and murder in connection with the death of death row 
inmate calvin j williams walker county sheriffs deputy don 
hampton said 
williams 30 was found near death monday by prison guards at 
the ellis i unit northeast of huntsville near the end of a 
scheduled threehour recreation period he died later at a hospital 
gibbs and williams had been isolated in adjacent recreation 
yards separated by a chainlink fence 
it was clear from the way the rope was tied off it was done 
from gibbs side of the fence special prosecutor david weeks 
told the houston chronicle he said gibbs had fresh scratches and 
rope burns on his hands 
williams death came one day short of the 10th anniversary of a 
harris county jurys decision to sentence him to lethal injection 
for the rapeslaying of emily anderson 28 the vice president of a 
houston travel agency 
williams who came within 90 minutes of execution in 1988 before 
winning a supreme court stay had vowed he would never be put to 
death without a struggle he had a history of violence during his 
years in prison 
williams who was black was a target of a homemade bomb during 
a september 1984 attack blamed on prison racial violence he 
suffered burns over 17 percent of his body and also was stabbed and 
one leg was broken

in the 11th grade when he went to jail on a robbery conviction he 
had been out 34 days when miss anderson nicknamed mimi was killed 
miss andersons sister ellen yarrell was not upset monday when 
told of williams death 
apparently he or someone else decided his time was up said 
ms yarrell a houston lawyer i have been upset with the 
judicial system even though im a lawyer that his appeal process 
has gone on so long i still think he acted as mimis judge jury 
and executioner 
williams acknowledged breaking into the apartment where miss 
anderson was slain but insisted the burglary occurred a month 
before the killing his fingerprints however were found in the 
womans stolen car recovered a few blocks from his home 
a jury took just six minutes to decide on the death penalty 
prison records showed he was involved in five fights within four 
years and was cited numerous times for destruction of state 
property

19year soldier charged with unpremeditated murder in the shooting 
death of a man during the us invasion of panama 
master sgt roberto enrique bryan pleaded innocent as his 
courtmartial began monday unpremeditated murder carries a maximum 
punishment of life in prison

similar to a jury instead of a military judge eight of 12 people 
questioned were chosen to hear the case 
im feeling good bryan 42 said monday after his 
courtmartial recessed for the day 
the army alleges bryan shot the panamanian man without 
provocation on dec 23 1989 three days after the united states

performing his duty in the heat of battle

los angeles international airport has tried 
everything from blowhorns to gunfire to get rid of pesky pigeons 
and sea gulls that occasionally get sucked into jet engines but 
nothing seems to work 
now the airport is calling in the feds 
airport commissioners hired experts from the department of 
agricultures animal damage control unit pigeon killers as 
theyre known by some airport workers to eliminate birds of a 
feather 
weve run out of solutions its time to get some outside 
assistance said mario polselli the airports chief of airfield 
operations 
bird ingestion as aviators call it can seriously hurt a 
planes machinery forcing pilots to dump fuel over the ocean and 
circle back for unscheduled landings 
in the last year three jetliners sucked birds into their 
engines at the airport costing the airlines thousands of dollars 
in wasted fuel and time 
among the solutions being considered by the unit are paving over 
fields where birds roost plugging building holes so birds cant 
make nests and cutting down trees that have seeds that birds like 
and if all that doesnt work the unit might also lay out 
something called porcupine wire that is covered in needles or play 
tape recordings of bird distress calls 
wildlife experts who will spend about a year at the airport 
say they have a tough task ahead 
lax is going to be a real test because its located along a 
bird migratory route but we should be able to make a dent said 
biologist judy loven

the bodies of a man and a woman were 
found at a student apartment complex today a day after police said 
they believed the grisly deaths of three young women were linked 
law enforcement authorities said they didnt know whether the 
fourth and fifth deaths were related to the earlier slayings but 
they said they were investigating the latest deaths as a possible 
double murder and state officials braced for that possibility 
it looks like its a part of a serial killer state 
university system chancellor charles reed said today in 
tallahassee its a community problem its not just a university 
problem we are taking every precaution we possibly can 
there were no plans to cancel classes but students were being 
encouraged to stay on campus reed said we think our campus is 
more secure than the surrounding community right now he said 
gov bob martinez urged that young people avoid staying alone in 
this college community where fall classes opened monday at the 
university of florida and nearby santa fe community college 
alachua sheriffs lt spencer mann said the bodies of a man and 
a woman were found together at about 830 am at an apartment 
complex near one where two bodies were found sunday police set up 
a command post between those sites and the spot about two miles 
from where a third body was discovered early monday 
martinez said authorities werent speculating that a ted bundy 
copycat serial killer was on the loose but the governor said the 
fbi and outofstate experts are involved in the investigation 
fbi agents joined gainesville authorities monday and martinez 
dispatched the state police mobile crime lab to gainesville 
on the campus the slayings stirred memories of bundy he was 
executed in floridas electric chair on jan 24 1989 after 
murdering dozens of young women including two florida state 
university students in tallahassee in a 1978 rampage he followed 
with the murder of a 12yearold schoolgirl in lake city 
thats what were all saying its another ted bundy on the 
loose jana walters 18 a freshman from longwood fla said 
monday some sicko 
adding to fears was the mysterious disappearance of tiffany 
sessions a 20yearold uf student who vanished after leaving her 
gainesville apartment to go jogging on feb 9 1989 
authorities have declined to give details on the bodies and the 
possible links 
the gainesville sun however reported today that the 
mutilations of the bodies at the two separate apartments was the 
apparent connection 
two of the victims who shared a townhouse apartment were 
identified as secondsemester freshmen christina p powell 17 of 
jacksonville and sonya larson 18 of deerfield beach their bodies 
were found sunday afternoon 
eight hours later at another southwest gainesville apartment 
about two miles away alachua county deputies found the body of 
christa l hoyt 18 a student at nearby santa fe community college 
and a fulltime records clerk at the alachua county sheriffs 
office the colleges president lawrence tyree said monday 
the two crimes could have been done by the same individual 
gainesville police chief wayland clifton said monday the method 
of operation in these cases are similar 
the sun quoted unidentified sources as saying that ms hoyt had 
been decapitated and her breasts mutilated while at least one of 
the other victims had her nipples cut off 
police would not confirm the reports but feared more killings 
were possible because of the gruesomeness of the slayings 
i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that 
anybody that commits homicide using mutilation is a pretty sick 
individual and its somebody we want to get off the streets very 
badly said spencer mann spokesman for the alachua county 
sheriffs office 
the weekend slayings prompted parents to flood the university 
and police with worried calls more than threefourths of the 
34000 students live off campus 
university president john lombardi and other officials spent 
monday trying to soothe the fears of anxious parents the 
university which advised students to make reassuring calls home 
established a free phone bank because many students telephones 
have not yet been connected 
the first two bodies were discovered after the parents of ms 
powell trying to contact their daughter before fall classes 
started monday had police open the door 
one victim was nude and the other was partly clothed said lt 
sadie darnell a gainesville police spokesman ms powells body 
was found in the living room of their apartment while ms larsons 
body was found in a secondfloor bedroom 
the body of ms hoyt was discovered by alachua county deputies 
after she failed to show up for work mann said he said there was 
trauma to the teenagers body but he refused to elaborate

hurricane gustav was taking its 105 mph winds 
northward into the open atlantic ocean today after curving away 
from the northeastern caribbean islands the national hurricane 
center reported 
gustav continues moving northward the only threat to land 
would be only four days away in bermuda ray fagen a 
meteorologist at the center in suburban coral gables said this 
morning we see a northerly course which would put it within 300 
miles of bermuda in four days 
but its definitely not a certainty that bermuda would be 
hit he added 
at noon edt gustavs center was located near 208 degrees north 
latitude and 580 degrees west longitude or about 390 miles 
northeast of antigua it was moving northward at about 15 mph and 
was expected to hold that course and speed for the next 24 hours 
meteorologists watching gustav believe its unlikely the 
hurricane will turn towards the us east coast as it makes its way 
north 
the chances would be maybe one in 50 its just the way the 
steering currents are setting up itd be more likely to curve to 
the northeast than to the northwest fagen said 
gustavs path skirted the leeward islands and hurricane warnings 
there were dropped by midday monday all other storm warnings and 
watches issued sunday for the area were later dropped 
but islands in the northeastern caribbean could get rough seas 
and swells during the day today forecasters said 
gustavs hurricaneforce winds this morning extended 35 miles 
from its center with tropical stormforce winds extending outward 
175 miles 
meanwhile tropical storm hortense remained about a thousand 
miles to the east in the midatlantic a danger only to shipping 
at noon tuesday hortense the eighth named storm of the 
atlantic season had winds of 65 mph it was moving north northwest 
at about 10 mph 
the storm was centered near 226 degrees north latitude and 441 
degrees west longitude or about 1310 miles westnorthwest of the 
cape verde islands little change in its strength was expected for 
the next 24 hours 
both gustav and hortense were born as tropical depressions near 
the cape verde islands off west africa like many of historys 
worst hurricanes 
tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained 
top winds reach 39 mph tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph

thousands of university students danced 
and clapped to the beat of antigovernment slogans in heavy rain 
tuesday to protest a proposed job policy they say is discriminatory 
in a separate protest about 500 students from new delhis 
medical colleges marched to prime minister vp singhs house and 
demanded the proposals be withdrawn 
singh announced this month that the government would reserve 27 
percent of government jobs for socially backward castes on 
monday he said quotas also will be introduced for lower income 
groups irrespective of caste 
already 225 percent of the jobs are held for lower castes and 
tribes if implemented the new proposals would raise the 
percentage of reserved jobs to between 54 percent and 59 percent 
the remainder would be awarded on merit 
this has divided the student community it has brought the 
illegal caste system to the fore said ranjit manchanda a 
student at the all india institute of medical sciences the 
countrys top medical college 
opponents also say the quota system would lead to the employment 
and promotion of unqualified people and heighten caste tensions 
discrimination on the basis of caste is illegal but in 
practice the fourtier hindu caste system which determines a 
persons social standing is widely prevalant in india especially 
in villages the four castes are divided into hundreds of 
subcastes 
about 85 percent of indias 880 million people are hindus and 
the high castes among the community hold the majority of government 
jobs they also are generally richer than the lower castes 
nationwide protests against the new quota proposals started 
three weeks ago 
in new delhi students have repeatedly enforced general strikes 
blocked traffic and damaged governmentrun buses during the past 
week tuesdays downpour did not appear to have broken the tempo of 
the protest 
demonstrations were largely peaceful in the morning it started 
raining after noon when the students of the medical colleges and 
those of the delhi university began their marches 
the students stood in the rain for more than two hours 
chanting vp singh down down and who acts like hitler 
will die like hitler 
the protest ended after some protesters commandeered city buses 
for drenched colleagues others walked in the rain and some forced 
drivers of private vehicles and motor scooter taxis to take them 
home mounted and riot police watched from a distance 
dont worry we will fight to the last if the government does 
not listen to us we know what to do said a teenager 
brandishing a stone as he climbed aboard a packed bus

crack gangs waging bloody turf battles held the 
attention of many law enforcers in the late 1980s while behind the 
scenes one violent gang scenes made millions peddling heroin and 
cocaine authorities say 
jury selection begins wednesday in the trial of what prosecutors 
describe as the one of the citys most lucrative streetlevel drug 
gangs 
from early in 1986 until his arrest 2 years later ricardo 
melendez and his followers built up a network that raked in as much 
as 8 million to 10 million a month from some of brooklyns 
poorest neighborhoods by selling drugs out of abandoned buildings 
and storefronts according to authorities 
there used to be blocklong lines of people waiting to get 
their hands on this stuff detective robert alongi an 
investigator in the case told the daily news 
when police and federal drug agents raided melendez apartment 
two years ago money was everywhere they said 6inch high stacks 
of 10 20 50 and 100 bills spread across the kitchen floor 
some 300 pounds of cash was found in the apartment totaling 
238 million 
the trial with some 150 witnesses is expected to last as long 
as three months 
melendez 30 who is being held without bail and his nine 
codefendants are charged with several drug conspiracy counts that 
incorporate numerous drugrelated slayings kidnapping tortures 
and beatings aimed at maintaining discipline in the organization 
and keeping out competing drug dealers 
they face life in prison if convicted 
former melendez employees and rival drug dealers will take the 
stand to tell jurors how melendez and his lieutenants yanked out 
teeth cut off fingers or broke bones as punishment for stealing 
from the organization or selling drugs in its territory said 
assistant us attorney peter r ginsberg 
one witness says melendez kept a souvenir jar filled with 
teeth of victims he had tortured or beaten authorities said in 
court monday 
alleged threats to prosecutors and to the families of anyone who 
testified against melendez prompted us district judge arthur 
spatt to keep secret jurors first names addresses and their jobs 
to insulate them from improper influence 
security was tight when the defendants several of whom are free 
on bail appeared for final pretrial hearings monday 
spatt citing an account of melendez drug operation published 
monday in the daily news imposed a gag order directing prosecutors 
and defense lawyers to not speak with reporters about the case 
melendez was first arrested on heroin charges in 1985 he jumped 
50000 bail just before the start of his trial and was convicted 
and sentenced in absentia to 25 years to life in prison 
according to court records his gang employed up to 100 people 
paying hourly wages to some lowlevel workers and his drugs sales 
paid for luxury clothes jewelry gambling trips and mercedesbenz 
cars 
defense lawyer lawrence hochheiser said that with the publicity 
and the public frustration with drugs defending melendez would be 
difficult in a case involving such violent crimes and such hugh 
sums of money 
anyone in a narcotics case already has two strikes against 
them he said

a wildfire that killed two firefighters 
razed 19 houses and blackened more than 2600 acres of timber and 
brush defied control today although its progress slowed officials 
said 
three hundred firefighters used aerial tankers waterbearing 
helicopters and bulldozers to cut fire lines in an allout assault 
on the blaze which they expected to contain from spreading by late 
tonight authorities said they hoped to have the fire under control 
by wednesday evening 
todays the first day we actually have the resources in place 
to man the whole fire said gary laing the interagency fire 
management teams operations manager 
we dont have a stranglehold on it yet added incident 
commander john shive but were going for its throat 
after completing an overnight survey of the fire officials 
today downgraded its acreage to 2600 acres from earlier estimates 
of 3000 acres 
two firefighters died sunday night when the blaze exploded in 
size because of winds gusting to 60 mph the victims were trapped 
between advancing flames and a precipice 
wasatch county sheriffs deputy blake wright 39 and county 
road crew worker ralph broadhead 65 were found near the bulldozer 
they had been using to cut a fireline near an area known as devils 
hole 
hundres of homes in the wasatch mountain area were threatened 
but the fire had to move downhill to advance fire spokesman dick 
buehler said flames move faster uphill 
smoke hung along the face of the scorched mountains west of 
midway this morning as cool air created an inversion holding the 
hotter air close to the ground afternoon winds were expected to 
again fan the flames however 
its asleep right now shive said of the fire itll 
explode again but this time were waiting for it 
the cause of the fire was under investigation 
state forester dick klason speculated that it was sparked by an 
ember blown over from a small fire near cascade springs he 
estimated the cost of fighting and cleaning up after the blaze 
could exceed 3 million 
sheriff edd thacker said the two firefighters who died 
apparently had tried to cut a buffer between themselves and the 
fire investigators said temperatures rocketed to nearly 1100 
degrees in the area melting the bulldozers windows 
they did what they were supposed to do he said it was a 
firestorm the fire was coming at them and they did the best they 
could 
wright was a 10year law enforcement veteran with six children 
and broadhead was within weeks of retirement thacker said 
its going be hard on everybody he said weve known them 
both for years its just awful

someone on a fishing excursion tuesday with 
president bush and prime minister brian mulroney hooked a big one 
the president himself 
camera crew members in a news boat following close behind said 
mulroney appeared to be responsible for the hook that caught bushs 
ear a notion the canadian prime minister did nothing to dispell 
it was not a hostile act mulroney said 
however first lady barbara bush who said her husband is 
fine disputed that mulroney was the culprit she summoned son 
jeb who was also on the boat and commanded him to tell reporters 
just who had hooked his father 
jeb just grinned sheepishly did mulroney hook bush that is 
really not true he said and walked away 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater later confirmed that jeb 
was responsible for accidentally piercing his fathers right ear 
lobe 
bushs physician on an accompanying boat attended to the wound 
he snipped the fish hook with wirecutters and pulled the remainder 
of the hook through the ear according to fitzwater 
the president was strong and courageous throughout this 
exercise fitzwater told reporters traveling back to washington 
with bush aboard air force one fitzwater said the hook passed 
through the bottom rounded part of the presidents ear lobe 
bush continued to fish for about another hour and later received 
a tetanus shot when he boarded air force one later in the morning 
no evidence of a wound or bandage could be seen 
it was the second boating mishap involving bush and mulroney 
on monday bushs boat broke down while the president was taking 
the canadian leader and his family for a ride a small coast guard 
boat was summoned to rescue the party the boat was fixed over 
night

magellans mission to map the rugged 
surface of venus is being delayed again so a team of engineers can 
figure out why the spacecraft keeps losing contact with earth a 
nasa official said tuesday 
were targeting for the last week in september to start 
mapping said tony spear magellan project manager at the space 
agencys jet propulsion laboratory 
spear had said friday that engineers hoped to fix the problem in 
time to have magellan working properly by midseptember before 
magellan started malfunctioning the national aeronautics and space 
administration planned for it to make pictures and maps of venus on 
a regular basis starting sept 1 
the spaceship remained in a protective safing mode tuesday 
spear said during an interview 
engineers still havent figured out why magellans radio link to 
earth failed for 14 hours starting aug 16 and for 17 hours 
beginning aug 21 he added 
so spear said he organized a tiger team of 40 engineers from 
the laboratory and from martin marietta corp which built magellan 
in denver to determine what is wrong with the spaceship and fix it 
magellans 744 million mission is to use radar to peer through 
venus thick clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the 
planets surface it was launched from space shuttle atlantis on 
may 4 1989 
pictures made during an aug 16 radar test showed extensive 
venusquake faults vast flows of solidified lava cinder cones 
a lavafilled meteorite impact crater and countless valleys and 
mountain ridges on the surface of earths nearest planetary 
neighbor 
spear said one major theory is that something went wrong when 
magellan entered orbit around venus on aug 10 it functioned 
almost flawlessly during the 15 months it traveled a looping path 
of 948 million miles from earth 
spear ruled out the possibility raised friday that magellans 
braking rocket may have failed to separate from the spacecraft 
after it went into venus orbit 
mapping is being delayed not only because time is needed to fix 
magellan but also because the spacecrafts troubles have left 
engineers mentally and physically exhausted spear said 
weve decided to give the team three days off around labor day 
engineers want to make sure magellan doesnt break down again 
when mapping is in progress because its not good for peoples 
hearts he added 
spear fully aware of nasas problems stemming from temporary 
grounding of the shuttle fleet and a severe defect on the hubble 
space telescope appealed to the public to have patience with 
magellan 
were going to make it work he pledged have confidence 
in us we have one of the worlds best teams working on this 
problem 
spear said the tiger team is divided into four groups one will 
try to understand and fix the overall problem the second will look 
at the environment around venus to determine if previously unknown 
electrical fields or particles are disrupting magellans 
electronics 
the third group will examine changes on magellan as it went into 
orbit including the possibility of short circuits in plugs that 
once connected the braking rocket to the spaceship the fourth 
group will study a backup computer that helps point magellan spear 
said the computer ran amok during both lossofcontact incidents

saddam hussein today visited foreign 
families held hostage in iraq and told them he was willing to 
discuss the persian gulf crisis with president bush and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
saddam said he was ready and prepared for direct talks with 
mr bush and mrs thatcher let us have the debate between me 
and them on television for the whole world to see 
margaret tutwiler a state department spokeswoman in washington 
quickly dismissed saddams offer saying its sick and it 
doesnt even deserve a response come on there is nothing to 
debate 
mrs thatcher was visitng finland today but a spokeswomen in 
britain said im not in a position to give an immediate reaction 
except to say i dont think the position has changed the bottom 
line is that he saddam has to get out of kuwait before any 
discussion can occur 
the iraqi presidents meeting with several hostage families was 
shown on iraqi television and broadcast by cable news network 
in its report on the meeting the iraqi news agency said saddam 
also ordered that one unidentified british family be allowed to 
return home 
it was not immediately clear what countries the foreigners were 
from or when and where the meeting occurred 
one woman with a british accent asked saddam why he was using 
children in in something they cant undersand he gave a long 
answer in which he repeated that his hand was forced by western 
troops massing in the region 
he also complained that the international trade embargo against 
iraq was reducing food and medicine supplies in his country 
saddam said children will be undernourished and could become 
ill and die he said the cutoff of medicine could cause outbreaks 
of disease 
when food is cut off from a society then youre actually 
choking the society to death saddam told one of the western 
hostages 
as the broadcast began saddam was shown entering a large room 
and greeting the western families shaking hands with men and 
patting children on the head 
dressed in a brown suit and tie instead of his military uniform 
he smiled as he greeted the foreigners he then sat down to make a 
statement through a translator at his side 
he told the families he knew that they were feeling restricted 
and if my family were in your place i would have the same 
feelings 
but he said politicians are forced sometimes to take a 
position that goes beyond what they see directly in front of them 
if it had to do with human feelings towards you then i 
would immediately say you should leave and go back to your 
families but he told them that their presence was needed to 
prevent an attack 
it was the second time saddam visited hostage families in a 
broadcast intended for western consumption he was widely condemned 
for his first visit last week which was seen as a crude attempt to 
gain western sympathy 
in todays broadcast he told the foreigners that although he 
understood they were in a difficult sort of situation 
when we put the issue in a larger context in the event of a 
possible military clash with the armies that have come to the 
area and if we suppose that your presence here in iraq for this 
period would prevent such a clash then we would find ourselves in 
a position in which we are forced to take the sort of decision 
that we have taken 
saddam has used the same justification in the past for his 
detention of about 21000 foreigners including 3000 americans and 
3000 britons who were trapped in iraq and kuwait at the time of 
the aug 2 invasion 
british and us officials say iraq has moved more than 150 
britons and more than 60 americans from kuwait to strategic 
locations for use as human shields against a possible attack by 
the usled forces 
the iraqi leader made no mention in the broadcast of the british 
family reportedly being allowed to leave 
the iraqi news agency said that president saddam hussein 
ordered that one of the british families be allowed to return to 
their country as a generous gesture by his excellency on the 
occasion of the family celebrating the birthday of its child 
rachel 
the dispatch did not reveal the familys surname although it 
said the family expressed its great gratitude and appreciation

there isnt much time for anything other than raising them is 
there that just about takes up all of your time if youre doing 
it properly miss ward said on a promotion tour for her new movie 
after dark my sweet 
she said 5yearold rosie and 3yearold matilda are a handful 
but the highprofile life of a celebrity doesnt appeal to her 
i didnt really feel that that was particularly rewarding

movies and stuff but just being in the movies ultimately isnt 
enough 
last year she portrayed an overly materialistic wife in how

sent to liberia said the two rebels handed over their automatic 
rifles and ammunition monday

taylor has opposed the intervention of the african force to end 
liberias 8monthold civil war he accuses the force comprised of 
3000 soldiers from ghana nigeria sierra leone guinea and 
gambia of supporting president samuel doe of liberia 
both doe and prince johnson leader of another rebel army at

an unidentified american being held in iraq 
has died the state department said today quoting iraqi 
authorities the american was reported to be a man in his mid50s 
who died of a heart attack 
the department also disclosed that iraq plans to expel an 
unspecified number of americans from the us embassy in baghdad in 
response to the us decision on monday to order 36 iraqi envoys 
out of the united states by thursday 
in addition the us embassy in baghdad was told that 
unspecified restrictions will be placed on embassy funds 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
the pentagon meanwhile said iraqs troop strength in and near 
kuwait has increased to 265000 soldiers theres been a general 
trend in the past several days of these numbers increasing 
spokesman pete williams said 
the pentagon also estimated the total costs of the desert shield 
operation through the end of september at 25 billion nearly 
double the previous estimate of 13 billion williams said the 
sharply increased costs can be attributed to the expense of calling 
up reserve and national guard forces increased operations for 
ships and aircraft and to increased fuel costs 
as for the dead american the iraqi foreign ministry said he 
died in the iraqi city of basra and that his body would be turned 
over to the us embassy in baghdad 
the state department in a statement released this morning said 
it could not confirm the cause of death or the identity of the 
american 
later ms tutwiler said the death underscores the barbaric 
nature of iraqi policy towards foreign nationals in iraq and 
kuwait and makes a lie of iraqs claim that they are all well 
treated and in no danger 
she said nine americans have been taken into custody by iraqi 
authorities since monday bringing the total to 70 48 in iraq and 
22 in kuwait she said reports have been received that more 
americans have escaped from the two countries but she had no 
further details 
in baghdad the press attache at the us embassy stephen 
thibeault said that according to the iraqis an american had died 
in basra a southern port in iraq he said the 56yearold man 
apparently died of a heart attack and was believed one of those 
who had been detained by the iraqis 
thibeault in a telephone interview from baghdad said there was 
no positive identification on the american because we have not 
been given access to the american citizen yet the iraqi 
authorities have said that they would allow us to participate in 
any autopsy 
cnn said the man was one of the 63 americans being held hostage 
as human shields against any us attack it quoted us charge 
daffaires joseph wilson as saying the man had been taken from 
kuwait to a strategic site in basra 
meanwhile 36 iraqi envoys face a thursday deadline to leave the 
country targets of what the state department calls a measured 
response to almost a month of blatant iraqi misbehavior 
a us diplomatic message was delivered to iraqi ambassador 
mohamed almashat on monday afternoon serving notice that the 
affected diplomats must be gone within 72 hours 
the move was in retaliation for a series of iraqi actions 
especially the illegal order for the closure of the us 
embassy in kuwait ms tutwiler said 
the department also restricted the remaining iraqi diplomats 
here to a radius of 25 miles from the iraqi embassy in washington 
it said all iraqi diplomatic visas will be switched to single entry 
from multiple entry 
procedures for approving visa applications from private iraqi 
citizens also will be tightened 
the 19 iraqi diplomats permitted to remain in the united states 
including almashat reflect the number of americans accredited to 
the us embassies in iraq and kuwait 
at a news conference at his maine vacation home president bush 
said the united states was trying to keep a reasonable parallel 
in terms of numbers 
ms tutwiler said the measured steps were being taken in 
response to the blatant disregard iraq has shown for 
international law in particular the moves against the us embassy 
in kuwait 
almashat said outside the embassay that the expulsion order was 
unfair and unjustified 
we feel we have been victimized once more he said 
among the iraqis expelled are seven accredited diplomats 
including all those who deal with commercial affairs those 
diplomats became expendable after bush suspended all commercial 
transactions with iraq following its invasion of kuwait 
iraq had ordered all embassies in kuwait to shut down by last 
friday but the united states and a number of other countries have 
defied the order 
since then iraqi authorities have cut off water and electricity 
at the us embassy and are restricting all personnel to the 
embassy grounds 
ms tutwiler said the reduced us embassy staff in kuwait has 
enough food and water only to last several more days power is 
being supplied by a generator 
the united states has refused to close its embassy in kuwait 
because it does not want to lend legitimacy to iraqs conquest and 
subsequent annexation of kuwait

a survey released tuesday casts new doubt on 
the old notion that women who have given birth by cesarean section 
must always deliver that way 
the survey of 2213 physicians by the american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists found that 63 percent of women who 
attempt vaginal delivery after a previous cesarean section succeed 
strides certainly have been made to convince women and their 
physicians that vaginal deliveries are safe and successful 
alternatives to repeat cesareans said dr mary jo osullivan 
secretary of the organization 
but she said since about 42 percent of the patients in the 
survey chose to have another cesarean there is a need to further 
educate women about the benefits of vaginal deliveries 
vaginal deliveries are less risky than cesarean sections mainly 
because the latter is a surgical procedure said osullivan 
associate chairwoman of obstetrics at the university of miami in 
florida 
also vaginal births are less expensive and the patient spends 
less time in the hospital an average of 4334 and two or three 
days compared with 7186 and four or five days for a cesarean 
according to 1989 data from the health insurance association of 
america 
the rate of cesarean deliveries rose from 55 percent of all 
us births in 1970 to 247 percent in 1988 
but osullivan noted that the increase from 198687 and from 
198788 was 03 percent the smallest rise in five years 
also the rate of vaginal births after cesareans rose from 22 
percent in 1970 to 126 percent in 1988 she said 
osullivan said the rate of repeat cesareans appears to be tied 
to the age of the physician ninetyeight percent of physicians 
under 40 said they encourage their cesarean patients to have 
vaginal deliveries for subsequent births compared to 84 percent of 
physicians over 55 
it takes a long time to change your practice pattern 
osullivan said noting that some smaller hospitals still do not 
offer the option of vaginal delivery to women with a previous 
cesarean 
as recently as 15 years ago vaginal birth after a cesarean was 
not considered good medicine in the united states though a 
standard practice for years in many other countries 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the 
largest professional organization for physicians in those 
specialties recommends that women who have had a low transverse 
incision in a previous delivery and have no medical complications 
should be encouraged to attempt labor and vaginal delivery in their 
current pregnancy 
a low transverse incision which cuts into a noncontracting 
portion of the uterus is most commonly used in cesareans today it 
largely replaced what is called the classical incision in which the 
contracting muscles of the uterus are cut and are more likely to 
rupture in a subsequent labor

the explusion of some iraqi diplomats from 
washington could raise persian gulf tensions the soviet union 
warned tuesday in the latest indication of the nations reluctance 
to match harsh us measures 
i dont believe that we have to add fuel to the fire in this 
explosive situation said foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov 
of course iraqs actions to close embassies in kuwait are 
illegitimate he added but if you use a titfortat policy in 
this question you risk falling down the spiral of escalation and 
aggravating the situation 
the united states has ordered 36 iraqi embassy personnel to 
leave washington by thursday and imposed travel limits on the 19 
envoys allowed to remain 
it has been unable to persuade its allies to expel iraqi 
diplomats from other capitals 
the move followed iraqi demands that foreign countries close 
their embassies in kuwait the united states and several other 
nations have defied the order but the soviet union pulled its 
diplomats from kuwait citing security reasons 
gerasimov said the soviet union had no plans to expel iraqi 
diplomats 
we want to move with caution we have to be real 
delicate he said 
although the soviet union has joined the near universal 
condemnation of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait it has urged less 
confrontational measures against its longtime ally the soviet 
union was iraqs top arms supplier prior to the invasion but has 
since cut off weapons shipments 
the soviet union supported united nations security council 
economic sanctions against iraq foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze also joined us secretary of state james a baker iii 
in an unusual joint statement denouncing the invasion 
but the soviets acting on a request from iraq then delayed a 
security council vote to authorize a naval blockade to enforce the 
embargo they also said they preferred diplomatic rather than 
military efforts to resolve the crisis 
yet last week the soviets voted along with other members of the 
security council to authorize the use of military force 
we gave additional time for iraq to have second thoughts 
said gerasimov it was in vain and so we decided not to prolong 
it again 
gerasimov also suggested some of iraqs arab neighbors have 
failed to put enough pressure on iraq 
a lot depends on the arabs themselves they can make 
certain efforts to find a way out of that situation he said 
a group of 240 soviet women and children arrived in moscow on 
tuesday after being evacuated from iraq a second group planned to 
leave either late tuesday or early wednesday and all 983 
dependents were scheduled to be home by saturday 
the soviet union had 7791 citizens in iraq mostly oil workers 
diplomats and dependents officials have said that number also 
includes 193 military advisers who soviet officials say are under 
contractual obligation to continue working for iraq 
gerasimov denied accusations the soviet union had violated un 
sanctions by keeping military advisers in iraq he said the 
sanctions do not cover the military experts who teach iraqi 
soldiers to use modern sovietbuilt weapons they also maintain and 
repair the hardware 
legally there is no problem but there is a moral aspect to 
that problem so we recognize that and will try to resolve it he 
said

independent scientists praised a plan to 
protect the spotted owl tuesday that the bush administration has 
resisted accepting 
three of the scientists said they told a government task force 
examining the plan that it is one of the best issued on a 
threatened or endangered species 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and interior secretary 
manuel lujan jr appointed the task force in june after the fish 
and wildlife service declared the owl to be a threatened species 
throughout oregon washington and northern california 
they asked the panel to examine alternatives to the plan 
authored by forest service biologist jack ward thomas and other 
government experts because they feared it would ban logging on 
millions of acres of oldgrowth forests and cost thousands of 
timber jobs by the end of the decade 
they the task force asked us our opinion of the jack ward 
thomas report whether we thought it was a sound piece of work and 
we said it had our unequivocal support said malcolm hunter a 
university of maine biologist and author of a book on forestry 
john teer a former texas aampm biologist who heads the welder 
wildlife federation in texas said to further compromise the thomas 
committees recommendations would be a travesty 
it is one of the best reports on an environmental issue that 
has ever been issued much better than the average environmental 
impact statement required by the environmental protection agency 
he said 
hunter teer and north carolina state forestry professor richard 
lancia said they told the task force about three weeks ago that the 
thomas recommendations are the minimum necessary to protect the 
rare owl 
the fourth scientist who appeared before the task force jim 
carr of virginia polytechnic institute could not be reached for 
comment on tuesday but the other three said he agreed with them 
this is a precedentsetting report in that the thomas 
committee has in effect been able or been willing to sacrifice 
about half of the habitat to preserve the other half said teer 
past president of the wildlife society a 9000member association 
of professional biologists 
the task force is scheduled to announce on saturday its 
recommendations to protect the rare owl while minimizing the 
economic impact on the northwests timber industry

the defense department has nearly doubled the 
estimated cost of the desert shield deployment of us forces in 
saudi arabia putting it at 25 billion a spokesman said today 
the sharply increased costs up from an earlier estimate of 13 
billion can be attributed to the expense of calling up reserve and 
national guard forces increased operations for ships and aircraft 
and increased fuel costs said pentagon spokesman pete williams 
other factors include increases in the number of c130 aircraft 
in the gulf region and an increases in the number of aircraft 
carrier battle groups deployed there williams said 
the cost estimate includes 113 billion for the army 494 
million for the navy 556 million for defense agencies and 300 
million to account for the increased fuel prices

premier andrei lukanov on tuesday 
assailed police idleness at a fire that gutted the ruling socialist 
party headquarters but said it may be the price we have to pay 
for avoiding clashes with protesters 
there is no justification for me for this lack of efficiency 
or passivity that was demonstrated by the forces of order said 
lukanov who has demanded a government probe of the sunday night 
blaze 
witnesses said police stood by for the first hour of the fire 
started by a small group of demonstrators who broke away from a 
larger protest police eventually cleared a path for firefighters 
who found that many of their hoses had been cut 
the fire has been condemned by both anticommunist leaders and 
officials at the socialist party the name adopted last year by the 
former communist party but the two groups traded charges about who 
was responsible 
lukanov said the blaze would be investigated by police 
authorities while a a separate probe is conducted by the national 
assembly 
he said the governments policy of great restraint since a 
november 1989 party coup could explain some of the inaction by 
police at the fire scene 
for a long time it worked he said 
on nov 10 1989 longtime communist strongman todor zhivkov was 
toppled in a party unheaval reportedly led by lukanov former 
president petar mladenov and defense minister dobri dzhurov 
the headquarters fire is the price we have to pay for the 
policy of avoiding open physical clashes between civilians and the 
militia lukanov said 
the socialist party won national elections two months ago but 
its popularity has fallen because of bulgarias deteriorating 
economy many items are rationed or in short supply 
on monday socialist party chief alexander lilov blamed the fire 
on extremists among the political opposition addressing the 
national assembly on tuesday lilov said he detected the 
beginning of neofascism and predicted political extremism 
may throw the country into civil war 
the union of democratic forces a 16party opposition alliance 
denied responsibility 
some opposition figures have suggested the socialists could have 
started the fire in an attempt to discredit the protesters filip 
bokov a member of the socialist partys supreme council termed 
the allegation preposterous 
udf officials said they would look into reports that konstantin 
trenchev leader of the opposition podkrepa labor federation 
issued an ultimatum before the fire for the removal of the red 
star the symbol of communist power from atop the headquarters 
if facts prove that trenchev or in fact any other person 
contributed to sunday nights events we are of the opinion that 
such a person has no place in the udf spokesman stoyan ganev 
said

the burden of medicare reimbursement paperwork 
will shift next week from patients to physicians 
many physicians who dont already submit reimbursement claims 
for their elderly and disabled patients on medicare see a clerical 
nightmare ahead 
but advocates for the elderly see the change as needed relief 
from confusing and timeconsuming paperwork that so confounds some 
medicare beneficiaries that they dont file for benefits they are 
owed 
the paperwork burden on medicare beneficiaries has been 
tremendous said horace deets executive director of the american 
association of retired persons now medicare beneficiaries will 
receive the benefits to which they are entitled without having to 
deal with burdensome paperwork 
a physician payment review commission poll in 1988 found nearly 
one in 10 medicare beneficiaries did not file a medicare claim for 
at least one bill they paid that year most often they said the 
forms were too complicated 
these unfiled claims amounted to between 90 million and 130 
million the commission estimated 
most of the estimated 450 million medicare part b claims 
expected to be filed this fiscal year will have been submitted by 
physicians or medical suppliers said barbara gagel the government 
official responsible for implementing the new provision 
about 10 percent of the bills are submitted by patients 
themselves but medicare officials do not know how many physicians 
this represents 
congress approved the change in filing requirements last year 
without much discussion and some lawmakers now say it wasnt a 
wise idea 
rep joe kolter dpa who introduced a bill last may to repeal 
the filing change has received many letters from medicare 
recipients as well as physicians who oppose the change 
we think its an unnecessary burden on physicians said bob 
powers kolters senior legislative assistant 
weve gotten a lot of mail from medicare recipients who are 
insulted because they feel the provision implies that they cant 
fill out the forms themselves powers said they want to do it 
themselves usually because they can do it faster than a 
physicians office staff can 
physicians will have up to a year to file claims less than half 
the time now allowed failure to file would mean 1000 fine for 
each violation 
doctors and suppliers cannot charge medicare patients for 
preparing and filing claim forms but as is the case now they can 
require payment from the patient at the time of service 
physicians generally dont foresee lengthy filing delays 
although they expect the added work will increase their costs 
forcing them to hire extra clerical help or buy computers to handle 
the chore 
this is one of those instances where someone is trying to fix 
something that wasnt broken in the first place said dr joseph 
f boyle executive vice president of the american society of 
internal medicine 
dr norton j greenberger president of the american college of 
physicians the largest professional organization of internists 
said the change has a desirable goal of easing the paperwork 
burden on patients it also will encourage electronic billing and 
could speed payments he said 
but some physicians see the change as further intrusion by the 
government into their office practices he said 
initially at least the government will accept a bill filed by a 
medicare patient when the beneficiary is paid medicare officials 
will inform him or her that the physician is supposed to file 
claims said gagel an official of the department of health and 
human services 
the impact on physicians will vary from state to state an 
informal sampling by insurance carriers that process medicare 
claims suggests it will have the most impact in oregon where the 
proportion of doctors who dont file patient claims was estimated 
at about 30 percent she said 
indiana and colorado were next with 13 percent and 12 percent 
respectively at the other end was massachusetts where nearly all 
physicians already file medicare forms for their patients gagel 
said

the united states recorded its smallest 
quarterly trade deficit in 6 years in the spring the government 
reported tuesday but analysts forecast widening deficits in coming 
months as the persian gulf crisis boosts americas foreign oil bill 
the commerce department said the trade gap from april through 
june narrowed a sharp 141 percent to 226 billion reflecting a 
big drop in oil prices and a record level for us exports sales 
americas trade performance has been the one bright spot in a 
generally lackluster economy this year and the bush administration 
had been counting on further trade gains to keep the country out of 
a recession 
however since iraqs invasion of kuwait many private 
economists fear that an economic slump is imminent as an already 
weak us economy succumbs to an oilprice shock that sends 
inflation surging and reverses the trade improvement 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said he believed 
a mild recession would begin in the octoberdecember quarter and 
last for two quarters 
he forecast that the us trade deficit would widen sharply in 
the current quarter and the final three months of the year 
reflecting higher oil prices 
the problems in the middle east just added to the other 
problems the economy was facing wyss said trade is going to 
get worse before it starts getting better again 
even though oil prices retreated somewhat monday the price of a 
42gallon barrel of crude on the world market still stands about 35 
percent higher than it did aug 1 the day before iraqs invasion 
david steinberg an economist at merrill lynch predicted that 
the increase in oil prices would add between 6 billion and 75 
billion to the quarterly deficit figure 
steinberg said it was too soon to predict whether the oil runup 
will be enough to trigger a recession or simply leave economic 
growth at a near standstill 
although this event is smaller than oil shocks in the past it 
comes at a time when the economy was already quite weak 
steinberg said 
the 226 billion trade deficit in the third quarter was down 
37 billion from a first quarter gap of 263 billion it was the 
lowest quarterly imbalance since a 213 billion shortfall in the 
last three months of 1983 
in the second quarter us imports fell 26 percent to 11932 
billion an improvement of 32 billion with a big 35 billion 
drop in the foreign oil bill being partially offset by a 300 
million rise in nonoil imports 
us exports were up 480 million to a record level of 967 
billion besting the old mark of 963 billion set in the first 
three months this year 
the trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports 
tuesdays report on merchandise trade calculated on a 
balanceofpayments basis confirmed trends noted in the 
departments monthly trade reports although the figures were 
slightly different because the quarterly report excludes military 
sales by the us government and makes other minor adjustments 
petroleum imports which had risen sharply in the first quarter 
fell by 22 percent to 121 billion the average price per barrel 
decreased to 1581 down from 1947 in the first quarter 
the import volume decreased as well in the second quarter to 
841 million barrels down from 89 million barrels in the first 
quarter 
while the price of oil surged to nearly 32 per barrel last 
week it was trading at around 27 per barrel tuesday 
the small rise in us export sales came from higher 
manufacturing exports offsetting a drop in farm sales nonfarm 
exports rose by 11 billion with increases recorded for automotive 
products consumer goods and civilian aircraft 
agricultural exports fell 6 percent to 103 billion with 
wheat corn soybeans and cotton sales all declining 
as usual the biggest imbalance occurred with japan a deficit 
of 104 billion up slightly from a 103 billion first quarter 
deficit 
the united states posted a rare 15 billion second quarter 
surplus with western europe up from a 400 million surplus in the 
first quarter 
analysts predicted the surpluses with western europe would 
continue in part because the us dollar has been declining in 
value in relation to the west german mark a weaker dollar makes 
us products more competitive

president mikhail s gorbachev beefed up his press 
office tuesday by naming a wellrespected soviet magazine editor as 
his personal assistant and chief spokesman 
vitaly n ignatenko was slated to give his first press briefing 
in the newly influential post wednesday he is editor of the new 
times magazine which under his stewardship has played a 
significant role in gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
ignatenko is expected to play a larger role in policymaking 
than either his predecessor arkady maslennikov or his american 
counterpart marlin fitzwater 
ignatenko 49 who speaks some english is one of a handful of 
top soviet journalists who reputedly have enjoyed regular access to 
gorbachev and gained his confidence 
one sign of his influence is his title assistant to the 
president and head of the presidential press service the assistant 
to the president designation is new 
maslennikov whose performance was widely viewed as lackluster 
has returned to his former position as press aide to the chairman 
of the supreme soviet legislature he was on vacation and could not 
be reached for comment 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov who 
announced the changes at a news conference said maslennikov would 
begin working for anatoly lukyanov gorbachevs successor as 
supreme soviet chairman 
gerasimov himself was the top soviet spokesman until he was 
pushed out of the limelight when gorbachev elevated maslennikov 
maslennikov developed a reputation among both soviet and foreign 
reporters in moscow for being difficult to reach and not returning 
phone calls he also made some high profile mistakes such as 
failing to put down a rumor about gorbachevs health during his 
june summit meeting with president bush 
asked at a press conference in washington whether it was true 
gorbachev planned to undergo testing for diabetes in minnesota 
maslennikov replied that there were many scientific experts in 
minnesota with whom the soviet leader might consult his answer 
allowed the rumor to live for several hours before being firmly 
denied by other soviet officials 
ignatenko has a reputation for accessibility and clarity 
he is easygoing with a very good sense of humor said his 
deputy at novoye vremya new times aleksandr pumpyansky but 
hes also a professional journalist whose language is very precise 
he knows all the nuances 
born in the black sea resort of sochi ignatenko graduated from 
the journalism department of moscow state university and worked for 
15 years at komsolskaya pravda the communist youth league 
newspaper rising from cub reporter to deputy editor in chief 
in 1975 he switched to tass the official soviet new agency 
where he served as deputy general director 1978 he then worked for 
the communist party central committee serving as deputy chief of 
its international information department until being named editor 
of new times four years ago 
the weekly magazine which is published in russian and several 
other languages including english has published articles critical 
of the soviet military and some of its allies such as cuba this 
summer it carried a revisionist history of the korean war laying 
considerable blame on the north korean side for the first time

cowboys and golfers can phone home these 
days without getting off their horses or out of their golf carts 
and the convenience will be extended soon to bikers and boaters 
its all part of a program launched by southwestern bell 
telephone co this summer to make things easier for people on the 
go 
for starters the company has installed three pay telephones 80 
inches off the ground at the lazy e arena near guthrie the 
worlds largest privately owned indoor rodeo arena the height is 
perfect for mounted cowboys who are beckoned by phone from 
horse signs 
at westwood park golf course in norman golfers can drive right 
up to a phone near the 15th tee to take or make calls that phone 
is 50 inches off the ground just right for someone seated in a 
golf cart 
the states first phone from bike will be installed next week 
along the arkansas river in tulsa phone company officials said 
bikers can talk in comfort on the 50inch high phone without 
resorting to a kickstand 
in addition the company plans to install 36inch high phones 
soon at docks at one or two oklahoma lakes so boaters can make 
calls without disembarking 
the phone company has long been offering roadside telephones 
suited for people seated in their cars but the new phones for 
sporting people are unique to oklahoma for now said dennis smiley 
a southwestern bell spokesman 
its kind of what you call grass roots ingenuity or employee 
innovation this is where the idea originated so this is where its 
starting smiley said adding that other state divisions of st 
louisbased southwestern bell could adopt the program if they like 
it 
it comes down to basic customer interest and economy if 
people start using phones from cars and boats and golf carts i 
guarantee it will spread he said 
sue ball the phone companys marketing manager predicts the 
best success from the golf course telephones i really expect it 
to take off big and i really wouldnt be surprised if the phone 
from boat isnt popular too she said 
the first phones for people on the go were at the horse arena 
and were installed at the suggestion of a contractor 
it went over so big we started thinking of all kinds of 
transportation people have and tried to adapt our signs ms 
ball said 
she expects to hear any day now from oklahoma city officials 
about permission for the first phone from boat installation at lake 
hefner 
if that works she plans a second one at grand lake in 
northeastern oklahoma 
obviously oklahoma has people on the move people dont sit 
around with their feet up all weekend a lot of the times they 
spend that time mobile pursuing recreational interests but they 
want to have access smiley said

prodemocracy activists accused the ruling 
party tuesday of harassment after police refused to give them 
permission to hold a mass rally this weekend 
vernon mwaanga a spokesman for prodemocracy campaigners 
charged that ruling party officials have intimidated opposition 
supporters he said thugs and hooligans tore down posters 
announcing upcoming rallies 
mwaanga described the postponement of saturdays rally as an 
attempt to frustrate the opposition campaign for a multiparty 
democracy in this oneparty state the rally was rescheduled sept 
8 
mwaanga said heads of the frontline african states bordering 
south africa are to meet in lusaka on saturday and police said they 
did not have the manpower to supervise both events simultaneously 
it has been a consistent feature of our campaign that the 
authorities have frustrated our efforts to hold meetings mwaanga 
said 
in a separate press statement tuesday arthur wina chairman of 
the national interim committee for multiparty democracy said he 
was disappointed that the government continued to operate on the 
basis of giving priority to foreign and international images rather 
than domestic affairs and national welfare 
earlier tuesday a longtime political associate of president 
kenneth kaunda said he would aggressively campaign to end oneparty 
rule 
legislator humphrey mulemba a former ruling party 
secretarygeneral told reporters in lusaka the scrapping of the 
oneparty system was vital for the future wellbeing of zambia one 
of africas poorest nations 
it is time we had political structural changes by removing 
oneparty and introduce multiparty politics in zambia he said 
as secretarygeneral of the ruling party for four years mulemba 
was no 2 in the party hierarchy after kaunda 
he is the second ruling party legislator to openly attack 
oneparty rule 
with immediate effect i am going public and i am appealing to 
all zambians for support he said 
kaunda imposed a oneparty system in 1973 when his ruling 
united national independence party became the only legal political 
organization in zambia 
mulemba blamed oneparty rule for inertia corruption and lack 
of competition 
on monday frederick chiluba head of the powerful zambia 
congress of trade unions made his strongest attack yet against the 
ruling party 
addressing prodemocracy supporters chiluba accused kaunda of 
being a dictator and criticized the ruling party for being out of 
touch with the people 
a referendum on the political future of zambia is scheduled aug

most agriculture department workers would be 
laid off if congress and the white house fail to solve the 
governments budget problems a report showed tuesday 
there would be lower subsidies for major commodities and needy 
farmers would have less of a chance to get housing and operating 
loans the report said 
perhaps as many as 90000 employees roughly 90 percent of the 
departments permanent work force would be affected one way or 
another by the layoffs 
it would affect chicken inspectors and economists scientists 
and file clerks highly paid executives and those at the bottom of 
the scale the report warned 
layoff notices have been sent out to 24 million federal 
employees in case congress and the bush administration dont come 
up with an 11thhour rescue for the fiscal year that will begin 
oct 1 
under the grammrudman deficitreduction law an 
acrosstheboard cut of federal spending has been ordered by the 
white house to begin oct 15 if no budget agreement is reached 
about 229 billion of usdas projected outlays would be 
affected food stamps and child nutrition programs generally are 
exempt from the cuts 
the usda study anticipates cuts of 319 percent or 73 billion 
from affected programs 
farm price support payments and many other usda loan and grant 
programs would be severely reduced the report said 
the report added the necessity to lay off employees would 
disrupt usda services throughout the world and especially at usda 
county offices throughout rural america producers and industries 
dependent on the availability of usda programs and services would 
be severely affected 
for example socalled deficiency payments to farmers for next 
year have been projected at about 3 billion and a 319 percent 
cut would be more than 900 million 
dairy farmers would be assessed approximately 87 percent per 
100 pounds of milk marketed which would reduce cash receipts by 
nearly 130 million 
in state and county offices of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service where the programs are 
administered salaries and expenses would be reduced by the same 
percentage more than 20300 employees of the county offices would 
be furloughed offices would be closed mondays and fridays 
stephen b dewhurst the departments budget director said he 
and others in the office had received letters that they would be 
furloughed three days out of every 10 
you can get a 5050 bet i suppose from people who think it 
wont happen at all and those who think cuts will be 40 
percent dewhurst said 
the office of management and budget has already boosted its 
estimate of spending cuts to 324 percent and dewhurst said that 
could balloon further 
only about 600 million of the 23 billion in food programs 
would be subject to the cuts 
food stamps alone account for around 16 billion or so but the 
current food stamp law runs out in 1991 
if as everybody expects the food stamp program is 
reauthorized it will drive federal spending up dewhurst said 
youd see the cuts go to somewhere between 38 and 40 percent 
that would put a further bite on commodity price support 
operations the farmers home administration food aid to foreign 
countries conservation research and the other eligible programs

president saddam hussein announced today 
that all women and children foreigners in iraq are free to leave 
the country on wednesday the iraqi news agency said 
in a decree issued tuesday saddam said that all women and 
children who are foreigners in iraq are allowed to move freely in 
iraq or to travel whenever they want starting tomorrow including 
the families iraq is hosting according to the news agency the 
report was monitored in nicosia 
it was not immediately clear how many women and children there 
are among the 500 american hostages in iraq it also was not known 
if the decree would apply to the 2500 american hostages in kuwait 
baghdad whose troops overran kuwait on aug 2 now considers its 
oilrich neighbor part of iraq 
the announcement followed a televised meeting saddam held with a 
group of foreign families earlier tuesday 
during the meeting a woman with a british accent asked saddam 
why he was using foreign children in something they cant 
understand 
the iraqi president gave a long answer in which he repeated that 
his hand was being forced by the western troops massing in the 
region iraq has moved some of the hostages to military sites to 
prevent an attack on them 
but the iraqi news agency report on saddams decree said it was 
issued because of the concern expressed by the foreign families 
about their children during the meeting tuesday with the foreign 
hostages 
the report said the fate of the foreign women and children is 
now a humane issue that transcends the earlier reason for holding 
them as hostages 
during the meeting with the foreign families saddam also said 
he was willing to discuss the persian gulf crisis with president 
bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
saddam said he was ready and prepared for direct talks with 
mr bush and mrs thatcher let us have the debate between me 
and them on television for the whole world to see 
the united states quickly rejected the offer a spokeswoman for 
mrs thatcher repeated the firm policy of britain and the united 
states that iraq must withdraw its troops from kuwait before talks 
can begin

iraqi president saddam hussein today said women and children 
foreigners can leave the country and he was ready for direct talks 
with president bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
in other developments baghdad tightened its grip on kuwait by 
declaring it a 19th province and an american civilian died in iraq 
apparently one of 63 americans who were rounded up for use as human 
shields against attack 
saddam issued a decree that all women and children who are 
foreigners in iraq are allowed to move freely in iraq or to travel 
whenever they want starting tomorrow including the families iraq 
is hosting the iraqi news agency said in a report monitored in 
nicosia 
about 500 americans are being held captive in iraq it was not 
know if the decree applied to the 2500 american hostages in 
kuwait baghdad whose troops overran kuwait on aug 2 now 
considers its oilrich neighbor part of iraq 
saddam offered to meet with bush and mrs thatcher while 
visiting with several foreign families held hostage in iraq the 
meeting was shown on staterun iraqi tv and was saddams second 
televised meeting with hostages 
the iraqi president said he was ready and prepared for direct 
talks with mr bush and mrs thatcher let us have the debate 
between me and them on television for the whole world to see 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
quickly dismissed saddams offer saying its sick and it 
doesnt even deserve a response come on there is nothing to 
debate 
a spokeswoman for mrs thatcher said britain was unlikely to 
agree to talks unless iraq withdraws its troops from kuwait 
the nationalities of the foreigners shown with saddam today were 
not known one woman who asked a question spoke with a british 
accent and another indicated he was from france 
it also was know known when or where the meeting occurred but 
the iraqi news agency said saddam used the meeting to free one 
british family and order that it be sent home 
saddam said he understood the families felt restricted but that 
iraq needed to hold them to prevent an attack by usled forces 
sent to the gulf to prevent iraqi troops that overran kuwait from 
invading saudi arabia 
last week saddam was shown meeting with foreign hostages on 
iraqi television patting the heads of small boys and posing for a 
group photograph the broadcast was sharply criticized by world 
leaders who demanded that he let the foreigners go and stop using 
them for propaganda purposes 
earlier today shipping sources said us navy warships 
enforcing the un embargo against iraq stopped two cargo ships and 
crewmen boarded one in the gulf of aqaba before allowing them to 
proceed to jordan 
it was believed to be the first time a ship was boarded and 
inspected by the us navy since the embargo began shortly after 
iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
also today the soviet union criticized the united states for 
expelling iraqi diplomats from washington and warned that such 
action could lead to a spiral of escalation in the conflict 
but foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov also indicated 
that some of iraqs arab neighbors have failed to put enough 
pressure on baghdad in response to its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the developments came as un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said he was intervening with iraq to try to defuse the gulf 
crisis 
president bush said he was pessimistic about the un initiative 
the peace effort however was enough to make stock markets 
rally in tokyo and london stock prices slipped slightly on wall 
street 
gold whose value increases in times of turmoil plunged about 
19 to 39255 an ounce today on londons gold exchange oil prices 
also fell 
in vienna 10 of the 13 opec ministers tentatively backed a deal 
that would permit increased oil production by saudi arabia 
venezuela and some other nations to help offset losses arising from 
the gulf crisis 
but the ministers delayed until wednesday a formal meeting 
expected to give final approval to the agreement until messages had 
been sent to iraq and libya whose representatives did not attend 
the meeting 
in baghdad the press attache at the us embassy stephen 
thibeault said that according to the iraqis an american had died 
in basra a southern port in iraq he said the 56yearold man 
apparently died of a heart attack and was believed one of those 
who had been detained by the iraqis 
saddam has said he is rounding up westerners and placing them at 
key military and civilian installations as protection against an 
attack by the usled multinational force deploying in the gulf 
region 
thibeault in a telephone interview from baghdad said there was 
no positive identification on the american because we have not 
been given access to the american citizen yet the iraqi 
authorities have said that they would allow us to participate in 
any autopsy 
asked about life in baghdad thibeault said the american 
diplomats here as of this moment are being accorded the same 
diplomatic priviliges that weve had over the last few months 
asked if the atmosphere in iraq worries him he said 
nothing specific other than being in a country where people 
are not allowed to travel freely and leave the country i think 
that any thinking person would be concerned about those 
circumstances 
meanwhile 52 dependents of us diplomats who were evacuated 
from the american embassy in kuwait arrived in paris today on their 
way home from turkey three young men from the group were not 
allowed to leave iraq 
a furious united states saying iraq had once again reneged on 
its pledge that all the dependents could go free swiftly ordered 
36 iraqi embassy staff members in washington expelled from the 
united states and imposed travel limits on the 19 envoys allowed to 
remain 
i talked to the doctors everyone was in great shape said 
us embassy spokesman paul kozelka who met with some of the tired 
americans at charles de gaulleroissy airport before the plane 
continued on to the united states 
the state department said monday it could not confirm us media 
reports that iraqi ship captains had been ordered not to resist if 
their vessels are stopped and searched by warships enforcing the 
un embargo 
but iraqs ambassador to the united states mohammed sadiq 
almashat seemed to confirm the reports in an interview on abcs 
nightline 
we are doing our best ourselves to defuse the tension i 
mean the order that we have given to the captains of the ship not 
to resist he said 
the londonbased lloyds shipping agency which monitors 
maritime traffic worldwide said the us navy boarded the 
greekowned container ship zorba express and stopped the indian 
owned vessel kalidas on monday near the mouth to the gulf of aqaba 
both ships were allowed to proceed when the navy determined the 
cargoes were not bound for iraq 
diplomats and shipping executives said that previously the us 
navy simply radioed ships demanding to know their nationality 
cargo and destination however the us navy also fired warning 
shots across the bows of two iraqi tankers early in the crisis 
both refused to stop 
lloyds also said that on sunday the us navy denied the french 
container ship paris entry into the gulf of aqaba 
iraqi newspapers today published saddams decree turning kuwait 
into an iraqi province the newspapers did not say when he issued 
the decree which created the province of kuwait iraqs 
longstanding claim to kuwait is based on the fact that during the 
ottoman empire kuwait was part of the basra governate and the 
british split it up after world war i 
in washington the white house condemned iraq for making kuwait 
a province the reaction is quite obvious said spokesman roman 
popadiuk the annexation is null and void the whole united 
nations has spoken on it and thats it

after five years in kuwait ray shoopman had finally glimpsed 
the day when every spare penny wouldnt have to be reinvested in 
his fledgling construction company what he didnt see was iraqs 
saddam hussein on the horizon 
within a matter of a few hours it all changed shoopman 
said tuesday we had no intentions of leaving when we did but 
when youre in a position like that youre ready to leave 
everything behind 
for the american families who abandoned their adoptive homes in 
the middle east the past weeks are frighteningly fresh and the 
immediate future painfully uncertain they are feeling their way 
tentatively beyond disorientation 
instead of building up his business shoopman is picking up the 
pieces in the scramble to escape occupied kuwait the 50yearold 
instructed his family to pack only essentials water a change of 
clothes birth certificates 
he his wife daughter and two grandchildren arrived in alabama 
on aug 24 with little more than a suitcase each and 60 days to 
repay a 10000 emergency loan from the us government 
repatriation loans are made to destitute americans for a 
oneway ticket home said aleta wenger a state department 
spokeswoman in washington dc 
arrangements are made to pay that amount of support back 
and until they complain that they cant pay it back within 60 days 
theres no real reason to be flexible she said its a 
waitandsee kind of thing 
shoopman had no choice but to borrow the money when his family 
shaken and weary crossed into saudi arabia they needed a place to 
bathe and a flight home the hotel and airfare costs mounted 
quickly 
we asked if we can make a payment schedule but they said 
theyll charge an interest rate shoopman said still he didnt 
think twice about taking the financial aid 
you dont think about materialistic things when youre in a 
position like that shoopman said we didnt have time to think 
about it 
but with time to reflect reality has begun catching up 
shoopman thinks of the fax machine computer and business files 
ditched along with the rest of the familys possessions he 
imagines iraqi troops using the crane and frontend loaders his 
employees had to abandon in the invasion 
we had signed contracts to export cement from iraq he said 
were talking about 600000 tons of cement and fiveyear 
contracts it looked like everything was going to turn out real 
nice and then this happened 
now its catch as catch can shoopman is looking up old friends 
in decatur ala in the hopes of finding a job he and his family 
are also remembering their desert journey the gunfire and bedouin 
friends who led them to safety 
scores of americans hit the ground running after saddam invaded 
aug 2 now some are trying to outrun a new set of problems 
stephanie atieh spent part of monday standing in line for aid 
from family services she has three young children is six months 
pregnant and worried halfsick about the safety of her jordanian 
husband and his family in kuwait 
the couples comfortable fourbedroom life on the fringe of 
kuwait city disappeared without warning before they had a chance 
to prepare 
we went to sleep on a wednesday night and by thursday our 
whole world was destroyed mrs atieh said tuesday from 
stewartsville texas we didnt have any money except what was in 
our pockets because the banks closed down immediately 
mrs atieh her mother and children reached the jordanian border 
via a backroads route through iraq but once there they found 
themselves temporarily at a deadend 
it took us a week to get money for oneway tickets back to 
the united states and the papers say you have to pay it back in 60 
days which is impossible right now mrs atieh said 
i owe the government 4000 and my mother owes a little more 
than 1000 mrs atieh said they want us to pay back the 
money but were refugees we had some money but now its gone

president bush told an unusual gathering of 
lawmakers today that steps were under way to make the sanctions 
against iraq as watertight as possible and warned baghdad 
let no one abroad doubt our national unity or our staying power 
it was bushs first meeting with members of congress since 
american troops were deployed to saudi arabia in a crisis triggered 
aug 2 when iraq invaded the the neighboring oilrich emirate of 
kuwait as white house aides scoffed at baghdads declaration that 
kuwait had been incorporated as a province of iraq bush reiterated 
his demand that iraq withdraw and reinstate the kuwaiti government 
to power 
bush hailed the tightening of the united nations embargo against 
iraq as further evidence that iraq cannot benefit from this 
illegal occupation 
iraqi oil no longer flows through pipelines in turkey and 
saudi arabia the president said today reports indicate that 
traffic through aqaba jordan has come virtually to a halt and 
us naval forces sail with navies of many other states to make 
these sanctions as water tight as possible 
with many thousands of american soldiers now deployed in saudi 
arabia bush said iraq would pay a stiff price by trying to hold 
on and an even stiffer price by widening the conflict 
he also repeated that he would hold iraq responsible for the 
safety of americans it has taken hostage in kuwait and iraq 
with that bush ended brief public remarks and went into 
executive session to brief lawmakers privately and field their 
questions 
the ranking democrat house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
was asked whether congress supports bushs middle east policy and 
answered yes 
interrupting his vacation in maine bush returned to the white 
house and met in the cabinet room with top congressional leaders 
before addressing a larger gathering of about 150 lawmakers 
returned from vacations of their own 
earlier in maine saddam husseins decree turning kuwait into 
iraqs 19th province was dismissed by white house aides 
the reaction is quite obvious said presidential spokesman 
roman popadiuk the annexation is null and void the whole united 
nations has spoken on it and thats it 
the president who has bristled at criticism that he should be 
spending more time in washington during the crisis planned to stay 
in the nations capital until late thursday before resuming his 
vacation 
he denied that his trip to washington was a response to that 
criticism or that his time spent in maine fishing playing golf 
and boating was detracting from his ability to deal with the iraqi 
crisis 
ive been able to keep in very close touch he said monday 
during a joint news conference with canadian prime minister bryan 
mulroney outside his oceanfront vacation home were making a lot 
of international phone calls that you wouldnt normally expect at 
the time of a vacation 
he cited the time he spends with key aides and meetings like 
those with mulroney and a session last week with jordans king 
hussein 
were on top of the situation i think the american people 
understand that bush said 
this afternoon bush met first with top house and senate 
leaders then with members of the house and senate armed services 
foreign affairs appropriations and intelligence committees 
it is most understandable that they want to know what is going 
on and get up to speed on things bush said so i welcome 
this 
also briefing the members were defense secretary dick cheney 
cia director william webster secretary of state james a baker iii 
who cut short a wyoming vacation and joint chiefs of staff 
chairman colin powell 
in advance of todays meeting with bush sen claiborne pell 
dri chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said 
public support for keeping us troops in the inhospitable saudi 
desert might evaporate if the united states is the only country 
willing to put at risk a sizable ground force to defend the entire 
worlds interests 
that is not a sustainable condition pell wrote in a weekend 
newspaper column 
and sen alfonse damato rny among a group of senators that 
visited saudi arabia earlier this week said at some point we 
have to realize the waiting game works against us i dont think 
the american public is going to stand for waiting six or seven 
months 
lawmakers return to washington early next month hearings on 
various aspects of the crisis are certain

operation desert shield will cost an estimated 
25 billion through the end of september nearly double the 
earlier estimate of 13 billion the pentagon said tuesday 
the sharply higher costs are attributed to the expense of 
calling up reserve and national guard forces increased operations 
for ships and aircraft and increased fuel costs said spokesman 
pete williams 
other factors include increases in the number of c130 aircraft 
in the persian gulf region and increases in the number of aircraft 
carrier battle groups deployed there williams said 
the cost estimate includes 113 billion for the army 494 
million for the navy 556 million for the air force 20 million 
for defense agencies and 300 million for increased fuel prices 
reporting on its reserve call up the pentagon said that by the 
end of the month it will have activated 14129 people in hundreds 
of army air force navy and coast guard units across the country 
the total includes 
air force 7386 including 616 from air force reserve units 
386 from the air national guard and 6384 air force reservists who 
werent formally activated but who volunteered for duty in the gulf 
crisis 
navy 2236 sailors from 127 units will be activated by months 
end 
army 4236 soldiers activated so far including 542 national 
guardsmen from 19 units and 3694 army reservists from 34 units 
coast guard 271 personnel 
the pentagon said additional expenses include the cost of 
calling up reservists up to a total of 48200 the cost of the 
call up the operations of the reserve forces and their subsistence 
is estimated at 347 million through september it said 
it pegged at 175 million the cost incurred due to the increased 
tempo of flying time and ship use the pentagon noted that the 
number of deployed carrier battle groups in the area of the arabian 
peninsula will increase to three from 1 
the pentagon also said the 51 c130 transport planes in use in 
the crisis will more than double to 112 aircraft by the end of 
september 
deployment of us forces is proving costly the pentagon said 
eight fast sealift sl7 ships with crews and equipment 34 
million 
sixteen rollon rolloff ships and 20 cargo ships moved out of 
the ready reserve fleet to active operations 95 million 
the use of commercial and government cargo aircraft 484 
million 
the deploying of two navy prepositioned ships for aviation 
logistics support 9 million 
onetime costs at various military installations to prepare 
units for deployment 135 million 
the pentagon said two hospital ships had been equipped and 
deployed at a cost of 10 million and that it has spent 30 
million for medical supplies and 85 million for chemical 
protective clothing camouflage uniforms nets and chemicalagent 
resistant paint 
support for water equipment sanitation supplies and other 
consumables has cost 250 million it said 
the pentagon said that while its operating costs are increasing 
dramatically because of the desert shield operation it faces a 35 
percent reduction in operating appropriations if congress and the 
white house fail to reach a budget agreement by oct 1 thereby 
avoiding the automatic cuts required by the grammrudman deficit 
reduction act

the skeleton is made up of eight separate pieces of plaster 
containing the hip the back the head a shin the right foot the 
left foots toes a section of the tail alone and a section of the 
tail containing the lower jaw

a tiny school district once so broke 
it gave teachers ious instead of paychecks is now so flush it gives 
1000 to each collegebound student 
this district was down and out but we came back when 
everybody gave up on us said peter corona superintendent of the 
525student emery unified school district we showed that success 
begins at home the good old ethic of hard work dedication 
commitment and the will and desire to succeed and overcome all 
odds 
the scholarship believed to be the first of its kind in the 
country helps make college possible for students in this 
lowincome district between berkeley and oakland 
the gifts first provided to the class of 1989 are just one 
example of the districts remarkable recovery from financial 
adversity eight years ago emery unified had a 24 percent budget 
deficit the largest ever of any district in california that 
threatened its very existence 
the district in this bayside industrial town of 4800 was once 
wealthy but a 1972 change in the way state property tax is 
allocated left emery unified with less money and the district got 
into trouble because over 10 years it didnt cut spending corona 
said 
corona discovered a 600000 shortfall 10 days after coming to 
the district as business manager in 1982 he boasts that emery 
unified now enjoys a 15 million reserve 35 percent of its 43 
million budget significantly higher test scores and improved 
morale 
but the rehabilitation took several years and had its price 
including a state loan teacher layoffs and deep cuts in programs 
the children have made sacrifices our staff has made 
sacrifices and our community has had to make sacrifices corona 
said 
the district borrowed 600000 from the state laid off 60 
percent of the staff postponed raises and sent principals back to 
the classroom it cut classes in art music homemaking french and 
shop and reduced such basics as english math social studies and 
physical education 
teachers doubled as custodians mowing lawns and fixing plumbing 
at the districts two schools corona became superintendent at the 
start of the 198283 school year remained business manager and 
served as principal of a high school 
for several months in 1983 the district was so strapped that it 
gave its teachers ious the first time a public agency in the state 
had done so since the depression 
some educators and parents suggested the district join one of 
its larger neighbors but emery unified began to recover paying 
back the state loan in three years two years early it rehired 
some teachers gave raises restored some cut programs and added 
new ones 
even today the district which employed 45 teachers before 
dropping to 17 in the 198384 school year only has 25 classroom 
teachers 
meanwhile test scores traditionally at the bottom have made 
big gains for example on the state achievement tests taken by 
eighthgraders reading scores rose from 194 in the 198384 school 
year to 251 last year math scores jumped from 190 to 402 and 
history scores increased from 184 to 367 and the dropout rate has 
fallen to near zero 
emery unified has been commended by us secretary of education 
lauro cavazos state and county education officials and school and 
taxpayers groups 
some of the accomplishments here i feel pretty proud of 
them said tom phan 17 a junior who worked on the high schools 
first hardcover yearbook in nearly a decade im glad im 
involved 
corona introduced the scholarship program during the 198889 
school year eleven of the 22 students in last years graduating 
class took the scholarship money 
these are families who are struggling to make ends meet 
usually not highly educated but who really want and expect a good 
education for their children and they should corona said 
natasha winfrey an 18yearold sophomore at the university of 
california davis said she and her family would have found a way 
to get her to college somehow but the districts gift helped eased 
her anxiety about money 
i was afraid i wouldnt be able to go to college she said 
so it made a difference if only to inspire me to get other 
things

an anthology of english poetry has 
been returned to the library 50 years and six days overdue 
the copy of wh audens the oxford book of light verse was 
returned monday said gloria garcia automation coordinator for the 
corpus christi public library 
we were in shock ms garcia said 
the datedue card was stamped aug 21 1940 it had been checked 
out from the old la retama library which was the citys central 
library for 75 years until 1986 when the corpus christi public 
library opened 
the tattered book was returned by an unidentified man described 
by a library worker as in his 30s 
he just said that he and his wife had been going through some 
stuff and found the book said joan roith a city reference 
librarian i teasingly asked if hed like to pay the fine and he 
just laughed 
the book was so old and moldy ms roith said the library 
probably wont put it back on the shelves let alone levy a fine 
the maximum fine would only have amounted to 447 or half the 
books current 895 purchase price said mark gretchen the 
librarys reference services manager 
the maximum fine we ever charge is half the price of the book 
because we dont want to discourage people from returning overdue 
books gretchen said 
since the library didnt retain its old records when it 
converted to a computerized checkout system two years ago the 
borrowers identity probably will remain a mystery 
even if we could identify him we couldnt divulge the name 
all of that is confidential gretchen said

a federal appeals court tuesday overturned a 
federal trade commission ruling that would have prevented states 
from banning such operations as shopping mall stores that combine 
optometric practice with eyeglass sales 
an agency may not exercise authority over states as sovereigns 
unless that authority has been unambiguously granted to it wrote 
circuit judge james buckley of the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia 
the ftc acted beyond its statutory authority in its 
socalled eyeglasses ii ruling last year he wrote in an opinion 
agreed to by chief judge patricia wald and circuit judge douglas h 
ginsburg 
if the court were to uphold eyeglasses ii in the face of 
congressional silence we would shortcircuit the protections 
offered states by the political process buckley wrote 
ftc attorney lawrence demillewagman said no decision had yet 
been reached on whether the commission would appeal the fact that 
the decision was unanimous is certainly a factor well have to 
take into account he said 
while demillewagman said he was not surprised by the ruling 
california deputy attorney general thomas s lazar who argued the 
case for the states sounded both stunned and ecstatic when he 
heard the news 
no kidding we won the case he shouted to coworkers in his 
san diego office oh how excellent how excellent i spent two 
years working on this case around the clock 
the ftcs ruling of march 1989 never took effect because the 
california state board of optometry and others sought and received 
a stay from the appellate court moments after the ruling would have 
become effective last sept 1 lazar said 
the states had imposed restrictions that in the words of the 
court decision tended to discourage the commercial practice of 
optometry such as partnerships between optometrists and laymen 
use of trade names and chain operations combining the practice of 
optometry with the sale of eyeglasses in shopping centers in 
favor of traditional optometric practice typified by sole 
practitioners operating in professional office buildings under 
their own names 
the ftc started investigating the stateimposed restrictions in 
the mid1970s the commissions findings published in 1980 
indicated that these restrictions resulted in higher prices and 
reduced the quality of eye care available to the public 
buckleys opinion noted 
nine years later the ftc voted for eyeglasses ii even though 
ftc chairman daniel oliver voted against it based on principles 
of federalism and his view that the ftc was without authority to 
promulgate it 
the state optometry boards agreed with oliver lazar said he 
argued that the ftc action was circumventing the national political 
process in other words ftc if you want to have this 
authority go across the street and get it from congress 
lazar who was the main attorney working on the appeal said 
california and 44 other states that imposed restrictions on 
optometric practices never moved against the type of eyeglass 
stores that exist in malls everywhere 
theres nothing wrong with them lazar said you walk in 
there with your prescription and you walk out with your glasses in 
an hour 
theyre opticians not optometrists he said theyre just 
people who dispense glasses after a prescription has been written 
by an optometrist 
what the states opposed was such practices as storefront 
operations in which nonoptometrists were writing and filling the 
prescriptions or where optometrists had an economic interest in 
selling eyeglasses

the projected value of us farm exports is 
holding steady at 40 billion despite a decline in the volume of 
wheat shipments the agriculture department said tuesday 
at 40 billion the value of agricultural exports for the fiscal 
year that began last oct 1 is up slightly from 396 billion in 
198889 the departments economic research service said total 
export quantity is expected to be 1485 million metric tons 
officials said that while the tonnage will be up from last year 
it is expected to be down from the 150 million tons forecast in may 
the new forecast is down because weaker prospects for wheat 
more than offset expected gains in corn soybeans and soybean 
meal the agency said in its report 
larger prospective crops in several major importing countries 
increased competitor supplies especially canada and buyers 
anticipation of even lower prices have led to sluggish us wheat 
and flour sales the report said 
but stronger demand for coarse grains by asian countries and 
mexico has boosted the export forecast for those commodities led 
by corn

president saddam hussein of iraq mingled with foreign hostages 
tuesday and then decreed that the women and children held captive 
in his country were free to leave 
a statement from the revolutionary command council said the 
decision was made to preserve the image of arabs the official 
iraqi news agency said 
the agency monitored in nicosia cyprus said the foreigners 
could leave starting wednesday it was not known how many women and 
children were among the hostages in iraq or whether the decree also 
applies to foreigners in kuwait 
there are 500 americans trapped in iraq and 2500 in kuwait 
the iraqi news agency said saddam made his decision after 
foreigners expressed concern about their children during tuesdays 
televised encounter a woman with a british accent asked saddam why 
he was using foreign children in something they cant 
understand 
at the same meeting saddam told the foreigners he was willing 
to talk to president bush and prime minister margaret thatcher on 
television about ending the persian gulf crisis 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler asked about 
saddams suggestion said its sick and it doesnt even deserve 
a response 
another department spokesman mark dillen said the us 
government had received no official word of the planned release of 
women and children we hope its true but we have seen promises 
and statements by iraq in the past that have proven false dillen 
said 
despite saddams conciliatory gestures baghdad hardened its 
position on kuwait declaring it a 19th province of iraq the white 
house condemned the move 
also tuesday us officials said an american civilian died of a 
heart attack in iraq the 56yearold man who was not identified 
was believed to be one of 63 americans rounded up and taken to 
strategic sites in iraq for use as human shields against attack 
ms tutwiler said the death underscores the barbaric nature of 
iraqi policy toward foreign nationals in iraq and kuwait and makes 
a lie of iraqs claim that they are all well treated and in no 
danger 
in other developments 
shipping sources said us navy warships stopped greek and 
indian cargo ships in the gulf of aqaba in the persian gulf and 
us crewmen boarded one before the ships were allowed to proceed 
to jordan 
it was believed to be the first time a ship was boarded and 
inspected by the us navy since a un embargo began shortly after 
iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
the soviet government said washingtons expulsion of iraqi 
diplomats could increase tensions in the conflict 
president bush headed back to washington from his vacation home 
in kennebunkport maine to brief congress on the gulf crisis he 
reiterated his demand that saddam withdraw from kuwait 
most opec ministers tentatively backed a deal that would permit 
increased oil production by saudi arabia venezuela and some other 
nations to help offset losses arising from the conflict the 
ministers delayed until wednesday a formal meeting to approve the 
agreement 
stock markets rallied in tokyo and london in response to an 
announcement by un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that 
he would meet thursday with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
stock prices slipped slightly on wall street 
the us armys heaviest ground firepower reached saudi arabia 
including dozens of m11p tanks and m2 bradley armored infantry 
fighting vehicles 
sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
urged egyptian president hosni mubarak to send more troops to saudi 
arabia to show solidarity with the united states 
saddams televised visit with foreigners was his second such 
appearance and apparently intended to convince western viewers that 
he is taking a reasonable stand in the crisis he was widely 
condemned for his first visit last week which was seen as a crude 
attempt to use the detainees for propaganda purposes 
the meeting was shown on iraqi television and broadcast by cable 
news network 
one of the hostages shown was american kevin bazner according 
to his sister patricia heath of farmington hills mich bazner 
his wife dawn and their two children were stranded after their 
plane stopped in kuwait to refuel during the aug 2 invasion im 
glad i got to see my brother im glad hes safe i hope dawn and 
the kids are safe too ms heath told cnn 
it was not immediately clear what countries the other foreigners 
were from or when and where the meeting occurred one woman who 
asked a question spoke with a british accent another indicated he 
was from france 
the families appeared uncomfortable as they listened to saddams 
rambling statement through a translator saddam said he was ready 
and prepared for direct talks with mr bush and mrs thatcher 
let us have the debate between me and them on television for the 
whole world to see 
both the us and british governments have said iraq must pull 
out of kuwait before negotiations take place

in its report on saddams meeting with foreigners the iraqi 
news agency said the president ordered that one british family be 
allowed to return home on the occasion of a childs birthday there 
was no mention of that in the tv broadcast 
saddam was shown entering a large room and greeting families 
shaking hands with men and patting children on the head dressed in 
a brown suit and tie instead of his military uniform he smiled as 
he approached 
he told them he knew they were feeling restricted if my 
family were in your place i would have the same feelings he said 
but saddam added politicians are forced sometimes to take a 
position that goes beyond what they see directly in front of them 
if it had to do with human feelings toward you then i 
would immediately say you should leave and go back to your 
families but he told them that their presence was needed to 
prevent an attack 
saddam has used the same justification in the past for his 
detention of about 21000 foreigners including 3000 americans and 
3000 britons who were trapped in iraq and kuwait by the aug 2 
invasion 
british and us officials say iraq has moved more than 150 
britons and more than 60 americans from kuwait to strategic 
locations for use as human shields against a possible attack 
iraqi newspapers published saddams decree turning kuwait into 
an iraqi province iraqs longstanding claim to kuwait dates back 
to the time of the ottoman empire 
meanwhile the press attache at the us embassy in baghdad 
stephen thibeault said that according to the iraqis the american 
died in the southern port city of basra he said the man apparently 
died of a heart attack 
thibeault speaking in a telephone interview said iraqi 
authorities said they would allow us officials to participate in 
an autopsy 
asked if the atmosphere in iraq worried him he said 
nothing specific other than being in a country where people 
are not allowed to travel freely and leave the country i think 
that any thinking person would be concerned about those 
circumstances

a survey released tuesday casts new doubt on 
the old notion that women who have given birth by caesarean section 
must always deliver that way 
the survey of 2213 physicians by the american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists found that 63 percent of women who 
attempt vaginal delivery after a previous caesarean section succeed 
strides certainly have been made to convince women and their 
physicians that vaginal deliveries are safe and successful 
alternatives to repeat caesareans said dr mary jo osullivan 
secretary of the organization 
but she said since about 42 percent of the patients in the 
survey chose to have another caesarean there is a need to 
further educate women about the benefits of vaginal deliveries 
vaginal deliveries are less risky than caesarean sections mainly 
because the latter is a surgical procedure said osullivan 
associate chairwoman of obstetrics at the university of miami in 
florida 
also vaginal births are less expensive and the patient spends 
less time in the hospital an average of 4334 and two or three 
days compared with 7186 and four or five days for a caesarean 
according to 1989 data from the health insurance association of 
america 
the rate of caesarean deliveries rose from 55 percent of all 
us births in 1970 to 247 percent in 1988 
but osullivan noted that the increase from 198687 and from 
198788 was 03 percent the smallest rise in five years 
also the rate of vaginal births after caesareans rose from 22 
percent in 1970 to 126 percent in 1988 she said 
osullivan said the rate of repeat caesareans appears to be tied 
to the age of the physician ninetyeight percent of physicians 
under 40 said they encourage their caesarean patients to have 
vaginal deliveries for subsequent births compared with 84 percent 
of physicians over 55 
it takes a long time to change your practice pattern 
osullivan said noting that some smaller hospitals still do not 
offer the option of vaginal delivery to women with a previous 
caesarean 
as recently as 15 years ago vaginal birth after a caesarean was 
not considered good medicine in the united states though a 
standard practice for years in many other countries 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the 
largest professional organization for physicians in those 
specialties recommends that women who have had a low transverse 
incision in a previous delivery and have no medical complications 
should be encouraged to attempt labor and vaginal delivery in their 
current pregnancy 
a low transverse incision which cuts into a noncontracting 
portion of the uterus is most commonly used in caesareans today 
it largely replaced what is called the classical incision in which 
the contracting muscles of the uterus are cut and are more likely 
to rupture in a subsequent labor

authorities on tuesday outlawed 
demonstrations in central bucharest after six days of sometimes 
violent antigovernment rallies but protesters defied the order 
about 100 demonstrators gathered in central university square 
for the seventh day continuing a week of rallies against president 
ion iliescu they did not however block traffic or provoke a 
massive police response 
earlier tuesday the municipality issued a decree saying 
bucharests six main squares and their surrounding areas were 
offlimits to demonstrations that effectively made protests 
illegal in the entire downtown area 
the clampdown follows a series of turbulent protests in central 
university square along the capitals main boulevard 
antigovernment demonstrators had been gathering daily since 
wednesday blocking traffic and shouting slogans against iliescu 
on friday saturday and sunday police clashed with 
demonstrators in and around the square the worst violence broke 
out saturday night when about 2000 antiriot troops and military 
police were sent in 
demonstrators threw petrol bombs bottles and rocks at the 
police and 80 people were arrested at least two people two were 
reported hospitalized 
the new measures are similar to a national decree issued 
january which required special municipal authorizations for 
rallies and recommended they be held in parks 
the january order was widely disobeyed and protestors held 
frequent rallies in front of government headquarters in victory 
square during january and february 
bucharest municipal authorities said under the new rules 
arrangements would be made to allow demonstrations to be held in 
four city parks and in stadiums 
but posters and slogans throughout the city referring to the 
popular uprising that toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu in 
december said the revolution was made in the streets not in 
parks 
university square was the site of a 53day antigovernment 
protest in june that sparked several days of violence in the 
capital when the government cracked down on the demonstrators 
that rally was organized by students and anticommunists who 
accuse iliescu and his associates who won free elections in may 
of continuing ceausescus policy 
this weeks rallies however appeared to be motivated by the 
deteriorating economy and attracted mostly lowerincome workers 
the governing national salvation front charged tuesday that the 
demonstrators were harming romanias image and creating a 
collective feeling of insecurity 
the army called for an atmosphere of calm and order in 
bucharest

two more bodies were discovered tuesday 
in this university city and police linked them to the mutilations 
of three women students whose deaths set off a wave of fear at the 
start of the school year 
its clear this part of the country has some maniac on the 
loose university of florida president john lombardi said during 
a staff meeting it reminds us of a natural catastrophe the 
killer is selecting victims by criteria that are not clear to us 
the bodies of a man and a woman were found together tuesday 
morning at a student apartment complex near one where two bodies 
were discovered sunday said alachua county sheriffs lt spencer 
mann 
police set up a command post between those offcampus sites and 
about two miles from the apartment where a third body was 
discovered early monday 
the two latest victims were identified as tracy inez paules and 
a 23yearold friend manuel r tobada both graduates of american 
high school in miami tobada had just been accepted at nearby santa 
fe community college and was planning to study architecture said a 
friend eric dunham 22 of sarasota ms paules whose age was not 
available reportedly was pursuing a law degree 
gainesville police chief wayland clifton said all five victims 
are probably connected to one suspect or two suspects because the 
methods of the killer appeared similar he did not elaborate 
the gainesville sun however reported tuesday that mutilation 
of the first three bodies found was the apparent connection 
i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that 
anybody that commits homicide using mutilation is a pretty sick 
individual and its somebody we want to get off the streets very 
badly said mann the alachua county sheriffs spokesman 
it looks like its a part of a serial killer state 
chancellor charles reed said earlier in tallahassee 
some students fled home while others parents rushed here to 
guard their children some students said the slayings were 
reminiscent of those by executed serial killer ted bundy 
gov bob martinez ordered 50 state troopers and florida 
department law enforcement agents and two crime labs to 
gainesville reed warned other florida colleges to step up security 
fbi agents also joined the investigators 
state officials and police urged students not to go out alone 
to keep doors locked and use deadbolt locks and to keep in touch 
with their worried parents 
three university of florida students who live across the street 
from the apartment complex where the two bodies were found tuesday 
said they were going home to key west 
were horrified were scared and were going home at least 
temporarily until this thing blows over said lydia blanco 22 
who lives with her sister ileana blanco 20 and lauren bacle 19 
joe colucci said he made the fivehour drive here from his home 
in davi to stay with his daughter jennifer an 18yearold freshman 
i came here to be with my child and protect her as much as 
possible if they dont catch someone by this weekend im taking 
her home he said 
in tallahassee the governor played down speculation about a 
bundy copycat even though experts on serial killers were being 
consulted 
bundy was executed in floridas electric chair on jan 24 1989 
after murdering dozens of young women including two florida state 
university sorority sisters in tallahassee in a 1978 rampage he 
followed with the murder of a 12yearold girl in lake city the 
florida state prison where he died is about 25 miles from here 
thats what were all saying its another ted bundy on the 
loose said jana walters 18 a freshman from longwood 
dave krupezaki 21 a uf student from miami said with what 
happened last year with tiffany sessions everybody is afraid 
ms sessions a 20yearold uf student vanished feb 9 1989 
after leaving her apartment to go jogging no trace of her has been 
found 
on sunday authorities found two victims freshmen christina p 
powell 17 of jacksonville and sonya larson 18 of deerfield 
beach who had shared a townhouse apartment 
one victim was nude and the other was partially clothed said 
police lt sadie darnell 
eight hours later deputies found the body of christa l hoyt 
18 a student at santa fe community college and a records clerk at 
the sheriffs office deputies checked on her when she failed to 
report for her midnight shift 
more than threefourths of all 34000 uf students live off 
campus but 95 percent of the 3000 freshmen live in dormitories a

australias foreign minister said tuesday the 
united states and other countries opposed to iraqs invasion of 
kuwait regard military force as a last resort to end the persian 
gulf crisis 
i am very much more comfortable that the military option has 
been put very much on the back burner foreign minister gareth 
evans told reporters after discussing the crisis with us 
secretary of state james baker iii there is solid and 
universal international support for the sanctions strategy and 
thats got every chance of success 
earlier evans told a news conference it doesnt do any harm 
to make it very clear that at the end of the day if this thing is 
not resolved in any other way the military option will be further 
considered to make it very clear that you have the clout and 
are prepared to see all hell break loose if there is going to 
be any more iraqi aggressive action or if a hair in the head of 
any hostage is harmed 
evans met baker pentagon officials and the news media near the 
end of a sixday roundtheworld trip discussing the crisis with 
policymakers and diplomats of european and arab countries the 
united nations and united states 
he planned to fly home via los angeles tuesday night reporting 
his findings thursday to australian prime minister bob hawke and 
parliament 
the policy of economic sanctions against iraq is going to have 
to be in place for some time before we can expect a sensible 
response from the iraqis but i am rather more confident than 
before i embarked that nonmilitary options will prevail 
evans said 
describing both world unity and iraqs isolation as 
unprecedented he said it is appropriate that all policies right 
now be based on the sanctions route and i am clear that is the 
thinking of this us administration certainly the thinking of 
the europeans certainly the thinking of the arab nations evans 
said he met egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo officials of 
the west european community currently headed by italy in venice 
and geneva and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and 
arab and european un representatives in new york 
it is absolutely crucial he said that all of us in the 
international community be prepared to sit this out for as long 
as it takes whether the end game involves overthrow of iraqi 
president saddam hussein capitulation without a political package 
to go with it or whether it does involve some ladders for the 
iraqis to climb down remains to be seen evans said 
the important thing is that iraq withdraw from kuwait restore 
the kuwaiti government and release foreign nationals desiring to 
leave he said 
the sanctions could cost australia 1 billion including 400 
million in annual sales of wheat meat and dairy products and 
another 600 million in accumulated debts australian officials 
said but australia backs them as the first postcold war test of 
the international communitys ability to manage regional conflicts 
by refusing to appease any country believing that might makes 
right said the foreign minister 
australia is rushing two heavily armed frigates and a supply 
ship to the gulf evans said

saddam husseins vow to set women and children free eased some 
of the tension tuesday for thousands of families keeping a 
monthlong vigil for loved ones trapped in the middle east but 
their cheers were restrained 
i dont want to be a downer but hes said things before 
he said he was going to let all the diplomats go said pauline 
gerard of new harmony ind everything hinges on this and i 
dont want to be crushed 
mrs gerards pregnant sister got trapped in kuwait when a visit 
with inlaws collided with iraqs invasion aug 2 since that day 
the family has been waiting for news like this but when it finally 
came the gerards like many of the hostages families reined in 
their emotions 
weve been waiting for this almost a month now mrs gerard 
said i dont want to get my hopes up too much because i dont 
want to fall down too far if it doesnt work out 
ill believe it when i see them home in this state said 
margaret nuzum of hutchinson kan her daughter soninlaw and two 
young children last got a call through from the us embassy in 
kuwait on aug 19 until them im just praying 
the coming home committees founder was more effusive its 
just an excellent sign said michael saba a champaign ill 
businessman who escaped iraq shortly after the invasion 
whether the men are soon to follow or whether thats something 
that has to be worked out isnt clear but id say the signs are 
good he said i think were seeing some signs that say theres 
some interest in deescalating the situation 
saddams decree broadcast by the iraqi news agency followed a 
meeting tuesday with hostages in which he agreed to talk to 
president bush and britains prime minister margaret thatcher about 
ending the persian gulf crisis 
but despite the conciliatory gestures baghdad hardened its 
position on kuwait declaring it a 19th province of iraq this 
stand is one that concerns jo ellen buehler whose sister is 
married to a kuwaiti air force officer 
im going to stay excited and keep everyones spirits as high 
as i can because thats all we have to clutch onto buehler said 
from memphis tenn but i dont want to jump the gun 
saddam decreed that all women and children who are foreigners 
in iraq are allowed to move freely in iraq or to travel whenever 
they want starting tomorrow including the families iraq is 
hosting the iraqi news agency said in a report monitored in 
nicosia 
but buehler said shes worried saddam means only to free the 
estimated 500 americans trapped in iraq 
he didnt say anything about kuwait said buehler whose 
sister and three young nephews are among about 2500 americans 
stuck in the annexed country what about kuwait 
or worse still what if this is a way of gathering up and 
carting them off to another place in a larger mass 
buehler who hasnt heard from her sister since aug 3 was not 
alone in her trepidation families around the country said they 
were trying to blot out thoughts of an elaborate hopecrushing 
scheme 
you dont know what theyre going to do said eleanor 
gicking of arlington tenn they might even have a trap for 
them 
but in her heart of hearts mrs gicking said she cant 
believe that she choked up at hearing her baby grandson and 
daughter who is married to a kuwaiti could be freed wednesday 
theyre going to get out she said her voice straining 
against tears they have to get out

saddam hussein in what baghdad said was 
a sympathetic response to hostages pleas for their childrens 
safety announced tuesday that foreign women and children would be 
allowed to leave iraq 
the dramatic announcement came hours after the iraq president 
met with a group of foreigners who were trapped by iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the official iraqi news agency which carried the announcement 
said saddam was moved by the foreign families fears over their 
childrens plight 
we hope its true state department spokesman mark dillen 
said of the announcement but he noted we have seen promises 
and statements by iraq in the past that have proven false 
he said the department had received no official word of the 
iraqi decision and was seeking more information through its embassy 
in baghdad 
britains foreign office too said it was seeking official 
confirmation that women and children would be freed we would 
love to hear it said a spokesman who by custom was not 
identified 
about 3000 americans and 3300 britons are among the 21000 
trapped westerners trapped in iraq and kuwait saddam has vowed to 
use them as human shields against attacks on iraqi installations 
british and us officials say iraq has moved more than 150 
britons and more than 60 americans from kuwait to strategic 
locations 
a statement from the iraqs ruling revolutionary command council 
said the decision was made to preserve the arab humanitarian 
image the official iraqi news agency said 
the agency monitored in nicosia said the iraqi president 
decreed that all women and children who are foreigners in iraq 
are allowed to move freely in iraq or to travel whenever they want 
starting tomorrow including the families iraq is hosting 
saddam has consistently referred to the captive foreigners as 
guests not hostages and has told them their presence would help 
prevent allout war from erupting 
the news agency repeated that view saying the foreigners were 
prevented from traveling on humanitarian grounds aimed at fending 
off the fires of war and deterring those seeking to start it 
but it said we opted to preserve the arab humanitarian 
image by freeing the women and children 
western nations have denounced the detentions as hostageholding 
the news agency said the decision was effective wednesday it 
was not clear whether it included foreigner women and children 
trapped in kuwait which baghdad now considers part of iraq it was 
also not known how many of the trapped foreigners are women and 
children 
in the televised meeting with western captives at an undisclosed 
location saddam told the group i appreciate your feelings 
which probably make you feel restricted because you are not allowed 
to go 
if i were in your place or my family was in your place id 
have the same feelings said saddam shown wearing a 
lightcolored doublebreasted suit sitting in an armchair beside a 
coffee table laden with flowers 
some of the foreigners were allowed to ask questions and they 
expressed concern about children being held 
one of the hostages shown was american kevin bazner according 
to his sister patricia heath of farmington hills mich bazner 
his british wife dawn and their two children were stranded when 
the plane they were aboard made a refueling stop in kuwait during 
the invasion 
im glad i got to see my brother im glad hes safe i hope 
dawn and the kids are safe too ms heath told cable news 
network 
the iraqi presidents meeting with the foreigners was broadcast 
by cnn 
one woman with a british accent asked saddam why he was using 
children as leverage in something they cant undersand he gave 
a long answer in which he repeated that he was forced to act 
because of western troops massing in the region 
a young frenchman asked if he and his wife could return to 
france saying they could then explain to the french people that 
iraq had humane intentions 
in the broadcast saddam complained that the international trade 
embargo against iraq was reducing supplies of food and medicine 
saying children will be undernourished and the cutoff of 
medicine could cause outbreaks of disease 
when food is cut off from a society then youre actually 
choking the society to death he told the western hostages 
as the broadcast began saddam was shown entering a large room 
and greeting the western families shaking hands with men and 
patting children on the head 
it was the second time saddam visited hostage families in a 
broadcast intended for western viewers he was widely condemned for 
his first visit last week which was seen as a crude attempt to 
gain western sympathy

the justice departments soldiers in the war 
on crime would have to take time out from the battle if congress 
and the bush administration dont agree on spending cuts officials 
said tuesday 
fbi agents federal prosecutors and other law enforcement 
officials would be furloughed in the coming fiscal year if a 
deficitreduction package is not enacted into law the officials 
said 
the justice department began sending out notices to tell its 
80000 employees they could be furloughed for up to 22 days in the 
1991 fiscal year which begins oct 1 the furloughs would be 
spread out over the 12month period 
a 32 percent spending cut in government agencies will be 
implemented unless congress and the white house agree by the end of 
september on other ways of reducing spending or raising revenue 
to meet the deficit targets in the grammrudmanhollings law 
the notices held out the possibility of longer furloughs if the 
deficitreduction package is not approved by congress 
a copy of a budget memo sent to justice management division 
employees said it would be necessary to impose 70day furloughs for 
the entire fiscal year if a budget agreement is not reached during 
the 1991 fiscal year 
special arrangements will have to be made so that prosecutors 
who are in the middle of trying crimimal cases in court are not 
furloughed officials said there are about 3800 federal 
prosecutors assigned to 94 us attorneys offices nationwide 
attorney general dick thornburgh us attorneys and other 
presidential appointees such as assistant attorneys general would 
not be furloughed 
at the fbi no decision has been made yet whether furloughs 
would apply to undercover agents said spokesman carlos h 
fernandez but the furloughs would apply to all other fbi 
employees including the agents assigned to foreign 
counterintelligence fernandez said 
we will try to do our duty as best we can but to say it wont 
affect operations would be a mistake he said the fbi employs 
9800 agents and 12910 support personnel 
the drug enforcement administration said it has no plans to 
furlough its 3000 agents but will impose a hiring freeze and stop 
paying overtime to meet the deficitreduction targets dea also 
will eliminate all but essential operational travel all 
equipment purchases and repairs and all inservice training said 
spokesman bill ruzzamenti 
but the bureau of prisons which houses 57600 federal inmates 
in overcrowded prisons sent furlough notices tuesday to its 18500 
employees 
each employee would be furloughed for 3 12 days per twoweek 
pay period said douglas lansing assistant director for human 
resources 
furloughs would make the job of running federal prisons 
incredibly challenging lansing said thats a euphemism 
we dont think we could do it he added

the new head of the drug enforcement 
administration said tuesday the war on drugs may be harmed by a 
judges order that could free a mexican doctor from us 
prosecution in the murder of a dea agent 
foreign suspects should not be allowed to leave the country 
merely because their own governments protest suggested robert c 
bonner who resigned a federal judgeship in los angeles to take the 
dea job 
the implications of the case are that anyone who can get a 
foreign government to issue a note of protest may have a ticket out 
of prosecution and conviction and sentence in the united states 
he said 
the case concerns dr humberto alvarez machain wanted in the 
1985 kidnapping torture and murder of dea agent enrique camarena 
in mexico 
dea agents made 20000 in payments to mexicans who brought the 
physician across the border to texas where he was arrested by dea 
agents in early april and transported to los angeles to stand trial 
the mexican government protested the action saying it violated 
mexican sovereignty and has sought the extradition of a dea agent 
and a dea informant to stand trial on kidnapping charges 
us district court judge edward rafeedie until recently a 
colleague of bonner ordered the physician returned to mexico 
saying the extradition treaty between the two countries was 
violated the us court of appeals in san francisco granted a stay 
of that order and rafeedie has denied bail while the appeal is 
pursued 
bonner said he urged the justice department to appeal rafeedies 
decision the dea did nothing wrong in bringing alvarez to the 
united states he said 
bonner is a former us attorney in los angeles who pushed 
prosecution of those involved in the camarena slaying he said he 
is committed to pursuing the investigation of the camarena killing 
there is no statute of limitations on the murder of a federal 
agent 
on another issue bonner said he disagrees with recent 
pronouncements by drug director william bennett and senate 
judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel said that 
success in curbing cocaine supplies led to increased violence on 
americas streets this summer 
if the nation achieves the ultimate objective a substantial 
reduction in the availability and use of illegal drugs you will 
have a dramatic and substantial reduction in violent crime in the 
united states he said 
bonner acknowledged that he was unsure what the interim period 
might bring in terms of violence 
in june bennett said increases in the wholesale price of 
cocaine in several cities around the country indicated that we 
are beginning to have a positive effect on the flow of cocaine into 
this country 
although he had long cited a need to get rid of drugs to help 
cut down the violence connected to drugtrafficking in the cities 
he said disruption of the cocaine flow would have the opposite 
effect 
in some of our communities where there is a shortage of 
cocaine there will be violence as a result of that bennett 
said there will be the same number of dogs fighting over a 
smaller number of bones 
biden said drug violence is on the rise as the quality of 
crack cocaine drops and gangs battle for turf

regional conflict one us diplomat said costing 3 billion to 
5 billion over one or two years and involving up to 10000 
peacekeeping troops and 10000 civilian personnel 
the five the united states britain france china and the 
soviet union ended two days of private talks on details of a 
transitional administration to guide cambodia to peace and 
democracy 
we have gone as far as we can as the five permanent members 
said a us diplomat involved in the talksnow it is up to the 
four cambodian parties the question is can the four cambodian 
factions agree

noncommunist guerrilla allies and the vietnaminstalled 
government in cambodia the diplomat and several other sources 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the cambodian factions are to meet in indonesia in september 
the us diplomat said we think there are grounds if not for 
wild optimism at least for strong confidence all parties will 
agree 
a western ambassador close to the talks said he thought the 
chances were better than even 
on aug 22 he said the three resistance factions issued a 
communique expressing support for the work of the five permanent 
security council members and willingness to accept military and 
administrative arrangements which were worked out earlier 
tuesdays accord means the backers of the warring factions the 
united states soviet union and china agree on a peace plan 
the khmer rouge gets its weapons and supplies from china the 
soviets back the current cambodian government of prime minister hun 
sen the united states backs the two noncommunist guerrilla 
factions 
the western ambassador said if all goes well a truce could take 
effect by november 
the us diplomat said the agreement would give the united 
nations very broad authority to administer and to control 
cambodia 
its significance regarding un involvement in a regional 
conflict would far exceed the un role in guiding namibia to 
independence from south africa which cost more than 750 million 
the united states pays 30 percent of all peacekeeping costs 
the key issues now the diplomat said are organizing a 
ceasefire and elections so that a new government can be 
established that is not dominated by the khmer rouge or the current 
provietnam government 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to oust the khmer 
rouge who presided over the deaths of up to a million cambodians 
from starvation and executions during their brutal rule that began 
in 1975 
for a decade america followed the position taken by the united 
nations and most of the world of recognizing the threeparty 
guerrilla alliance including the khmer rouge as cambodias 
legitimate government 
after hanoi announced last year that all its troops had been 
withdrawn and the khmer rouge began scoring impressive battlefield 
gains washington policymakers fretted more about a possible return 
to power by the khmer rouge than about vietnams invasion 
in july secretary of state james a baker iii announced 
washington was ending its recognition of the guerrilla alliance and 
would open talks with hanoi on ending the war 
america has not announced any cutoff of aid for prince 
sihanouks or son sanns factions however 
the us diplomats and others involved in the talks said the 
participants approved five documents to be sent on to the cambodian 
factions and others concerned 
according to an official statement these cover transitional 
arrangements regarding the administration of cambodia during the 
preelection period military arrangements during the transitional 
period elections under united nations auspices human rights 
protection and international guarantees that cambodia will be 
nonaligned neutral and democratic 
they call for a ceasefire for warring parties to disengage 
disarm and settle in unmonitored cantonments and for un 
peacekeepers to move in the united nations would organize 
elections and verify that all vietnamese forces have indeed left 
cambodia 
cambodian guerrillas claim many vietnamese troops remain in 
cambodia in disguise 
western officials believe once the truce takes effect it would 
take about a year to get ready for elections 
the draft documents call for the united nations to supervise 
and control if necessary five key cambodian ministries 
defense foreign affairs finance public security and information 
various diplomats said

cnns broadcast tuesday of saddam husseins 
latest meeting with western hostages raised the question should 
news operations give the iraqi leader live access to us 
television 
we would not do that under any circumstances said bob 
mcfarland deputy director of news at nbc we made that decision 
the first day they pumped it out we decided it was pure 
propaganda 
none of the big three american networks nbc abc and cbs 
carried the iraqi satellite transmission live on tuesday as the 
cable news network did instead they showed portions somewhat 
later 
but cnn management defended its practice saying the meeting was 
deemed of sufficient importance to air immediately 
we make these decisions on a casebycase basis cnn 
spokesman steve haworth said at the networks atlanta headquarters 
in tuesdays case he said cnn understood that saddam would be 
speaking with american hostages 
there was no question in our minds this would be newsworthy 
haworth said 
after the coverage pati heath of detroit the sister of an 
american hostage called cnn to say she had seen her brother on tv 
cnn put her on television too 
she wasnt troubled by the dispute over cnns programming 
decision im just happy to be able to see my brothers face 
she said i hope hussein sees me talking right now 
cnn noted that it was relaying an iraqi tv feed afterward the 
network aired a debate on the wisdom of its decisions 
it is by all accounts a somewhat sticky question 
wherever there is a hostage videotape a captive videotape 
its a decision we dont take lightly said sherrie rollins 
director of news information for abc in new york the president of 
abc news has to approve the use of such video she said 
when saddam appeared on television thursday with western 
hostages abc broadcast the iraqi satellite feed for a few moments 
after first viewing the transmission to gauge its content 
we did air the material we did feel it was newsworthy ms 
rollins said 
but when saddam appeared with hostages again tuesday abc taped 
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special 
report she said 
nbc regards the question of whether to air iraqi feeds as a 
cutanddried journalistic issue mcfarland said from nbcs new 
york headquarters 
we would not put iraqi tv on the air without first knowing 
what it was he said we took every frame of it into the house 
looked at it and then selected two or three bites 
cbs officials didnt respond tuesday to a request for comment

the chief witness against a paratrooper 
accused of murder in last years invasion of panama acknowledged 
tuesday that he shot an unarmed panamanian in the back during the 
operation 
1st lt brandon thomas the first witness at the courtmartial 
of master sgt roberto bryan said under crossexamination that he 
had taken the panamanian prisoner and was searching him when he ran 
away 
he seemed to me at the time a potential threat thomas 
testified 
thomas said he didnt know the man was unarmed until after he 
shot him 
bryan an 82nd airborne division paratrooper with a 
distinguished 19year record is accused of shooting another 
panamanian without provocation on dec 23 three days after the 
united states invaded panama to oust dictator manuel noriega 
he doesnt deny killing the man but maintains the shooting was 
justified 
if convicted of unpremeditated murder the military equivalent 
of seconddegree murder bryan 42 could be sentenced to life in 
prison 
the shooting by bryan occurred after a panamanian tossed a 
grenade that wounded 10 soldiers of the 82nd airborne at a 
roadblock authorities said 
thomas said he went up to bryan grabbed his m16 rifle and 
said what the hell are you doing he was almost dead anyway 
you didnt have to empty a magazine into him 
the lieutenant testified that bryan stepped back with a startled 
look on his face and said he injured my people 
thomas who helped the army bring the charge against bryan and 
said he hadnt been granted immunity from prosecution made at 
least three statements on the bryan shooting at military hearings 
capt steve lamb a military attorney representing bryan spent 
most of his crossexamination asking thomas about discrepancies in 
his statements 
in opening arguments capt charles luckey one of two army 
prosecutors said the case is one of justification and whether 
bryan did it out of revenge 
the united states of america submits to you that this is a 
simple case not an easy one he said there is no lipstick on 
the glass no fingerprints on the windowsill but i do have 
american soldiers to testify about that they saw 
bryans attorney mark waple said evidence would show that most 
of the witnesses being called by the prosecution were biased 
against bryan 
an eightmember military panel similar to a civilian jury will 
decide the case

the family of a young graffiti artist who died 
after his 1983 arrest in a subway station in what critics said was 
police brutality reached a 17 million settlement tuesday with the 
city and the transit authority 
leaders in the black community charged that michael stewart was 
a victim of a beating at the hands of white police six of the 11 
transit police officers involved in his arrest were acquitted of 
criminal charges in 1985 
the agreement which ends a 4yearold wrongful death lawsuit 
was approved by us district judge miriam cedarbaum i certainly 
hope justice is done he said 
neither the city nor the transit authority admitted liability 
for stewarts death 
there is no admission of any wrongdoing by any transit police 
officer in the settlement said barry agulnick an attorney 
representing one of the 11 officers who also were defendants in the 
lawsuit 
the familys lawyers and supporters disagreed 
there is as reflected in the size of the settlement a clear 
acknowledgement by the defendant parties of their 
responsibility for the wrongful death and subsequent coverup that 
occurred in this case said hazel dukes president of the new 
york state chapter of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people 
however the defendant parties might wish to put a spin on the 
closure of this litigation no amount of words can deny that 
reality and the vindication encompassed therein dukes said in a 
statement 
michael stewarts death was a tragedy no amount of money can 
compensate a mother or a father a sister or a brother for such a 
loss mayor david dinkins said in a statement but i hope this 
settlement helps members of his family to continue rebuilding their 
lives 
stewart 25 was arrested sept 15 1983 on charges that he had 
spraypainted graffiti on the walls of the subway station 
transit police later took him bruised and unconscious to 
bellevue hospital where he died 13 days later 
the lawsuit charged that stewart was beaten by police after his 
arrest and that the officers concealed their alleged involvement in 
his death 
the family accused the transit authority of failing to 
adequately investigate and discipline the officers involved 
in addition the lawsuit alleged that former city medical 
examiner elliot gross obstructed justice by failing to make a 
proper diagnosis of the cause of death and failing to classify the 
death as a homicide 
three transit policemen were indicted on charges of 
manslaughter criminally negligent homicide hindering prosecution 
reckless endangerment assault and official misconduct 
the indictments were later struck down because one grand juror 
pursued his own independent investigation 
in february 1985 six transit police officers were indicted 
three of them for the second time all six were acquitted of all 
charges on nov 24 1985 
a 1987 report by a special counsel appointed to investigate 
stewarts death concluded that excessive restraint was used in his 
arrest the special counsel also found that the arresting officer 
lied about stewarts condition and was derelict in his duty and 
that the investigation of the death by the transit authority police 
department was inadequate 
under the settlement lawyers said stewarts parents and 
brother and sister will receive 920000 the remaining 780000 
will pay for expenses and lawyers fees

a 1 million spraying campaign to kill mosquitoes 
that carry encephalitis also may be killing thousands of tiny fish 
but its nothing to worry about the states expert on fish kills 
said tuesday 
by tuesday the dawn and dusk spraying of 700000 acres in 
southeastern massachusetts with malathion that began monday was 
more than half completed 
the campaigns target is the adult mosquito that carries the 
sometimes fatal eastern equine encephalitis virus 
the state has monitored the mosquitoes for the virus since the 
1930s the last time anyone in massachusetts died of the disease 
was in 1984 
if there is a connection between the spraying and fish deaths 
it wont harm the food chain and its no disaster said richard 
keller a biologist at the westboro headquarters of the division of 
fisheries and wildlife 
its not good news keller said of the dead fish but 
weighted against the eastern encephalitis virus its something 
were going to obviously have to accept its certainly not 
catastrophic 
the health department said people still need to protect 
themselves against the mosquitos bite once the spraying ends 
the mosquitoes that carry the virus favor the states swampy 
southeastern corner the state is spraying 3 ounces of malathion 
per acre as long as the temperature is over 62 degrees the wind is 
no faster than 10 mph and it doesnt rain 
officials have said the pesticide does no serious harm they 
argue that the risk of encephalitis which causes swelling of the 
brain and kills 30 percent of its victims is greater than any that 
malathion may pose 
a 7yearold boy from marshfield is the only confirmed case of 
encephalitis this year he was in fair condition tuesday at 
floating hospital in boston 
four suspected cases are being tested 
it will be a few days at least before scientists know whether 
the spraying program eradicated the mosquitoes it was aimed at 
even then officials said it is expected to wipe out only 90 
percent to 95 percent of the insects 
you are reducing the risk substantially but we dont want 
people to think there is zero risk said department of public 
health spokeswoman mary ann hart there will be some mosquitoes 
around people should still take precautions 
descriptions of dead and sick fish and eyewitness reports 
leads us to believe these are related to the malathion 
spraying said keller 
but he said results of tests on the fish wont be available for 
another couple of days 
its circumstantial said keller however personnel in 
the field say the fish they have examined exhibit the symptoms of 
pesticide poisoning nervous tremors associated with 
pesticiderelated kills 
fish kills usually occur at the rate of one or two a week he 
said since monday he has heard of 14 or 15 
the dead fish were largely of the minnowlike killifish species 
which is around 1 to 1 inches long and feeds near the waters 
surface they were turning up dead in coastal estuaries 
keller said malathion breaks down fast and doesnt accumulate in 
the food chain

venezuela is already pumping more oil 
to help make up the shortage following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
president carlos andres perez announced tuesday 
earlier tuesday the nations defense minister announced 
venezuela is preparing to step up security at its oil installations 
against possible sabotage 
perezs statement was venezuelas first official admission that 
it was already pumping more oil to help fill iraq and kuwaits 
embargoed supply 
our country is already producing additional oil for 
inventories to be sold to our clients particularly those in latin 
america perez was quoted as saying in a news release 
perez on tuesday did not not disclose how much extra oil 
venezuela is pumping but said the nation can increase its output 
by 400000 to 500000 barrels per day 
venezuela joined nine other opec nations in supporting in 
principle an agreement to produce more oil perez said an opec 
announcement on the issue was expected wednesday in vienna where 
cartel officials were meeting 
defense minister hector jurado toro said tuesday that the 
national guard is ready to move on the operation if the iraqkuwait 
conflict escalates 
this is a good idea even for routine situations and more so 
in this situation in which at any moment someone for whatever 
reasion could decide to take an act of sabotage against some of 
the installations he said in a statement transmitted by the 
government news agency venpres 
jurado toro avoided mentioning iraq which vehemently opposes 
increasing oil production to cover the blockaded supply 
venezuela has been one of the staunchest proponents in the 
13member cartel of increased oil output 
venezuela usually produces about 2 million barrels per day in 
compliance with its quota in the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
industry sources warned tuesday that it would take about three 
months for venezuela to reach 500000 barrels of extra daily output

the paddlefish a primitive longsnouted 
source of 50apound caviar is swimming farther up the ohio 
river as pollution is reduced and water quality improves 
biologists are finding the paddlefish and other 
pollutionsensitive species in the upper ohio which had been 
shunned by such fishes until the 1980s 
the passport has been cleaner waters ronald preston an 
aquatic biologist at the us environmental protection agencys 
wheeling wva field office said tuesday 
preston plans to present his findings thursday at a meeting of 
the american fisheries society about 900 fishery managers 
biologists and scientists are attending the fourday meeting which 
began monday in pittsburgh 
many species of fish disappeared from the river during the first 
half of the century when industry polluted the water said william 
pearson fishery biology professor at the university of louisville 
in the past decade waste has been treated more thoroughly before 
being discharged 
still industries municipalities and government regulators are 
not off the hook fish experts cautioned 
we still have a legacy of pollution preston said while 
weve cleaned up the easy things to clean up weve got a ways to 
go 
he said efforts must now focus on runoff from agricultural 
pesticides and construction sites storm discharge and cargo 
spillage 
other species returning to the upper third of the ohio river are 
the mooneye and the slenderhead darter both are food for other 
fishes not humans 
their value is in what they represent cleaner water 
preston said 
the paddlefish though is a highly commercialized fish prized 
especially for its roe which can fetch 50 a pound a single 
female paddlefish may produce 10 pounds of roe 
having moved south to escape pollution the paddlefish limited 
itself to louisville and points south until the past few years now 
its being found as far north as cincinnati more than 100 miles 
upstream from louisville 
the paddlefish is expanding its river habitat by about 20 miles 
a year pearson said 
largemouth bass crappie and walleye never left the upper ohio 
completely and now are thriving in numbers to attract aficionados 
of sport fishing bass even have moved into the allegheny and 
monongahela rivers which merge to form the ohio at pittsburgh 
the fish may not be good to eat because of continued pollution 
from pcbs and chlordane the two toxic substances are present in 
fishes in many western pennsylvania rivers and are eliminated from 
the body slowly if at all states regularly issue public warnings 
about what is and isnt edible 
so the ohio isnt likely to return to the pristine conditions of 
the early 1800s when ichthyologists first documented its diversity 
of fish some species wont be seen again without being 
artificially reintroduced 
some of them got pushed over the edge and cant be brought 
back without extra measures pearson said

a community college nursing student who 
refused to dissect a cat for religious reasons said tuesday she had 
resolved her dispute by agreeing to watch the dissection of a human 
cadaver at another school 
the difference is the person died of natural causes and 
donated their body to science said roseann charron 31 they 
do not raise people and kill them and sell them to universities 
perfectly good cats are raised specifically for that purpose 
stolen and killed and sold she said 
charrons dispute with the community college of rhode island 
began in june 1989 when school officials told charron she couldnt 
complete her licensed practical nursing program unless she passed 
the anatomy class which requires dissecting a cat 
charron a vegetarian and owner of two cats filed a complaint 
claiming that breeding animals for laboratory experiments violates 
the ten commandments 
charron asked school officials to substitute a computer 
simulation or a model instead of a cat the two sides reached an 
agreement in july 1989 but it fell through and she eventually 
hired an attorney 
this squares with her conscientious beliefs and is more 
pertinent to her studies as well said charrons lawyer stephen 
j fortunato 
charron said she received final confirmation friday that she 
could get credit for taking an anatomy class at the university of 
rhode island in which students watch a human dissection 
charron said she really didnt think she would have to cut 
open the cadaver at the university but wasnt sure 
charron only took one class at the community college last year 
and is set for the university anatomy class and three nursing 
classes there this semester 
im actually very pleased with the alternative charron 
said its certainly a good teaching technique 
college spokeswoman lee chartier said the school had no problem 
with charrons arrangement 
this kind of thing will be handled on a casebycase basis 
should it come up again chartier said 
university spokeswoman linda acciardo said tuesday that charron 
had registered for the course classes start sept 5

oil prices rebounded tuesday from a slide a day 
earlier jumping almost 1 per barrel as traders speculated on 
diplomatic efforts to resolve the middle east crisis 
traders also were monitoring opec discussions that could lead to 
boosts in crude oil production offsetting the shortfall caused by 
the international boycott of iraq and kuwait overall however 
market strategists saw no news that could push it wildly in either 
direction 
it was such a collapse yesterday that its getting its 
breath said philip l dodge an oil analyst with nomura 
securities international inc opec has postponed their meeting 
maybe suggesting to some that theyre not agreeing on ways to 
increase production 
in vienna ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries delayed formal endorsement of a plan for production 
increases to give them more time to hear from absent members iraq 
and libya 
the price of light sweet crude the benchmark grade of oil rose 
97 cents to 2788 per barrel for october contracts on the new york 
mercantile exchange wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 97 cent to 
8853 cents per gallon for september delivery while home heating 
oil rose 142 cents to 7952 cents per gallon on september 
contracts natural gas barely budged closing at 1500 per 1000 
cubic feet compared with mondays close of 1502 on october 
contracts 
without cataclysmic news coming from the persian gulf traders 
pondered the diplomatic nuances and reports of prospects for peace 
in the region a crucial provider of petroleum to the united states 
and other developed nations 
by some reckonings 4 million barrels of oil a day has been 
removed from the market because of a usled boycott of crude from 
iraq and iraqoccupied kuwait 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar planned to meet 
thursday with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to discuss the 
turmoil that has developed since iraq seized kuwait aug 2 
earlier speculation about a nonviolent solution to the crisis 
was a partial cause of mondays 4perbarrel drop in the price of 
crude but some petroleum strategists said tuesday the market may 
have overreacted 
its almost as if the market has declared peace but in 
reality were still missing 4 million barrels a day of oil said 
stephen smith an analyst with bear stearns amp co 
others predicted prices would fluctuate pending outcome of 
perez de cuellars mission 
its just a very choppy market at this point said ed 
kevelson of dean witter reynolds inc i think it will chop 
around for a couple of days youll probably see a lot of emphasis 
put on that meeting 
after the market closed the american petroleum institute 
released figures showing that the us stockpile and imports of 
gasoline declined sharply as the persian gulf crisis turned 3 weeks 
old while the stockpile and imports of crude oil were slightly 
higher 
gasoline imports dropped from 545000 barrels per day to 287000 
barrels per day for the week ending aug 24 compared with imports 
of 515000 barrels per day a year earlier api said 
the nations stockpile of gasoline was 2109 million barrels for 
the week ending aug 24 vs 2140 million barrels a week earlier 
and 2235 million barrels a year earlier the trade group said in 
its weekly report 
analysts following oil prices had predicted supplies of gasoline 
would tighten because of the loss of three modern kuwaiti 
refineries other refineries that can boost output are unable to 
produce gasoline that meets us standards they said 
the nations crude oil stocks rose slightly from 3757 million 
barrels to 3766 million barrels up from 3373 million barrels a 
year earlier api said crude oil imports were up to 66 million 
barrels per day compared with a rate of 65 million barrels per 
day a week earlier and a year earlier 
api said the nations refineries were running at 924 percent of 
capacity up from 923 percent a week earlier and 912 percent a 
year earlier

us navy warships enforcing the un 
embargo against iraq stopped two cargo ships and crewmen boarded 
one in the gulf of aqaba before allowing them to proceed to jordan 
shipping sources said tuesday 
in washington the pentagon said the american naval flotilla 
operating in the waters around the arabian peninsula to enforce 
economic sanctions imposed by the united nations has brought 
shipping to and from iraq virtually to a halt 
since the navy put itself into position to enforce the un 
sanctions in the persian gulf the red sea and elsewhere about 170 
ships have been intercepted pentagon spokesman pete williams 
said williams said this total includes ships identified or 
signalled to or whose intent and cargo has been learned 
he told reporters only a handful of ships have actually been 
boarded defining that as less than 10 
on aug 18 two navy frigates fired warning shots across the 
bows of two iraqi tankers but both ships refused to stop 
the londonbased lloyds shipping agency which monitors 
maritime traffic worldwide said the navy boarded the greekowned 
container ship zorba express and stopped the indianowned vessel 
kalidas on monday near the mouth to the gulf of aqaba both ships 
were allowed to proceed when the navy determined the cargoes were 
not bound for iraq 
the agency also said that on sunday the us navy denied the 
french container ship paris entry into the gulf of aqaba it did 
not give details 
us media reports said monday that iraq has issued new orders 
to its ships telling them to stop if challenged and not to defy 
us warships 
the iraqi ambassador to washington mohammed sadiq almashat 
appeared to confirm the report on abc tvs nightline 
we are doing our best ourselves to defuse the tension i 
mean the order that we have given to the captains of the ship not 
to resist he said 
a western diplomat in the gulf without giving specifics said 
the iraqis did seem to be folowing that order however gulfbased 
shipping executives speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
were unaware of any iraqiflagged ships currently at sea in either 
the persian gulf or the red sea 
the united nations ordered the embargo on trade with iraq after 
its invasion of kuwait the un security council agreed saturday 
that military force could be used to uphold the sanctions against 
iraq 
jordans port of aqaba once a main trading point for iraqi 
goods has been brought to a near standstill by the un sanctions 
lloyds said the port is almost empty and that the trucking 
fleets operating out of the port are almost idle it said jordan 
has ordered all shipping agents not to transit iraqi cargoes 
through aqaba with the exception of food pharmaceuticals and 
medical products 
about 70 warships from western countries are participating in 
the multinational force in the gulf the red sea and the

a courtappointed bankruptcy trustee has 
ordered the closing of the 101yearold hotel barre which catered 
to three presidents but has been operating under chapter 11 
protection since february 1989 
trustee david m nickless ordered the shutdown monday saying he 
saw little chance of the stately hotel reopening during the 
liquidation 
it sounds like they would continue to lose money and that 
would put the creditors further in the hole nickless said 
built in 1889 in a style that suggested a mississippi river 
steamboat the threestory hotel had 36 guest rooms 11 fireplaces 
and an elegant dining room guests included theodore roosevelt 
woodrow wilson and calvin coolidge 
it was sold in 1985 for 265000 to new owners who recreated its 
lavish victorian atmosphere 
the hotel has been listed for sale since 1987 for 26 million 
unfurnished or 36 million furnished

a judge tuesday gave the roman catholic church 
permission to exhume the remains of a former haitian slave proposed 
for canonization as the united states first black saint nearly 
weeping as she read her ruling 
the archdiocese of new york wants to exhume pierre toussaints 
remains for identification by a pathologist and church officials 
said monsignor robert oconnell who heads the cause for 
toussaints canonization 
church records show that toussaint who died a free man in new 
york in 1853 at age 87 was buried at old st patricks cathedral 
on mulberry street in what is now little italy 
oconnell said toussaints remains eventually will be buried 
beneath the altar of st patricks cathedral on fifth avenue where 
all new york archbishops and bishop fulton j sheen are interred 
acting state justice phyllis gangeljacob granted permission to 
exhume toussaints body 
it is rare that this court has an opportunity to participate 
in such a historic event if only tangentially gangeljacob said 
court papers referred to toussaint as a model of charity who 
is considered the founder of catholic charities because he helped 
the needy for 66 years before formal systems of assistance existed 
gangeljacob said toussaint had lived a long and apparently 
virtuous life giving money to the poor and nursing the ill 
during yellow fever plagues that swept new york city 
in those times the only consolation may have been the miracles 
of faith and trust gangeljacob said struggling to keep from 
weeping 
after pausing as her voice broke gangeljacob said indeed 
for the thousands of victims of the scourge of aids alzheimers 
disease melanoma and other currently incurable diseases the same 
may be true today 
the judge refused to tell reporters what had moved her as she 
read her decision 
oconnell said the church is investigating two miracles 
attributed to toussaint one involves a haitian man who claimed he 
was cured of lung and stomach cancers by praying to toussaint the 
second is claimed by a miami woman who said toussaint cured her 
breast cancer 
according to a church brochure toussaint was born into slavery 
in haiti in 1766 at 21 he was brought to new york by john berard 
du pithon and his family for whom he worked as a slave he was 
apprenticed to a womens hairdresser 
after pithon died his family fell into poverty toussaint 
secretly supported them for 20 years until the widow marie 
remarried she repaid him by arranging for his freedom 
toussaint then bought the freedom of several other slaves 
including juliette noel whom he married in 1811 
oconnell said canonization by the congregation for the causes 
of saints in rome could take years and will involve lengthy 
investigations and hearings

about 80000 soviet jews have arrived in israel 
so far in 1990 israel television reported tuesday a government 
official said the influx this month is expected to be the largest 
in more than three decades 
the number of soviet immigrants has reached 16000 so far this 
month the staterun television said 
gad benari a spokesman for the quasigovernment jewish agency 
that helps handle immigration said the august total is expected to 
reach some 17000 to 18000 a record monthly figure since the 
1950s 
israeli officials expect a total of some 150000 soviet jews to 
immigrate by the end of the year benari said the soviet 
immigration rate does not appear to be affected by the persian gulf 
crisis 
under mikhail s gorbachevs loosening of emigration the soviet 
union has issued visas for 234000 people to emigrate during the 
first seven months of 1990 more than twice as many as in the same 
period last year soviet officials said tuesday 
most of the soviet visas 132400 were issued to people 
wanting to go to israel the second largest number 73400 went to 
west germany about 16800 left for greece and 5300 for the 
united states according to figures released by the soviet interior 
ministrys visa office 
rudolf kuznetsov head of the visa office complained at a news 
conference in moscow that the office has run short of blank 
passports to issue to soviet citizens wishing to travel abroad he 
said the soviet enterprise goznak can supply only onefifth the 
required number of blanks and the state would have to allocate 16 
million to solve the problem 
permission to travel abroad and particularly to the west used 
to be very difficult for ordinary soviet citizens to obtain under 
gorbachevs reforms increasing numbers of people have been able to 
see the world

czechoslovak president vaclav havel warned 
tuesday it will take vigilance and care to keep the ethnic 
minorities of central europe from turning on each other as 
proxies for the totalitarian system 
some groups are seeking a focus for their anger after 
discovering the extent of the awful legacy left us by decades 
of communist rule havel said during a debate about ethnic 
conflicts at a conference in norways capital 
the fourday seminar which began sunday was called by 1986 
nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel to explore the roots of 
ethnic religious and political hatred and how to overcome it 
about 70 world leaders nobel laureates and activists were 
attending the gathering 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis who wants to lead his 
baltic republic out of the soviet union agreed that 
longsuppressed ethnic conflicts have boiled to the surface in 
countries where democracy is taking hold 
maybe this is why western europe even now strangely 
interprets eastern europes spring as a winter of frightening 
instability landsbergis said 
french president francois mitterrand said in order to maintain 
peace the world must cooperate to enforce international law he 
had a timely example to offer the persian gulf crisis 
this is an appeal for courage mitterrand said reminding 
listeners of nazi expansionism in world war ii we must refuse 
from the outset iraqs use of force 
he said france is fully committed with air sea and land 
forces to countering iraqs aug 2 invasion of neighboring kuwait 
and threats to foreigners trapped in the two countries 
international law must prevail over force over antagonism 
he said 
he pointed out that western europe despite two conflagrations 
this century had found peace through economic cooperation 
we could call it a victory over hate mitterrand said 
mitterrand urged the eventual inclusion in the european 
community of east bloc nations that have abandoned authoritarian 
communist systems 
havel said he was optimistic that the ethnic groups of eastern 
europe could eventually live in peace 
if i speak of the nationalist hatred in central and eastern 
europe i am not talking about it as our certain future but as a 
potential threat he said 
after four decades spent in the communist mold ethnic groups 
are rediscovering their individuality he said 
after all they have gone through they feel a natural need to 
make their existence quickly visible he said 
havel said it will take care to keep the ethnic groups from 
turning on each other as proxies for the totalitarian system

a neighbor complained the police were 
unsympathetic and finally a sore gum stopped liam kites pursuit 
of a world record for playing the french horn 
its something he wouldnt try again he said tuesday not in 
the foreseeable future 
the stunt was organized to raise money for the skegness junior 
band which has more members than instruments kite said 
the 25yearold optician began his pursuit of the record of 32 
hours at 11 am saturday playing all through the night from 
one of his pile of hymn books and attended by the required number 
of witnesses 
at about 7 pm he said a neighbor had wearied of the music 
kite had reached praise my soul the king of heaven and 
called the police who ordered him to move on 
during his permitted fiveminute break the only venue he could 
find was a toilet in a nearby amusement arcade kite his 
timekeeper his two official witnesses and the keeper of his three 
horns selected cubicles and pressed on until they could move to a 
theater he had hired for 10 pm 
meanwhile he said he cut his gum it didnt bother him at 
first he said but it started to throb overnight it was very 
painful indeed he said 
at 430 am sunday after playing nearer my god to thee 
kite gave up more than 15 hours short of his goal 
the record would have been unofficial the guinness book of 
records has entries for longest performances on an accordion 85 
hours bagpipes 120 hours flute 61 hours guitar 300 hours 
and electric organ 440 hours but nothing for the horn 
for the skegness junior band however it paid off 
we think it looks in the region of 600 to 700 pounds 
12001400 so thats going to be quite nice kite said

president fw de klerk told 
church leaders tuesday he would investigate charges that police 
sided against supporters of the african national congress in recent 
township violence 
black leaders have blamed police for fueling the two weeks of 
savage street fights in black townships around johannesburg that 
killed more than 500 people 
police said two black men were killed in unrest tuesday but the 
townships were peaceful for a fourth straight day following a 
government crackdown 
also tuesday police raided the headquarters of south africas 
largest labor federation and arrested its secretary general jay 
naidoo and two others the three were charged with kidnapping 
robbery and assault all three were later released on bail and 
naidoo denied the charges 
the raid followed a news conference at naidoos congress of 
south african trade unions where officials presented a man they 
said had been spying for the police the independent south african 
press association reported 
a delegation of church leaders including anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu and the rev frank chikane head of the south african 
council of churches met in pretoria with de klerk and adriaan 
vlok the law and order minister 
after the twohour meeting chikane told journalists the 
president had pledged to investigate charges that police aided 
zulubased inkatha supporters in the fighting against xhosas and 
other blacks loyal to the african national congress 
anc leader nelson mandela tutu and other antiapartheid figures 
have said police bias toward inkatha inflamed the situation they 
accused police of disarming and scattering anc supporters while 
allowing zulus to weapons 
mandela on tuesday renewed charges that the government was not 
moving to settle weeks of bloody unrest 
the police are inflaming the conflict the anc leader said 
after arriving in the algerian capital for meetings with president 
chadli bendjedid and other officials 
government officials have denied the charges de klerk has 
previously said individual officers may have acted improperly but 
the police force as a whole followed orders to be impartial 
the fighting erupted aug 12 in johannesburg area townships and 
raged for two weeks until the government declared a de facto state 
of emergency and poured in more police and soldiers 
it was considered the worst unrest since the mid1980s 
officials said more than 18000 township dwellers were left 
homeless by the fighting 
the press association reported tuesday that analysts estimated 
it would cost 80 million to replace the 2000 houses shops and 
factories destroyed 
chikane said tuesdays meeting with de klerk also covered 
compensation for victims of the violence and the problems of 
migrant worker hostels in the townships most of the clashes 
involved hostel residents clashing with rival township dwellers 
tutu said de klerk had treated the group as respected leaders 
unlike previous presidents 
the difference between him and the others is there was no 
fingerwagging tutu said we give him credit for taking 
seriously the issues before us 
police said a 20yearold man was shot to death tuesday in 
vosloorus southeast of johannesburg and a man was stabbed to 
death in umgababa in the eastern province of natal more than 
5000 blacks have died in inkathaanc clashes in natal over the 
past five years 
the government and many neutral observers portray the conflict 
as mostly tribal fighting linked to the power struggle between the 
anc and inkatha 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi has blamed the anc for 
instigating the fighting saying the anc wants to crush all 
opposition the anc contends inkatha spread the fighting from natal 
to the johannesburg townships to broaden its constituency 
both groups oppose apartheid but differ on the shape of a future 
south africa 
under south africas apartheid system of racial segregation the 
5 million whites dominate politics and the economy and blacks have 
no voice in national affairs de klerk says he wants to end 
apartheid and negotiate a blackwhite powersharing agreement with 
the anc and other opposition groups

fortyseven wives and 
children of us diplomats reached american soil tuesday evening 
after three hard days on the road and in the air putting the perils 
of iraqioccupied kuwait behind them god bless america 
proclaimed one leader of the group glad to be home 
a chartered jet carrying the 20 women and 27 children touched 
down almost exactly 48 hours after their 13car convoy crossed the 
iraqi border into turkey 
many of the youngsters carried stuffed animals as they descended 
onto the tarmac at andrews air force base near washington to board 
buses with their families for an undisclosed hotel many of the 
wives left behind husband who were denied permission by the iraqi 
government to accompany their families home 
earlier in the day the state department said iraqi authorities 
were continuing to round up americans taking nine more into 
custody iraq also informed the us embassy in baghdad that a 
56year old american died of a heart attack in the port city of 
basra 
luz marina colwell wife of the the us consul in kuwait 
william colwell fought back tears in a planeside conversation with 
reporters thanking the bush administration for bringing the group 
home 
during the present crisis we learned to know each other to 
care for each other and we became a big family ms colwell said 
but our hearts are left in kuwait and baghdad with all our 
husbands members of our families our private american citizens 
and members of the international community left behind she added 
we had to keep being strong and keep our hearts very high god 
bles america she concluded 
left behind in iraq where three young american men children of 
us diplomats in kuwait who were denied permission by iraqi 
authorities to accompany the group home when it was realized they 
were over 18 
an additional 54 or 55 us personnel mostly men who had been 
stationed in kuwait remained behind in baghdad and are still 
seeking permission to leave 
the americans left kuwait late thursday for baghdad they left 
baghdad sunday morning and drove about 20 hours in desert heat 
through iraq before crossing into turkey at 6 pm edt sunday 
five of the 52 who arrived at the border did not make the flight 
to washington 
the us embassy in baghdad was informed that iraq plans to 
expel an unspecified number of american envoys in response to the 
state department decision monday to order 36 iraqi embassy staff 
members out of the united states by thursday 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said six 
americans were arrested in iraq and three in kuwait since monday 
bringing the total to 70 48 in iraq and 22 in kuwait 
the dead american was in iraqi custody at the time he died ms 
tutwiler was unable to identify him but said iraqi officials have 
agreed to conduct an autopsy us officials asked that a competent 
physician chosen by the embassy be present and that the remains be 
delivered to us custody as soon as possible 
she said the death underscores the barbaric nature of iraqi 
policy towards foreign nationals in iraq and kuwait and makes a 
lie of iraqs claim that they are all well treated and in no 
danger 
ms tutwiler said iraqi officials have not responded to us 
requests concerning 15 americans in iraq and kuwait with special 
medical needs who the administration believes should be allowed to 
leave the country immediately 
the dead american was not among the 15 she said 
there was no immediate state department response to the 
announcement of president saddam hussein that all foreigners who 
are women and children in iraq will be allowed to leave 
as for the iraqi decision to expel us diplomats ms tutwiler 
said the united states was awaiting clarification of the iraqi 
demand the head of the us embassy in baghdad joseph wilson was 
informed of the decision tuesday morning by iraqs chief of 
protocol 
wilson also was informed that unspecified restrictions would be 
imposed on embassy funds 
the iraqi action occurred less than 24 hours after the state 
department ordered a reduction in the iraqi embassy staff here from 
55 to 19 and imposed strict travel restrictions on those left 
behind 
the us action was prompted by an iraqi demand that the united 
states and other countries close their embassies in kuwait that 
order has been widely ignored 
for the second day in a row ms tutwiler said the state 
department has received reports of additional americans having fled 
iraq and kuwait 
two weeks ago the state department estimated that there were 
2500 americans in kuwait and 500 in iraq who were not free to 
leave 
since americans have departed the two countries over the past 
two weeks those figures are now obsolete but no updated estimates 
have been disclosed because the state department has refused to say 
how many have escaped

domestic news agency

defense sources disclosed tuesday night that 
the multinational forces are considering seeking a un resolution 
for an air blockade to stop sanctionbusting flights to baghdad 
the sources believe the blockade which would involve all of 
iraqs neighbors banning iraqibound planes from their airspace 
would tighten the noose around baghdads warravaged economy 
the move comes after reports that iraqi president saddam hussein 
was building stores of grain and meat before his invasion of kuwait 
a senior defense source in the middle east speaking on 
condition he was not identified said there is some evidence 
that he has filled his granaries and ordered meat 
it is alleged that before the invasion there may have been a 
lot of early purchasing going on 
he added there is no evidence that he is running short 
any aerial blockade would heighten tension in the persian gulf 
but would also help prevent an inevitable and fatal split in global 
solidarity against iraq should sanctions take too long to bite 
the british are confident they have the right to impose both 
naval and air blockades under the un charter but accept other 
nations may want a resolution specifically covering action against 
sanctionbusters 
on saturday the un security council passed a resolution 
backing use of force to impose the naval blockade 
earlier tuesday at a news conference at saudi arabias massive 
dhahran air base british defense secretary tom king said british 
forces could remain in the gulf even if saddam bows to world 
pressure and quits kuwait 
after visiting britains vanguard squadron of tornado fighters 
and holding discussions with the local saudi air commander prince 
turki king hinted at a prolonged standoff in the sand between 
iraq and the multinational forces 
pledging to achieve kuwaits liberation and the restoration of 
its ousted rulers by peaceful means if possible king said we 
are here to achieve those objectives but we would need confirmation 
that the situation could not deteriorate again 
we would want to ensure that there was a secure and stable 
situation 
britain has three squadrons of tornadoes and jaguars 11 
warships and support vessels nimrod aircraft and 150 soldiers from 
the signals regiment deployed in the gulf 
king refused to rule out any military option and a ministry of 
defense team is assessing deployment of more forces during while

the california assembly on tuesday 
soundly rejected a proposal which urged schools to teach that the 
internment of japaneseamericans during world war ii was a military 
necessity 
the resolution introduced by a legislator who served in the 
marines maintained its wrong to teach that japaneseamericans 
were put in concentration camps it portrayed the 
relocation as it was called at the time as a reasonable 
reaction of people frightened by japans attack on pearl harbor 
the measure was intended to counteract another nonbinding 
resolution approved by the state legislature last year that called 
the wartime detentions a human rights violation driven in part by 
racism 
the new resolution was rejected by the assmebly 604 only the 
author republican assemblyman gil ferguson a retired marine spoke 
in favor of it eleven lawmakers opposed it with emotional and 
anecdotal speeches 
it unnecessarily reopens wounds that should and must be 
allowed to heal minority leader ross johnson a republican said 
in leading the bipartisan opposition 
fergusons measure was aimed at one by democratic assemblywoman 
jackie speier that the legislature passed last year 
speiers measure which isnt a law but an expression of the 
legislatures opinion urged the state and its school districts to 
use textbooks that show the internment of japaneseamericans was 
a violation of human rights rather than an act of military 
necessity 
speiers resolution noted a conclusion of the federal commission 
on wartime relocations and internment of civilians about internment 
of more than 110000 japaneseamericans in fenced guarded camps 
the internment the commission said was not justified by 
military necessity and the decisions which followed from it 
detention ending detention and ending exclusion were not driven 
by analysis of military conditions 
speiers resolution added that the broad historical causes 
which shaped these decisions were race prejudice war hysteria and 
a failure of political leadership 
fergusons resolution urged the state and school districts to 
adopt a broad range of instructional materials that discuss and 
reference these events and facts so as to offer california 
students an honest objective and balanced education concerning 
this period in our history 
fergusons proposal stated it is simply untrue that 
japaneseamericans were interned in concentration camps during 
world war ii 
the people of california and the designated war zone areas had 
good reason to fear an invasion attempt after the surprise attack 
on pearl harbor as japanese submarines cruised off our coast 
barrage balloons flew over our harbor areas and great parts of the 
zone existed under blackout conditions the resolution said 
it also said any history that omits the attack on pearl harbor 
and the war as a major factor in our nations relocation policy 
unfairly denigrates the character of a generation of americans 
including all who fought in that war or who merely were alive at 
the time 
ferguson said speier was trying to rewrite history 
for the first time in the history of america a bunch of 
politicians are acting as they do in russia or china and revising 
history and telling teachers how they should teach ferguson said 
i admire and respect japaneseamericans he said i agree 
it was a tragic period in our history im sure there was racism in 
american just as there is now and is in every country in the 
world 
arguing against the measure johnson said what happened was 
wrong if even one us citizen was denied his or her constitutional 
rights or freedom not because of what they did but because of who 
they were it should never have happened it must never be allowed 
to happen again 
this measure fergusons resolution says somehow if youre 
really upset and really concerned its ok to violate your civil 
rights added republican assemblyman charles quackenbush

police seized about 2600 pounds of pure 
cocaine and arrested eight people in a raid on a jungle laboratory 
in southeastern colombia a national police bulletin said tuesday 
the drug bust monday was the biggest since president cesar 
gaviria took office aug 7 
a special antidrug police unit in usmade helicopters swooped 
on the lab and confiscated a dc3 airplane two vehicles three 
electrical plants and 11 tons of chemicals used to process cocaine 
the report said 
it said police also discovered three clandestine landing strips 
security forces have seized about 43 tons of cocaine so far this 
year the figure for all of 1989 was 33 tons 
police in southwestern colombia last weekend destroyed a 
sophisticated drugprocessing laboratory capable of producing about 
1500 pounds of cocaine a week according to a police statement 
broadcast on caracol radio network 
colombias medellin and cali cartels supply much of the cocaine 
consumed in the united states and europe 
authorities released fabio ochoa on tuesday the father of three 
reputed leaders of the medellin cartel his wife said 
in a statement tuesday over local tv margoth ochoa said she and 
her husband were detained overnight at ochoas luxury ranch on the 
outskirts of medellin colombias second largest city she said 
about 50 workers also were detained 
the ochoas sons jorge luis juan david and fabio are 
presumed leaders of the cartel 
she said security forces in helicopters descended on the ranch 
monday apparently they were looking for my son jorge luis 
jorge luis ochoa 41 is considered no 2 man in the cartel 
after pablo escobar and is wanted on drug trafficking charges in 
the united states 
the senior ochoa a lifelong rancher faces no criminal charges 
cartel leaders have been blamed for killing about 500 colombians 
in the past year including three presidential candidates the 
ochoa brothers along with escobar remain at large despite a 
police and army dragnet to catch them 
the governments yearlong war with drug traffickers appeared to 
be winding down tuesday as barricades against car bombs were 
removed from around the capitals government buildings 
no major traffickers have been arrested and the cocaine is 
still flowing to the united states 
both the government and the medellin cartel have moved toward 
defusing the conflict 
president gaviria has said nothing publicly about easing the war 
against the traffickers but signs are clear he is looking for some 
sort of understanding with the medellin cartel toward ending the 
violence 
the cartel declared a truce july 27 11 days before gaviria took 
office 
on aug 7 gaviria hinted in his inaugural speech he might end 
extradition of trafficking suspects to the united states if the 
cartel ended its campaign of terrorism 
on aug 16 justice minister fabio giraldo said a state of siege 
would be lifted if the cartel halted its terrorism and that the 
next step would be an end to extradition 
on sunday bogota mayor martin caicedo said police and private 
guards for government officials and businessmen must start obeying 
traffic laws 
escort vehicles crammed with guards toting submachine guns and 
shotguns have been allowed to force traffic to the side of the road 
and disregard traffic lights and speed limits pedestrians have to 
run for their lives when they find the bulletproof cars and escort 
vehicles tearing down streets 
ending extraditions would probably be the biggest single 
conciliatory gesture toward the medellin cartel drug traffickers 
stand in dread of being extradited in colombia they have been 
able to threaten or bribe their way out of trouble

hurricanes beginning with gs and hs tend 
to make people along the coast a little nervous there was hazel in 
1954 gracie in 1959 gilbert which raked the caribbean in 1988 
and then there was hugo 
its no wonder people are keeping an eye on gustav and hortense 
and an ear to the phone at national hurricane central in coral 
gables fla 
people are saying it better not come hit us we just got our 
house put back together said darryl graham an employee at 
isle of palms hardware 
many residents on the isle of palms are still living in houses 
with plastic covering the holes left by last septembers hurricane 
hugo which killed 29 people in south carolina and caused an 
estimated 59 billion in damage 
folks around here are planning to load everything up and 
head out early if it even looks close but we arent selling 
batteries and water yet he said 
despite word from the national weather service that hurricane 
gustav and tropical storm hortense will skip the east coast 
coastal residents are wary 
gustav with winds of 105 mph began turning north sunday night 
and hortense is continuing a northward path that should keep both 
well out in the atlantic ocean said silvia graff a meteorologist 
with the national weather services hurricane center in coral 
gables 
fortunately it looks like the steering currents will keep 
both gustav and hortense away from the us and the caribbean 
islands ms graff said 
at least this time around it looks like south carolina is off 
the hook 
ms graff said weather service phones were ringing off the 
hook with many of the calls coming from south carolina 
jackie ford a ladys island marina dockmaster who is thought by 
many in the area to have a sixth sense when it comes to predicting 
the landfalls of large storms said he spent most of monday 
puzzling over the storms directions 
ive got just one pin on the chart and i dont have a good 
feeling for it one way or the other ford said its a little 
too early to tell but i guarantee you we will be keeping an eye on 
both of them 
meteorologists watching gustav believe its unlikely the 
hurricane will turn toward the us east coast as it makes its way 
north 
at 6 pm edt gustavs center was located near 22 degrees north 
latitude and 58 degrees west longitude or about 425 miles 
northeast of antigua it was moving north at about 13 mph and was 
expected to hold that course and speed through wednesday 
tropical storm hortense remained a danger only to shipping the 
storm was centered near 232 degrees north latitude and 455 
degrees west longitude or about 1420 miles westnorthwest of the 
cape verde islands little change in its strength was expected 
either 
tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained 
top winds reach 39 mph tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph

oil exploration in an alaska wildlife refuge 
could help boost domestic production in response to the persian 
gulf crisis us interior secretary manuel lujan said tuesday 
there is no reason why we should not explore in the arctic 
national wildlife refuge lujan said its selfdefeating not 
to have production 
the less production the more tankers you have oil spills are 
due to tankers colliding said the secretary who was making a 
working vacation swing through the west 
a number of spills including one in 1969 off santa barbara 
calif and the 1987 pemex spill in the gulf of mexico have come 
from offshore oil rigs and others have involved pipelines 
lujan said one possibility was limited exploration in 1 million 
acres of the 18 millionacre refuge in alaskas northeast corner 
east of prudhoe bay the site of north americas largest oil 
discovery 
alaskas top elected officials also have endorsed exploration in 
the refuge following the aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq 
at a us energy department hearing on longrange energy 
planning in fairbanks on monday alaska gov steve cowper a 
democrat and republicans sen ted stevens and rep don young 
testified in favor of granting leases for oil exploration in the 
refuge 
the refuge was established in 1960 and enlarged in 1980 to 
protect caribou and other wildlife species when congress expanded 
the refuge it postponed any decision about oil exploration 
environmentalists said drilling in the refuge is not the 
solution to the nations appetite for foreign oil even if there is 
a commercial quantity of oil there it will do little to reduce 
imports the environmentalists said 
lujan said the standoff in the middle east has not created a 
national oil crisis which warrants unlimited exploration of 
domestic reserves but he said new test wells must be considered 
overseas oil one of these days is going to run out he said 
if oil is found in the refuge it would take about seven years 
before it would be available to american consumers james ross 
president and chief executive of bp america inc has said 
only one well has been drilled in the alaskan refuge and its 
findings are a closely held corporate secret the oil industry 
calls the refuge one of the best chances of finding a significant 
domestic oil field

the ship that caused the nations worst oil 
spill is ready for sea trials after a 30 million repair job to its 
mangled hull the repair company said tuesday 
the exxon mediterranean formerly the former exxon valdez has 
been undergoing dock trials at a pier at national steel amp 
shipbuilding co after being floated out of a dry dock last month 
the ship which was built at nassco and delivered to exxon in 
1986 was scheduled to depart early wednesday for a week of sea 
trials about 200 miles offshore said nassco spokesman fred hallett 
it had been undergoing repairs for 11 months 
the tanker was renamed in july and exxon officials said it would 
be put into service in the mediterranean they denied that renaming 
the tanker and sending it to the mediterranean were related to the 
massive spill 
the ship spilled almost 11 million gallons of oil when it struck 
a reef in alaskas prince william sound on march 24 1989 fouling 
hundreds of miles of coastline and killing untold numbers of 
wildlife 
exxon officials had said the vessel is too big for any us 
pacific ports when fully loaded they said declining production 
from alaskan oil fields have reduced the need for such large 
tankers to be used on west coast shipping routes 
the tanker holds nearly 14 million barrels of crude one barrel 
contains 42 gallons 
exxon officials didnt return telephone calls about the ship 
tuesday 
workers replaced the singlehulled ships mangled steel with 
3000 tons of new inchthick steel 
exxon officials had said last month that the ship would stop in 
singapore en route to ports in the mediterranean but the current 
crisis in the persian gulf could alter some of those plans exxon 
officials have said

the deployment of troops to the persian gulf has 
given rise to scattered protests that are focusing more on 
economics than on the political concerns expressed during the 
vietnam era 
many of the demonstrators say the soldiers are risking their 
lives for oil companies and that the financially strapped nation 
cannot afford the deployment 
hell no we wont go we wont die for texaco 200 
protesters shouted saturday outside the white house echoing words 
used by demonstrators during the vietnam war but adding a twist 
the name of a us oil company 
opposition to the vietnam war in the 60s and 70s and to us 
military policy in central america in the 80s focused on whether 
the united states had the right to interfere in the politics of 
other nations opponents of us gulf policy a minority according 
to opinion polls are centering their arguments on the morality of 
intervention for economic ends 
we have to tell each other that we will not kill and we will 
not die for exxon for gulf petroleum peace activist becky 
minnich said last week during a meeting of 100 dissidents in 
minneapolis 
the argument might get a sympathetic ear 
an associated press poll conducted earlier this month said 86 
percent of americans believed the oil companies took advantage of 
the iraqi invasion and unfairly raised gasoline prices the survey 
of 1004 adults had a margi of sampling error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points 
former us attorney general ramsey clark speaking at a news 
conference in new york last week called the us military buildup 
aggression designed simply to dominate oil 
another of the protesters arguments is that america 416 
trillion in debt cannot afford a massive troop deployment costing 
billions of dollars 
they now run up a military bill to the top of the sky and take 
it out of federal housing money for brooklyn wrote jimmy 
breslin pulitzer prizewinning columnist for new york newsday 
many protesters dont believe protecting middle east oil from 
iraq is worth american lives 
i kissed my son goodbye today college professor alex molnar 
wrote in a letter to bush published in the new york times he is 
a 21yearold marine you have ordered him to saudi arabia for 
what cheap gas 
images of soldiers boarding transport planes for the middle east 
have become a daily staple of television news but not all are 
going willingly 
one serviceman marine cpl jeffrey paterson said he will not 
fight a war over oil and has filed for conscientious objector 
status to prevent his deployment to the gulf a marine reservist 
erik glen larsen said tuesday he would file for discharge as a 
conscientious objector 
i will refuse orders to ship me to saudi arabia to defend our 
polluting exploitive lifestyle larsen a lance corporal told 
an audience of peace activists packed into a church in san 
francisco they responded with a standing ovation 
the ap poll said 64 percent of americans supported deployment of 
us troops to saudi arabia to help defend it against a possible 
iraqi attack while 22 percent were opposed but the poll said 52 
percent of americans opposed using ground forces to push iraq out 
of kuwait thirtytwo percent favored such a move 
if the united states is drawn into a war to force iraq out of 
kuwait which is the intent of the economic embargo the few voices 
of protest in the us will likely grow 
among the scattered voices raised in recent days 
in san francisco hundreds of placardbearing protesters 
marched in front of chevron oil headquarters tuesday organized by 
the emergency committee to stop the us war in the middle east 
the demonstration was directed at what protesters called a war 
for profit by the united states and its oil companies 
in seattle two protesters chained themselves to the main gate 
of the naval reserve center on tuesday a dozen other protesters 
dumped bags of sand and poured oil and fake blood onto the sand 
in pittsburgh about 40 demonstrators on a college campus 
created a pyramid of 55gallon drums bearing the slogan war oil 
in amherst mass about 15 protesters elicited a few honks in 
support from passing motorists but also the shouted comment get 
out of america 
at westover air force base mass where planes being used to 
supply troops in the gulf are based two people were arrested on 
charges of disturbing the peace monday during a small demonstration 
in san francisco 15 protesters at the federal building held 
signs saying shed no blood for oil and promised to continue 
holding pickets there until the troops come home

bela lugosi is having a bad day murdering 
brides and stealing their bodily fluids to rejuvenate your aging 
cranky wife is a disgusting job 
and the corpse vanishes 1942 a sublevel thriller is a 
disgusting movie just ask the two robots and the guy sitting in 
the front row 
no one can hold a candle to him in this role says one 
actually maybe someone could douse him with a flammable liquid 
and then hold a candle to him 
talking back to bad movies is something most people can relate 
to but few are as funny or as weird as joel hodgson and his two 
robot pals who screen catastrophes of filmmaking on mystery 
science theater 3000 on home box offices the comedy channel 
this show with a baffling title and a bizarre premise is 
something new in the land of comedy television its funny 
intelligent and off the beaten path actually its in outer space 
as the opening song explains joel was a janitor whose bosses at 
the gizmonic institute didnt like him so they shot him into 
space this all takes place in the not too distant future 
aboard the satellite of love also the title of an old lou reed 
song hodgson is forced to watch cheesy movies such as the 
corpse vanishes the crawling hand and the robot vs the 
aztec mummy 
lonely joel builds two robot buddies out of spare satellite of 
love parts and together they sit before this orbiting movie screen 
and deliver a diatribe of bad puns jokes and sight gags 
the three appear in silhouette at the bottom of the movie 
screen on which the film plays in its entirety while they quietly 
comment from the theaters front row 
mystery science theater 3000 has become a cult hit for 
thousands of devotees mst3k as viewers call it is one of the 
most popular shows on the comedy channel which just renewed it for 
a second 13episode season 
the comedy channel can use a hit the 24hour service that began 
last november opened to generally terrible reviews archrival ha 
launched this spring by viacom has been locked in a lackluster 
duel with the comedy channel for what appears to be a small 
universe of people who want to watch only comedy shows 
but mst3k has its own nationwide fan club of 2000plus 
members and an audience that ranges from hip college kids to 
middleaged parents newspapers and tv guide have written about it 
production companies are making offers 
its one of the biggest hits on our service said comedy 
channel spokesman tony fox these guys are great people write 
from all over the country 
the unorthodox success of mystery science theater is about as 
offbeat as hodgson himself who puts the show together in a 
warehouse in eden prairie minn outside minneapolis 
the 30yearold comedian stays in minnesota because he does not 
like big city life or hollywood he has had a speedy brush with 
fame and decided it was too much 
at age 22 right out of college he came to los angeles with his 
standup comedy routine and gadget collection including a burning 
purse and a 360degree head cranker and ended up doing bits on 
david letterman and saturday night live 
brandon tartikoff then the entertainment president of nbc 
offered hodgson his own show he turned it down 
i just wasnt happy hodgson said 
two years after moving to la he was back in minneapolis he 
sold tshirts and wrote an hbo special with comedian jerry 
seinfeld in the middle of this reentry into a more normal life 
hodgson met jim mallon then a production manager at ktmatv in 
minneapolis 
together they formed best brains inc standup comedians and 
local television people joined on mst3k which debuted on ktma 
on thanksgiving day 1988 eventually was shopped to bigger 
television executives 
the comedy channel in need of original programming for its 
yettobe seen network at the time snapped it up for its premiere 
late last year 
hodgson who tends to speak in dry understatement and incomplete 
sentences described the genesis of mst3k this way 
it started from the idea of talk radio someone being really 
alone the dj being alone and you being alone in a car gilligans 
island its kind of like too being isolated 
on mst3k joels character is about as isolated as you can 
get hurtling through space with his robot friends crow and tom 
servo the trio appear as silhouettes in the lower right corner of 
the television screen looking up at a large movie screen 
each twohour show contains about 450 jokes hodgson said the 
writing takes place around a table in the best brains warehouse 
where hodgson mallon and the companys eight other employees watch 
cheesy films make fun of them and jot it all down 
in the corpse vanishes episode as one bride after another 
drops in a heap at the altar joel crow and tom servo break into 
im getting buried in the morning 
when it becomes apparent the brides are not dead after all but 
merely a little low on lifesustaining fluids an intrepid female 
reporter proclaims you mean they may be alive in a catalytic

the people who tormented lyndon b johnson 
with chants of hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today 
are old enough now to have a son or daughter in the marines 
and some of them are ready to take to the streets again when 
president bush deployed the troops he mobilized the peace movement 
the peaceniks of vietnam and the next few generations of 
antiwar activists are forming coalitions planning vigils keeping 
the fax machines humming 
human rights lawyer ramsey clark called together a coalition 
to stop us intervention in the middle east to demand an 
american withdrawal from the persian gulf and to denounce the 
attempt to take the people of this country by surprise and usurp 
arab and international peaceful and diplomatic solutions 
someone even remembered the teachins of the 1960s at which 
speakers tried to talk the vietnam war to death a persian gulf 
teachin was quickly scheduled in new york city 
but things are different bush disarmed the peace advocates by 
going multinational and going to the united nations 
and the peace movement cannot bring itself to ally itself with 
saddam hussein who used chemical weapons in the iraniraq war who 
gassed his own countrys kurdish minority and who invaded kuwait a 
country that helped finance his eightyear war with iran 
not even so dedicated an antiwar advocate as dave mcreynolds of 
the war resisters league which hasnt supported a war since its 
creation in 1923 by pacifists jailed during world war i concedes 
this is not vietnam and saddam hussein is not ho chi minh 
ho was the revolutionary who led communist forces in a war of 
liberation in vietnam the kids who taunted lyndon johnson also 
used to cry ho ho ho chi minh at him 
we were so stunned the first day or two at saddams invasion 
that we didnt know what to do mcreynolds acknowledged but it 
didnt last 
the league adopted a position decrying iraqs indefensible 
invasion but saying the arab nations should be allowed to 
resolve the conflict 
american leftists mcreynolds said were shocked when jesse 
jackson wrote a statement for the new york times on aug 12 
supporting bushs deployment 
saudi arabia asked for our help jackson wrote it seems 
to me that we were obliged to respond 
mcreynolds said jacksons leftwing supporters are gathering 
signatures on a letter taking him to task 
it says what are you doing jesse he said you are 
supposed to speak for us this may have looked presidential to you 
but it doesnt look rational to us and you are going to lose our 
support 
george mcgovern the democrats antiwar presidential candidate 
in 1972 also told the times that he supported bush 
jerome grossman is another defector he sold his business the 
massachusetts envelope co in 1975 to devote his energies to the 
council for a liveable world which he helped found in 1955 during 
the vietnam war he said he orchestrated the moratorium marches of 
oct 15 1969 the largest demonstration in the history of 
mankind 
does he think bush did wrong 
slowly grossman ticks off his answer no 1 he set a bad 
example when he invaded panama no 2 he continued the reagan 
policy of not encouraging energy conservation n0 3 he did not 
denounce iraqs use of chemical weapons but in his handling of the 
current crisis apart from the obscene continuation of his 
vacation i have no serious major criticism 
but most leaders of the old peace movement are less willing to 
give bush the benefit of the doubt 
bruce birchard disarmament specialist at the american friends 
service committee the quaker group deplores the huge american 
buildup 
even if the united states does not want war and thats not 
something were certain of any unexpected move could lead to the 
whole thing blowing up he said 
and ira shorr program director at sanefreeze said americans 
initial reaction was to rally around the president but he said 
people are becoming convinced that the administrations foremost 
priority is a military resolution to this conflict 
he draws a lesson from history i think our response to war 
will forever be changed by vietnam we will never be as deeply 
trustful of our government as we were then

activities in the financial and economic world 
have created many odd lines on charts and graphs during the past 
three weeks but one of the oddest is a line describing the 
availability of credit 
even the federal reserve generally thought to be the entity 
that tightens or loosens the noose on the nations money supply is 
puzzled and concerned that being so there is cause for general 
concern 
credit is indeed tightening but the fed indicates that it isnt 
the only one doing the tightening instead the constricting 
appears to be a joint undertaking of lenders business people 
individuals regulators and the banks 
it seems that simultaneously and automatically large segments 
of these credituser categories have come to the same conclusion 
that credit has been too easily dispensed and that it is time to 
slow the flow 
no matter where you test for opinions in business or government 
or among individuals you will find large numbers who feel that the 
economy is slowing that bad loans are a danger and that standards 
must be raised 
but no matter what the general opinion there will always be 
those in need of money who cannot get it and these days that 
includes not just wouldbe homebuyers but small beginning and 
financially endangered businesses 
the latest fed survey of lending officers found a reduced 
willingness on the part of banks to lend during the past three 
months of those queried more than onethird said they had cracked 
down on lending 
why because it seems banks own investment portfolios are 
down their capital positions are strained they have observed many 
other banks nearing insolvency they fear for the immediate 
economic future 
these are the reasons you would expect but there are others 
too 
federal regulators have been looking warily at the value of many 
loans already made and have been insisting that some loans or 
assets be written down in value 
atop this is the sense among some bankers that they overdid 
their lending in the past and lowered their standards in doing so 
psychologically it is the same reaction as that of the big 
borrowers time to straighten out 
while some businesses especially those whose applications 
contain the words real estate or construction or 
developer are begging for money and not getting it other 
businesses have withdrawn from the market 
surveys show that businesses are very concerned about economic 
conditions in general and specifically about financial practices 
their own included 
a recent survey by the national federation of independent 
business for example found that members werent especially hurt 
by a credit crunch one reason being that they just werent seeking 
credit 
the consumer has cut back too and for many of the same reasons 
that dictate the actions of banks and business that is the 
feeling that borrowing might have been overdone and that now is the 
time to put matters in order 
in summary the tight credit market today may be partly a 
reflection of privatesector attitudes a selfimposed credit 
tightening rather than a crackdown by the federal reserve 
whatever the reason it has engendered a rare almost unheard 
of concern from the fed that the trend to greater restraint in 
the provision of credit might continue

vladimir lubaschevsky and his wife natalia 
traveled three days by train from moscow to reach a new world of 
love and freedom in taize 
we have found here quite another life the 38yearold 
engineer said shyly clutching a dogeared bible in one hand and 
natalias elbow in the other it is fantastic for us 
it is a dramatic contrast the officially atheist soviet union 
where they share a bleak apartment with his mother and this 
liberal religious community nestled in the hills of burgundy about 
230 miles southeast of paris 
the lubaschevskys are among tens of thousands of newly free east 
europeans descending this year on taize a cross between summer 
camp and ecumenical seminary 
taize observed its 50th birthday sept 1 and cardinal albert 
decourtray of lyon conducted a special service 
for many people who live here the arrival of the east europeans 
is a greater event than the anniversary 
its very moving to know what some of them have come 
through said brother john a 38yearold american here 
youre a christian and its no big deal in east germany it meant 
a guy had to give up his job 
taize is a fraternity of 90 monks most of them clad in sandals 
and slacks who hope to reconcile the human family and overcome 
divisions among christians through common prayer 
their ideas are a powerful beacon that draws more than 100000 
visitors a year to share prayer discussion song and silence 
brother roger 75 founded the community during world war ii and 
still leads it 
he is a swiss protestant a mystical man who loves bach and tea 
and likes his christianity simple he will cross out whole sections 
of a text by st augustine to make the essential message easier to 
grasp 
john xxiii was the pope who understood us the best said 
brother roger who has known them all since pius xii he was a 
man of great simplicity and sensitivity 
both are embodied in taize 
visitors sleep in tents three times a day they sit on 
allweather carpet in the church of reconciliation to pray in a 
region known for wine tripe sausage and escargot they eat green 
beans and pears 
the monks keep an open ear to anxieties hoping to turn 
individual suffering into compassion 
the brothers offer us a chance to take part in their prayers 
their work which is very important to me said andrea hegedus 
25 of budapest hungary 
this would have been expropriated by the communists in 
eastern europe she said because coming together was a privilege 
held by the party 
an estimated 2 million pilgrims have visited taize in its 
halfcentury including anglican archbishop desmond tutu of south 
africa and pope john xxiii pope john paul ii visited as cardinal 
of krakow in 1968 and pontiff in 1986 
most visitors are aged 1725 recognizable by backpacks and 
faded jeans some hitchhike and others arrive at the tiny railroad 
station shuttle buses run from several polish cities 
mary tyminska 16 arrived on a bus from czem with 40 other 
teenagers some immediately tried to hitch rides to paris but 
mary stayed behind 
everyone is so happy here she said they treat you like 
brothers or sisters 
in 1940 roger schuutz pedaled his bicycle from switzerland into 
unoccupied france and bought a rundown house in taize as the home 
for what he envisioned as a simple community of monks dedicated to 
prayer and meditation 
then as now taize was affiliated with no church and did not 
accept donations brother roger refused his inheritance following 
the example of his mother who refused too 
the monks support themselves with a crafts shop where they sell 
articles they make visitors pay for meals and sleeping space in a 
tent 
in 1942 the gestapo chased brother roger to geneva after 
learning he had helped jews escape france he returned after the 
allied invasion and conducted services for german prisoners of war 
in the 13thcentury village church 
young people started coming to taize in the late 1950s the 
brothers built a spacious modern church to hold them the annual 
pilgrimage grew to 100000 in the 1970 and the brothers expanded 
the churchs capacity with circus tents 
we didnt ever want it brother roger said but his monks 
adapted organizing food and lodging for their guests and composing 
multilingual chants to break down language barriers 
some brothers now live part of the year in north and south 
america africa and asia to expand contact between christians 
we first started making contacts in eastern europe in 1962 
when we had a german brother who said we must go there to express 
our humanity said brother emile a canadian 
the revolution in eastern europe means many who dreamed of 
visiting taize can do so more than half the pilgrims this year are 
from the region 
here we feel a unity in faith and being together 
lubachevsky said here it is approved to have more love and 
freedom than we ever had before

a 10foothigh concrete barrier separates 
the elite from the masses on the beach of this black sea resort 
illustrating the soviet unions failure to achieve a classless 
society 
the wall starts in the water and runs over the sand to separate 
the riviera a public beach from a vast playground reserved for 
those with position and influence 
no one seems to know the name of the private beach or the names 
of those who use it little is known of the services provided but 
the sheer size of the sanctum raises eyebrows 
on an average day 15000 people must crowd onto a public beach 
only 750 yards long while about 500 of the upper crust loll on an 
expanse that stretches more than half a mile 
arkady melkonyan a state television correspondent cited the 
figures in a recent broadcast 
like melkonyan some citizens are indignant others shrug it off 
the martians live differently than we why shouldnt they 
valery skripnik a 40yearold gardener said on the riviera beach 
he spoke between chinups on an exercise bar 
there is increasing criticism of reserving beaches quality 
medical care luxury apartments special planes and stores for 
communist party and government officials in a country where 
ordinary people live in cramped housing and stand in line for food 
and other necessities 
some politicians most notably boris yeltsin president of the 
russian republic have won wide popular support by attacking 
privilege 
dozens of country homes have been converted from private 
residences for the elite to public rest homes the newspaper 
rabochaya tribuna reported aug 8 that the number of aircraft 
reserved for the privileged had been drastically reduced 
those who are more equal than others have a strong grip on 
sochi however and few of its facilities have gone public 
melkonyan told viewers that of the resort areas 151 beaches only 
22 were open to ordinary people 
in addition to the reserved beaches sochi has elaborate private 
resort complexes known in russian as sanatoriums they do not 
appear on maps are generally visible only from the sea and are 
heavily guarded 
down the beach from the actors sanatorium and pravda 
sanatorium spas for actors and journalists is the dzerzhinsky 
sanatorium the summer hideaway of kgb agents named for felix 
dzerzhinsky who founded the soviet secret police 
it begins at the seaside with a covered patio adorned with tall 
ornate yellow arches and white columns an elevator takes 
vacationers up a hill to a main building tucked into a thickly 
wooded area 
exclusive beachfront facilities nearby include a small yellow 
villa with white arches that was favored by lavrenti beria 
dictator josef stalins chief of secret police 
farther along the black sea coast are the dachas as the villas 
are called of president mikhail s gorbachev premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov and anatoly i lukyanov 
at least two resorts have been partly opened to the public after 
decades of catering to the elite 
the 180acre green grove resort once reserved for communist 
party officials received automotive workers from gorky and 
steelworkers from magnitogorsk last year director ludmilla 
voblikova reported 
staffs of communist party schools from janitors to instructors 
spend vacations at the complex on a wooded hill overlooking the sea 
voblikova has run the place since 1958 when privilege was not 
questioned she proclaimed allegiance to the new policy but said 
i think we should all work well and the better we work the 
better we should live 
at nearby lenin sanitorium the splendor formerly saved for 
communist party officials now is available to workers from 
collective farms 
they live in a gray marble dormitory built in 1984 that has 
clean carpeted wellfurnished rooms 
an older building erected in the 1950s has an italian 
courtyard with colored tile white columns and an ornate 
fountain in the main dining room are glass chandeliers white 
marble columns and parquet floors

a sudden steep drop in oil prices shocked some 
traders but motorists shouldnt be surprised if they keep paying 
increased prices when they fill up their cars at least for now 
critics of the oil industry contend that companies tend to pass 
on higher prices much more quickly than they pass on savings they 
say the lag that follows cheaper oil prices is an example of oil 
company gouging 
oil companies bristle at the the accusation saying the pricing 
of petroleum products is left to market forces some industry 
analysts defend the policies saying the cost of crude oil and 
gasoline on world markets has risen far faster than retail prices 
in recent months 
crude oil fell 4 per barrel monday on the new york mercantile 
exchange while gasoline for september delivery declined 171 cents 
to 875 cents per gallon 
according to the american automobile association gasoline 
prices at the pump have risen an average of 20 cents per gallon 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
while pump prices werent expected to fall immediately conoco 
inc in houston said it would lower the price of its branded 
wholesale gasoline by 2 to 5 cents per gallon beginning today 
because of softer market conditions 
it also said it would cut prices for unbranded wholesale 
gasoline by 1065 cents per gallon because retailers are required 
by federal law to set pump prices lower prices for drivers could 
not be guaranteed conoco said 
a ralph nader consumers group buyers up said it generally 
takes up to several weeks for lower oil prices to translate into 
lower retail gasoline prices 
james w brock a business professor at miami university in 
oxford ohio said he believes the behavior of prices has shown 
that oil giants are taking advantage of consumers during the 
current crisis 
the oil companies jumped on it to raise prices instantly he 
said that hasnt been true when it goes down 
in addition to complaints from consumer groups cries of price 
gouging have been heard from members of congress and numerous state 
attorneys general 
oil companies repeatedly have denied charges that they are 
operating unfairly and say pump prices did not rise as much as 
wholesale prices following the iraqi invasion 
according to a lundberg survey of 13500 stations nationwide 
wholesale prices rose nearly twice as much as retail prices in the 
period from aug 10 to aug 24 in addition federal law bars 
companies from setting pump prices which is left to local service 
stations 
also the need for oil companies to purchase large amounts of 
gasoline on socalled spot markets is less now than a month 
ago at the peak of the nations summer driving season 
with summer demand at its tail end us oil companies now can 
rely more on their own producing and refining capabilities and will 
be less affected by the price drops some experts said 
gus ensz a spokesman for the american petroleum institute said 
pump prices are likely to follow crude prices logic is logic 
he said what goes up comes down or what goes down comes up 
there is no reliable way for anybody to predict how prices will 
move or when ensz said 
theres no fixed formula he said there are thousands of 
people making decisions on it theres not only companies there 
are middlemen there are dealers themselves literally tens of 
thousands of people make those decisions theres not a central 
headquarters where its done 
ensz acknowledged a public perception that oil companies are 
quick to pass along higher costs but slow to pass along savings 
there is that feeling he said i think that in the long 
run studies have shown that everything equalizes eventually

merrill lynch amp co and its insurers have 
settled a set of claims stemming from 250 million in losses from 
trading mortgagebacked securities announced in april 1987 
officials said 
merrill also agreed to release more than 1 million in 
compensation plus interest previously withheld from howard a 
rubin a senior trader merrill had blamed for a substantial portion 
of the losses 
merrill spokeswoman monica prihoda said monday that merrill had 
received 175 million from insurance companies that provide its 
directors and officers with liability coverage to settle various 
lawsuits brought by shareholders for the firm 
merrill had dimissed rubin after the losses occurred and said it 
had given the securities and exchange commission information 
relating to allegedly unauthorized trading 
rubin earlier this year settled sec charges without admitting or 
denying guilt that he had aided and abetted a recordkeeping 
violation in connection with the trades 
it is worth noting that these lawsuits are being settled 
without him paying anything and indeed with merrill paying him 
said george yankwitt an attorney for rubin 
i consider this a complete vindication of mr rubins 
position which is that he had not engaged in any unauthorized or 
wrongful trading he said 
prihoda declined to comment on details of the settlement with 
rubin as cited by yankwitt 
the lawsuits against the firm had mainatined that the losses 
were caused by rubin and that his superiors had failed to supervise 
his activities 
the settlement with mr rubin was to resolve prior contractual 
claims unrelated to the trading loss prihoda said 
she also said merrill believes all shareholder allegations about 
who was to blame for the trading losses arev without merit 
except those relating to the conduct of howard rubin 
in addition to the trading losses various merrill shareholders 
had filed other claims on the firms behalf against several 
executives and officers the lawsuits cited lease agreements 
various transactions and merrills investment in a resort 
development in st thomas in the us virgin islands 
the 175 million payment also represented a settlement of those 
claims said david ap brower a lawyer for various merrill 
shareholders

general motors corp the worlds largest 
automaker plans to install air bags on the drivers side of all 
its cars built in the united states by the fall of 1995 
barring unforeseen design problems the safety devices would be 
in all chevrolets pontiacs oldsmobiles buicks and cadillacs the 
company said monday the plan doesnt apply to cars gm makes in 
cooperation with japanese companies such as the geo and the nova 
the announcement came as gm plays catchup with its big three 
competitors in installing a safety device that appears destined to 
become as common as the safety belt 
chrysler corp currently equips almost all its north 
americanmade cars with air bags first announcing the step in 
1988 and ford motor co has air bags in about half of its fleet 
under federal law all cars made in the united states after 
sept 1 1989 must have either an air bag or automatic seat belt 
for drivers and frontseat passengers 
gm last november said that driversside air bags would be 
standard or optional equipment on 13 million 1991 models up from 
450000 model 1990 cars 
air bags normally are stored in the steering wheel and inflate 
rapidly during a crash they have been mainly on the drivers side 
because that seat always is occupied and because many injuries are 
caused on impact with the steering wheel 
gm president lloyd reuss said the company will begin offering 
passengerside air bags in the 1992 model year officials said gm 
is conducting research on rearseat air bags but there are no firm 
plans to offer them 
engineering and market considerations led gm to decide to 
install driversside air bags by late 1995 said donald postma 
spokesman for gms technical staffs group 
the only gm cars lacking driversside air bags would be those 
in which the systems posed unforeseen design problems as far as 
we know there wont be any exceptions postma said 
gm first introduced air bags as optional equipment in the 1988 
model year since then the automaker has made the devices standard 
on some models and introduced them as options on others which 
postma said would continue until 1995 
postma declined to say how much each airbag system costs gm 
air bags on the 1990 oldsmobile 98 and oldsmobile 88 are options 
costing the consumer 850 he said 
the 13 million 1991model cars equipped with air bags are 
expected to represent between onethird and onehalf of gms sales 
for the model year 
before deciding to install air bags in all cars gm wanted to 
ensure suppliers could handle the production volume required 
postma said 
he added that the automaker wanted to make sure people were 
ready for this amount of safety the automotive marketplace has 
shown that safety is beginning to sell cars 
the insurance institute for highway safety estimates that air 
bags have inflated in about 2500 crashes since the early 1980s it 
estimates that widespread air bag use could save up to 9000 lives 
annually

nearly all opec ministers today 
tentatively backed a deal that would permit increased oil 
production by saudi arabia venezuela and some other nations to 
help offset losses arising from the middle east crisis 
however officials of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries delayed until wednesday a meeting to give formal approval 
to the arrangement which would temporarily lift the cartels 
supply quotas 
senior delegation sources said on condition of anonymity that 10 
of the 11 nations participating in the informal vienna talks 
favored allowing extra pumping by some producers 
only iran failed to support the arrangement iraq and libya did 
not attend the talks and the meeting was postponed so messages 
could be sent to them 
we are trying of course to get everybody in the accord 
said opec secretarygeneral subroto 
libya had been expected for several days to send a delegation to 
the cartel talks which began on sunday iraq had opposed holding 
the gathering 
earlier today the ministers tried to persuade iran to go along 
with the agreement iran had indicated that if the situation in the 
persian gulf worsened it might boost production 
but after morning talks the iranian oil minister gholamreza 
aqazadeh called the opec move a big mistake 
aqazadeh said western nations should first draw on oil stocks to 
help meet the crisis it is not the responsibility of opec 
only he said for this reason i cannot support an increase in 
production 
the increased output would help fill a gap of about 4 million 
barrels of oil a day pulled off the market by the international 
embargo against iraqi and kuwaiti oil the prohibitions were 
imposed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
most countries have already agreed to sanction production 
increases for the simple reason that the countries are going 
to do it anyway said a source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
if they do it outside opec it may be difficult to have them 
back in the mold again he said monday 
saudi arabia and venezuela have said they will boost pumping to 
help make up for the lost crude caused by the crisis but the two 
would like a nod from the others before going ahead 
a source close to opec said it appeared saudi arabia already has 
increased production to meet the extra demand but he refused to 
say by how much or give other details it would take about a month 
for the oil to enter the market 
saudi arabia which pumps about a quarter of the cartels crude 
has an opec supply quota of 54 million barrels a day 
the output ceiling for all 13 members is 225 million barrels a 
day 
with fears of oil shortages crude prices have skyrocketed 
reaching more than 30 a barrel last week in trading monday they 
fell 4 a barrel 
irans aqazadeh said monday it is not necessary now to boost 
output but maybe in the future 
iran has benefited greatly from the higher prices brought on by 
the crisis 
it contends there is enough excess oil stored in industrialized 
nations to make up for any shortages the consuming nations and 
their oil companies first should draw from these inventories before 
asking opec for help the iranians say 
the arrangement permitting greater pumping was expected to 
contain promises that production must fall back to current levels 
once the crisis ends according to the sources 
it also was likely to call on consuming nations to use some of 
their oil in storage to cover shortages they said 
it was unclear whether the final agreement would be formally 
signed by the members or be more of an understanding among the 
nations 
opec nations are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

a federal judge has overturned a 1488 million 
jury award to cigarette maker liggett group against brown amp 
williamson tobacco corp which had been found guilty of predatory 
pricing 
us district judge frank w bullock in greensboro nc said 
monday the jury had come to its decision in march using legally 
insufficient evidence he denied a motion for a retrial by liggett 
which had accused its larger rival of trying to put it out of 
business 
brown amp williamson is the nations third largest cigarette maker 
with brands including kool and viceroy liggett the nations 
smallest cigarette maker has the lampm lark and chesterfield brands 
bullock said liggett had failed to show that brown amp williamson 
had injured liggett in a dispute that centered on generic 
cigarettes which cost about one third less than the average pack 
price of 160 
alan hilburg a liggett spokesman said company lawyers were 
studying bullocks decision and had not decided whether to appeal 
in its lawsuit liggett argued that brown amp williamson in 1984 
and 1985 used volume discounts and rebates to wholesalers which 
forced liggett to match the incentives and reduced its profits 
liggetts market share was the industrys lowest before it entered 
the discount business 
liggett based in durham nc also charged that louisville 
kybased brown amp williamson had copied liggetts plain 
blackandwhite packaging in an attempt to confuse consumers 
after 115 days of testimony and nine days of deliberations a 
federal jury in greensboro awarded liggett 496 million in 
damages which automatically is tripled under the law 
the judges ruling underscores that what happened when brown amp 
williamson began selling generic cigarettes is exactly whats 
supposed to happen in a freeenterprise system brown amp 
williamson said in a statement 
industry figures show that liggett group had a 144 percent 
market share in discount cigarettes in 1989 down from 152 percent 
the previous year brown amp williamsons generic share was 233 
percent in 1989 up from 204 percent

its a performers dream audiences who idolize 
them full houses high ticket prices potentially huge record 
sales 
and for many of the worlds hottest musicians japan is the best 
place to be whether its rock classical or jazz japan has become 
a must stop often the first stop for traveling bands 
madonna kicked off her 1990 world tour blond ambition with 
a sevenconcert tour of japan beginning april 13 then went back to 
the united states and on to europe 
the money in japan is certainly a factor said liz 
rosenberg a publicist for warner bros records tour sponsorship 
in japan is on a much bigger scale than in other parts of the 
world financially its very worthwhile 
although rosenberg refused to say how worthwhile fans paid 
about 45 million to attend madonnas first three concerts in 
tokyo alone there was no indication how much of that went to 
madonna and how much to local organizers 
the singers flashy show in tokyo consisted of little more than 
deafening music and a garishly lighted stage still about 35000 
young fans at an outdoor stadium screamed and cheered under driving 
rains through shows that lasted for twohours 
other pop performers who played for japanese audiences in the 
first half of 1990 include paul macartney the rolling stones 
michael jackson janet jackson tracy chapman bobby mcferrin and 
david bowie 
rock stars perform in huge stadiums packing in tens of 
thousands while classical music concerts are much smaller but 
while madonnas top ticket price was about 56 good seats for the 
chicago symphony in tokyo ran as high as 168 each 
for classical music lovers the chicago symphony st louis 
symphony cleveland orchestra and the london symphony with leonard 
bernstein conducting have all made recent tours of japan 
many of the orchestral worlds top batons are enthusiastic about 
the japanese music consumer 
st louis symphony conductor leonard slatkin finds japanese 
audiences quiet polite and appreciative 
european audiences often take the music for granted japanese 
never do said christoph von dohnanyi the conductor of the 
cleveland orchestra which toured japan for two weeks in may 
israeli conductor and pianist daniel barenboim who has been 
coming to japan to perform for 25 years agrees 
im always struck by the silence with which the japanese 
audiences listen to music it makes me feel the music is not just 
entertainment but that there is a deep respect almost awe for 
the music said barenboim musical directordesignate of the 
chicago symphony orchestra in an interview 
that is something i find inspiring no other audiences are 
like this no other audiences buy records like the japanese do 
either henry fogel executive director of the chicago symphony 
says that among the three largest record markets in the world 
europe the united states and japan the orchestras royalties 
payments are highest from japan 
fees paid to the orchestra by musical presenter kajimoto concert 
management co are about twice what the chicago symphony gets when 
it tours european capitals but costs are higher in japan too says 
fogel sponsorship from motorola inc and kajimotos fee just 
covered the 21 million cost of the orchestras threeweek japan 
tour last april well break even fogel says 
japan is also home to some wellknown festivals that attract the 
giants of jazz this summers mount fuji jazz festival featured 
wynton marsalis and dizzy gillespie another festival outside 
tokyo select live under the sky will feature pat metheny 
herbie hancock wayne shorter and jack dejohnette 
japanese jazz fans will pay 270 a ticket to see miles davis at 
a small tokyo club this month 
jazz has been popular in japan since it was first introduced by 
us occupation forces after world war ii american jazz labels 
such as blue note have said they were able to remain in business 
during slumps in jazzs popularity in the united states because of 
continuing support in japan 
japan is the second largest market after the united states and 
jazz music sales here total about 66 million a year

a judge today sentenced the former head of 
guinness plc to five years in jail for what he called dishonesty 
on a massive scale in the companys hotlycontested takeover of a 
scottish distillery four years ago 
judge sir denis henry also levied the biggest fine on record 
from a british court nearly 10 million against another defendant 
in the case 
the judge sentenced ernest saunders 54 the former chairman and 
chief executive of guinness to five years in prison on two counts 
of conspiracy and two counts of theft 
saunders was also sentenced to 3 years in prison on eight 
counts of false accounting the sentences are to be served 
concurrently 
codefendant gerald ronson 51 chairman of heron international 
plc was sentenced to one year in prison fined 5 million pounds or 
about 975 million and was ordered to pay about 858000 in 
prosecution costs 
the fine was the largest ever imposed by a british court the 
previous high was 525000 pounds then worth about 750000 
assessed against the national graphical association in 1983 for 
illegally picketing a newspaper plant according to the guinness 
book of records the book is owned by a subsidiary of guinness plc 
saunders ronson and two others were convicted monday in what 
has become known as the biggest whitecollar fraud in britain and 
followed the countrys explosive financialmarket growth in the 
1980s guinness 52 billion buyout of distillers ltd in 1986 was 
the nations biggest takeover to that point 
i am quite satisfied as the jury by their verdicts have 
shown that you were at the center of the dishonest conduct that 
occurred in guinness at the time of the distillers takeover the 
judge told saunders 
saunders was not fined he says he has been impoverished by his 
legal expenses and was granted legal aid for the trial his son 
james said the family would seek further legal aid for an appeal 
former stockbroker anthony parnes 44 was sentenced to 2 years 
in prison and was ordered to pay 858000 prosecution costs 
parnes collapsed during the sentencing an ambulance was called 
but he revived and remained in court 
parnes saunders and ronson had spent their first night in jail 
on monday their bail was revoked following the jury verdict on 
monday at southwark crown court 
a fourth convicted man financier sir jack lyons 74 was free 
on bail to give him time to prepare for and recover from an 
operation on friday for a tumor he will be sentenced sept 25 
the four men were variously convicted of conspiracy theft and 
false accounting saunders was acquitted on a charge of destroying 
guinness documents 
after a 112day trial a jury found the four guilty of secretly 
and illegally rigging the stock market to inflate the price of 
guinness plc shares in 1986 when the company battled competitors 
for control of distillers a scotch whisky and gin manufacturer 
ronson parnes and lyons are millionaires saunders earned 
682000 a year but his attorney said he was now bankrupt and 
penniless his marriage had collapsed and he was living on a weekly 
state handout of 59 
while awaiting trial saunders complained to reporters that he 
no longer had a chauffeurdriven car could not afford taxis and 
was compelled to travel on the crowded london subway 
prosecutor john chadwick said at the start of the trial on feb 
14 these are not men who were likely to make mistakes in their 
commercial affairs these are men who were greedy and arrogant and 
who thought that they were above the law 
to secure control of distillers guinness invited distillers 
stockholders to exchange their shares for guinness stock that 
meant guinness stock had to be more attractive than that of its 
chief competitor in the takeover fight argyll group plc a 
supermarket operator 
the prosecution charged that saunders who had taken charge of 
the ailing guinness in 1981 and transformed it into a highly 
successful business used the companys funds to get others to buy 
guinness stock the large purchases of guinness stock boosted the 
market price of guinness shares 
more than 7686 million worth of shares were purchased during 
the takeover the prosecution claimed guinness paid about 48 
million in unlawful indemnities against losses and in fees 
guinness succeeded in april 1986 in what was then britains 
largest takeover saunders personally was set to make more than 5 
million from the operation 
the department of trade and industry launched an investigation 
in december 1986 after receiving information from us authorities 
who had arrested a major guinness supporter ivan boesky for 
insider dealing in may 1987 the police were called in and the 
arrests of saunders and the others followed 
the daily telegraph reported the trial was the most expensive in 
british criminal history with total legal costs estimated at 29 
million 
the hearing involved 107 days of testimony by 62 witnesses as 
well as saunders who took the stand for two weeks in his own 
defense the judge spent five days on his summingup before the 
jury of seven men and four women returned their verdicts after 34 
hours deliberation spread over six days

oil prices rebounded a bit today after falling 
4 per barrel a day earlier as traders wondered what will happen 
in thursdays planned meeting between the un secretarygeneral 
and iraqs foreign minister 
its just a very choppy market at this point said ed 
kevelson a trader with dean witter reynolds inc i think it will 
chop around for a couple of days youll probably see a lot of 
emphasis put on that meeting 
oil took its biggest fall in recent memory on monday partially 
on news that the un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
would meet with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to discuss the 
middle east crisis traders were also betting on the possibility of 
increased opec production 
in early trading this morning on the new york mercantile 
exchange the price of light sweet crude rose 29 cents to 2720 
per barrel for october delivery the contract fell 4 a barrel on 
monday 
other petroleum futures also showed slight recoveries today 
unleaded regular gasoline was up 169 cents to 8925 cents per 
gallon on september contracts after dropping 1710 cents on monday 
home heating oil was up 150 cents to 7960 cents per gallon on 
september contracts after mondays decline of 1286 cents 
but natural gas for october delivery continued its descent 
slipping from 1502 to 1500 per 1000 cubic feet it had fallen 
23 cents on monday 
kevelson said today that thursdays meeting could send oil 
prices down again if any progress appears to have been made but if 
the meeting fails to come off or if nothing notable is 
accomplished prices could move back up 
until then youre going to kick around in somewhat of a big 
range he predicted 
analysts said mondays sharp decline in oil and petroleum 
product prices was also based partially on the prospect of 
increased opec production which could offset much of the 4 million 
barrels a day kept off the market through the international boycott 
of iraq and kuwait 
meeting today in vienna nearly all opec ministers tentatively 
backed a deal that would permit increased oil production by saudi 
arabia venezuela and some other nations to help offset losses 
arising from the middle east crisis 
however the opec officials they would wait until wednesday to 
hold a meeting for giving formal approval to the temporary lifting 
of the cartels supply quotas

in 1956 harland sanders threatened with 
financial ruin by the advent of a new superhighway left his little 
restaurant here and took his idea for kentucky fried chicken on the 
road 
on sunday the 100th anniversary of the fastfood legends 
birth the owner of that original restaurant is bringing a little 
bit of colonel sanders back home 
after almost a decade of planning one of the colonels first 
restaurants has been turned into a museum by john r neal whose 
company jrn inc owns 87 kentucky fried chicken franchises 
its neals way of honoring the whitesuited entrepreneur whose 
homecooked meals served to hungry travelers at a southeastern 
kentucky service station spawned a fastfood empire that now boasts 
8000 outlets in 58 countries 
it revolutionized fastfood service neal said and it all 
started right there in corbin 
the museum which opens sunday is housed in the colonels third 
restaurant where he developed both his fingerlickin good secret 
recipe and the pressurecooker method that gave birth to the 
fastfood era 
it gives me the opportunity to share the fruits of the 
effort the idea of colonel sanders and the kentucky fried chicken 
dream neal said its really a very important piece of 
americana 
built in 1940 the harland sanders cafe and motor court were on 
old us 25 then one of the main northsouth routes across the 
united states but plans for interstate 75 threatened to divert 
travelers around his restaurant and sanders saw the end of his 
lifes work 
but sanders who at age 65 already had guided his business 
through the depression and world war ii had enough confidence in 
himself and his product to take his idea on the road 
he loaded his car with pressure cookers and bags of spices and 
built his empire one handshake at a time 
sanders who died in 1980 obtained the colonel appellation 
in the 1930s from kentucky gov ruby laffoon who named him a 
kentucky colonel a honorary state title in recognition of his 
contributions to the states cuisine 
he started franchising his restaurants in 1952 by 1964 when he 
sold the business to a group of investors that included future 
kentucky gov john y brown he had more than 600 franchises in the 
united states and canada 
the company which was bought in 1986 by pepsico inc for 840 
million now has annual sales of about 5 billion 
the renovation of the cafe the motel now longer stands has 
been two years in the making and it wasnt easy 
paul cross jrns director of special projects had to look to 
hollywood calif to find companies to reproduce the battleship 
linoleum used on the cafes floors and the wheeletched glass that 
bore the colonels name on the front of the building 
but the most difficult items to locate were the period 
appliances for the kitchen a vulcan oven and a hobart dishwasher 
after miles of dead ends cross finally found the appliances at 
his old junior high school in shelbyville tenn both pieces still 
were in working order the ovens pilot still was lit 
i feel like i have a guardian angel he said 
cross and his team worked from pictures and postcards of the 
cafe and from the accounts of townspeople but they also had some 
consulting help from the folks who knew the restaurant and 
sanders best his family 
they have really gone to every length to get it back like it 
was in the beginning said mildred sanders ruggles the younger 
of sanders two daughters and his first field representative 
they have certainly done it she said 
other consultants include sanders other daughter margaret 
sanders of west palm beach fla and his widow claudia sanders 
who lives in shelbyville ky 
visitors to the museum will be able to purchase their food at a 
stateoftheart kfc kitchen adjacent to the original building but 
theyll eat in the old dining room 
surrounding them will be exhibits illustrating sanders life 
including such items as the china on which he served his famous 
homecooked meals the certificate of incorporation for his first 
restaurant the first photograph taken of him in his white suit 
his goldtipped walking stick and handwritten recipe cards 
though not the one with his secret recipe 
the exhibit also includes an exact reproduction of the model 
motel room sanders built near the ladies restroom to lure families 
to spend the night 
we think thats a fairly ingenious marketing strategy cross 
said 
mrs ruggles is just glad her fathers old restaurant is being 
taken care of the way he would have liked it 
it wasnt daddy she said of the restaurant before the 
renovations it didnt have any class and now theyre going back 
and making it all the way it was its something that we as a 
family will be proud of and my daddy would say a job well 
done

the united auto workers union today picked the 
biggest of the big three automakers as its target company in 
contract negotiations covering 450000 active auto workers 
uaw president owen bieber said general motors corp which 
employs 300000 of the active workers affected by the three 
national contracts would be the target company 
we were here to choose a target company at which we can 
achieve a pattern agreement for 1990 bieber said 
gm said it welcomed the uaws decision 
because it represents the largest segment of the uaw it 
seemed appropriate that the company be selected to lead contract 
negotiations gm said in a written statement 
bieber declined to talk about specifics that led to the 
selection of gm and refused to talk about strategies the union may 
pursue with just 18 days left in the current agreement 
talks at ford motor co and chrysler corp will be put on hold 
while the uaw tries to work out a threeyear agreement with gm that 
then would be used as a pattern for talks at no 2 ford and no 3 
chrysler 
national contracts which cover about 450000 hourly workers 
and several thousand salaried workers expire sept 14 raising 
pressure on negotiators to reach an agreement quickly to avoid 
laying the groundwork for a possible strike 
the contracts cover issues common to all unionized autoworkers 
such as wages and benefits local contracts many of which are 
being negotiated now cover issues such as local work rules and 
seniority rights 
chief negotiators for each company have said they want to be the 
national bargaining target because it gives the automaker a chance 
to negotiate an agreement more tailored to its needs 
gm and ford negotiated their current agreements with the uaw in 
1987 when ford was chosen as a target chryslers current contract 
was negotiated in 1988 
in 1984 gm and ford were selected as dual targets in the last 
week of bargaining the uaw decided to focus on gm the union hit 
gm with a sevenday strike that shut down all of its assembly 
plants and other factories 
speculation about which company would be the unions target this 
year has been going on since talks began in midjuly observers 
gave little chance of chrysler being chosen as the target because 
of its relatively weak financial condition 
in fact one of the biggest questions is whether chrysler would 
remain part of the bargaining pattern the uaw fought to 
reestablish this year the last time the three contracts had a 
common expiration date was 11 years ago 
chrysler broke from the pattern in the early 1980s when union 
members accepted concessions to help the strapped automaker survive 
a nearbrush with bankruptcy 
this year chryslers chief negotiator vice president anthony 
st john contends that since the companys peremployee labor 
costs are much higher than gms or fords it has special needs and 
may not be able to afford a gm or fordnegotiated contract 
st john said simply continuing the current contract provisions 
for another three years would add 16 percent to chryslers labor 
costs an expense the automaker couldnt afford 
uaw officials have brushed aside questions about negotiating 
separately with the target and chrysler saying pattern bargaining 
is here to stay

the al williams corp acquired by 
primerica corp nine months ago will eliminate about 250 jobs a 
company spokesman said 
the cuts are part of a restructuring that will affect all levels 
of the insurance and financial services company williams spokesman 
mark supic said 
he said the majority of the job losses will come from al 
williams corp and massachusetts indemnity and life insurance co 
which together employ about 1700 people 
the restructuring by primerica already has affected some top 
williams officials including president william keane who left the 
company earlier this month after his position was eliminated

review of all primerica subsidiaries and are expected to improve 
operating efficiencies supic said 
primerica completed its acquisition of williams last november 
when it paid 470 million for the companys remaining publicly held 
stock primerica spokeswoman mary mcdermott said the job cuts at 
williams are part of an effort to restructure all of the 
corporations holdings the move began in 1988 when primerica was

fiat spa announced tuesday it would 
temporarily lay off 35000 of its 116000 factory workers 
the layoffs were to address sharperthanexpected declines in 
european auto sales during the second quarter said a spokesman for 
fiat italys largest industrial group 
the second quarter has been far below expectations the 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said the layoff plan which will involve work suspensions 
ranging from one to three weeks over the next three months will 
help reduce excess production capacity that has built up due to the 
poor growth of the european auto market 
the suspensions will begin the week of september 24 and continue 
through december 
fiat under the layoff plan has also frozen hiring of unskilled 
bluecollar workers and stopped authorizing overtime 
the spokesman said fiat had planned to sell more than 24 
million units in 1990 based on an average growth rate of 22 
percent of the european car market during the first quarter 
fiat posted record sales in that quarter helped by an 
aboveaverage 57 percent growth rate of the italian car market he 
said 
but after secondquarter sales figures showed the european 
market was actually shrinking by 36 percent fiat had to revise 
its sales projection to 224 million units in 1990 he said 
fiat is also expected to be hurt by the crisis in the gulf and 
consequent higher oil prices 
we will reduce our capacity by some 75000 units by the end of 
the year the spokesman said 
under italian law companies can suspend workers with pay under 
adverse market conditions including an excess of capacity the 
workers receive 85 percent of their full salary through a pool of 
funds to which the company contributes 
fiats share of the italian market fell to 543 percent in the 
first semester of 1990 from 58 percent in the first half of 1989

mondays sharp decline of prices in the grain market the selloff 
was tied to the drop in crude oil and precious metals prices 
there was very little action in the stocks oil and precious 
metals so the grains traded both sides of market said jerry 
zusel an analyst with balfour maclaine corp in chicago 
grain and soybean prices were pushed higher last week on fears 
of war in the middle east and fears of inflation in the united 
states he said 
people are watching events in the middle east zusel said 
if we get a new spate of news on a negative note then grain 
prices will rise again otherwise grains will be on the defensive 
the latest state crop reports indicate the condition of corn and 
soybeans has improved because of hot dry weather conditions 
prices are also being pressured by a lack of export demand 
at the close wheat was a cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 279 a bushel corn was a 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with september at 254 a bushel oats 
were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with september at 108 a bushel

donald trump has pledged his 272 percent 
stake in alexanders inc as collateral for his 65 million 
financial rescue from casino and bank debt documents disclosed 
tuesday 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission trump 
revealed that as part of the restructuring of some 2 billion in 
debt last week he pledged more than 135 million shares in the new 
york department store chain as security 
the three new york banks to which the alexanders stock was 
pledged were not identified in the documents 
the slumping new york real estate market and disappointing 
results from his atlantic city nj casinos put trump in a cash 
squeeze earlier this year endangering his ability to pay his debts 
on time 
on june 15 trump failed to make a 43 million payment on bonds 
issued to build the trumps castle hotel and casino in atlantic 
city he also was overdue on a 30 million loan payment to a group 
led by manufacturers hanover trust co 
but the new jersey casino control commission approved the bank

a judge came down hard tuesday on convicts in 
britains biggest whitecollar fraud sentencing the former head of 
brewing giant guinness plc to five years imprisonment and a 
codefendant to a record fine 
another defendant collapsed in court as judge sir denis henry 
was about to pronounce his sentence in the guinness plc scandal 
stemming from the companys multibillion dollar takeover of a 
scottish distiller four years ago 
four prominent professionals were convicted monday on 19 counts 
of fraud and other charges in the scandal which revealed the dark 
side of the takeover craze that swept britain in the late 1980s it 
symbolized an era of greed akin to the insider trading scandal that 
rocked wall street at the same time 
henry said he ordered the stiff punishment for the lead 
defendant former guinness chairman and chief executive officer 
ernest saunders because of what the judge called his dishonesty 
on a massive scale 
the judge levied an unprecedented 975 million fine against 
millionaire businessman codefendant gerald ronson as well as a 
one year prison term for what the judge described as an attack on 
the integrity of the market 
former top stockbroker anthony parnes sentenced to 2 12 years 
imprisonment passed out during the proceedings causing a 
90minute delay while a doctor treated him 
ronson and parnes also were ordered to pay more than 850000 
each for the costs of the prosecution 
millionaire financier sir jack lyons 74 convicted with the 
others monday will be sentenced on sept 25 the judge freed him 
on bail so he can undergo surgery 
a jury found the four had secretly and illegally rigged the 
stock market to inflate the price of guinness shares in 1986 that 
helped the company successfully battle competitors for control of 
distillers ltd a whisky and gin manufacturer 
the judge said the guinness case had shown that when men are 
hellbent on victory greed is in the saddle and the normal 
commercial proprieties and respect for the law are cast aside in 
the rush 
the mammoth trial at southwark crown court lasted more than 100 
days 
henry especially criticized saunders 54 for what he called the 
former executives dishonesty in allowing the payment of illegal 
multimillion dollar fees to prop up guinness stock price 
that helped guinness win its 526 billion takeover battle 
against supermarket operators argyll for distillers at the time 
it was britains largest takeover 
i am quite satisfied as the jury by their verdicts have 
shown that you were at the center of the dishonest conduct that 
occurred in guinness at the time of the distillers takeover the 
judge told saunders 
saunders son james 24 called the sentence appalling and 
totally unwarranted and said his father would appeal 
my father has been made a scapegoat he has lost everything in 
his entire life he said saunders has lost his country home and 
his job and split with his wife carole since the scandal broke 
saunders will stand trial again later this year with three other 
britons accused of misconduct during the distillers takeover 
british authorities are trying to have american lawyer thomas ward 
extradited from the united states to be tried with them 
the fine against ronson 51 breaks the record for the highest 
court fine previously held by the national graphical association 
union it was fined 750000 in 1983 for illegally picketing a 
newspaper plant 
ronsons lawyer lord mishcon said he was shocked by his 
clients sentence 
obviously mr ronson and the family find it difficult to 
accept because they regard mr ronson as mr ronson regards 
himself as having acted honorably and honestly he said

american workers wracked by the widening gap 
between the wellpaid and the poorly paid are likely to force labor 
issues particularly health care to the forefront in the 1990s 
analysts and union leaders predict 
that middle class thats been stepped on and pushed down to a 
lower class is starting to resent it and fight back richard 
trumka president of the united mine workers said in advance of 
this first labor day of the 1990s 
people will no longer tolerate the fact that they work 40 
hours or more a week and dont have health care that their 
children dont have health care trumka said 
jim green a labor historian at the university of massachusetts 
said that the coming years would bring a lot of anticorporate 
sentiment from people who are having a hard time making it 
i think people are scared and angry about the uncertainty of 
their lives about whats happened to the safety net if were 
working harder why arent we getting ahead 
the 80s was a decade of yuppies and bmws an 
ostentatious wasteful display of wealth green said in the 
90s i think were going to see a lot of social unrest as people 
start to realize that theres been a real decline in their quality 
of life 
real earnings or wages after adjustment for inflation ground 
to a standstill for many americans in the 1980s according to 
figures provided by the bureau of labor statistics 
using 1977 as a base the median weekly salary in 1980 was 257 
but that translated to 190 after adjustment for inflation the 
bureau said 
this years figures show that the median weekly salary for the 
apriljune period was 413 but after inflation it was just 195 
giving workers only a minuscule improvement in their purchasing 
power over 1980 the bls said 
that american myth about being able to pull yourself up by 
your bootstraps it doesnt exist anymore said barbara otto of 
9to5 national association of working women an advocacy group for 
secretarial and clerical workers 
another study released this weekend by the economic policy 
institute a laborbacked group found that from 1979 to 1988 the 
incomes of the wealthiest 5 percent of american families grew 176 
percent five times faster than incomes for the bottom 80 percent 
that study also said real wages for the average american worker 
have declined by almost 10 percent over the past decade and that an 
additional 58 million people were living in poverty compared with 
1979 
barry bluestone an economist with the university of 
massachusetts contends that the recent shift to a service sector 
economy has produced thousands of mcjobs at fastfood chains 
rather than goodpaying jobs he says workers standing will worsen 
if the nation slips into recession soon as many economists fear 
the working joe or jane did not have much to celebrate during 
the 1980s it seems clear to most economists that the early 
1990s will treat the average worker even worse than the 80s 
bluestone said i see a continuation of the trends that we saw in 
the 1980s the polarization between the well paid and poorly paid 
michael dukakis tried to make a declining middle class a main 
theme of his 1988 presidential bid but voters overwhelmingly 
rejected the democrats argument instead favoring republican 
claims that the longest peacetime expansion in the nations history 
had created millions of new jobs in the 1980s and given americans 
unprecedented prosperity 
union leaders are hoping that workers growing dissatisfaction 
will help revive the labor movement which suffered a series of 
blows in recent years membership has dropped the 17 million 
americans who belonged to unions last year made up just 164 
percent of the work force down from the 18 percent they accounted 
for in 1985 
in addition labors ultimate weapon the strike has lost a 
bit of its firepower because more and more companies feel 
emboldened to hire permanent replacement workers union leaders pin 
the start of that trend on former president reagans firing of air 
traffic controllers in 1981 
one of labors immediate priorities is to get congress to outlaw 
the practice used most recently in the greyhound drivers strike 
and against machinists and pilots at eastern air lines 
trumka noting that the american labor movement originally grew 
out of social unrest said unions are counting on a similar 
movement in the 90s 
in the 80s working peoples issues were like holding your 
hand out in the sunlight it never got burned said the 
mineworkers president in the 90s its going to be like 
holding a magnifying glass out in that sunlight and focusing on one 
spot on that hand

energy futures on tuesday regained some of the huge losses that 
occurred in the previous days trading but analysts said trading 
on the new york mercantile exchange was confused due to a lack of 
news in the persian gulf 
on other markets precious metal futures were off grain and 
soybeans were mixed and livestock and pork futures fell 
todays market was a function of yesterdays market said 
andrew lebow an analyst with ed amp f man international futures 
inc we bounced up but there was not any particular news to 
account for the rally 
crude oil futures prices had their sharpest oneday decline in 
history on monday due to expectations the middle east crisis would 
be resolved diplomatically 
we ended higher yet a lot of the news is bearish said an 
analyst who asked not to be named i thought we would see more 
what we saw yesterday 
while the price of spot crude was higher prices for later 
contracts were lower traders said the losses in the later months 
were a correction of the distortion that developed monday as 
trading limits prevented those contracts from falling as steeply as 
the prices for current delivery 
light sweet settled 66 cents lower to 99 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in october at 2788 a barrel heating oil 
was 179 cents to 443 cents lower with september at 7952 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 6 cents lower to 97 cent higher with 
september at 8853 cents a gallon 
on the new york commodity exchange precious metals continued 
the selloff that began monday 
precious metals remain totally dependent on what goes on in 
iraq and on the crude oil market said william oneill an 
analyst with merrill lynch futures inc in new york no other 
factors are having an impact on prices 
oneill said producer selling is the primary reason for the 
overall weakness of precious metals he said the price levels 
reached by gold and silver in recent weeks have been the best in a 
long time 
the producers australia south africa and the soviet union 
took advantage of that and dried up speculative interest oneill 
said 
gold was 330 to 410 lower with august at 385 a troy ounce 
silver was 80 cent to 3 cents lower with august at 4840 a troy 
ounce 
grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in light trading on 
the chicago board of trade 
analysts said traders were taking a waitandsee attitude after 
mondays sharp decline of prices in the grain market the selloff 
was tied to the drop in crude oil and precious metals prices 
there was very little action in the stocks oil and precious 
metals so the grains traded both sides of market said jerry 
zusel an analyst with balfour maclaine corp in chicago 
grain and soybean prices were pushed higher last week on fears 
of war in the middle east and fears of inflation in the united 
states he said 
people are watching events in the middle east zusel said 
if we get a new spate of news on a negative note then grain 
prices will rise again otherwise grains will be on the defensive 
the latest state crop reports indicate the condition of corn and 
soybeans has improved because of hot dry weather conditions 
prices are also being pressured by a lack of export demand 
wheat was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 
279 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
september at 253 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower 
with september at 108 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 
1 cents higher with september at 619 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures were lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange as profittaking set in after mondays price climb 
sluggish retail demand for beef weighed on livestock futures as 
expections for lower cash hog prices pushed pork futures lower 
live cattle were 30 cent lower to 15 cent higher with october 
at 7665 cents a pound feeder cattle were 02 cent to 25 cent 
lower with august at 8857 cents a pound hogs were 13 cent to 77 
cent lower with october at 4845 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 180 cents to 2 cents lower with february at 5237 cents a 
pound

nabisco brands inc announced tuesday it 
will begin marketing a fatfree cracker next month 
the fat free premium crackers will be on store shelves by sept 
10 with a price tag of 179 for a 15ounce package said ann 
smith spokeswoman for the company which is a division of rjr 
nabisco inc 
the label on the cracker says it has zero grams of fat per half 
cup or five crackers compared to the original premium cracker 
which has two grams of fat for the same quantity 
smith said the previous fat level is a fairly high amount 
especially since people rarely eat crackers alone 
the company began developing the new crackers about two years 
ago as many consumers began to lower fat and cholesterol intake and 
as other companies introduced fatfree cakes yogurts and other 
products smith said

a federal appeals court on tuesday ruled that 
the governments resolution trust corp can override arkansas bank 
branching laws in approving the sale of a failed savings and loan 
the 21 ruling by the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
overturned a lower court ruling that said the sale of federal 
independence savings to worthen bank and trust co would violate 
arkansas state law 
at issue is an rtc regulation that permits banks making 
emergency acquisitions of insolvent thrifts such as independence to 
operate the branches of the thrift as bank branches independence 
has 20 branches in 15 counties 
us district judge stephen m reasoner of little rock ark 
had ruled that the rtcs proposed sale to worthen would violate 
arkansas bank branching law which limits banks to branches within 
their home counties 
the rtc argued that it was granted broad rulemaking authority 
by congress in its mission to maximize the returns and minimize the 
losses in resolving failed thrifts 
we consider todays ruling to be a significant victory for the 
taxpayers of the united states worthen president and chairman 
curt bradbury said in a statement 
he said the bank believes acquiring independence will be a 
beneficial stabilizing force for the financialservices segment 
of our economy 
rtc attorney dorothy nichols said the case had national 
implications because 26 states have similar laws 
the rtcs authority has been challenged in new mexico and 
colorado rtc spokesman steve katsanos said he said a district 
court judge in new mexico sided with the rtc earlier this year 
in colorado a hearing on the case is scheduled for sept 5 
katsanos said the district court has issued a restraining order to 
keep the rtc from going ahead with any transaction that would 
involve overriding colorado state law 
in the independence case arkansas state bank commissioner bill 
j ford and the arkansas independent bankers association had filed 
suit june 28 to block the proposed sale to worthen 
in arguments before the appellate court the rtcs nichols 
argued that most of independences branch offices would be shut 
down by the rtc if the institution was sold piecemeal 
the most valuable assets of sampls in dire straits arent their 
loan portfolios she said the most valuable asset of a failed 
thrift is its branches 
ford argued that the states 1988 branching law which would 
permit statewide branches gradually over 10 years was necessary to 
ensure fair competition 
tuesdays opinion was written by circuit judge john r gibson 
for circuit judge frank j magill 
senior circuit judge gerald w heaney dissented agreeing with 
arkansas officials that the rtcs regulation referred only to the 
ability of the savings associations to operate branches and not to 
the ability of a bank to retain and operate branches

source perrier will replace the label on its 
sparkling water in europe because it doesnt meet european 
community criteria for naturally carbonated water officials said 
the label that describes perrier as naturally carbonated 
will be replaced in europe nov 1 with one reading natural 
mineral water fortified with gas from the spring 
this marks the third label change in six months for perrier 
earlier this year traces of benzene were discovered in some 
bottles leading to a worldwide recall of 160 million bottles 
labels for bottles produced after the recall carried the words 
new production to distinguish them from the earlier vintage 
a dirty filter on a gas line caused the benzene contamination 
then in april source perrier and the us food and drug 
administration agreed that the word naturally would be dropped 
from the label reading perrier naturally sparkling mineral 
water 
british deputy food minister david maclean praised the change in 
europe as a victory for european consumers 
similar changes in labeling had already been agreed for the 
us market and it is right that uk consumers should also have 
the same treatment maclean said 
the us changes will occur in late october said jane lazgin 
spokeswoman for perrier group of america inc of greenwich conn 
the companys us distributor 
in europe perrier will exhaust its stock of old labels before 
switching to the new ones this fall 
the latest labeling change developed after the british 
government filed a complaint with the ecs executive commission 
alleging perriers labeling violated ec regulations and misled 
consumers 
the dispute arose from the way perrier produces 1 billion 
bottles of water a year said british officials and peter thomas 
perriers international marketing director 
carbon dioxide gas occurs naturally at the perrier spring at 
vergeze in southern france perrier normally separates the water 
from the gas underground and pipes them separately to the bottling 
plant they are remixed during the bottling process 
thomas said that perrier adds additional gas to the water by 
drilling deeper into the spring and tapping pockets of natural 
carbon dioxide 
that gas forms perhaps a little under half of the carbon dioxide 
bubbles in a bottle of perrier thomas estimated 
it is a naturally sparkling mineral water thomas said we 
also reinforce that with gas from deeper in the spring 
but the ecs natural mineral waters directive states that the 
term naturally carbonated applies only to waters containing the 
same gas they had in the spring if other gas from the spring is 
added the water comes under the fortified heading 
perrier voluntarily agreed to change the label after agreeing 
with the ec commission and the french government that the new 
billing would better describe the product thomas said 
the nov 1 change affects the 12nation european community 
about 60 percent of perriers market thomas said adding that 
other nations may request similar treatment 
perriers sales and prestige fell sharply after the us food 
and drug administration discovered benzene in some samples in 
february 
the us ordered a recall and perrier voluntarily extended it 
around the world a week later when benzeneladen bottles turned up 
in other countries 
the company which stakes its reputation on the purity of its 
bottled water quickly regained the lost sales this spring sales 
are at 75 percent of their level last winter thomas said while in 
france perrier sold more bottles in july this year than in july 
1989

arizona businessman charles keating jr a 
key figure in the savings and loan debacle gave financial 
disclosure statements to the government tuesday a day past a 
federal judges deadline 
we were preparing a contempt case against him when the 
paperwork was filed said thomas p mason jr a spokesman for 
the office of thrift supervision 
keating says he is broke the ots had ordered keating to prove 
it and partially froze his assets in connection with its efforts to 
recover 41 million from keating and five associates 
that effort stems from the failure of irvinebased lincoln 
savings and loan association which keating controlled and has been 
accused of looting regulators have estimated the collapse may cost 
taxpayers 2 billion contending with miamis centrust bank as the 
nations costliest failure 
the ots got a court order enforcing its administrative action 
from us district judge stephen v wilson in los angeles last 
week the deadline for disclosure was monday 
keating also has been ordered not to send any money out of the 
country and to give 48 hours notice before spending more than 
5000 
keating earned huge salaries lived lavishly and contributed 
heavily to politicians while he headed american continental corp 
a phoenix development company that owned lincoln 
he contends he never broke any laws and that government 
officials are making him a scapegoat to conceal their own failure 
to prevent the sampl disaster 
however keating suffered a significant defeat last week in 
washington where he was trying to make that case us district 
court judge stanley sporkin dismissed his lawsuit to recover 
control of lincoln saying actions by keating and his cohorts 
amounted to a looting of lincoln 
after the ruling he resigned as chairman and chief executive of 
american continental which is in bankruptcy proceedings 
the thrift office and lawyers for keating are due back in 
wilsons court in los angeles on monday the judge has indicated he 
is likely to extend his orders against keating which initially 
were made in the form of a 10day temporary restraining order 
the financial disclosure statement will not be made public 
carolyn lieberman senior counsel for the thrift office said last 
week that regulators want to know if keating transferred money out 
of the country because he had traveled extensively in switzerland 
and the bahamas in the last few years 
keating says he has never transferred funds overseas

billionaire kirk kerkorian put the desert inn 
and casino up for sale tuesday hoping to raise 200 million or 
more to help finance a planned theme park and 5000room hotel on 
the las vegas strip 
in a statement kerkorian associate fred benninger said 
developing the theme park project had reduced time to devote to the 
desert inn howard hughes onetime flagship and one of the oldest 
resorts in las vegas 
small by las vegas standards with 821 rooms the desert inn has 
found a successful niche catering to highrollers from asia it 
unofficially had been on the market for some time analysts said 
the 185acre site has a championship golf course 34 undeveloped 
acres on the strip and another five acres on which luxury 
condominiums could be built 
kerkorian hopes those factors will help sell the desert inn 
which is coming onto the market at a tough time junk bond and bank 
financing for deals has dried up and huge new resorts have sliced 
away profits at older hotels 
i think the buyer will be someone with vision and an 
interest in fully developing the property said michael 
tennenbaum a vice chairman at bear stearns amp co the investment 
banking firm retained to handle the sale 
tennenbaum said the desert inns wellknown name might be used 
at a chain of hotels he said the price could be in excess of 
200 million if the right buyer can be found bear stearns is 
looking worldwide 
there are a couple of very famous pacific rim clients who go 
there and we suspect the pacific rim buyers are the most likely 
he said 
kerkorian owns the desert inn through his los angelesbased mgm 
grand inc which also operates a luxury airline 
mgm grand announced last october it planned to lure families to 
las vegas by building a movie theme park and huge hotel on the site 
where the tropicana country club and marina hotel now stand 
kerkorian is in the process of trying to sell mgmua 
communications co to pathe communications corp pathes chief 
giancarlo parretti has agreed to pay 13 billion for mgmua but 
has yet to arrange financing 
kerkorian paid 167 million for both the sands hotelcasino and 
the desert inn when he bought them from summa corp in september 
1987 he sold the sands in april 1988 for 110 million to 
massachusettsbased interface group 
business at some las vegas resorts has been sagging since last 
november when the 3100room mirage resort opened to record gaming 
revenues 
gaming figures are not broken down by the nevada gaming control 
board but other resorts including caesars palace acknowledged in 
recent months that the mirage has hurt their earnings 
the 4000room excalibur billed as the worlds largest resort 
opened in june to big crowds however it is aimed primarily at the 
middle america market and does attract the type of players the 
desert inn does 
other hotels have in the past year either announced or embarked 
on expansions or remodeling projects in an effort to keep their 
share of business although overall gaming revenues for the las 
vegas area are at record highs
