a radio station offered a 1 
million reward for proof elvis presley is still alive on the 11th 
anniversary of his death tuesday but only impersonators and fans 
of the king showed 
how many believe elvis is still alive asked krla radio disc 
jockey charlie tuna as the crowd gathered outside a local diner ed 
debevics which serves up burgers and malts in 50s tradition 
he was greeted by applause and cheers from about 150 of the late 
rock n roll greats fans but the only elvis present was 
impersonator paul boland 27 of san pedro who arrived wearing a 
white pantsuit with red and gold spangles 
a waiter with a pompadour hairdo and shaking maracacas also 
appeared 
tuna said the event was inspired by gail brewer giorgios recent 
book is elvis alive which disputes that the entertainer died 
of heart disease aug 16 1977 
so we decided 1 million might put an end to all the 
speculation he said the reward would be exchanged for seven 
days worth of exclusive interviews for the station he said 
sue wiegger president of the los angeles chapter of a national 
elvis fan club said she doesnt believe presley is still alive 
i just believe that woman is making money at the expense of 
other peoples feelings she said of ms giorgio adding elvis 
fans have had a hard time dealing with the death 
his spirits here and will always be here said fan gail 
herrington of suburban valencia 
in presleys hometown of memphis tenn on tuesday fans lined 
up to pay their respects at the singers grave more than 70 stands 
of flowers many shaped like guitars or hearts lined the walk to

one of the armys two best 
battalions has occupied this mountain town in the heart of 
guerrilla country and its men patrol the heights and valleys as a 
challenge to the rebels 
nearly 700 men of the arce infantry battalion were brought in 
july 26 by helicopter because truck transport from their garrison 
35 miles to the south is considered too risky 
soldiers of the arce and those of the atlacatl battalion are 
considered the armys most seasoned and efficient fighters 
the operation is the biggest of the past year around the town in 
morazan province 125 miles northeast of san salvador 
it is directed by a colonel in line to become armed forces 
commander who combines battlefield offensives with political and 
social action designed to undermine peasant support for the 
guerrillas 
leftist rebels have fought usbacked salvadoran governments 
since late 1979 in a civil war that has killed an estimated 65000 
people most of them civilians 
col rene emilio ponce eastern military zone commander and 
director of the perquin campaign said about 1000 guerrillas 
operate within a 20mile radius of the town he called that the 
densest concentration of rebel fighters in el salvador a nation of 
55 million about the size of massachussetts 
it is an area of forested mountains and jungled hollows 
alternately baked by tropical sun and lashed by rainyseason 
storms venceremos the clandestine rebel radio broadcasts from 
northern morazan 
ponce and lt col reynaldo chavarria the theater commander 
stationed in perquin believe most of the rebels have retreated 
northward to or across the border with an isolated area of 
honduras where they sometimes take refuge 
a 15mile patrol with arce troopers over two days revealed ample 
evidence of rebel presence including mine fields communication 
lines and two brief skirmishes 
ponce and chavarria say the guerrillas have taken surprisingly 
little offensive action against the incursion into the heart of 
liberated territory 
they said that indicates weakness because the arce patrols are 
somewhat exposed and would seem to be attractive targets 
as we kill off their seasoned fighters they are more and more 
dependent on young illtrained recruits kids chavarria said 
he spoke on the stoop of his command post an abandoned house on 
the north side of a town square lined with facades pocked by 
bullets and mortar shells 
directly across the square was a green house where guerrilla 
commander joaquin villalobos the most wanted man in el salvador 
and his top officers held a news conference in march 
lieutenants noncommissioned officers and troopers who man the 
patrols are not convinced of guerrilla weakness the soldiers are 
tough with high morale but their nervousness and caution revealed 
a sense that attack always was imminent 
ive got the jitters lt ali valdez whispered as the men 
pitched camp silently in the dark on torola hill at the end of a 
days march 
this is very hostile country we know it well but los babosos 
a disparaging term for the guerrillas live here and know every 
square meter of it 
the battalion lost two killed and 12 wounded in the first two 
weeks most of them from from mines or snipers no guerrilla deaths 
were confirmed 
a radio venceremos broadcast aug 3 said the arce will have 
to leave eventually because they cant stay in perquin forever 
no one argues with that ponce says his men will stay as long 
as circumstances permit 
government forces have occupied perquin several times during the 
war but never for more than 10 weeks 
chavarria and his officers said they think in terms of a month 
this time which puts limitations on ponces attempt to win the 
areas approximately 800 peasants away from the rebel cause 
people will be reluctant to listen to us and collaborate as 
long as they know that in a month well be gone and the subversives 
will be back chavarria said 
earlier this month ponce took reporters by helicopter to 
perquin for two hours then to a town in neighboring san miguel 
province where he and his men distributed food and medicine they 
listened to requests from residents for a well fertilizer and a 
bridge over a nearby river 
he says the san miguel area has become less of a guerrilla 
bastion because of attention to the peoples needs and wants 
we hurt the subversives much more by taking away their base of 
support than by killing them the colonel said 
ponce said he plans such work in perquin but it is difficult 
because years of war have made the people unresponsive 
the towns cobbled streets were nearly empty of civilians during 
the first week of the battalions presence chavarria said but 
activity later returned to a semblance of normal 
during a reporters visit children played soccer in a clearing 
off the square and about 20 people gathered for the slaughter of a 
young bull waiting to buy some of the meat 
pablo argueta a 45yearold peasant with eight children killed 
and butchered the animal 
were caught in the middle he said we dont want 
problems with either side we just want the war to end so we can 
work in peace

radical students staging 
antigovernment protests have been criticized heckled and even 
attacked in recent days by furious citizens demanding an end to 
violent clashes in their communities 
such public anger toward the radicals who represent about 10 
percent of south koreas students is rarely seen in a nation that 
has been generally tolerant of student activism it has shocked the 
students who see themselves as fighting on behalf of the very 
people criticizing them 
the rising resentment appears to reflect both anger over the 
radicals violent tactics and concern for the olympics which start 
in seoul on sept 17 
south koreans are worried that violent protests at the moment 
when world attention is focused on seoul could ruin the nations 
image most people see the games as a coming of age and they want 
to impress the world with a major success 
hundreds of south koreans took part in counterdemonstrations 
against the students this past week calling for an end to violent 
confrontations newspapers have joined in the criticism 
we now call upon our students to return to their senses the 
korea times said in an editorial saturday violence is not the 
way to solve any problem the joongang ilbo said 
the radicals battled riot police in parts of seoul on monday as 
the government blocked them from marching to the north korean 
border for reunification talks scattered violent clashes involving 
a few thousand radicals also erupted last weekend 
twice during the weekend hundreds of people went to radical 
headquarters at yonsei university to demand that the students 
leave the two groups argued and yelled 
angry onlookers also denounced and heckled student demonstrators 
in other parts of seoul and newspapers reported similar outbursts 
in other cities elderly people screamed at students calling them 
rude and arrogant 
you students are not the only korean patriots one old man 
shouted 
in the most unusual development a few people hurled stones at 
students and some were seen helping riot police fighting the 
radicals 
observers have been impressed by the number of people 
spontaneously criticizing the students 
kim youngwon a political scientist said was amazed to see 
onlookers cheering on riot police in a street battle against 
students he said it was remarkable that riot police should 
suddenly be seen as heroes after years of beng despised for 
enforcing authoritarian rule 
the change he said may prove to be the first indication that 
citizens have become weary of the persistent violent actions of 
misled students 
student leaders admit they have failed to gain public support in 
the latest round of protests although they refuse to give up their 
struggle or change their tactics 
we should have strengthened our solidarity with the people 
we have to admit our failure in doing so said student leader oh 
yungshik 
students played key roles in battling past authoritarian regimes 
and many people took to the streets with them in june 1987 to force 
president chun doohawn to agree to democratic reforms 
many south koreans say the current violent demonstrations are a 
threat to stability and the nations efforts to build enduring 
democracy they also oppose the students advances to communist 
north korea 
president roh taewoo and other government leaders have warned 
repeatedly that disorder wont be tolerated during the olympics 
the people and the government will not forgive anyone who 
spoils the olympic festival through mob action or the throwing of 
firebombs roh said in a speech monday 
the radicals have not decided if they will try to disrupt the 
games or stage protests they back north koreas demand to be a 
cohost at the olympics which the international olympic committee 
has rejected 
but the students would find it difficult to disrupt the games 
the government is deploying a massive security shield to forestall 
any threats

vigorous exercise such as running bicycling or 
even hiking uphill in intense heat can lead to heat stroke and 
possibly a heart attack with few warning signs researchers say 
the danger becomes even greater when the air contains high 
levels of carbon monoxide and ozone both of which put additional 
stress on the heart and lungs one of the researchers said in an 
interview tuesday 
the researchers were interviewed following the recent disclosure 
that two men had died after competing in races in new yorks 
central park during this summers intense heat wave 
the two men reportedly were not runners and were not accustomed 
to exercising in the heat which meant that they faced a special 
risk of injury or death 
i dont think its generally recognized that even in these 
short races when youre exercising very intensely and youre not 
trained or acclimated you can very quickly produce and store 
enough heat to kill you said edward coyle director of the human 
performance laboratory at the university of texas in austin 
they were untrained unacclimated and they were running very 
intensely for their level of ability he said 
in new york and many other parts of the country the intense 
heat has often been accompanied by unusually high pollution and 
ozone levels 
carbon monoxide can trigger a heart attack in exercisers who 
unknowinly have latent coronary artery disease said peter raven 
an exercise physiologist at the texas college of osteopathic 
medicine in ft worth 
ozone irritates the lungs causing the tiny airways in the lungs 
to shrink and decreasing the amount of breath taken in with each 
inhalation raven said 
weve had elite cyclists complain at very low levels of ozone 
that they couldnt perform anywhere near where theyre used to 
he said 
exercisers should be concerned whenever the ozone level is 
reported to be higher than onetenth of one part per million raven 
said 
according to the american college of sports medicine the amount 
of heat produced in muscles that are exercising hard is 15 to 20 
times that produced in muscles at rest 
even short races can raise body temperature from its normal 986 
degrees to 104 degrees which is the point where serious injury can 
occur the college says 
this problem is not limited to runners but can occur with any 
type of exercise that involves expending a lot of energy including 
brisk walking and hiking especially uphill coyle said 
coyle an expert on fluid loss and replacement during exercise 
said that dehydration is one of the prime causes of heat stroke 
unfortunately dehydration is a difficult thing for an exerciser 
to be aware of coyle said its difficult to tell that you are 
in danger because you dont often get sufficient warning time or 
you dont get warnings early enough 
exercisers who are seriously dehydrated will feel chilled and 
stop sweating coyle said their skin turns white and they will 
feel tingly sensations the hair on the back of the neck stands up 
at that point you know youre in trouble stop exercising and 
seek some help to try to cool yourself down usually at that point 
youre not thinking very clearly so its important to try to get 
some help coyle said 
raven noted that many exercisers will develop a headache 
especially around the temples as the first sign of impending heat 
stroke 
people will have it but they tend to ignore it he said 
and thats the danger signal 
researchers had these tips for people who want to exercise on 
warm days 
drink at least a quart of water per hour of exercise avoid 
drinks high in sugar and other carbohydrates because they stay in 
the stomach too long 
take a week to gradually increase your exercise program so 
that you become acclimated to the heat and pollution the body 
adapts to cool itself faster the more acclimated you are however 
the more water you need 
exercise before 8 am or after 7 pm 
watch children carefully because they can become overheated 
more easily than adults

unfortunately for fox it is now little more than a sunday night 
network and a moneylosing network at that in june owner rupert 
murdoch he was committed indefinitely to supporting the network 
despite losses of 80 million last year 
fox has an automatic liability in the ratings wars it now has 
122 affiliates compared to 207 for nbc so its potential viewing 
audience is smaller

while other farmers wring their hands 
in despair and pray for rain gene trimble dresses like a clown and 
plays raindrops keep falling on my head on his trumpet 
it may not make the rain come but it helps trimble and the 
other farmers in his clown band forget their troubles as they make 
music strolling through the illinois state fair 
this is a way as one of the songs says to pack up your 
troubles in an old kit bag and smile smile smile 
well we pack up our troubles in an old horn bag and laugh 
laugh laugh said trimble 63 
he has traded his tractor for a trumpet every year for the past 
26 years during the fair 
during this years 11day fair he left 300 acres of corn that 
wasnt in very good shape on his farm in newman about 35 miles 
south of champaign 
it isnt a happy year he said i would say this is as bad 
as weve had since 1936 
but trimble said he tries not to dwell on the problems caused by 
the drought when hes at the fair instead he puts on his clown 
face and polkadot costume and makes music 
of course theres some clowning around that goes with the music 
making 
as temperatures neared 100 degrees this week trimbles 
fivepiece band roamed the asphalt streets at the fairgrounds 
playing jingle bells and let it snow 
the band doesnt play raindrops keep falling on my head 
every day but maybe it should said saxophonist neil mathews of 
urbana 
if we had maybe it would have done some good said mathews 
holding a saxophone sprouting plastic flowers 
well have a crop he said of the corn and soybeans his 
nephew farms for him 
but mathews said this is the worst year that he remembers 
i came over to the fair needing a vacation and about two days 
here and i feel fine he said im more relaxed than i have 
been since i was here last year 
trimbles son dana is a manager for a company that grows seed 
corn a variety he says is more stressed this year than other corn 
crops 
but the younger trimble paints on a happy face literally each 
day of the fair before he straps on the bands drum he brings a 
stuffed monkey dressed like a clown and holding cymbals along for 
the ride 
these two weeks we spend over here is a time that you can 
just go and forget all about the corn or other headaches that 
you have dana trimble said 
he said he has trouble explaining to people why his family 
spends its vacation each year in a trailer at the hot dusty 
fairgrounds 
we tell them we come over here for 10 days and wish it lasted 
three weeks more he said they cant understand that

town officials say they cant afford 
3000 worth of tests to pinpoint the site of a 211yearold jail 
the first prison authorized by the continental congress 
the town is in a financial dilemma town clerk irene amsden 
said tuesday this is not the time to be asking for money for 
such a project 
during the revolutionary war the jail housed 3000 british and 
german prisoners 
the prison was abandoned in 1783 and eventually turned over to 
private hands in 1828 part of it burned the rest later was torn 
down 
two boston university archaeology students want to make sonar 
tests and aerial surveys to pinpoint the jails foundation the 
state historical commission pledged 3000 toward the tests if the 
central massachusetts town of 1400 people comes up with another 
3000

michael dukakis does not advocate the spread of communism in 
central america or africa but he opposes american aid to the 
contras and to unita the only forces blocking the spread of 
communism 
michael dukakis ideas about defense differ sharply from past 
republican and democratic administrations since world war ii 
unlike any of them he believes that conventional forces can be a 
substitute for nuclear deterrence 
but the most disturbing aspect of dukakis approach to national 
security is what he doesnt understand about defending the united 
states 
the danger of nuclear blackmail is the first security problem an 
american president should face not only because the soviet union 
has a large and growing arsenal of icbms but because half a dozen 
other countries either have or soon will have nuclear arms and the 
capacity to deliver them 
to speak as though we could defend ourselves against these 
weapons with more and better tanks is ludicrous 
michael dukakis simply doesnt take the need for defense 
seriously he even opposed massachusetts participation in a 
national warning system against nuclear attack he said a good 
communication system quote might make national leaders more 
inclined to let a nuclear war begin unquote 
this attitude that weak is strong and vulnerable is safe is 
extremely dangerous franklin roosevelt didnt believe it harry 
truman didnt believe it 
dwight eisenhower didnt believe it john kennedy didnt believe 
it lyndon johnson didnt believe it richard nixon didnt believe 
it gerald ford didnt believe it jimmy carter didnt believe it 
ronald reagan doesnt believe it 
george bush doesnt believe it dan quayle doesnt believe it 
but michael dukakis is more worried about an american 
presidents misuse of power than about an adversarys use of it 
the khomeinis the gadhafis and ortegas and the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons make the world too dangerous for america to rely 
on naive unrealistic uninformed strategies to defend our freedom 
and the soviet union is too powerful to rely on a president with 
no experience in foreign affairs 
we all applause we all hope for liberalization and reform of 
the soviet union i personally take mikhail gorbachevs desire for 
economic reform seriously and also his understanding that internal 
changes are required to achieve it 
but gorbachev and the new generation of soviet leaders are 
sending mixed messages about what they intend for their own 
society and for the world soviet troops are beginning to 
withdrawal from afghanistan but the flow of arms and money to 
nicaragua el salvador mozambique cuba vietnam and to the puppet 
government of afghanistan continues 
soviet leaders have spoken of adopting a purely defensive 
strategy but they continue to produce missiles that are ideal for 
a first strike against us 
inside the soviet union messages are also mixed more soviet 
jews and pentecostals have been permitted to leave but the promise 
of free emigration remains unkept 
which is real the progress or the repression both are real 
and we need a president who can respond to both realities we 
need a president who knows the world we cant settle for less 
mistakes in economic policy can cost us jobs and profits thats 
serious 
but serious mistakes in foreign policy can cost us jobs profits 
and our freedom 
we need a president who knows world leaders and world problems 
who understands that we must participate and cooperate and 
contribute and protect our national interests all at the same 
time 
george bush knows those things he learned them from a lifetime 
of involvement in foreign affairs we know where george bush was 
and what he knows and where he stands 
but in the dukakis campaign there is a large carefully 
cultivated discrepancy between conservative style and liberal 
substance will it fool enough of the people for long enough to 
elect dukakis president 
that democrat who said delegates were told not to talk about 
taxes also said theres one problem with this strategy the 
american people are not stupid 
and thats right thats right the american people will know 
better 
they know there is no cram course for learning about global 
politics and world needs and nuclear strategy and national 
security it takes years of study practice and being there 
and of course that is why on election day the american people 
will elect an experienced international leader who knows how to 
preserve the peace and expand freedom 
thats why they will make george bush the next president of the 
united states 
thank you very much

hotels are booked solid so where are they so far the republicans 
havent bought diddly 
at the openair cafe du monde where a handful of conventioneers 
lingered over their morning coffee street performer mustapha

dan quayles is not a household name but it 
soon will be because george bush decided to make it one 
reaching across the generation gap for a vice presidential 
nominee bush took charge with a stroke that symbolized the change 
in republican command 
tonight the republican national convention formally installs 
bush as its nominee to succeed president reagan 
in choosing his running mate bush bypassed more familiar names 
defeated rivals republicans with power bases of their own 
quayles constituents are back home in indiana he has a national 
constituency of one george bush 
within hours after he arrived in new orleans on tuesday bush 
dramatized the passage of gop power he bid farewell to reagan 
then began telephoning about a dozen republican leaders and 
officeholders to tell them he would not be asking them to join the 
ticket 
i think we were all focusing on kemp dole and domenici and 
the vice president pulled a fast one said rep henry hyde of 
illinois 
quayles name had been on the vice presidential prospect lists 
but not at the top except on the only list that counted 
bush called quayle shortly after 2 pm to say he was the 
choice then at a riverfront welcoming rally reagans vice 
president introduced his own choice for vice president 
quayle 41 is two years into his second term in the senate 
after serving two terms in the house hes trim athletic 
hollywood handsome and a skilled television campaigner his 
congressional record is staunchly conservative and he is a 
specialist in national defense 
dan quayles a man of the future said bush a young man 
born in the middle of this century and from the middle of 
america 
this is the first baby boomer on any national ticket said 
james a baker iii the departing treasury secretary who is about 
to take charge of the bush campaign i think the vice president 
saw this as a bold reach across generations 
bush is 64 reagan 77 sen lloyd bentsen of texas the 
democratic nominee for vice president is 67 
quayle is the first child of the postworld war ii baby boom to 
be nominated for national office that doesnt necessarily mean 
hell pull the votes of his generation the nov 8 election will 
tell but he does give the ticket a youthful cast that should help 
with the baby boomyuppie generation 
gop strength has grown among younger voters and party 
strategists see that trend as the avenue to eventual majority or at 
least parity with the democrats 
a gallup poll conducted aug 57 showed bush leading by 54 
percent to michael dukakis 40 percent among voters under 30 years 
of age while dukakis led 5337 among those over 50 
the quayle candidacy certainly will draw a contrast with 
democrat bentsen 26 years his senior while republicans said a 
headtohead vice presidential debate should be to their advantage 
dukakis argued the other side of the youth issue praising his 
running mate as a mature thoughtful man with real stature 
bentsen said he looked forward to a debate comparing his 
accomplishments with quayles 
but quayle is no rookie not after a dozen years in congress he 
is not the kind of unknown quantity richard nixon chose in 1968 in 
plucking spiro t agnew from the governorship of maryland 
his midwestern base is one of the likely battlegrounds in the 
campaign ahead that territory is crucial to republican prospects 
the farm belt and the industrial midwest are prime targets for the 
democrats bush fared poorly there in the presidential primaries 
and lags in regional public opinion polls now 
so quayles assignment is sure to include heavy campaign duty in 
his home territory 
some republicans think quayle also could help bush narrow the 
gender gap by gaining the votes of women he won landslide senate 
reelection in 1986 over a female democrat showing about equal 
strength among male and female voters 
i cant believe a guy that handsome wouldnt be attractive in 
some respect said sen john mccain of arizona 
well maybe but that appeal doesnt work with the activist 
women who are most critical of the republican candidate a pretty 
face wont help george bush with women said molly yard who 
heads the national organization for women

dan quayle has emerged as one of the senates 
most fervent supporters of president reagans star wars 
antimissile shield and spearheaded reagans fight to defeat a 
democratic proposal to give workers advance notice of plant 
closings 
during eight years in the senate the indiana republican picked 
as george bushs vice presidential nominee has consistently urged 
the speediest possible development of star wars and has used his 
post on the armed services committee to argue that allied defenses 
need to be beefed up in europe to meet the soviet threat 
quayle is also a member of the labor and human resources 
committee where he has spearheaded the reagan administrations 
fight against providing advance notice of plant closings raising 
the minimum wage and other legislation backed by organized labor 
quayles counterpart on the democratic presidential ticket sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas was an active proponent of the plant 
closing law which requires 60day notices by any employer with at 
least 100 fulltime workers if a plant closing will result in loss 
of jobs for 50 or more employees 
bentsen lost no time in offering to renew that debate at a 
rally in fort worth texas hours after bush chose quayle bentsen 
said im really looking forward to that one dan quayle and 
the administration lost that debate and the american working man 
and woman won it 
on july 9 quayle argued that the mandatory notices required by 
the bill were nothing more than an attempt by unions to allow the 
government to assert itself in the collective bargaining process 
but quayle is best known in the senate as an expert on defense 
issues a reputation earned through hours spent learning the 
shadings of such national security topics as soviet military 
doctrine weapons performance and the impact of international law 
on arms control treaties 
quayle is the ranking republican on the conventional force and 
allied defense subcommittee which chiefly deals with the 16member 
north atlantic treaty organization 
quayles conservative views were most visible during two major 
national security battles in the senate this year over the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces inf pact and the pentagon 
budget 
even though the inf treaty which requires the elimination of 
both us and soviet mediumrange missiles from europe was 
negotiated by a conservative republican administration quayle was 
originally skeptical 
during weeks of hearings on the pacts effect on natos 
security quayle was one of the few senators who sat through 
virtually all of the hearings 
quayle questioned if the pact might inhibit deployment of the 
strategic defense initiative as star wars is formally known and 
demanded that the question be answered before the senate 
ratification vote ultimately he joined the 935 majority which 
ratified the treaty 
last month when the democraticcontrolled congress was deciding 
whether to approve a pentagon budget quayle said reagan should 
veto the bill because it cut too deeply into the star wars budget 
it was advice reagan followed even though more moderate 
republicans such as sen john warner rva said reagan should 
sign the bill because it was the best deal the administration was 
likely to get 
reagan wanted 48 billion next year for star wars but the 
compromise measure which emerged from congress provided 40 
billion 
as the senate was preparing july 14 for final passage of the 
bill quayle moved to have it returned to a housesenate conference 
committee to increase the star wars budget and strip out 
democraticwritten arms control restrictions 
this is a political struggle between the administration and 
the congress over who is going to run arms control policy no 
question about it quayle explained 
quayles move lost 5835 and he was one of the first 
legislators to praise reagan when the president vetoed the bill 
aug 3 quayle termed the veto a good sound decision 
on the labor committee quayle and sen orrin hatch rutah 
have been the strongest administration supporters 
but even when hatch the white house and major business groups 
dropped their opposition to some measures such as a ban on the 
use of lie detectors to screen job applicants quayle remained a 
vehement foe 
last march when the senate passed the polygraph ban that was 
later signed into law by reagan quayle complained the white house 
had caved like a house of cards he said the administration 
does not have the backbone at this time to veto this billthey 
have folded up shop 
quayle was also involved the bitter 1986 senate fight over 
daniel manion a conservative indiana lawyer whose judicial 
nomination became a battleground over reagans judicial 
philosophies 
manion had been appointed by reagan to a federal appeals court 
post in chicago opponents said manion was unqualified but 
republicans said he was being criticized only because of his 
conservative ideology 
manion a son of the founder of the john birch society had 
received a qualified rating from the american bar association 
the lowest passing grade given by the abas judicial screening 
panel 
manion was eventually confirmed 5049 on a tiebreaking vote 
cast by bush in his vicepresidential role as presiding officer of 
the senate

the search for a tiny eightlegged 
creature called the water bear has researcher diane nelson 
traveling the world 
the biological sciences professor at east tennessee state 
university has strapped on snow skis and hopped aboard airplanes to 
chile antarctica bermuda and venezuela where she found samples 
of her unique prey 
along the way her habit of drawing close to trees to find the 
minute water animals has drawn stares 
people look at you funny when you go up to trees and start 
hugging them she said they think youre kind of off your 
rocker a mad scientist and when someone comes up to you and says 
what are doing and you say im collecting water bears they 
think youre weird 
the creatures known scientifically as tardigrades exist in 
highmoisture areas but when the water dries up they merely curl 
up and go into a form of hibernation 
when the water evaporates they begin pulling in all their 
little legs and they stay that way until it rains again she 
said while they are in that stage you can expose them to 
radiation very high temperatures very low temperatures and you 
cant kill them they dont age all of their chemical reactions 
stop 
water bears seen more clearly under a microscope than with the 
naked eye look like nothing more than a dirt spot during dry 
spells ms nelson said 
ms nelson grew interested in water bears while working on her 
doctorate at the university of tennessee where she saw her first 
tardigrade under a microscope 
i finally saw this little water bear and it just turned around 
and looked up at me ms nelson said it was love at first

the national science foundation says it is 
working to clean up its act in antarctica where an environmental 
group says the federal agencys research bases are polluting the 
frigid environment 
were making progress says jack talmadge head of nsfs 
polar coordination and information section nobody here wants to 
rape antarctica we want to preserve it 
talmadge made the comments tuesday after the environmental 
defense fund released a report alleging that the agencys bases in 
antarctica are violating us environmental laws and an 
international agreement governing use of the frozen continent 
the environmental practices of the nsf would not be 
permitted anywhere in the united states said the edf which 
frequently brings lawsuits against polluters in this country 
the group said the science agency is dumping untreated sewage 
and other wastes in antarctic waters engaging in open burning of 
some wastes and operating diesel power generators without emissions 
controls 
the report said mcmurdo sound adjacent to the largest us 
installation is more polluted than virtually any us waterway and 
that highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals are 
being found in the tissues of penguins and seals 
it is incredible that these practices are observed by the us 
government in the most pristine environment in the world said 
bruce manheim the reports author and an edf attorney and 
scientist rather than addressing environmental threats in 
antarctica nsf has ignored them 
talmadge said that many of the reports findings are true but 
he said the agency is taking steps to improve environmental 
practices at its four bases 
nsf which gets 125 million a year for its antarctic 
activities is in the process of adopting an environmental 
protection plan and may ask congress for cleanup money according 
to talmadge 
we have been doing pollution control maybe not as 
aggressively as theyd like he said referring to the edf we 
have been undertaking extensive efforts to clean up since 1980 
talmadge said this year nsf shipped 160 tons of scrap metal and 
more than 500 drums of waste oil out of antarctica he said those 
materials are no longer dumped in the antarctic waters 
he said the agency is reviewing a recommendation by an internal 
safety panel that it stop using hazardous materials to ignite 
wastes in openair burning pits he said raw sewage is dumped into 
antarctic waters because officials believe it is less harmful than 
the chemicals that could be used to treat it 
the edf report said the united states is not the only polluter 
among the 18 nations with bases in antarctica it noted however 
that australia and japan remove all wastes from the continent and 
that poland and new zealand treat sewage and control incinerator 
emissions 
the report said that if the united states did a better 
environmental job in antarctica it would be in a much stronger 
position to press for more comprehensive pollution control by less 
responsible nations 
edf said the nsf operations which include 1000 people at 
mcmurdo during the antarctic summer months violate us laws 
regulating ocean dumping and land disposal of waste materials 
the landfill at mcmurdo does not comply with the international 
code of conduct on waste disposal adopted in 1975 according to the 
report which said nsf officials told a senate panel last year that 
it was in full compliance with the code 
we comply with most of the code except that provision 
talmadge said as far as we know we are in compliance with 
us laws he said 
the report said nsf despite a 1978 directive from congress has 
failed to assess the environmental impacts of its activities 
including dynamite blasting and construction near antarctic 
wildlife colonies 
in 1980 nsf promised to issue pollution control 
regulations and to mitigate environmental impacts but neither of 
these actions has ever been taken the report said

george bush played simultaneously to his 
weakness with midwesterners and women and his strength with younger 
voters by naming sen dan quayle of indiana as his running mate 
pollsters say 
quayle was not the popular choice most voters and even most 
republican national convention delegates are unfamiliar with him 
nobody ever heard of him outside of indiana said jeff 
alderman chief of polling for abc news 
indeed in a national abc poll of 456 registered voters sunday 
not one mentioned quayle for vice president and in an associated 
press survey of 1274 convention delegates not one favored quayle 
to run with bush 
that is not to say quayle wont fly running mates frequently 
enter the spotlight from obscurity sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
also was little known in opinion polls before his selection to join 
democrat michael dukakis 
instead political polling experts said tuesday bush appeared 
to address several strategic considerations in choosing quayle 
recent polls say bushs weakest region is the midwest voters 
there are not strongly committed to either ticket meaning a native 
son might boost the republicans 
bush is strongest among younger voters but they are the least 
reliable at turning out at the polls if the 41yearold quayle 
energizes young republicans and independents it would shore up a 
bush base also a running mate 23 years his junior could help bush 
appear as a strong leader 
bush suffers from a welldocumented gender gap lagging far 
behind dukakis in support among women voters quayle however ran 
against a woman democrat jill long in his 1986 reelection race 
and beat her in a landslide an abc exit poll found he had equal 
support from women and men in that election 
the hope is that he can help on the gender gap said 
claibourne darden an atlantabased pollster for candidates of both 
parties 
darden also suggested that bush selected a young running mate in 
hopes of asserting his own leadership an area in which he has been 
weak in the polls after eight years of subordinating himself to 
president reagan 
bush needs to be the boss said darden and establishing 
that image could have proven more difficult had he picked a figure 
as wellestablished as himself such as sen bob dole of kansas 
pollsters said bush seemed to eschew the conventional wisdom 
about vice presidential nominees that they are most helpful in 
their home states bush was considered likely to win indiana even 
without quayle for dukakis by contrast bentsen chiefly boosts 
the democrats in a close texas race 
the track record on vice presidential candidates is mixed on 
being able to deliver their states alderman said on their 
ability to draw regionally theres no track record 
still alderman said bushs choice was a signal that hes 
thinking like dukakis hes going to run a national campaign and he 
hopes to get something out of the midwest 
in a gallup poll released last week bush trailed by 19 points 
in the midwest compared to 10 in the west and nine in the east and 
a lead of seven in the south but there was a sign of opportunity 
only 27 percent of midwest voters supported either candidate 
strongly the lowest level in any region said gallup pollster 
larry hugick 
on age the gallup poll found bush leading dukakis by 14 points 
among voters younger than 30 while he trailed by nine among those 
3049 and by 16 among those 50 and up 
the republicans have been able to do better with young 
people said alderman but thats the group that doesnt 
vote quayle could help 
quayle also is a strong conservative but that is one area in 
which bush did not need much assistance he already led by 6029 
among conservatives in an nbc newswall street journal poll last 
week darden in fact saw a troublesome sign for the gop ticket in 
bushs selection of a conservative 
bush is perceived by the great great majority of the public 
as conservative to conservativemoderate darden said he 
already had the conservative vote in his pocket 
as dukakis moved to the center with the moreconservative 
bentsen darden said he expected bush to move to center with a 
moderate what bothers me is theres no reasonable ideological 
balance on the republican ticket he said balance wins

rising temperatures across america are 
overwhelming vulnerable people and could kill thousands according 
to an authority on health and the environment 
this will probably emerge as one of the largest natural 
disasters of this century and it will have just whispered its 
way by said w moulton avery executive director of the center 
for environmental physiology in washington 
by ones and twos the poor and elderly are succumbing to the 
heat which overtaxes their bodies he said but most of these 
tragedies will pass with little notice being recorded in 
government statistics as heart attacks or strokes rather than 
heatrelated fatalities 
in the end avery warned tuesday this summers stifling 
temperatures threaten to exact a higher death toll than the 1980 
heat wave that killed an estimated 15000 americans 
if i had in my hand right now the number of people that have 
died this summer from heat it would be frontpage news all over 
the country but i dont have that number said avery whose 
nonprofit center researches the effects of heat and cold on humans 
for government agencies and other clients 
he has argued for a reporting system to record heat deaths but 
statisticians must depend on comparing deaths during heat wave 
years with normal years and calculating the excess fatalities 
that was the system used to determine the 15000 extra deaths in 
1980 
what were living through now is the same thing we were living 
through in 1980 and is worse than many other hot summers he 
said 
normal death rates nearly doubled from oklahoma east during a 
1966 heat wave with deaths jumping to five times normal in st 
louis according to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the senate special committee on aging later reported that heat 
waves in 1963 and 1966 claimed a total of 11000 lives 
and a university of california at berkeley study found that hot 
spells in los angeles in 1939 1955 and 1963 each produced more 
excess deaths than any recorded natural disaster in that state 
including the san francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 
those most vulnerable to heat stress are the elderly who 
already may suffer various ailments avery said in 1980 the 
elderly accounted for 70 percent of the excess deaths in the hot 
weather he said 
after a few days of a heat wave the elderly begin to arrive at 
hospitals with heatrelated problems said dr keith sivertson 
director of emergency medicine at johns hopkins school of medicine 
in baltimore 
older people he said are more vulnerable for a variety of 
reasons mostly because their physiologic reserve is gone with age 
their heart function tends to be just enough their mental function 
tends to be just enough all of their organs are functioning just 
enough for some folks its not quite enough on some days and 
they end up in the hospital 
in addition he noted the elderly use more prescription 
medications and many of those drugs can increase sensitivity to 
heat 
heatcaused deaths do not arouse the concern they should because 
of the lack of a reporting system avery said 
as a result only classic cases of heat stroke get reported 
officially as heat deaths to the centers for disease control and 
those amount to perhaps 200 in a normal summer and 1500 to 1600 
in a hot summer such as 1980 he said

meat and poultry production is expected to 
decline in 1989 from this years record level but the agriculture 
department says output still will be 2 percent more than in 1987 
the decline next year will occur partly because fewer hogs and 
fewer nonfed cattle those that are not sent to feedlots 
before slaughtering will be going to market next year usda says 
it says that will mean further increases in consumer meat prices 
while per capita meat consumption is likely to decline from 
the 1988 record it will remain above the large levels of 
198587 the departments economic research service said tuesday 
in a new outlook report 
the 1988 supply of red meat and poultry is at a record level 
rising to more than 60 billion pounds a 3 percent increase from 
last year the report said 
but production next year is expected to drop 1 percent to less 
than 592 billion pounds all of the decline will come at the 
expense of red meat while poultry output is forecast to gain 4 
percent 
beef production forecast at 216 billion pounds in 1989 is 
expected to drop 6 percent while pork at 155 billion pounds may 
decline only 1 percent lamb and mutton production is expected to 
rise 2 percent to 335 million pounds while no change is forecast 
for veal production estimated at 400 million pounds 
retail prices for choicegrade beef may go up 1 percent to 3 
percent in 1989 following this years estimated rise of 3 percent 
to 4 percent the report said pork prices are expected to go up 3 
percent to 4 percent in 1989 after declining 3 percent this year 
wholesale broiler prices are forecast to average in a range of 
51 to 57 cents per pound compared with 53 to 56 cents this year 
turkey prices at 68 to 74 cents are expected to increase from 
this years wholesale average of 61 to 64 cents 
the report said the us cattle and calf inventory on july 1 was 
down 1 percent from a year ago this years calf crop estimated at 
402 million head is up only slightly from 1987 but is still the 
secondlowest since 1961 
during the first half of this year 10 percent more heifers 
calved and entered the cow herd than in the same period of 1987 
suggesting that the cattle inventory may begin to stabilize in 
198990 the report said 
beef cow slaughter during januaryjuly was 9 percent below a 
year ago while dairy cow slaughter was down 3 percent the 
report added however droughtreduced forage supplies and higher 
feed costs may delay expansion 
beef output may drop 1 percent this year as expanded production 
by feedlots partially offsets reduced production of nonfed beef 
in 1989 beef output is expected to drop 6 percent as nonfed 
slaughter remains low and reduced feeder cattle supplies result in 
lower fed cattle slaughter the report said 
prices paid for choicegrade steers on the omaha neb market 
were at record highs this spring and may average 69 per 100 pounds 
of liveweight for the year compared with 6460 in 1987 
reduced supplies in 1989 may boost prices 4 to 6 per 
hundredweight above 1988 the report added 
higher feed costs and lower hog prices are forcing pork 
producers to cut back from this year even so analysts said 1989 
output still may be up 8 percent from 1987 
hog prices at the major markets may average about 44 per 
hundredweight this year down from nearly 52 in 1987l prices in 
1989 may average in the range of 44 to 50 
despite higher feed costs broiler production remains 
profitable and is expected to rise 4 percent in 1989 about the 
same as this year the report said poor returns since mid1987 
and higher feed costs may slow turkey production increases to 1 
percent in 1989 following gains of 19 percent and 5 percent in 
1987 and 1988 
egg production may decline about 1 percent in 1989 following a 
2 percent cutback this year

federal and state agencies should start now to 
find ways to protect americas coastal wetlands from the rising sea 
level predicted for the next century the environmental protection 
agency says 
the agency makes the recommendation in a study warning that the 
nation could lose from 30 percent to 80 percent of its coastal 
wetlands by 2100 if emissions of greenhouse gases continue at 
present rates 
epa said in the study released tuesday that wetlands especially 
in louisiana could be flooded by ocean waters because of rising 
global temperatures and melting glaciers and polar ice 
based on current emission trends estimates for sea level rise 
by the year 2025 range from five to 15 inches above current sea 
levels and estimates for 2100 from two to seven feet higher the 
study said 
a five to seven foot rise would result in a 3080 percent loss 
of coastal wetlands epa said 
although the timing and magnitude of future sea level rise is 
uncertain there is an emerging scientific consensus that a 
significant rise is likely the report said 
many scientists say the earth is experiencing the greenhouse 
effect a warming of temperatures caused by heat being trapped by 
an atmospheric accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide nitrogen 
oxides and methane 
wetlands are vital ecosystems and wildlife areas that provide 
flood protection filter pollutants and help recharge groundwater 
supplies onehalf of seafood caught in the united states depends 
on wetlands for some part of its life cycle according to epa 
coastal marshes and swamps are generally within a few feet of 
sea level and hence could be lost if sea level rises 
significantly epa said 
although new wetlands could form where new areas are flooded 
this cannot happen where the land adjacent to todays wetlands is 
developed and protected from the rising sea it said 
todays coastal development could limit the ability of coastal 
wetlands to survive sea level rise in the next century along 
developed coasts there may not be any land available for wetland 
creation 
epa said federal and state agencies responsible for protecting 
wetlands should now begin to determine how to mitigate the loss 
of wetlands from sea level rise 
the report said the wetlands of louisiana which represent about 
40 percent of the nations total appear to be the most vulnerable 
to a rise in sea level

the management of a steel plant ordered 
workers to take down an american flag because company officials 
said it had been hung primarily to embarrass visiting japanese 
businessmen 
however michael hewlett president of united steelworkers of 
america local 1865 said the flag was displayed at armco incs 
ashland works to show the japanese we are proud to be american 
steelworkers 
i hate to see a company that forgets what they are or did 
they he asked monday 
hewlett said hourly workers hung the 15squarefoot flag sunday 
night from a beam in a cast house at one of the plants furnaces 
it was removed monday before the visiting officials of kawasaki 
steel corp saw it he said 
armco spokesman bill scaggs said the order to remove the flag 
was made after consulting with top managers at plant which employs 
about 3500 people 
the flag was put up principally to embarrass our visitors from 
kawasaki he said it was much the same as not offending a 
guest in our homes it was unfortunate that the american flag had 
to be hoisted under those circumstances patriotism is very much 
alive at armco 
scaggs said the kawasaki officials were at the mill to discuss 
trade agreements 
hewlett was particularly incensed by a company offer to let 
steelworkers keep the flag up if they displayed a japanese flag 
alongside 
these men didnt do that because of their proud heritage 
hewlett said i didnt see armco flying the japanese flag from 
their flagpole 
scaggs said the japanese traditionally display both countries 
flags during business meetings with americans 
if our people wanted to follow that custom it would have been 
acceptable to display both flags scaggs said we also offered 
to let the men display the flag permanently after our guests left 
the union turned down the offer and gave no explanation for its 
decision scaggs said 
the issue of japanese imports displacing american jobs has long 
been a sore spot with steelworkers in 1982 union members here 
took sledgehammers and pounded a japanese car into junk then 
packed the pieces into a coffin and tried to ship it to japan

the first us research vessel in a decade to 
steam through the waters of a restricted soviet economic zone is 
making scientific and diplomatic breakthroughs say officials 
involved 
its going well all the equipment is working and the weather 
is fine said peter lonsdale chief scientist aboard the thomas 
washington owned by the us navy and operated by the scripps 
institution of oceanography of the university of california at san 
diego 
lonsdale in a telephone interview tuesday from the ship said 
the expedition was using a range of measuring and sampling 
techniques to understand a period of volcanic activity on the sea 
floor 100 million years ago 
the research lonsdale said will contribute to scientific 
understanding of the giant plates which form the earths crust 
moving and shifting to form continents island chains and mountain 
ranges 
the ship was charting an undersea plateau at the intersection of 
the north pacific ocean and the bering sea 190 miles from the 
soviet island of medny and 220 miles from the us island of attu 
at the eastern tip of the aleutian chain 
the vessel with soviet scientists mikhail krasny and vyacheslav 
partikeyev aboard began the 33day expedition aug 5 and entered 
the soviet economic zone monday lonsdale said 
while scientific results of the expedition will take weeks or 
months to analyze it already has broken diplomatic ground 
the soviet union like the united states asserts an economic 
zone 200 miles off its coasts but unlike washington moscow 
requires foreign scientists to obtain its permission to conduct 
research in those waters said william erb director of maritime 
sciences at the state department 
lonsdales expedition marks the first time in 10 years that 
the soviets have authorized a us research vessel to operate in 
their economic zone erb said 
the project was made possible by an exchange of diplomatic notes 
in late 1987 reviving for one year the usussr agreement on 
cooperation in studies of the world ocean which was signed in 1973 
but allowed to lapse 
us and soviet officials will meet in washington starting oct 
3 to negotiate three more american expeditions in soviet waters 
under the agreement erb said 
previously he said the soviets had denied us permission and 
were acting in a way that we felt was not in conformance with the 
law of the sea and normal practice we raised the issue in 
bilateral diplomatic conversations but not in an international 
forum 
the plateau under study straddles us soviet and international 
waters 
measuring 250 miles by 60 miles the plateau belongs to a longer 
chain of volcanic islands and submerged mountains that include 
hawaii and a new formation the lohi seamount an active volcano 
rising in the northcentral pacific 
it is a continuous trail of volcanic activity that leads 3500 
miles to hawaii lonsdale said the theories we are testing 
have to do with what might cause this volcanic activity to start 
we know the result islands like hawaii 
some recent studies suggest that islands and seamounts form when 
weak spots in the earths crust pass over hot volcanic spots which 
act as blow torches 
the sophisticated hardware aboard the thomas washington includes 
a high resolution survey system known as sea beam made by the 
general instrument corp of westwood mass 
sea beam sends 16 simultaneous sonar signals toward the ocean 
floor measures the return time and uses a computer to make a 
topographic chart 
the expedition also is collecting rock samples and cores from 
the sea floor for later analysis lonsdale said

until tuesday the republican vice 
presidential nominee was the devil he didnt know 
now lloyd bentsen knows and the democratic vice presidential 
candidate is saying he wont have a devil of a time handling george 
bushs choice of dan quayle a colleague from the us senate 
bentsen in the middle of a nineday campaign swing through 
texas first heard about the selection when he arrived here for a 
rally he quickly hailed the choice in his speech as good news 
i must say im really looking forward to that one said the 
senator from texas who would debate the young indiana senator oct 
11 in omaha neb if quayle accepts bentsen already has said yes 
im looking forward to comparing our lists of accomplishments 
in the us senate and what each of us could do for his running 
mate if we were elected he said 
ive just had a debate with dan quayle and it shows again the 
lack of sensitivity for the concerns and the problems of the 
average working man and woman in this country shown by the 
republican that debate was over plant closing and dan quayle 
and the administration lost that debate and the american working 
man and woman won it bentsen said 
president reagan eventually signed the legislation sponsored by 
bentsen but only grudgingly the bill requires that employers give 
workers 60 days notice before closing the plant where they work 
quayle fought the bill in the senate 
bentsen has been campaigning almost exclusively in texas during 
the republican convention in addition to running for the vice 
presidency he is seeking reelection to the senate and he has been 
seeking coverage in his home state while the republicans dominate 
the national news from new orleans 
his events have been targeted for the local market with an 
announcement on the space program monday in houston and a visit to 
a strategic oil repository in beaumont on tuesday he planned to 
visit san angelo lubbock and tyler today 
when reporters asked bentsen on tuesday why he seemed so pleased 
with the choice he said i think what people are looking for in 
this country is substance and i think i bring that to the ticket 
did that mean he was asked that he did not consider quayle a 
man of substance bentsen chuckled and just said he was ready to 
compare records 
bentsens aides privately seemed delighted with the choice of 
quayle he is a candidate we are comfortable going against 
because of the obvious mismatch in experience said one speaking 
on the condition that his name not be used but he added 
we dont want to underestimate the guy

george bush ruined lunch for a lot of people 
by calling to say they were not going to be his vice presidential 
running mate 
he made the calls soon after his plane landed at belle chasse 
naval air station on tuesday the last in the series was reserved 
for the one man who got a yes sen dan quayle of indiana 
gov carroll campbell of south carolina said his call came about 
noon he quoted the vice president as saying weve made a 
decision on this i wanted to call you and let you know 
other sorry youre not it calls went out to bob dole and 
his wife elizabeth jack kemp pete domenici george deukmejian 
john sununu and the returns may not all be in bush went down the 
list of everyone who had been asked to submit a personal financial 
and biographical information 
his press secretary sheila tate said bush made about a dozen 
calls in all and that quayles was the last 
treasury secretary james a baker iii who is resigning to lead 
the bush campaign told reporters that bush thought it was 
important that there not be any suggestions that the process was 
not dignified or that the process was in any way demeaning to the 
people who might not be selected 
history will record the time of the call to quayle as 206 pm 
convention time for whatever significance may be attached to it 
most of those called were at lunch but quayle was in his hotel 
room 
ms tate said quayle was the vice presidents first choice 
his only choice and that bush told the senator so 
the other calls were of the letthemdowneasy variety 
new mexicos sen domenici was at antoines restaurant when 
baker reached him and put bush on the line 
as domenici remembers it in one long stream 
he indicated to me that he wanted to get a bit of the suspense 
out of the air and told me that i was not his choice that he was 
going to go another way that i was among the last few that he had 
to decide as far as his running mate and appreciated very much what 
i had done the way i had conducted myself and thanked me for all 
my effort and asked if i would be helpful in his campaign and i 
said yes of course 
kansas sen dole and his wife the former transportation 
secretary were not in their hotel when the bush call came at 145 
pm elizabeth dole returned a few minutes later reached bush 
through the white house switchboard and they spoke briefly 
he called to say the doles would not be on the ticket said 
walt riker the senators press secretary he said it was one of 
the toughest decisions he ever had to make 
mrs doles reaction i have said before that i didnt expect 
to be selected neither i nor bob was running for vice president 
the senator meanwhile was making a luncheon speech i dont 
have the foggiest notion who george bush will pick as a running 
mate he said the last call i got was a wakeup call at 730 
am it was the wrong room 
kemp the congressman from new york who was an oddson favorite 
for the running mate spot and made no secret that he wanted it 
also took the call at antoines 
there were no tears he said but 
nobody jumped up and down i said mr vice president i 
want you to know that my support for you is unconditional 
deukmejian the governor of california was eating at a cajun 
restaurant 
it was a courtesy call the governor said and he didnt ask 
bush whom he had chosen because i thought it would be 
presumptuous of me 
new hampshires gov sununu another to receive one of the 
dear john calls said yeah youre always a little 
disappointed 
but he said george bush taking the time to make those calls 
himself was typical george bush it was done in such a way that 
after the conversation you felt good

substance is the buzzword of republican 
convention planners but theyre paying at least as much attention 
to telegenic details as the democrats did in their openly 
madefortv convention 
from a colorcoordinated backdrop to a world record balloon 
drop the republicans are living up to their reputation as masters 
of sentiment celebration and the welloiled machine 
the superdome has been scaled down to a manageable size and 
sessions are finishing within minutes of the official schedule the 
demonstrations are running long enough to satisfy the delegates 
short enough to hold the living room audience 
and no ones outfit has clashed with the curtain behind the 
speakers rostrum at least not yet 
washed with a spectrum of lights the curtain changes from blue 
to red to pink to purple depending on the attire of the speaker 
we have a lighting designer who is alerted to the color of the 
clothing before the person enters and he makes a selection based 
on that said bob johnson assistant producer of the convention 
an elevator platform at the rostrum makes all speakers look the 
same height both for teleprompter readability and camera 
convenience 
we try to provide the cleanest headon shot for the 
networks johnson said our record is 6foot7 
music is another personalized element of the convention if 
someone is from a particular state we will select music 
representative of that particular state to give it a personal 
touch johnson said we even take requests someone from 
tennessee yesterday morning requested the tennessee waltz and we 
played it 
personal touches are being combined this week with spectacular 
special effects such as the combined balloonconfetti drop after 
president reagans speech monday night 
but that was just the beginning a paltry 20000 balloons 
stuffed sausagelike into nylon netting and dropped from what 
seemed like the heavens in the cavernous louisiana superdome 
fifty thousand balloons will drop wednesday night when the texas 
delegation led by george bushs eldest son george w bush gives 
the vice president the majority needed to capture the nomination 
and after bushs speech thursday night there will be 150000 
balloons a world record for an indoor balloon drop according to 
johnson 
frame that and salute it every morning he said gleefully 
the previous record was 100000 he said 
the republicans inevitably to best their democratic 
counterparts in balloons already have topped them in discretion 
not for them a party chairman who advises delegates to be a 
wellbehaved studio audience for a fournight miniseries as 
democrat paul kirk did in atlanta nor are the republicans issuing 
continually revised minutebyminute podium schedules that reveal 
the power struggles within their original list of speakers minus 
speaking times is holding steady 
house speaker jim wright dtexas was seen desperately making 
the cut sign forefinger across throat to arkansas gov bill 
clinton during the governors 32minute speech at the democratic 
convention 
we havent had to do that yet and i hope we dont have to 
johnson said with a laugh the republicans have reviewed all 
speeches and some are even running shorter than planned any need 
to move along is taken care of by the presiding officer or a quick 
music cutoff 
there was some skepticism over whether the republicans would be 
able to achieve any sense of warmth or intimacy in the 27story 
superdome but they reduced the size of the convention floor area 
by hanging a 90foot curtain down the middle invited a lot of 
guests spotlit the bustling floor and left in dimness tiers of 
stadium seats that arent always filled 
we think it looks crowded and warm johnson said with 
satisfaction the superdome is a fantastic environment for a 
convention

birds nests made of swallow saliva are 
becoming popular booty for hong kong thiefs as police reported a 
second robbery in as many days of the expensive soup ingredient 
valued by local connoiseurs 
two men posing as customers tied up employees of a central 
district company and snatched 66 pounds of birds nests worth about 
57700 tuesday afternoon before fleeing a police statement said 
no arrests were reported in the case 
the day before burglars broke into another local business and 
made off with nearly 90 pounds of birds nest with an estimated 
value of 77000 
police spokesman peter tiu acknowledged that backtoback birds 
nest heists are unusual in this british colony he said police did 
not yet know if the cases were related 
birds nest soup is considered a healthy food that helps build

state sen john vinich defeated two 
opponents tuesday night in a hotly contested democratic primary for 
the nomination to oppose republican us sen malcolm wallop in 
november 
wallop coasted to his third senate nomination amassing 39130 
votes or 83 percent with 351 of wyomings 474 precincts reporting 
with the same 74 percent of the precincts reporting vinich had 
15821 votes or 47 percent to university of wyoming law professor 
pete maxfields 9833 or 30 percent state schools superintendent 
lynn simons who entered the race late had 7619 votes or 23 
percent 
it appears that we are down to the oneonone wallop said 
its my hope that the campaign will stay on a high plane because 
wyoming doesnt have time to focus on personalities when the issues 
and leadership are so important 
wallop had four opponents in the primary michael dee russ 
hanrahan nora marie lewis or iw bud kinney but they did 
not conduct highly visible campaigns 
in the race for wyomings only house seat democrat bryan 
sharratt was unopposed while fiveterm incumbent dick cheney 
defeated bob morris as he had two years ago cheney had 32320 
votes or 87 percent to 4728 for morris or 13 percent in 
incomplete unofficial returns 
i look forward to a good hardfought campaign in the fall and 
i hope i have the privilage and opportunity to serve them for two 
more years cheney said from new orleans where he was attending 
the republican convention 
cheney however will get off to a slow start against sharratt 
on friday the fiveterm incumbent will enter a washington dc 
hospital for heart bypass surgery

a federal judge ruled tuesday that wyomings secretary of state 
must count absentee ballots received through aug 22 to protect the 
rights of voters living overseas 
it is certain that there are some absentee ballots that 
have been sent out too late and i think that that is an 
important thing that all peoples proper ballots should be 
counted us district judge clarence brimmer said thats 
almost something thats as basic as our democracy itself 
while the justice department prefers that ballots be mailed 30 
days before an election some of wyomings 23 counties mailed 
ballots only 26 days before the primary 
wallop 55 wyomings senior senator spent little time visibly 
working for the nomination

technicians moved into discoverys 
cargo bay to begin plugging a tiny gas leak that threatens to delay 
the first postchallenger shuttle launch 
with the shuttle poised on the launch pad the technicians today 
were to drill into the cargo bay wall and an engine compartment to 
repair the tiny leak discovered a month ago 
the leak in a steering engine compartment must be stopped before 
discovery can be launched in late september or early october 
the plan was to use a routing tool to cut two holes in the rear 
bulkhead of the 60footlong cargo bay and two more in the 
adjoining aluminum hull of the steering engine compartment 
the dual openings would allow a technician to reach about 12 
inches into the compartment to clamp a clamshellshaped device over 
the leak and fill it under pressure with a sealant the device 
measures 4 inches by 1 inch and should fit easily over a fitting 
that is slowly leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas from a vent line 
because discovery is poised vertically on the launch pad the 
technicians would have to do much of the work on their hands and 
knees or lying on their stomachs on the cargo bays rear bulkhead 
on tuesday workers opened the bays doors and erected a 
tentlike structure over the work area to prevent debris from 
getting into the rest of the shuttle or into a nearby enclosure 
where discoverys payload is waiting to be loaded the payload a 
communications satellite would be placed aboard once the repairs 
are complete 
the line with the leak services a steering engine system that is 
separate from the three main engines testfired on the launch pad 
last week 
the repair and subsequent testing are expected to take about a 
week said lisa malone a national aeronautics and space 
administration spokeswoman 
although the leak was detected a month ago nasa decided to put 
off repairing it until after the main engine test 
the launch team is continuing to troubleshoot the only fault 
resulting from the test firing a small amount of hydrogen gas 
detected after the test by a sensor in an area where lines join the 
shuttle with its external fuel tank for the firing the tank was 
loaded with liquid hydrogen and oxygen to fuel the main engines 
malone said the source of the hydrogen remains a mystery and 
pressure tests on monday failed to detect any leak she said 
officials did not consider it a serious problem 
once the source of the hydrogen is found engineers will 
determine whether it is an acceptable condition or what course of 
action is necessary to proceed malone said 
elsewhere at the morton thiokol plant in utah engineers 
prepared for thursdays fifth and final prelaunch testfiring of a 
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket insulation seals and orings 
have been deliberately flawed in segment joints to see how well 
backup systems contain the blazing exhaust gas 
a faulty booster rocket joint was blamed for the jan 28 1986 
explosion of challenger that killed its sevenmember crew 
the utah test is the last major hurdle before nasa sets a firm 
launch date for discovery

the campaign of democrat michael dukakis seized 
upon the selection of sen dan quayle as the republican vice 
presidential candidate to characterize the gop ticket as elitist 
with aides referring to quayle by his full name j danforth 
quayle 
dukakis aides already were fond of referring to george bush by 
his full name george herbert walker bush and they quickly 
adopted the same tack in talking about quayle heir to an indiana 
publishing fortune 
i think theyd make better tennis partners than a presidential 
ticket said mark gearan a spokesman for the democratic nominee 
or should that be squash partners 
dukakis himself did not attack quayle directly but was quick to 
point out the experience of his own running mate sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas and to imply that the 41yearold quayle would 
not be ready to be president should a tragedy befall bush 
sen bensten is a mature thoughtful man with real stature 
somebody whos a real leader in the united states senate dukakis 
said sen bentsen has been seasoned experienced on issues of 
foreign policy defense space thats the kind of stature thats 
the kind of strength the kind of maturity i think you want in a 
vice president especially when that vice president may be 
president 
bentsen at a rally in fort worth texas called the selection 
of quayle good news 
i must say im really looking forward to that one he told 
about 400 people gathered in a downtown square at a rally sponsored 
by house speaker jim wright dtexas 
im looking forward to comparing our lists of accomplishments 
in the us senate and what each of us could do for his running 
mate if we were elected he said 
a vice presidential debate is tentatively scheduled for oct 11 
in omaha neb and bentsen said he was ready 
ive just had a debate with dan quayle and it shows again the 
lack of sensitivity for the concerns and the problems of the 
average working man and woman in this country shown by the 
republicans bentsen said that debate was over plant closing 
and dan quayle and the administration lost that debate and the 
american working man and woman won it 
president reagan eventually allowed the legislation which gives 
workers 60 days notice of plant closings to become law without 
his signature but he fought it for a long time and quayle was one 
of the presidents allies in the senate 
dukakis and several top aides expressed mild surprise at the 
selection of quayle and predicted he would not help the gop ticket 
except in his traditionally republican home state of indiana bush 
aides countered by saying quayle would help with younger and women 
voters 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said quayles 
qualifications pale in comparison to those of bentsen 
lloyd bentsen clearly passes the first test of the vice 
presidency he is eminently qualified to step in as president in 
the event of a tragedy estrich said 
gearan said he was not very familiar with quayles record but 
then quickly listed a series of issues which he said highlighted 
the different directions of the democratic and republican tickets 
he cited quayles support of a freeze on social security 
benefits and his opposition to advance notice of plant closings 
drought assistance and civil rights legislation 
he does not understand the economic problems facing the 
american family gearan said of quayle bentsen supported all of 
the measures gearan cited in attacking quayle 
dukakis aides for weeks have been terming bushs selection of a 
running mate as his opportunity to step out of reagans shadow and 
demonstrate his independence after the quayle choice was 
announced they swiftly criticized bush 
this was his chance to show some independence strength and 
leadership gearan said instead he placated the extreme right 
wing of his party

although iran and iraq have agreed to a 
ceasefire the pentagon says four us warships have departed as 
scheduled for routine rotations in the persian gulf 
defense officials who requested anonymity said tuesday the 
deployments and that of a fifth ship last week was simply an 
indication that the united states would not reduce its military 
presence in the region until officials were certain the ceasefire 
was fully in effect 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has said repeatedly we can 
begin to reduce the number of ships in the gulf after a prudent 
amount of time has passed to make certain the threat has 
diminished one source said 
our guideline throughout will be as stated by the secretary 
that we will maintain forces there consistent with the perceived 
threat said dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman 
the ceasefire is scheduled for aug 20 were not ready to 
start really drawing down yet said one source

the state department says that for the past 10 
days the united states has sent about six tons of food clothing 
and tents to assist a large group of contra rebels and nicaraguan 
civilians who have fled to southern honduras 
according to reports from the border area more than 1000 
soldiers and civilians arrived there last week from a central 
nicaraguan combat zone another group estimated at about 2500 is 
said to be en route to the area 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said tuesday the nicaraguan exodus 
was the result of increased repression by the sandinista government 
and because contra units have been left without any means of 
resupply inside nicaragua 
the blocking of delivery of humanitarian aid by the sandinista 
regime has resulted in severe hunger disease and injury to some 
resistance fighters she said 
the assistance part of 17 million in humanitarian aid approved 
for the rebels by congress last march is intended to help sustain 
the contras through september

supporters of vice president george bush 
almost came to blows with about a dozen gay rights activists who 
disrupted a speech by bush upon his riverfront arrival for the 
republican national convention 
so hostile was the exchange tuesday that police intervened and 
escorted the demonstrators away one demonstrator later was 
arrested and booked for disturbing the peace 
as soon as bush began speaking at the rally alongside the 
mississippi river the mostly young male protesters locked arms 
and stood in a circle about 30 yards from the podium 
the demonstrators carried pink and green signs accusing the 
reagan administration of failing to fight acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome and chanted 40000 are dead of aids where 
was george 
bush supporters shouted back bush 88 and surrounded the 
protesters some bush backers shouted obscenities and one reached 
to tear down a protesters sign another man in the crowd pulled 
him away saying dont do it it looks bad 
police then hustled the demonstrators away bush did not stop 
speaking or acknowledge the protest 
earlier tuesday about 20 people staged a protest at a new 
orleans pharmaceutical company imreg which makes one of the few 
drugs said to be effective against aids 
the point was to complain about government red tape which has 
tied up approval of the drug for general use that protest was 
peaceful and concluded without incident

crumbling ceilings falling sinks broken 
toilets no cold water the pallas suite hotel home of the new 
york delegation to the republican national convention is no 
palace according to guests 
when we walked into our room half of the ceiling was 
convenient where you could get at it on the floor next to the 
bed rep david martin rny said tuesday makes it real 
easy to paint 
the hotel cheerfully moved martin and his wife to another room 
where the water wouldnt run out of the sink or tub but ran out of 
the toilet and onto the bathroom floor 
but weve still got a sense of humor he said 
chris cowman a field producer with cable news network who was 
covering the convention said he had to change rooms also 
i put one hand on the sink and stepped out of the shower and 
the sink fell away from the wall he said 
henry bayles a spokesman for delta towers ltd the 
atlantabased company that owns the hotel admitted the pallas 
suite was not troublefree 
were not the finest hotel in new orleans if we were the 
finest wed have the california or texas delegations he 
said 
the 1039room hotel had some problems when delegates began 
checking in on sunday bayles said but he claimed the number of 
complaints received since then has been relatively low 
it ran today between 49 and 52 and if you say god that 
sounds terrible call some of the other hotels youll find thats 
extremely good he said 
the building was erected in 1950 and underwent a 56 million 
renovation in 1982 said joanne caldwell the general manager she 
said she didnt mind the complaints because im getting a lot of

a judge rejected a bid to remove the 
executor of liberaces multimillion dollar estate overruling 
claims by his sister and four associates that the lawyer had looted 
the estate after orchestrating a deathbed will 
tuesdays ruling ended one chapter in a long court battle over 
the entertainers fortune state district judge michael wendell 
still must rule on who will pay the legal fees 
attorneys for the executor joel strote of beverly hills 
calif have asked that the fees be paid by the plaintiffs 
including liberaces 74yearold sister angie who was left 
594000 she had described herself as penniless 
the other plaintiffs were liberaces housekeepers dorothy 
mcmahon and gladys luckie longtime manager seymour heller and 
cary james liberaces companion the last six years of his life 
in closing arguments tuesday plaintiff attorney harold gewerter 
said if the lawsuit hadnt been filed strote would have kept on 
the path of raping the liberace estate 
he said strote had coerced liberace into signing a revised will 
13 days before his death leaving strote in charge gewerter argued 
that liberace was not capable of making rational decisions or 
reading the 100 pages of legal documents 
joel strote has become the largest single beneficiary of the 
liberace estate gewerter said he said strote had been paid 
500000 in legal fees and was making 250 an hour sitting through 
the court proceedings he said strote welcomed lawsuits against the 
entertainers estate so he could keep making the legal fees 
strotes actions were tantamount to robbing from a dead man 
he said 
but defense attorney john oreilly said strote had taken the 
liberace foundation with 100000 in assets at the time of the 
entertainers death and turned it into an 18 million entity by 
selling off the estates assets 
he said the liberace foundation for the performing arts had been 
a longtime dream of the flayboyant pianist who died feb 4 1987 
of complications from aids the foundation was formed in 1979 to 
provide art and music scholarships at 30 colleges and universities 
he said the plaintiffs had become accustomed to the good life 
while liberace was alive and wanted more out of the estate after 
his death 
liberace dreamed a dream then made it become a reality 
oreilly said the plaintiffs lived a dream but cant face 
reality its been said man must pay the fiddler liberace chose to 
subsidize a whole symphony orchestra now theyre saying just give 
us control

entertaining participants in a program for international political 
leaders 
forget the brawling bawdy days of rowdy roustabouts on mark

and bars upperdeck dance bands and attendants in crisp uniforms 
the creole queen with its realistic but dieseldriven 
paddlewheel is host to 20 gop river trips during convention week 
said bookkeeper paula hontz most are latenight cruises that show 
off the new orleans skyline 
the attraction is the riverboats themselves and everybody 
wants to see our river its new orleans it really is ms hontz

for 3200 partythrowers may have the run of the creole queen 
at any hour of the day if you buy the entire boat we can be

dan quayles sister believes the indiana 
senator wont let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family 
life he and his wife marilyn enjoy 
i dont think it will be tough on the family said martha 
saddler quayles sister who lives in huntington ind since 
hes been in politics we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic 
schedule and wonder how he does it but he does it and loves it 
the quayle family and friends were celebrating tuesday afternoon 
after george bush announced he wants the 41yearold indiana 
senator to be the republican nominee for vice president 
those who have known the quayles for years said the senator and 
his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in 
public life 
dan and marilyn quayle met as law students in indianapolis 
married while they were still in school and remain close to many of 
their friends from that period 
one of the greatest things about him is the job of being a 
senator has not changed him a bit said indianapolis attorney 
william r neale treasurer of quayles 1986 reelection campaign 
hes the same nice guy he was in law school 
neale who grew up with marilyn tucker quayle in indianapolis 
introduced dan quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at 
the indiana university law school in the early 1970s 
dan quayle who grew up in huntington graduated from depauw 
university a small liberal arts college in greencastle ind 
before going to work in the indiana attorney generals office in 
1970 
daniel f evans also a law school classmate of dan quayle said 
he doesnt expect quayles national candidacy to change him 
i think his strength is hell remember who his friends are 
even after this said evans who was chairman of quayles 1986 
campaign 
friends said the quayles are devoted to their three children and 
prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in washington 
his family looks like the family both parties are trying to 
appeal to said mitch daniels former political chief in the 
white house and now president of the hudson institute its a 
beautiful family i think theyll be a real asset 
the couple who married in 1972 have a 14yearold son tucker 
a 12yearold son benjamin and a 9yearold daughter corinne 
when they campaign in indiana the quayles often tour in two 
groups the boys riding in parades with marilyn quayle and corinne 
and her father visiting county fairs 
the kids are nonchalant normal kids said mrs saddler 
they take it in stride and play 
in an interview with indiana reporters monday the quayles said 
they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the 
familys loss of privacy during a national campaign 
the total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus 
said mrs quayle 39 
quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether 
he should accept the vice presidential spot if bush offered it 
tucker was fascinated by the idea quayle said benjamin was 
ambiguous but he thought secret service agents might be able to 
help him on tests at school mrs quayle said 
corinne didnt like the prospect of having her father spend more 
time away from home quayle said 
she told me daddy i really hope george bush picks bob 
dole said quayle

in a convention keynote which also raised his 
national profile new jersey gov thomas kean hammered on an 
emerging republican theme that democrat michael dukakis is out to 
dupe the voters 
speaking in the louisiana superdome on tuesday night kean said 
the democratic presidential nominee and his party were engaged in 
double talk 
the dukakis democrats will try to talk tough but dont be 
fooled they may talk like dirty harry but they will still act 
like pee wee herman kean said referring to the tough clint 
eastwood movie cop and the childlike television and movie comedian 
they want higher taxes but they wont say so kean said in 
the primetime televised address they want to weaken america 
but they wont admit it and they want to play the politics of 
special interests 
the new jersey governor selected as the keynote speaker because 
of his success in attracting traditional democrats to the 
republican party coupled his attacks on dukakis democrats with 
a vision for a george bush victory in november 
reaction to the speech was mainly polite and enthusiastic from 
some it was exuberant 
that was a great speech said benjamin l hooks executive 
director of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people hooks called keans address one of the best speeches ive 
heard in the 12 conventions ive attended 
it was a grandslam home run said gop senate candidate 
peter dawkins of new jersey kean is chairing dawkins campaign 
im an old athlete and i know when somebodys in stride tom 
kean was in stride said dawkins a winner of college footballs 
heisman trophy 
kean himself said he was pleased by the speech but relieved it 
was over i felt good it was fun but ill be glad to go home 
kean said 
kean touted his trademark politics of inclusion declaring 
we will not concede one single vote anywhere 
with george bush at the helm we will go to the farms and the 
cities to the barrios and the union halls to the suburban 
developments as well as the country roads kean said 
let the dukakis democrats offer the politics of delusion and 
exclusion he said we republicans will practice the politics 
of inclusion 
throughout the 36minute speech delegates opposed to keans 
prochoice views on abortion staged a small but noisy 
demonstration the protestors carried signs reading gov kean is 
baby killer they chanted abortion is murder 
kean did not acknowledge the demonstration later he said he 
heard the noise but did not know what it was authorities removed 
some demonstrators from the hall 
kean took note that the democrats chose a color scheme of 
pastels at their national convention in atlanta last month rather 
than red white and blue 
i dont know about you but i believe americans democrats and 
republicans alike have no use for pastel patriotism kean said 
drawing his loudest cheers 
the liberal democrats are trying to hide more than the colors 
of our flag they are trying to hide their true colors kean said 
democrats chose the pastel colors after deciding they would look 
better on television 
while repeating the dukakis democrats refrain kean never 
mentioned dukakis by his full name 
the governor who admits to being a lessthanriveting speaker 
won interruptions of applause about a halfdozen times 
as kean spoke new jersey followers flashed kean in 96 
signs suggesting the governor might seek the white house himself 
one day kean has only one year left in office 
but while the local crowd was loyal others began to fidget as 
the speech went on kean spoke four minutes longer than arkansas 
gov bill clinton did at the democratic convention last month in a 
speech that made clinton the brunt of jokes 
yet kean concluded to an enthusiastic polite response and 
several minutes of applause the governor beamed broadly as he 
accepted the reaction

republicans are looking for nice things to 
say about indiana sen dan quayle even if many of them hadnt 
heard of him before he became george bushs vice presidential 
running mate 
all i know is he is 41 from indiana and seems attractive 
edgar heiskell chairman of the west virginia republican party 
said after bush announced his decision tuesday he looks like one 
of george bushs sons 
not everybody knew as much as heiskell 
massachusetts republican chairman ray shamie who praised 
quayle confessed that he thought the designated vice presidential 
nominee hailed from ohio 
i dont know anyone in our group who knows sen quayle or 
knows how he helps said california state sen ken maddy im 
trying to turn myself around and feel good about it but i cant 
one of maddys california senate colleagues ed davis said so 
what to quayles selection 
the decision of the voters will be based strictly on the 
presidential candidates not the vice president or the platform or 
anything else davis said i dont know him ive never seen 
the man at least we can say he has no negatives at this point 
quayle is considered by his congressional colleagues to be a 
conservative with an aggressive debating style who could appeal to 
younger voters 
his selection drew praise from others who had been considered 
for the no 2 spot on the republican ticket 
former transportation secretary elizabeth dole said she was not 
disappointed at being passed over and called quayle a fine 
choice 
her husband senate minority leader bob dole of kansas who had 
been another vice presidential possibility made himself scarce 
after the announcement and issued no statement 
but dole the 1976 vice presidential nominee known for his 
occasionally sharp tongue was gracious when later cornered by 
reporters at the convention 
my reaction is they picked an outstanding young man dole 
told a kansas television station im very happy with the choice 
hes a young man a new generation 
i was kind of stunned said sen william cohen of maine who 
had been backing sen dole for the vice presidential post 
he doesnt have the stature of a dole or the following of 
jack kemp cohen said adding that bush may have been looking 
to do something bold and different and surprise all the pundits 
and the experts 
kemp a new york congressman also passed over for the job 
called the bushquayle pairing a very strong ticket for the 
republican party 
iowa gov terry branstad said quayles obscurity can be overcome 
nationally nobody knew who lloyd bentsen was until he got 
tapped for the democratic ticket so what difference does that 
make branstad asked 
democratic nominee michael dukakis campaign was restrained in 
its reaction 
this does not affect our campaign strategy in any way said 
campaign spokesman mark gearan 
bentsen a senator from texas called the selection good 
news and said im looking forward to comparing our lists of 
accomplishments in the us senate and what each of us could do for 
his running mate if we were elected 
sen lowell weicker of connecticut a liberal republican 
praised quayle as a friend but stayed away from his stand on the 
issues 
first and most importantly i regularly beat dan quayle at 
tennis weicker said 
hes a solid conservative and by that i underline solid about 
three times said weicker so we disagree on the issues but 
im very happy for him 
while many republicans were surprised or muted at quayles 
selection sen gordon humphrey rnh who has said for weeks 
that he would oppose the selection of anyone who was not 
sufficiently conservative was lavish in his praise 
im thrilled humphrey said i couldnt be more pleased 
im excited im enthused 
television evangelist pat robertson who formally ended his own 
presidential campaign tuesday by releasing his delegates called 
quayle a tremendous choice 
on areas like abortion and school prayer he is right down 
the line with the evangelicals robertson said 
in addition to helping gain support from younger voters one 
delegate said quayle could boost the gops showing among women 
if were behind in the lady vote my god if he cant help us 
there nobody can said louisiana state sen ken hollis 
somebody asked me yesterday about him i said hes a good 
looking robert redford 
alabama delegate jack dunlop was less than pleased with the 
choice the 72yearold auburn real estate man said quayle is 
too young and too inexperienced 
conservative activist phyllis schlafly said she was pleased with 
quayles selection 
i was supporting jack kemp but he sort of looks like jack 
kemp she said

president reagan who learned 
george bushs choice for a running mate in a whispered conversation 
before boarding air force one says indiana sen dan quayle is a 
proven votegetter who would make a great vice president

here is a transcript of the keynote address 
by gov thomas h kean of new jersey to the republican national 
convention on tuesday night 
thank you thank you very very much 
you know last week i went to the national governors 
association meeting and there was a fellow governor there his name 
happed to be mike dukakis you know mike dukakis gave me this 
hourglass and he gave it to me because people had become bored with 
speeches at the democratic convention 
well tonight id like to use it to send a different message 
mike because it proves an important point time has run out a long 
time ago on your liberal vision of america 
tonight i would like to take you on a journey into americas 
future 
we begin oddly enough centuries ago when a ship on a 
monumental voyage found itself beset by debate and argument 
some wanted the ship to reverse its course 
they cried turn back turn back 
but the santa maria stayed on its course and mankind gained a 
new world with unlimited hopes and horizons 
the president that we elect this year will preside over the 
500th anniversary of columbus journey the first voyage in 
pursuit of the american dream 
historians today agree that columbus was right to ignore his 
doubters 
but what about our voyage 
i would not presume to predict the judgment that historians will 
make of ronald reagan but i do know they must report the facts 
and they will report that today 17 million more americans have 
jobs than just eight years ago

here are comments on the choice of sen dan 
quayle of indiana as the republican vice presidential nominee from 
some of those who had been considered for george bushs running 
mate 
 
sen bob dole of kansas my reaction is they picked an 
outstanding young man im very happy with the choice hes a young 
man a new generation 
 
elizabeth dole former transportation secretary and doles wife 
i have said before that i didnt expect to be selected neither i 
nor bob was running for vice president bob is running for majority 
leader of the senate hopes to get five more republican seats so 
that hell have a republican senate to work with george bush i 
think its a fine choice and look forward to supporting both of 
them and working as a bush surrogate 
 
jack kemp congressman from new york a frontrunner and a 
favorite of the partys right wing up to the last minute i think 
george bush and dan quayle are going to make a very strong ticket 
for the republican party i told the vice president im going to 
look forward to campaigning for a bushquayle ticket in 1988 i 
told him mr vice president i want you to know my support is 
unconditional 
 
sen pete domenici of new mexico it was kind of a mixed 
feeling obviously one set of emotions was relief this is not an 
easy thing to carry around the other emotion was not 
disappointment in the sense that i desperately wanted this but 
there is a lingering kind of feeling that i think i might have 
done a good job and i wont have a chance at doing that 
 
gov john sununu of new hampshire said he was a little 
disappointed at being passed over 
 
sen alan simpson of wyoming you will find an outstanding 
legislative record hes a budgeteer but more importantly he is a 
legislator dan quayle is not a show horse hes a work horse 
he may look like robert redford but he has brightness and brains 
 
gov carroll campbell of south carolina a choice of some 
southern conservatives on how the choice will play in his region 
itll sell 
 
gov james thompson of illinois who took himself out of the 
running hes from our area he can speak to the hopes and 
aspirations of the midwest

a judge has ordered a psychiatrist to 
pay 75 million to the parents of a woman who was stabbed to death 
by a patient of the doctor 10 years ago 
in his decision last week middlesex superior court judge guy 
volterra upheld the jurys award of 45 million plus 3 million 
in interest to the parents of shelley rotman who was slain by her 
former boyfriend in 1978 
the case has drawn wide attention because of the issue of when 
if ever a doctor should violate a patients confidentiality to 
warn a potential victim of threats 
according to testimony at the trial in may dennis gould made 
threats against the 23yearold milton woman during therapy 
sessions with the psychiatrist dr steven mirin but the 
psychiatrist said he did not think gould would carry out the 
threats 
mirin a past president of the massachusetts psychiatric 
society is associate director of mclean hospital in belmont a 
teaching hospital of harvard medical school 
his attorney charles reidy argued that the jury was swayed by 
prejudice and passion not reason and that the verdict was wrong 
as a matter of law 
paul sugarman attorney for the rotmans contended that the 
psychiatrist was negligent because he failed to adequately warn the 
victim notify police or restrain gould 
mirin had written rotman a letter telling her that gould had 
talked of harming her but sugarman argued that the letter should 
have been stronger and more explicit and that mirin should have 
hospitalized gould 
when you get someone this sick you owe a duty to protect 
people sugarman said you owe a duty to see that hes removed 
from the community or at least from the ability to do harm 
after the killing gould was found innocent of murder by reason 
of insanity and was placed at bridgewater state hospital the 
hospital declined to say tuesday whether he is still a patient 
there

here is the transcript of the speech by 
former united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick to the 
republican national convention on tuesday night 
thank you for your warm welcome 
thank you for inviting me to this convention where we can think 
together about our problems and our opportunities 
presidential campaigns often become divisive and harsh so 
before we get too deeply involved in this one i think we should be 
clear that all americans want essentially the same things we want 
freedom we want peace and we want prosperity 
we all dislike spending money on weapons we would much rather 
invest our resources on teachers and schools and hospitals and 
housing we would much rather plant flowers in parks than build 
bombs we would much rather invest in medical research than weapons 
research 
we are not a warlike people we have no imperial vocation we 
are not engaged in a struggle with the soviet union for global 
predominance we seek no empire 
but we cherish our freedom and selfgovernment and we wish for 
others what we desire for ourselves 
we live in the most violent century in human history an age in 
which millions have died in wars and more unarmed millions still 
have been murdered by their own governments jews ukranians 
russians chinese cambodians and many others 
and so in our times it has been more necessary than anyone 
wished for free peoples to be strong to protect their lives and 
freedom 
so the question confronting us in this election is how can we 
use our great but limited power to achieve our goals of a peaceful 
world of independent nations how can we make a wise decision about 
who will use our power most wisely 
the last 11 years demonstrated how much it matters who is 
president of the united states 
nearly 12 years ago a very liberal democrat was inaugurated as 
president the carter administration began with high hopes and lots 
of apologies president carter canceled the b1 bomber and the 
trident submarine and the longrange cruise missile he thought the 
soviet union would follow suit 
but as one carter official said when we built they built 
and when we stopped building they built president carter said 
he learned a lot about the soviet union when its armies invaded 
afghanistan and began their ghastly war against the afghan people 
by the time this learning experience had taken place the 
united states and the west had lost military superiority the 
soviet union had become a global power a dozen countries had 
effectively lost their independence america had lost credibility 
and freedom was in retreat 
neither the united states nor the world can afford another 
learning experience like that for an american president 
by the time jimmy carter left office the united states and the 
soviet union were barely on speaking terms arms talks had been 
broken off cultural exchanges canceled the united states had 
imposed an embargo on grain and a boycott on the olympics 
but today eight years later its fair to say that american 
relations with the soviet union have never been better cultural 
and educational exchange programs have been restored and expanded 
so have trade agreements and scientific cooperation 
one arms agreement has been signed and another is well along the 
way and we are at peace 
some of this improvement reflects a new soviet leader with 
different ideas but much of it is due to the restored strength and 
purpose and confidence and skill and persistence of the united 
states 
when the soviets walked out on arms talks in geneva sdi brought 
them back to the bargaining table mikhail gorbachev doesnt give 
something for nothing 
the reaganbush administration has known how to strike a bargain 
and has had assets to bargain with and the will to persist

we americans should ask ourselves what improves relations what 
strengthens peace what promotes democracy what works a policy of 
unilateral concessions and wishful thinking or a policy of strength 
and clarity 
eight years of american prosperity peace and responsible 
participation in the world have been good for us and good for 
others and in london and kabul and tel aviv and abijan and in 
warsaw and all around the world people know it 
everyone seems to know it but the democratic leadership 
they said the last seven years had and i quote witnessed 
an unprecedented assault on our national interest and national 
security 
apparently the dukakis democrats do not understand how the 
prudent use of american power has helped in afghanistan 
grenada and the persian gulf and in the fight against 
international terrorism and drugs and in the struggle for democracy 
in central america and asia 
thats the bad news the good news is george bush knows better 
apparently the dukakis democrats do not understand the role of 
american power in strengthening and protecting israel or in 
negotiating the withdrawal of soviet missiles that threatened 
western europe thats the bad news 
the good news is george bush knows better 
more bad news the dukakis democrats do not understand how 
american power helped promote arms negotiations with the soviet 
union 
but the good news is george bush knows better and so does dan 
quayle 
the democrats who met in atlanta took pains to look nice and not 
to talk much about their plans and policies one delegate to the 
democratic convention explained why they acted the way they did he 
said were told it doesnt make political sense to talk about 
taxes were told we should be vague and after we win well get 
down to business 
generally speaking the democratic delegates did as they were 
told they didnt talk about taxes or about deep unilateral defense 
cuts or about nicaragua 
they didnt talk about much 
they left it to us to figure out for ourselves what will happen 
when they get down to business 
their candidate another very liberal governor with a 
technocratic style and no foreign policy experience is attempting 
now to repeat what jimmy carter performed in 1976 in presenting 
himself as a man more concerned with competence than with ideology 
but if you read the democratic platform if you listen to their 
speeches if you look at their record it is clear that the basic 
approach has not changed since george mcgovern was nominated in 
1972 and since jimmy carter was elected in 1976 
that approach features collectivism in domestic affairs 
weakness in defense and deep confusion about americas role in the 
world 
actually in spite of their conventions blackout on discussion 
of foreign policy we know a good deal about michael dukakis 
approach to foreign affairs and what we know is deeply disturbing 
we know for example that he never felt it necessary to 
disagree with the policies of jesse jackson we know hes proposed 
deep unilateral cuts in most of our weapon systems we know he said 
he would end missile test flights and nuclear testing that he 
would end work on sdi and a missile defense system and ban 
antisatellite weapons 
we know he calls for a stable nuclear deterrent he imagines 
that we can maintain that stable deterrence without developing any 
new weapons while the soviet union continues to produce new 
offensive and defensive arms we know dukakis favors arms 
negotiations but his proposed unilateral cuts would leave the 
soviet union no incentive to negotiate 
today foreign policy is vital to our economy and our security 
today it is a matter of life and death americans deserve a 
straight discussion of what a wouldbe president plans for us but 
dukakis evades such discussion 
michael dukakis doesnt say he will make america more 
vulnerable but that is the inevitable consequence of unilaterally 
canceling our major weapons systems 
michael dukakis doesnt say he will leave us defenseless against 
soviet missiles but that is the inevitable consequence of 
abandoning sdi

a woman with cerebral palsy who had two 
sons taken away by county officials is ending the custody fight her 
lawyer says galvanized the cause of disabled parents rights 
across the nation 
tiffany callo 21 says she has agreed to a settlement that 
would allow her 18month and 8monthold boys to be raised together 
by foster parents and let her visit them every six months 
in this case it just boiled down to an individual mothers 
decision that at this point in time it was in her childrens best 
interest and her best interest to let the open adoption go 
through callos attorney clay bedford said monday 
bedford said the custody proceedings callo had faced were 
unconstitutional an all or nothing gamble that encourages 
parents like callo to settle for limited visitation had callo 
lost he said the children likely would have been placed in a 
closed adoption with visitation forever lost 
she would have never been able to see the kids again or hear 
from the kids again it would have been just as if she had died or 
the kids had died bedford said 
despite the decision to end the custody battle bedford said the 
case won support from many other disabled parents 
i think tiffany has galvanized the cause of disabled parents 
rights across the nation he said theres going to be other 
cases because theres a lot of disabled parents out there 
after stories about callos case appeared in newspapers around 
the country last year and earlier this year she received dozens of 
letters in support of her fight and offers to help her raise her 
children 
callo who needs a wheelchair to get around said she has 
developed a warm relationship with the foster parents who plan to 
adopt the boys 
i feel good about them callo said of the parents the 
lady is taking very good care of my boys 
callo and the boys father tony rios who also uses a 
wheelchair married in november but separated soon afterward 
bedford said she is now seeking a divorce rios did not return 
messages seeking comment on the custody arrangement 
callos first son david was removed from her home by social 
workers last year her second son jessie was removed the day 
after he was born in january neither boy is disabled 
callo said santa clara county officials initially told her she 
was incapable of caring for her children because of her disability 
later officials cited other reasons including her psychological 
evaluation callo said

i believe we can keep america more competitive in the world if 
we keep those tax cuts in place 
and i believe if we help to get those small businesses started 
and get those big businesses smarter and if we make a national 
commitment that america will not settle for second best 
and i believe i believe that we can keep america secure if we 
keep her strong 
you know i also have another belief and that is that we can 
make americas neighborhoods and communities safe if were tough 
enough with the criminals instead of being tough on the lawabiding 
citizens 
lets be a little applause lets rededicate ourselves to 
safe neighborhoods and to supporting those who support the laws 
and i believe i believe most of all that what makes america 
great is values values like faith and freedom values like 
neighborhood and community and above all values like family 
and i have to confess its my family that gives me strength and 
i dont think im alone in america families are the thread with 
which this countrys magic quilt is held together

here is a transcript of the speech by 
christian broadcaster pat robertson to the republican national 
convention on tuesday night 
thank you very much 
ladies and gentlemen four years ago the keynote speaker at the 
democratic national convention told us that america was a tale of 
two cities the haves and the havenots the rich and the poor 
the upper class and the lower class 
we heard a variation on that message from jesse jackson and 
teddy kennedy and every democrat who spoke last month at their 
convention in atlanta 
ladies and gentlemen the time has come to tell the truth 
the message of the democratic party is a message of defeat 
division and despair they did not speak for the american people 
under mcgovern or mondale or carter and they do not speak for 
america today 
but that speaker who compared america to a tale of two 
cities was right in a way he never intended 
that great novel by charles dickens begins with a double 
sentence it was the best of times it was the worst of times 
in 1980 ronald reagan and george bush began a long journey to 
rescue this country from the worst of times from doubledigit 
inflation soaring interest rates and widespread unemployment 
as republicans our task in 1988 is to continue that journey and 
build the greatness of america through moral strength 
exactly two months and 22 days from tonight some 100 million of 
our fellow citizens will go to their polling places to choose the 
future course of the united states of america 
our tale of two cities is really a choice between two paths two 
visions of america two philosophies of the future 
when charles dickens wrote his epic novel he described in 
heartrending detail the consequences that the right and wrong 
choices made in two cities in europe

in city no 1 under the deceptive slogan liberty equality 
fraternity the people with revolutionary zeal threw out god the 
church established morality the established government their 
former leaders sound currency and some of the private ownership 
of property then they demanded that the new government buy them 
happiness 
instead of the govermentinspired utopia which the people 
thought they would get they got liberal divorce laws and a breakup 
of families anarchy looting ruinous inflation and financial 
chaos 
as the madness fed on itself they got something much worse 
the reign of terror a time when no ones life was safe from the 
dreaded guillotine 
the second city followed a very different course there faith 
in god was maintained there was even a spiritual revival under 
john wesley respect for the rule of law prevailed 
instead of wild excess there was selfcontrol and 
selfrestraint the currency was strong and families were stable 
private property was protected and life was held sacred with all 
its faults england created a strong stable conservative 
government that survived with prosperity for a hundred years 
so these two cities made choices in 1789 that shaped their 
future for decades for generations to come now 200 years later 
america faces its choice 
the democrats have given us a clear picture of their city they 
offer unlimited government massive transfers of wealth from the 
productive sector of society to the nonproductive and 
everincreasing regulation of the daily lives of the people and 
their children 
in the city of the democratic party the liberal mind set reigns 
supreme criminals are turned loose and the innocent are made 
victims disease carriers are protected and the healthy are placed 
at great risk 
in the democrats city welfare dependency flourishes and no one 
is held accountable for his or her behavior society is always to 
blame 
in the democrats city the rights of the majority must always 
take a back seat to the clamorous demands of special interest 
groups and yet in their city it is always the majority that must 
pay the bills through higher and higher taxes 
now the democratic party has discovered the family they want us 
all in one big family but lets keep in mind that they want you 
and me to be in one family with jim wright as the daddy barbara 
mikulski as the momma and teddy kennedy as big brother i cant 
speak for you but i believe i would rather pick my own relatives

to build their city the democratic party has selected michael 
dukakis as architect i submit to you tonight that michael dukakis 
is the most liberal candidate for the presidency ever put forward 
by any major party in the history of the united states of america 
in fact the city the democrats hope to build is so bad that 
they are ashamed to mention the word that describes who they are 
and what they really want to do they dont say what it is they 
just call it the l word 
they know that their programs will require massive new revenues 
but in their platform they did not mention once the vehicle they 
will use to raise the money they just call it the t word 
well ladies and gentlemen whether by silence whether by 
initials or whether in a foreign language its still 
taxandspend liberalism and the american people are too smart to 
fall for it again 
theres another word that the democrats did not mention once in 
their platform and not once in the acceptance speech of their 
candidate its a g word the name of god 
ladies and gentlemen our president ronald reagan was not 
ashamed to ask the assembled delegates at our convention in detroit 
to bow their heads in silent prayer to god as americans we are 
not ashamed to pledge allegiance to a flag that is a symbol of one 
nation under god 
and i submit to you that our party the republican party 
assembled here in new orleans is not ashamed to write into our 
national platform our solemn resolve that the children of this 
country will once again be allowed to pray to god in the classrooms 
of america 
as an aside i should mention that michael dukakis is a 
cardcarrying member of the aclu as you know thats an 
organization dedicated to removing all public affirmation of 
religious faith in america as president michael dukakis will pack 
the federal courts with aclu radicals if there were no other 
reason and there are many to deny michael dukakis the presidency 
this is a reason enough for all of us to vote against him in 
november 
ladies and gentlemen the republican party wants to write a tale 
of another city 
we are the children of those who tamed the wilderness spanned a 
continent and brought forth the greatest nation on the face of the 
earth we are the heirs of those who enriched the world with the 
electric light the telephone the airplane massproduced 
automobiles the transistor and countless wonderful inventions

and yet we are the heirs of a more enduring legacy than mere 
material progress we are the heirs of a legacy of ideas a legacy 
of freedom a legacy of equality of opportunity a legacy of 
government of the people by the people and for the people we are 
the heirs of an experiment in freedom that has given hope and 
promise to all the people on the face of this earth 
we see a city set on a hill a shining light of freedom for all 
of the nations to see and admire a city made great by the moral 
strength and selfreliance of her people 
a city where husbands and wives love each other and families 
hold together 
a city where every child whether rich or poor has available to 
him the very best education in the world 
a city where the elderly live out their lives with respect and 
dignity and where the unborn child is safe in his mothers womb 
a city where the plague of drugs is no more and those who would 
destroy and debase our children with illegal drugs are given life 
sentences in prison with no chance for parole 
a city where the streets are safe where criminals are locked up 
and the law abiding can walk about without fear 
a city where the water is pure to drink the air clean to 
breathe and the citizens respect and care for the soil the 
forests and gods other creatures who share with us the earth the 
sky and the water 
a city with limited government but unlimited opportunity for 
every one of its citizens 
we are republicans and we believe in government that is our 
servant and not our master 
we believe that the wisdom of the millions who make up the 
marketplace is greater than the wisdom of the few who serve in 
government 
we want a balanced budget but we feel that the way to balance 
the budget is to stop waste and mismanagement in government not to 
raise the taxes on the people 
there is a word to describe us it is a c word we are 
conservatives and we are proud of it

in november the voters will choose their version of a tale of 
two cities 
some people say they dont care what choice the voters make in 
november that it doesnt really matter 
i say to you tonight we care because it does matter it matters 
to us and our children whether we vote democrat or whether we vote 
republican 
and we care whether the successor to a great president ronald 
reagan is a liberal who returns us to the failed policies of jimmy 
carter or a principled conservative like george bush who moves us 
proudly into the 1990s 
etched in my mind is the memory of a 40yearold black man he 
was strong he was honest he was hardworking he was handsome he 
was a family man with a wife and a couple of children 
he was building a place for himself and his family when one day 
tragedy struck him 
you see he couldnt read and write he had been running a 
loading dock for a fertilizer distributor he got along by 
memorizing the colors of the products that he handled until the 
company changed the labels and he made so many mistakes that they 
had to let him go 
his life is now in shambles his pride is gone his hopes and 
dreams are gone he is one more on the welfare rolls he is one of 
the 30 million functional illiterates in america who have been 
shortchanged by our educational establishment 
ladies and gentlemen george bush wants to be known as the 
education president together we can make our schools the best in 
the world if we follow a few simple steps 
we must guarantee to our children a disciplined crimefree 
drugfree school environment tough school principals should be 
made community heroes not community scapegoats 
we must recognize that the socalled new age curriculum of 
progressive education is a colossal failure and must be replaced 
we must place control of education in the hands of parents and 
teachers in the local communities and take it away from washington 
the federal courts and the liberal leadership of a powerful 
teachers union

we must give to every parent the maximum freedom to decide what 
school is best for his or her child empowering parents with 
vouchers and educational choice at the state and local level is an 
idea whose time has come 
yet some would say we can never have better education without 
stronger families 
in part they are right in my opinion the breakup of the 
american family is the no 1 social problem in america today 
half of our marriages end in divorce over 15 million children 
now live with a single parent single women with children are the 
fastest growing segment of the poor in our land we speak of the 
feminization of poverty 
but what has government done about the problem 
successive democratic congresses have raised the tax burden on 
parents with children an estimated 245 percent over a 20year 
period in one year federal taxpayers money was used to institute 
an estimated 225000 divorce actions 
it has been estimated that 30 percent of all divorces in america 
are caused by misguided welfare laws 
more cruel than all this is the assumption begun by lyndon 
johnsons great society programs that the poor did not have to 
strive to learn to compete and to excel this attitude fostered 
dependency then hopelessness then despair 
ladies and gentlemen we are republicans and we believe some 
basic truths here tonight 
no 1 government must seek to strengthen families not tear 
them apart 
no 2 parents are responsible for their own children if a man 
fathers a child that child is not the responsibility of the city 
the state or the federal government that child is his 
responsibility and he and the childs mother should be made to look 
after it 
no 3 women in our society should have complete access to 
challenging and rewarding careers if women in our society do the 
same work as men they should receive the same pay as men for that 
equal work

no 4 we also need to stop punishing women in our society who 
choose to be homemakers if in our society we can afford to give 
tax deductions and credits to working parents with children we 
also can afford to give tax deductions and credits to women who 
want to stay at home and care for their children 
no 5 the goal of welfare must be to restore people in crisis 
to dignity and useful employment not to create a class of 
government dependents for whom welfare is a way of life whatever 
the democrats may tell you that is not the way to keep hope 
alive 
but hope is very much alive in america today it is alive 
because our vision the republican vision expresses the hopes and 
the dreams of the vast majority of the american people 
as we leave new orleans we will go back to our homes confident 
that we are a party united around a platform that expresses the 
american spirit a platform we can be proud to share with our 
neighbors all over this great nation 
and now i would like to give a personal message to the millions 
of americans voters volunteers and supporters across this nation 
who committed themselves to my campaign i thank you i am very 
proud of you and now the time has come for you to make your choice 
this party is about to nominate as its presidential candidate a 
man that i have come to respect and admire today we have learned 
of the selection of sen dan quayle as his running mate 
dan quayle beat the liberal birch bayh to get a seat from 
indiana in the united states senate only a few members of the 
senate can claim his distinguished record of support for the 
reaganbush agenda he is a staunch defender of freedom a champion 
of family values and a common sense hoosier who understands the 
needs of the farmer and the working man 
he is young vigorous and capable 
ladies and gentlemen the george bushdan quayle ticket can and 
will lead our nation proudly into the future 
therefore tonight i release my delegates and alternates who 
have come to this convention and urge you and all of my friends 
across america to give your enthusiastic support to our party to 
our platform and our presidential and vice presidential nominees 
as we cast our eyes toward november we know that a new page of 
history will be written 
on that page we will inscribe the name of the 41st president of 
the united states 
his name will be george bush republican 
thank you and god bless you

jose sanchez neighbors are crowing 
about his 15pound rooster and the city says the pet has ruffled 
too many feathers in the tranquil neighborhood 
sanchez has run afoul of the law illegally harboring a rooster 
in a residential area if he loses his fight to keep travis the 
rooster he could be sentenced to six months in jail and fined 
1000 on each of four misdemeanmor counts 
can you believe it i might end up in county jail with 
burglars and thieves and ill be there because of a chicken 
said the 26yearold sanchez whos been fighting the city over the 
law for two years 
his trial begins monday 
deputy city attorney frank rhemrev said he doubts the maximum 
sentence will be assessed 
many people have told sanchez he shouldnt risk jail for a 
rooster 
you can get warm and cuddly about a rooster just like you can 
about a cat or a dog sanchez said about his 7yearold rooster 
travis is real friendly hes a companion just like any 
other pet 
he just happens to be a chicken 
public defender linda van winkle has given up trying to talk him 
into giving up travis 
i ask him how long do roosters live anyway but he told me 
travis has a good three years left and i dont think i can get the 
case continued for that long the lawyer said 
rhemrev said neighbors began complaining about the roosters 
crowing in 1986 
sanchez said travis was 3 years old and living in his back yard 
when the law was passed in 1984 thus sanchez said the rooster 
should be the beneficiary of a grandfather clause

here is a transcript of the speech by former 
president gerald r ford to the republican national convention on 
tuesday night 
thank you secretary of transportation bill coleman betty and i 
are deeply grateful for your many many kindnesses your loyal 
support and we are most appreciative of your warm and generous 
introduction 
let me say that both betty and i treasure and cherish our 
friendship with you and lovida 
during my 40 years of public service i have been very fortunate 
and very blessed to have a wise and courageous partner shes been 
a wonderful mother of four great great children and naturally im 
very proud of the help and inspiration she has given to so many 
americans 
its an honor for me to introduce to you my loving wife betty 
ford 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
betty fords remarks im delighted to be here with jerry to 
help him send george and barbara bush on to a republican victory 
and to the white house where they belong 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gerald ford then resumes his remarks 
my fellow americans my fellow republicans this is my 10th 
republican national convention and god willing not my last 
thank you for inviting me to share in your nomination of my 
friend and colleague in so many difficult days and tough campaigns 
the next president of the united states george bush 
and may i say with equal emphasis i endorse and support dan 
quayle as the next vice president of the united states 
last month together with a few thousand other diehard 
television fans i watched the democrats miniseries in atlanta 
i applaud and i salute the tremendous strides that the dukakis 
family has taken to achieve the american dream i applaud and i 
salute rev jesse jackson for his talents and personal achievements 
and for showing millions of black citizens that the american dream 
can be more than a dream 
but my applause stopped short when i saw the democrats claiming 
that they have somehow become the party of the american dream 
lets set the record straight we are one nation under god and 
we have only one american dream that unites and belongs to all of 
us no party no politician has a patent on that dream 
it doesnt matter what state you come from or where your 
ancestors came from or which party you prefer the american dream 
belongs to you 
except for the native american indians we are all of us 
immigrants to this blessed land some came by sailing ships slave 
ships and steamships some came outcast and oppressed workhungry 
and warweary boat people and jet people and we are all proud 
custodians of the american dream

<DOCNO> AP880817-0067 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
the american dream belongs to you and nobody can take it away 
from you the work of this crucial 1988 campaign is to advance that 
dream by realistic progress not by promises by continuing 
leadership that has brought america closer to peace in the world 
and full prosperity at home 
the task before us as republicans is to show that we stand for 
something we stand for individual freedom for equal justice and 
opportunity and for safety at home and peace in the world we 
believe that government exists to serve not only the worthy causes 
of all minorities but also to safeguard the rights and legitimate 
interests of the majority 
we believe that a government big enough to give you everything 
you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you 
have 
do we really want to go back to the days of spend and spend tax 
and tax a government in washington with its head in the clouds 
and its hand in your pocket 
i can put it no plainer than this this years democratic ticket 
is a tax increase on its way to happen 
under president reagan weve cut cut taxes kept inflation 
under control and come as close to full employment as we are likely 
to get in peacetime and we are in peacetime thats performance 
not promises 
can we continue this performance with george bush in the white 
house and more republicans in the congress you bet we will 
we republicans stand for more not less individual freedom 
fewer bureaucrats bungling up the works more freedom to keep what 
weve worked for freedom from the cruel head tax of inflation 
do we really want to go back to all the democrat economic misery 
from 1977 to 1981 interest rates 21 percent inflation 13 percent 
no not even the professional democrats want to go back to such 
economic misery they claim theyve seen the light changed their 
ways and want us to believe that this campaign is not about 
ideology but about competence 
competence when you look at the competence of the two or three 
gentlemen who now speak for the democrats where is their 
experience in foreign affairs only reverend jackson has shown much 
interest in it

i have to admit that my friend lloyd bentsen we came to the 
congress together in 1948 is pretty solid on defense matters but 
his partners cant seem to get their act together 
i wish you lots and lots of luck lloyd youre going to need it 
governor dukakis says youll be the kind of vice president who 
will march into the oval office and tell him mr president that 
is a perfectly ridiculous policy lloyd with all the differences 
between the democratic leaders why wait speak up now 
when governor dukakis says hell cut back on american military 
strength that has brought the soviets to the negotiating table for 
the reduction of nuclear weapons lloyd educate him now not 
later 
tell him now how jobs are created who really creates them in 
america the private sector not government it may be your only 
chance dont wait lloyd speak up now 
now some other speaker at the democratic convention i dont 
remember his name asked the rhetorical question where was 
george 
a fair question deserves a fair answer i know the answer 
i know where george bush was during the second world war george 
was there 
we were both out there in the pacific ocean fighting to win it 
i was on an aircraft carrier and george was flying fighter planes 
off another courageously winning the distinguished flying cross 
and three air medals in combat 
i know where george bush was in 1966 i flew down to texas 
campaigned for him he won when george came to the house of 
representatives as a freshman congressman i was the new house 
republican leader 
i was so impressed with the integrity and ability of george bush 
i saw to it that he was assigned to the committee on ways and 
means a very rare honor for a freshman 
now thats not the committee of congress that spends your money 
thats the one that worries how to find it so george learned all 
about taxes and budgets in a hard school and we know where george 
bush stands on that issue 
i know where george bush was in 1971 and 72 he was at the 
united nations battling once more for his country working for 
peace george was there speaking up loud and clear for the united 
states of america

i know where george bush was in 1973 and 74 i was vice 
president and he was chairman of the republican national committee 
during one of the most difficult periods in our partys history 
george was there he came out of this charactertesting without 
a mark on him and with a profound understanding of our national 
political process from the courthouse to the statehouse to the 
white house 
when i asked george to be our representative in the peoples 
republic of china he recommended as his successor the first woman 
national chairman of either party in our history mary louise 
smith of iowa so we also know where george bush stands on equal 
opportunity for women 
i know where george was on dec 1 1975 he and barbara greeted 
betty and me in beijing on a critical state visit i learned first 
hand how the bushes had won the affection of the chinese people as 
well as the respect of the chinese leadership during the internal 
struggles that followed the death of chairman mao 
i know where george was during my last year as president i 
brought him home to be my director of the central intelligence 
agency the cia had been wracked by serious charges its dedicated 
people were demoralized george bush took charge fast his 
leadership put this essential agency firmly onto a responsible new 
course 
and where was and where was george bush in all the years 
between right where most other americans were making a living 
raising a loving family meeting a payroll helping his community 
paying his taxes and his debts i ask you whats wrong with those 
credentials 
i know we all know where george bush has been for the last 
eight years in 1980 he was running for president he finished 
second for our nomination but became the winners choice for vice 
presidency and that was one of president reagans best decisions 
now i know a thing or two about the vice presidency its not 
an easy job thomas jefferson called it a splendid misery but 
like most of lifes challenges you can learn a lot from being vice 
president 
i held that office eight months george bush for eight years we 
carried out our constitutional chores with loyalty to the 
presidency and trust in the american people for that superb job 
george bush i salute you and the american people salute you 
so where was george for 45 years george bush has been at the 
center of the action in the service of this great republic 
ill be damned if i will stand and let anyone with a smirk and a 
sneer discredit the honor service accountability and competence 
of george bush 
if the three democratic standardbearers in this campaign think 
it is about competence let any one of them or all three of them 
put together top the demonstrated competence of george bush 
if our fellow countrymen think this campaign is about change 
let them think long and hard about what they got the last time they 
voted for change with democrats without experience we cannot 
afford to make the same mistake again 
we republicans we republicans are not perfect we make 
mistakes some of them lulus but we stand for something our 
candidate george bush stands for something hes been there 
my fellow citizens im going to work my heart out to make 
george bush the next president of the united states george bush 
was there when i needed him george bush was there when america 
needed him 
and i know where george bush will be in 1989 right there in 
the white house where we all need him 
thank you and god bless you

afghan guerrillas claimed today that 
they killed 500 soviets soldiers in an attack on a garrison and 
ammunition dump near the red armys evacuation route in northern 
afghanistan 
masood khalili spokesman for the jamiatiislami moslem 
revolutionaries said 200 other soviets troops were wounded when 
guerrillas fired eight rockets into the khalagay base in baghlan 
province at midday on friday 
western diplomatic sources in islamabad said they had 
conflicting reports of attacks on the garrison by different groups 
on different days 
rival guerrilla groups had reported last weekend that they 
started a fire at a fuel storage facility at the base 
i think the figure sounds high said one western diplomat on 
condition of anonymity he said that if accurate it would be the 
red armys worst single loss since it intervened in the afghan 
civil war in december 1979 to back a prosoviet regime in kabul 
khalili said the rockets touched off a fire that burned for two 
days and destroyed 250 fighting vehicles he said news of the 
attack came from forces under jamiats famed commander ahmad shah 
masood who controls much of northern afghanistan 
masood is widely reported to have agreed not to attack soviet 
troops who have just passed the numerical halfway point in their 
scheduled ninemonth withdrawal from afghanistan 
these troops were not withdrawing they were on the base 
khalili said 
khlagay about 90 miles south of the soviet border lies near a 
fork in the main northbound land route for withdrawing soviet 
forces 
the shorter north fork reportedly is cut in two places by 
insurgents red army forces have been using the northwest fork 
which follows major oil and natural gas pipelines running from 
kabul to the soviet union 
in new york meanwhile a un official said soviet troops have 
left 10 of their 18 main garrisons in afghanistan and are 
withdrawing from the country according to the schedule worked out 
under a un accord 
the unmediated geneva accords specify that onehalf of the 
soviet contingent of more than 100000 troops be out by aug 15 
the rest are to be gone by feb 15 
francois giuliani spokesman for secretarygeneral javier perez

perus vital silver industry 
prime minister armando villanueva and valetin pacho 
secretarygeneral of the general confederation of peruvian workers 
said late tuesday that a tentative agreement had been reached to

the national federation of mine metal and steel workers called 
the strike to demand unified labor contracts for all unionized 
miners the federation claims to represent 75 percent of perus 
estimated 80000 to 100000 mine workers 
the federation said more than 90 percent of the mining industry 
was affected the strike industry analysts said the figure was 
closer to 60 percent

industry particularly hard peru is the worlds second leading 
producer of silver behind mexico it is also a major source of 
copper lead zinc and gold

panhandling windshield washers often intimidate 
drivers going so far as to smack a car window if they dont get 
money for their unsolicited services says mayor edward i koch 
who wants to regulate them 
i believe theyre horrible koch said tuesday were going 
to address this issue its a police issue 
the mayor who drew criticism recently when he urged people not 
to give money to beggars predicted his move against the windshield 
washers will bring him more flak 
the windshield washers who have proliferated in recent years 
stand at busy street corners and rush out uninvited to clean the 
front windows of cars that stop for lights they then ask for a tip 
many motorists complain that the washers use filthy rags and 
leave the glass streaked and dirtier than before there have been 
some incidents of violence by windshield washers when motorists 
refused to pay them 
koch said he was concerned about intimidation by the washers 
suddenly if three or four guys descend on your car and 
without asking you they start to polish it up with dirty rags and 
filthy squeegees and dirty water and you say to yourself i dont 
want it but you cant stop it what are you going to do fight 
with these guys 
koch said he did not know if it was a crime to wash windshields 
when not asked to but if the panhandler intimidates the driver or 
passengers it might be a form of harassment

the us government should have stopped 
short of paying reparations to japaneseamericans interned during 
world war ii says one war veteran who has turned in his army

enough for these people said frank gonzol of middlesex borough 
the retired 69yearold mechanic turned in his 11 medals and 
accreditations to the office of rep matthew rinaldo despite 
efforts by rinaldos staff to dissuade him said robert delazaro 
an aide to the republican congressman 
rinaldo who voted in favor of the reparations represents 
gonzols district 
gonzol said he served from 194245 and saw combat action in 
africa sicily and other parts of europe 
the reparations signed last week by presdient reagan authorizes 
taxfree payments of 20000 to each of the approximately 60000 
surviving japaneseamericans who were placed in camps during the

police plans to pursue two bank 
robbers who fled with hostages and a small fortune in a getaway car 
provided by authorities backfired when the pair commandeered a 
highpowered bmw officials said today 
authorities said they provided the first automobile and the bulk 
of the 420000 marks 227000 the robbers demanded to prevent any 
harm to the two captive bank employees and had planned to pursue 
the getaway car 
then in a statement issued 24 hours after the robbery began 
police in gladbeck said they had lost contact with the gunmen and 
their victims 
the statement said the bank robbers switched cars twice after 
fleeing the scene with their hostages late tuesday 
in the first the gunmen rushed into a restaurant and demanded 
the keys to a highpowered bmw which they used as part of the 
escape details of the second car change were not included in the 
police statment which added that the fugitives presumably had left 
the gladeck area in central germany 
the gunmen had burst into a bank early tuesday in this town 50 
miles north of cologne and held police at bay for 14 hours before 
fleeing with 65000 stolen from the bank and an additional 
162000 provided by authorities 
it doesnt matter whether we give them 300000 marks or a 
million our foremost concern is the hostages police spokesman 
klaus fechner said 
fechner said the robbers had threatened to kill their hostages 
a 34yearold man who worked as a bank teller and a 23yearold 
woman who worked as a customer service representative 
the gunmen fired warning shots through windows of the building 
but no injuries were reported 
negotiators had continued to try to persuade the two gunmen to 
surrender but they refused demanding the getaway car they 
eventually used at the start of the escape 
police officials said they had intended to follow the audi sedan 
and arrest the two men but lost contact after the two car changes

patrons of john vinichs union bar and 
lounge boisterously celebrated the democrats triumph in wyomings 
hotly contested us senate primary but the nominee faces a battle 
to unseat republican sen malcolm wallop in november 
wyoming people are ready for a change and i think by working 
in a grassroots kind of campaign wyoming will be able to make 
malcolm wallop be a man of his word and limit him to two terms 
vinich said over the din of revellers who packed his bar in the 
tiny town of hudson 
complete unofficial returns from wyomings primary tuesday 
showed vinich a state senator with 14 years legislative 
experience with 23165 votes or 47 percent in the democratic 
primary 
university of wyoming professor pete maxfield ran second with 
14595 votes or 30 percent while state schools superintendent 
lynn simons had 11312 votes or 23 percent 
wallop coasted to his third gop senate nomination amassing 
55696 votes or 83 percent with all of wyomings 474 precincts 
reporting wallops four opponents michael dee russ hanrahan 
nora marie lewis and iw bud kinney did not conduct highly 
visible campaigns 
twelve years ago wallop pledged to stay just two terms in the 
senate but this year he changed his mind saying that challenges 
to wyomings way of life its environment and the states and the 
nations defense made a third term necessary 
official totals in the races likely will differ slightly as a 
federal judge on tuesday ordered state elections officials to count 
any absentee ballots that arrive by the end of business monday 
the order stemmed from a justice department lawsuit claiming 
that the states 23 county clerks failed to mail the ballots early 
enough so they could be returned by primary day 
however there were not enough absentee ballots to affect 
vinichs 8570vote victory margin 
the victory will pit a man considered by some to be one of 
wyomings most liberal politicians against another thought to be 
one of the states most conservative vinich spent thousands of 
dollars on commercials designed to combat his liberal image 
tuesday night while savoring his victory vinich didnt worry 
about labels 
i think political labels are just smoke screens that other 
candidates like to use when they have nothing else to say he 
said in a telephone interview 
wallop 55 issued a brief statement from his campaign 
headquarters 
i look forward to informing the people of wyoming about my 
record and continuing the discussion of the issues that face us 
today and in the future he said 
overshadowed by the democratic senate race were the contests for 
wyomings only us house seat democrat bryan sharratt ran 
unopposed while fiveterm incumbent dick cheney easily earned his 
sixth nomination by outdistancing jacksons bob morris 59364 to 
8492

a continental airlines report filed with federal 
safety inspectors blames the fatal november crash of a dc9 at 
stapleton international airport on wing turbulence a poorly plowed 
runway and airtraffic control errors 
flight 1713 crashed upon takeoff during a snowstorm killing 28 
people 
a combination of errors by the city of denver and airtraffic 
control caused the catastrophic crash of flight 1713 the airline 
concluded in the report filed last month with the national 
transportation safety board the rocky mountain news reported in 
todays edition 
the evidence developed to date indicates the crash of flight 
1713 was not caused by mechanical or equipment failure structural 
icing or pilot error the report said rather the crash was 
caused by the aircraft encountering wingtip vortices at a critical 
phase of flight 
a wingtip vortex is turbulence resulting from an intense eddy 
of swirling air that fans out from the wings of airplanes 
particularly widebody planes 
in response to continentals claim that the city did not 
completely clear the runway stapleton spokesman richard boulware 
said we reject that categorically i personally sat in my office 
that day and watched airplanes take off from that very runway 
nobody else had any problem why did they and if continental did 
the pilot had the option of choosing not to take off 
frank johns airtraffic manager at stapleton said he hadnt 
seen the report so i dont have any specific comments but we 
would probably disagree with those findings 
continental spokesman bruce hicks said the ntsb has barred the 
airline from releasing the 54page report filed july 11 and a 
50page aug 5 supplemental document that further argues turbulence 
from another airplane caused the crash 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said the board will not comment 
on the investigation until sept 27 when it is expected to 
announce its findings in the nov 15 crash 
an air line pilots association report filed with the ntsb 
alleges inadequate aircraft deicing and incomplete crew training 
by continental caused the crash the report also said the copilot 
lee edward bruecher mishandled the jets controls contributing to 
the severity of the crash 
the 26yearold copilot and pilot frank zvonek 43 were among 
those killed 
in its report continental contends turbulence from the wings of 
a delta boeing 767 that landed on a runway parallel to the one used 
by flight 1713 less than three minutes before takeoff was the 
primary cause of the accident 
continental also contends the pilots injuries and damage to 
cockpit controls indicate zvonek recognized the severity of the 
votexinduced loss of control at a critical phase of the flight 
and assumed control of the aircraft 
in addition to turbulence and runway conditions the continental 
report cited airtraffic controllers for allegedly 
failing to report clutter or slush on the runway and to 
request an inspection of the runway 
failing to provide proper spacing between landings and 
departures on the parallel runway to avoid turbulence 
failing to properly chart flight 1713s position prior to 
departure causing a delay of up to seven minutes in takeoff which 
may have affected airplane deicing 
failing to report wind direction and velocity accurately

china has refused to accredit a reporter from the 
voice of america the radio network supported by the us 
government and which china has criticized for its coverage of 
student unrest 
the foreign ministry gave no reason for its refusal to grant 
credentials to max ruston 26 saying only we find it difficult 
to accept mr ruston as a resident correspondent 
ruston is the first reporter in recent years from a major 
foreign news organization to be refused accreditation by china 
ruston reached in hong kong refused comment on the decision 
the rejection came more than two months after voa requested 
accreditation for ruston the voa office in beijing had no 
immediate response to the decision 
it was not clear whether the rejection was linked to chinas 
harsh criticism of voa for its reports on prodemocracy student 
demonstrations in december 1986 and january 1987 
the radio network which broadcasts in both chinese and english 
was a major source of information for students trying to find out 
what was happening on campuses in other parts of the country 
the official press again lashed out at voa in june when students 
at beijing university demonstrated and put up posters calling for 
more democracy it quoted an unidentified student as saying voa was 
interested only in bad news about china 
ruston formerly accredited as a local hire for voa was in 
shanghai when thousands of students in chinas largest city took to 
the streets in december 1986 for several days his reports were 
some of the most detailed of the student unrest there 
ruston who is fluent in mandarin worked for voa in beijing 
until mid1987 when he was transferred to washington he has been 
reporting from hong kong while waiting for approval to take up his 
position in beijing 
the foreign ministry statement made no mention of chinas past 
displeasure with voa and said we hope voa will nominate someone 
else 
china has expelled three foreign journalists since 1986 on 
various charges of violating chinese security regulations 
two of those reporters an american working for the french news 
agency agencefrance presse and a correspondent for japans kyodo 
news service were expelled after last years student 
demonstrations and an ensuing conservative campaign against western 
liberal ideas

a willie nelson concert at baylor university 
has been canceled by the baptist schools president who said he 
was concerned for the health and wellbeing of the american 
people 
the nov 14 concert which was to be a benefit for depositors of 
a failed bank in leroy was scheduled to be held on campus 
when the uninsured leroy bank was declared insolvent last 
august about 600 depositors including many retirees lost their 
savings 
baylor university sympathizes greatly with those in the leroy 
texas community where bank deposits have been lost but our 
concern for the health and wellbeing of the american people is an 
overriding one baylor president herbert reynolds said in a 
statement tuesday 
reynolds also said he hopes nelson will use his strong influence 
to strengthen the moral fiber of our nation 
reynolds refused to discuss his specific concerns 
im leaving that to the inference of the readers he told 
the associated press 
concert promoter tom gresham said he planned to meet with nelson 
today to discuss having the concert at another location on the same 
date he would not say what reason baylor officials gave him for 
the concerts cancellation 
willie is a singer and an entertainer he is not a politician 
or a preacher no one should confuse that gresham said his 
offer to help the people of that community was from the heart 
last month a nelson concert in providence ri was picketed 
by more than 400 police officers and their supporters because of a 
benefit concert he gave for a man convicted of killing two fbi 
agents in south dakota in 1975 police withdrew their pickets the 
next day after nelson said he would stage a benefit concert aug 23 
in springfield mass for both american indian and police causes

five bombs exploded in west beirut two 
days before parliament was scheduled to elect a new national 
president and druse and christian militiamen battled southeast of 
the capital police said today 
police said one person was killed and four wounded in the 
militias overnight exchange of mortars and rockets 
the violence began a few hours after former president suleiman 
franjieh a christian leader backed by syria announced tuesday he 
will run for president 
on thursday parliament planned to meet in beirut to elect a 
successor to president amin gemayel whose sixyear term expires 
sept 23 
a police spokesman said the bombs exploded late tuesday within 
two hours in five residential districts of moslem west beirut they 
caused damage but no casualties were reported 
gunmen of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist 
party and their rightwing christian foes the lebanese forces 
fought in the hills of kfarshima southeast of beirut for three 
hours 
they stopped after a committee grouping representatives of the 
various lebanese militias called a ceasefire at 315 am said 
the police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
franjieh 78 is a personal friend of syrian president hafez 
assad the lebanese forces which opposes syria urged parliament 
not to elect a man who bears grudges and whose accession to power 
would touch off the war anew 
it called for a reconciliatory president who could lead the 
nation out of its current impasse and bring about national 
entente 
the statement did not say whether the lebanese forces will fight 
to prevent the election of franjieh who was president when the 
civil war broke out in april 1975 
the war which has claimed more than 130000 lives and shattered 
the nations economy forced franjieh to request syrias military 
intervention in lebanon in 1976 
many lebanese christian leaders see franjiehs candidacy as an 
attempt by syria to extend its control over lebanon 
syria maintains about 40000 troops in northern and eastern 
lebanon and in west and south beirut 
in israel a senior government official said israel will 
withdraw its forces from southern lebanon if a strong independent 
president is elected 
a syriancontrolled president would plunge lebanon into an 
ongoing state of turmoil said uri lubrani coordinator of 
government policy on lebanon he said israel had ongoing private 
and public contacts with various groups not just its traditional 
christian allies 
israel maintains about 1000 soldiers in a selfdeclared 
security zone six to 10 miles deep in south lebanon 
lebanons 99seat parliament was elected to a fouryear term in 
1972 since then 22 deputies have died gemayels seat became 
vacant when he was elected president in 1982 leaving only 76 
surviving parliamentarians 
the civil war has prevented parliamentary elections and the 
legislature has been extending its mandate since 1976 
according to an unwritten national covenant lebanons president 
should be a maronite catholic house speaker a shiite moslem and 
prime minister a sunni moslem gemayel is forbidden by law from 
seeking a second term

a 9yearold carriage horse that collapsed on a 
manhattan street this week apparently from heat prostration has 
become something of a cause celebre whether he knows it or not 
several protestors afraid that the geldings new lease on life 
would be a short one arrived at shamrock stables on tuesday some 
carrying signs reading whitey from carriage horse to 
hamburger 
he could easily end up as dog food said peggy parker 
carriage horse action committee coordinator 
cleveland amory who writes a column about animals for the new 
york post said he offered whiteys owner anthony haught 1000 
for the animal but haught failed to show for a meeting tuesday 
we want whitey to have the rest of his life amory said 
hes suffered enough 
haught who has said he plans to send the horse to a farm in new 
jersey could not be reached for comment 
whitey was on his way back to the stables as city law requires 
when the temperature reached 90 degrees sunday he collapsed just a 
few blocks away but was revived after about two hours after he was 
hosed with water and fed intravenously 
the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
ordered whitey suspended from working for 30 days on tuesday he 
was in the stable resting and driver ed loeffler said wondering 
what the hell all the fuss is about

the father of sen dan quayle today said 
he watched his son in the chase in the hunt for the gop vice 
presidential slot but still was surprised when george bush selected 
the indiana senator 
theres no way to prepare for something like that said 
james c quayle whose 41yearold son got the nod from bush on 
tuesday as the vice president arrived at the republican national 
convention 
the senators mother corinne said she was kind of shocked 
but im not sure that i was real surprised 
her impartial assessment i thought he was a good choice 
the elder quayle interviewed with his wife on abctvs good 
morning america said of the suspense that surrounded the 
selection of their son we watched him in the chase in the hunt 
but you never know until you know 
in preceding days as dan quayles name had been bandied about 
as a potential candidate his father had rated his chances as 
slim to none 
but hours later the senators parents found their relaxed ranch 
house just north of town besieged by reporters and ringing with 
telephone calls of congratulations suddenly and unexpectedly they 
found themselves being asked to explain how theyd raised the first 
hoosier to wind up on a national ticket since wendell willkie in 
1940 
our home was like a lot of homes kind of raucous sometimes 
with four kids but it was a very normal at least i think normal 
home life ventured mrs quayle 66 
jim quayle 67 publishes the huntington heraldpress a 
newspaper he bought in 1963 from his publisher fatherinlaw the 
late eugene pulliam he describes himself as a conservative who 
wasnt sure about his sons politics when dan first went to 
washington as a member of the house 
i dont think hes as conservative as i am but i dont think 
hes made a single vote in 12 years that i would challenge the 
senior quayle said 
the residents of huntington and the rest of dan quayles 
original northeastern indiana congressional district didnt 
challenge his politics either giving him solid support in each 
election campaign 
by tuesday evening the town offered some modest early 
recognition of its favorite sons accomplishment congratulations 
dan quayle huntington is proud of you read the sign outside the 
combination bus stop and western union office congratulations 
dan quayle read another sign outside an insurance office 
nearby historical markers remember people and events little 
noted beyond the town limits one notes its position along the 
wabash and erie canal once a link between lake erie and the ohio 
river but defunct before the civil war another commemorates a 
19th century us supreme court decision while a third says the 
town was named for samuel huntington a signer of the declaration 
of independence 
dan quayle should be cautious about trying to make his own 
historical mark as the no 2 man on the ticket his father 
cautioned 
its dangerous hed better not try he said hed better 
try to figure out which way mr bush wants to go its his dictates 
that should be followed i hope dan doesnt get any ideas about 
going off on his own 
the elder quayle said he held few illusions about the power of 
the vice presidency its like reagan said about george i send 
him to all the funerals 
but he has a clear idea of why bush chose his son 
in 1986 dan quayle soundly defeated jill long in his bid for a 
second senate term his ability to draw votes against a woman may 
have caught the eye of bush advisers who worry about the vice 
presidents weak support among women said his father the 
demographics showed he pulled more womens votes than she did he 
said 
quayles youthfulness may draw still more votes his father 
said hes a baby boomer he said

former president gerald r ford today said 
his speech before the republican national convention was designed 
to meet headon the snide barbs lobbed by some democrats at 
their parley last month 
ford who came to bushs defense in an address to the convention 
tuesday night said he was angered by the democrats personal 
attacks on the vice president 
some of the peripheral speakers got a little snide he said 
in an interview on abctvs good morning america show i 
thought that was unfair and unfortunate i had to meet it headon 
ford expressed hope that the fall campaign wont turn nasty 
saying there are some legitimate substantive differences of 
opinion the question of competence the question of change you 
dont have to get into personalities to make your point 
in his address to the convention ford rebutted the chants of 
where was george from the democratic convention in atlanta 
for 45 years george bush has been at the center of the action 
in the service of this great republic ford said 
ill be damned if i will stand by and let anyone with a smirk 
and a sneer discredit the honor service accountability and 
competence of george bush 
if the democratic standardbearers in this campaign think 
it is about competence let any one of them top the 
demonstrated competence of george bush ford said 
in an echo of themes from his losing campaign against jimmy 
carter in 1976 ford asked his audience do we really want to go 
back to the days of spend and spend and tax and tax of a 
government in washington with its head in the clouds and its hand 
in your pocket 
i can put it no plainer than this this years democratic 
ticket is a tax increase on its way to happen 
in a backhanded slap at democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis ford said that sen lloyd bentsen of texas the democratic 
vice presidential candidate is pretty solid on defense matters 
but his partners cant seem to get their act together he 
said 
rhetorically addressing bentsen ford said gov dukakis says 
youll be the kind of vice president who will march into the oval 
office and tell him mr president that is a perfectly ridiculous 
policy 
ford added lloyd with all the differences between the 
democratic leaders why wait speak up now

sen dan quayle brings youth wealth golden 
good looks and a profoundly combative conservative view of the 
world to the 1988 republican presidential ticket 
quayles age 41 was the factor george bush stressed tuesday 
afternoon as he stood on the bank of the mississippi river and 
announced he would ask the republican national convention to 
nominate a man of the future to be his vice presidential 
running mate 
the indiana senator projected youthful enthusiasm and energy as 
he strode to bushs side punched the air with his fist and urged 
the soontobe republican standard bearer to go get em 
but some democrats said quayles conservatism may provide them 
with an opening to attack a record that includes his leadership 
this summer in a losing fight to defeat legislation requiring 
60days notice of plant closings and mass layoffs 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen called 
quayles selection good news 
quayle himself braced for the public scrutiny that is sure to 
follow his selection 
for every vice presidential nominee quayle said there are 
15000 journalists who want to grab him by the ankles turn him 
upside down and shake him until something bad comes out 
dan quayle his legal name is james danforth quayle was born 
in indianapolis on feb 4 1947 a birthdate that makes him the 
first member of the baby boom generation on the presidential 
ticket of a major american political party 
indianas junior republican senator is a presbyterian and a 
member of one of the nations most prominent publishing families 
the pulliams his grandfather was eugene c pulliam publisher of 
the indianapolis star and news the arizona republic and the 
phoenix gazette quayles father james c quayle is publisher of 
the huntington ind heraldpress 
quayle invoked his familys philosophy tuesday as he told 
cheering republicans many of them apparently surprised at his 
selection that my grandfather told me that there is nothing more 
important in this country than freedom 
enrolling in 1969 at depauw university alma mater of many of 
his relatives quayle waited on tables at a sorority house for 40 
a month 
after graduating from depauw in 1969 quayle went to law school 
at indiana university where he met his wife marilyn also a law 
student they married on nov 18 1972 10 weeks after their first 
date quayle received his law degree in 1974 
the couple has a 14yearold son tucker a 12yearold son 
benjamin and a 9yearold daughter corinne the two youngest 
children were born after quayle began his first congressional 
campaign in 1976 winning election to the house where he was to 
serve indianas 4th congressional district for two terms 
five months into his second house term quayle challenged 
indianas most prominent democrat sen birch bayh a veteran 
incumbent 
on election day 1980 quayle ended bayhs political career 
winning by a margin of 166000 votes 54 percent of the total 
six years later as democrats were reclaiming the senate 
majority they lost in ronald reagans 1980 landslide quayle bucked 
the tide and crushed his poorly financed opponent taking 61 
percent of the vote 
it was in his campaign against birch bayh that quayle acquired 
what he still dubs his stigma 
voters and the indiana press compared his handsome features 
and blowdried hair to the moviestar good looks of a movie star 
robert redford 
asked about the comparison this week quayle brushed his sandy 
blond hair with an impatient sweep of his hand and said ive had 
that stigma ever since i first ran for the senate id rather 
talk about what i stand for than what i look like 
quayle tried to erase that glamor boy image by immersing himself 
in his work 
but in eight years in the senate he has only rarely appeared at 
the edge of the national spotlight never attaining the level of 
recognition and peer respect accorded his senior colleague sen 
richard lugar rind the former chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee 
but he has made a mark on the three senate committees on which 
he serves armed forces budget and labor and human resources 
on the armed services committee quayle made himself a 
specialist in the nato alliance he strongly supported president 
reagans spacebased missile defense system popularly known as star 
wars a few weeks ago he successfully urged the president to veto 
this years defense authorization bill because of its restrictions 
on administration arms control policies 
quayle does not shy from the intricacies of defense policy he 
has mastered such matters as troop strength weapons performance 
and soviet military doctrine 
he attended virtually all of the panels exhaustive hearings 
into the details of the mediumrange missile treaty between the 
united states and the soviet union expressing great skepticism 
even though it had been negotiated by a conservative president 
quayle eventually joined the 935 majority voting to ratify the 
pact 
in the labor committee and on the senate floor quayle was a 
leader in the reagan administrations fight against raising the 
minimum wage as well as the plant closing bill 
speaking with reporters tuesday quayle said his children were 
divided 2to1 on whether their father should plunge into the vice 
presidential race 
he said tucker quayle was fascinated by the idea while benjamin 
quayle was persuaded by the thought that the secret service agents 
protecting the family might help him with his homework 
but corinne quayle didnt like the idea of having her father 
away from home for long periods 
quayle said she told him daddy i really hope george bush 
picks bob dole

dan quayle selected for the no 2 spot on the 
republican presidential ticket could well be one of the wealthiest 
members of congress but the indiana senator lists as his only 
substantial asset newspaper stock valued at 250000 and above 
if quayles stock in the familycontrolled central newspapers 
inc headquartered in indianapolis were worth 250000 or so he 
would not be among the estimated onethird of senators who are 
millionaires 
but federal law requires financial disclosure by members of 
congress and other officials of only broad categories the highest 
category for assets is 250000 and above whether the asset 
is worth 250001 or more than 500 million 
in addition the laws do not require that the actual value of an 
asset be listed thus quayles statement uses book value for the 
newspaper stock which probably understates its value dramatically 
the 41yearold quayle is reputed to be in line to inherit 
several million dollars worth of stock in the newspaper group 
whose holdings include the indianapolis star and indianapolis news 
in indiana and the arizona republic and phoenix gazette in arizona 
his uncle eugene pulliam is publisher of the newspapers 
the senators financial disclosure statement also lists his wife 
as owning a block of central stock with a book value of 100001 
to 250000 
except for the stock in central newspapers quayles only 
holdings last year were two retirement accounts totaling a maximum 
of 65000 a bank account worth up to 15000 and an account in 
the house of representatives credit union of 1000 to 5000 
quayle still holds the title of vice president and associate 
publisher of his hometown paper the familyrun huntington ind 
heraldpress that papers owner huntington newspapers inc paid 
him 2625 in directors fees last year he reported 
he listed three growthoriented mutual fund accounts in the 
names of his children totaling up to 45000 and a bank account 
in the childrens names worth between 1000 and 5000 
like most other members of the senate quayle received thousands 
of dollars last year for making speeches to various 
specialinterest groups his honoraria which totaled 49255 came 
from such diverse sources as the health industry manufacturers

rain poured down on the capital today and 
the nile rose higher as the city tried to cope with the worst 
flooding in its history 
news reports today said an additional 21 people died in 
accidents caused by the floods bringing the total known death toll 
to more than 90 
torrential rains aug 45 left 15 million to 2 million people 
homeless as thousands of mud huts melted in the refugee camps that 
ring this desert city 
in khartoum alone 70 people died 213 were injured and nearly 
115000 houses were destroyed by the flooding egypts stateowned 
middle east news agency quoted amin abdellatif sudans ambassador 
to cairo as saying tuesday 
the agency said today that 18 sudanese drowned when their ferry 
overturned in fast currents on the rahad river the river is a 
tributary of the blue nile which joins the white nile at khartoum 
to form the nile river 
in omdurman across the nile from khartoum the agency said 
three children were killed and dozens injured when a house 
collapsed because of the flood 
in northern sudan 99 islands were submerged and their 60000 
inhabitants moved to safe locations and 21 villages were washed 
away and the 12000 families who lived there were left homeless 
abdellatif said 
he said there were no figures on total casualties and damages 
because the floods isolated so many places 
sudanese finance minister omar nour dayem earlier estimated 
damages were around 200 million and that up to 2 million people 
were homeless 
the crisis could worsen with the beginning of the niles annual 
flooding heavy rains in ethiopia source of the blue nile have 
produced a plentiful flood after eight years of drought 
officials dont know whether the nile will flood the city parts 
of which are already isolated by vast pools of stagnant water and 
roads that have become impassable tracks of mud 
the nile waters have already started seeping into houses along 
its banks in the capital and many residents have evacuated their 
homes for higher ground 
the egyptian agency quoted sudanese irrigation minister mahmoud 
beshir gamma as saying several areas in the north were threatened 
with river flooding he said they included the large towns of 
atbara damer berber and dongola 
gamma also said floods caused by heavy rains in the western 
province of kordofan washed away many houses and left 15000 
families homeless 
the middle east news agency said the large croprich island of 
tuti in the nile between khartoum and its twin city om durman was 
almost submerged 
the agency quoted travelers coming from central sudan and the 
gezira region as saying the annual flood submerged large areas of 
land and left 55000 people destitute 
gezira contains the countrys richest agricultural lands which 
are mostly planted with cotton one of the sudans most important 
exports losing the cotton crop would add to the countrys economic 
woes 
the world health organization in khartoum has warned of 
waterborne epidemics that could kill thousands of peasants mostly 
children who are cut off from supplies of clean water 
about 90 planes have brought food medicine tents and other 
supplies into khartoum from all over the world but sudanese 
authorities have had difficulty distributing the aid

a highspeed passenger train caught fire and 
derailed killing 17 people on a trip from leningrad to moscow 
soviet media said today 
fire engulfed the restaurant car and quickly spread to the 
entire line of sleeping cars tuesday evening about midway between 
the soviet unions two largest cities said the government evening 
newspaper izvestia 
it said that by noon today 17 people were dead and 106 
hospitalized it said children were among the fatalities but did 
not say how many 
the moscowleningrad route is one of the busiest in the soviet 
union and the trains are usually full 
the train was carrying 760 passengers when it crashed about 190 
miles north of the capital said anatoly n sobin director of the 
leningrad railway station in moscow 
he told the associated press in a telephone interview that 95 of 
the injured were hospitalized in two towns near the scene of the 
accident bologoye and vyshny volochok 
sobin said he did not know the exact death toll from the crash 
but said it was not as deadly as a june 4 explosion aboard a 
freight train in the city of arzamas 240 miles east of moscow 
that blast killed nearly 100 people wounded 200 and forced the 
evacuation of 700 families 
the official tass news agency said the moscowbound aurora 
passenger train left the tracks between the berezaika and 
poplavenets stations at 634 pm tuesday izvestia said 15 cars 
derailed 
the cause of the fire and the exact point where it broke out 
were still under investigation but it began shortly before the 
train derailed izvestia said previous reports suggested the fire 
broke out after the train derailed 
the newspaper said firefighting equipment could not approach the 
burning cars fast enough because they derailed in swampland it 
also said the first railway water tanker sent to the scene turned 
out to be empty and had to be refilled before it could be used by 
firefighters 
residents of nearby villages soldiers and civilian emergency 
workers rushed to the scene to evacuate the injured and help others 
contact relatives izvestia said 
traffic on the moscowleningrad route was restored by this 
morning and an investigation team was set up and led by a deputy 
chairman of the council of ministers vladimir gusev tass said 
disaster reports by soviet media are still slow in appearing and 
often lacking in important details but todays accounts of the 
fatal train derailment less than 24 hours earlier reflect the 
closer watch soviet media have been keeping on public matters under 
communist party chief mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness on selected subjects

beachgoers on the sweltering east coast 
have been surprised to run smack into cold waves along the 
midatlantic coast 
waters from virginia to new jersey are unexpectedly cold and 
lifeguards at the assateague island national seashore in maryland 
report the coldest ocean temperatures in 20 years 
the chilly waters have frequently forced bathers out of the 
water said larry g points the parks chief naturalist 
in chincoteague va water temperatures plunged to 58 degrees 
during the annual wild pony roundup last month at least 12 degrees 
below the normal temperature range 
satellite photographs show a band of unusually cold water 
extending from just south of long island along the new jersey coast 
to virginia beach and norfolk va said dorothy kropp a national 
weather service meteorologist in camp springs md 
scientists blame the subnormal water temperatures on 
upwelling a natural phenomenon in which warm water is blown 
offshore by the wind and replaced by colder water from the ocean 
bottom 
its nothing new but its usually not noticeable on the 
eastern seaboard said james a eberwine a national weather 
service forecaster in atlantic city nj on the july 4 weekend 
we had water temperatures in the 50s we had to put out an alert

north korea today said it would meet 
with south korean delegates friday to prepare for a joint 
parliamentary session on a nonaggression pact and the norths 
demand to cohost the olympics 
south koreas national assembly said north koreas supreme 
peoples assembly agreed in a telephone message to send five 
delegates to the truce village of panmunjom on friday it would be 
the first time in nearly three years that the two koreas have met 
facetoface 
both sides last met in december 1985 at red cross talks at 
panmunjom but the north shelved all interkorea dialogue in early 
1986 to protest regular joint military exercises between south 
korea and the united states 
the latest peace overtures began july 21 when the north 
proposed that a joint session of the parliaments draft a 
nonaggression pact it later proposed that they discuss the 
olympics which open sept 17 in seoul 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics unless it is 
allowed to cohost them south korea and international olympic 
officials have rejected the demand because the games are awarded 
only to one city 
north korea had proposed the meeting for today but the south 
suggested moving it to friday so it wouldnt interfere with 
celebrations marking 30 days before the olympics begin 
an assembly source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
norths message today did not mention its earlier demand for 
fullfledged parliamentary talks the two sides have disagreed over 
the norths demand to include representatives of all walks of life 
in the main legislative conference 
the north also insists fridays meeting should discuss only 
logistical arrangements for main talks but the south wants to take 
up all basic and procedural matters including the agenda and the 
size of full negotiations 
the disagreement cast doubts on the prospects of full 
parliamentary talks between the two koreas which were divided in 
1945 at the end of world war ii and which fought the korean war 
from 1950 to 1953 
some south korean government officials said north korea may have 
agreed to the preliminary talks in an attempt to stir unrest before 
the olympics or to find an excuse to boycott the olympics 
but south koreas opposition parties welcomed the norths 
agreement 
we hope the southnorth parliamentary talks would provide an 
opportunity for realizing national unification said a message 
from the main opposition party for peace and democracy 
the proposed parliamentary talks could involve nearly 600 
lawmakers from communist north korea and capitalist south korea 
the norths offiical korean central news agency in a report 
monitored in tokyo said the norths delegation to fridays talks 
would be headed by chon gum chol representative of the communist 
workers party and the supreme peoples assembly 
south koreas national assembly has named park joonkyu a 
senior member of the governing democratic justice party to head 
its fivemember delegation which also includes members of the 
three main opposition parties and one other member of the governing 
party 
on tuesday north korea rejected the international olympic 
committees latest compromise proposal that the two koreas march 
sidebyside at the opening and closing ceremonies 
north korea sees the awarding of the games to seoul and a 
successful staging of the olympiad as a major victory for its 
rival it also has argued that letting seoul alone host the games 
will bring world recognition of a divided korean peninsula and 
further delay reunification

that a 6yearold aids victim stay inside a glass booth if she 
attends a school for handicapped children 
steve hanlon attorney for rosa martinez said he filed notice 
of appeal tuesday taking the case to the 11th us circuit court 
of appeals in atlanta he said he doubts the matter could be 
resolved before school starts aug 29 
we were hopeful the judges solution might work hanlon 
said but after talking with pediatric and psychological experts 
people whose judgments we respect a great deal we are convinced 
it would be very harmful even to the extent of affecting her 
immune system 
mrs martinez filed suit last year saying she wanted her 
adopted daughter eliana to be in a classroom setting 
last week us district judge elizabeth kovachevich ruled that 
the hillsborough county school board must admit the mentally 
handicapped child to manhattan exceptional center 
the child was to remain inside a plexiglass enclosure until she 
became toilettrained and learned to stop sucking her thumb and 
forefingers according to the order 
school officials had wanted to have the girl instructed at home 
doctors believe eliana contracted from multiple blood 
transfusions following her premature birth in puerto rico

beating injuries today in the gaza strip hospital officials said 
during a palestinian general strike to protest israeli rule of the 
occupied lands 
the army said it could not immediately confirm any injury 
reports 
israel deported four palestinians from the occupied gaza strip 
to lebanon today said police in rachaiya lebanon the move 
brought to 33 the number of deportees since an arab uprising 
against israeli rule began eight months ago

treated today for beating injuries most of the injuries were 
bruises and contusions dr ahmed yazeji chief surgeon at shifa 
said in an interview 
yazeji said the bruises appeared to be caused by beatings with 
clubs and rifle butts and kicking with heavy military boots 
he said 90 percent of the victims said they were beaten in their 
homes by troops looking for suspected stonethrowers after a surge 
of violence in gaza 
troops shot and wounded two palestinians in gaza today and they 
were treated at the nearby ahli arab hospital officials at the 
hospital said 
in refugee camp no 1 near the occupied west bank city of 
nablus soldiers opened fire on arab stonethrowers today wounding

hospital 
under the general strike call many of the 110000 palestinians 
who work in israel boycotted their jobs arabowned shops and 
businesses were closed in at least a dozen towns and cities in the 
occupied lands

leaders of the uprising it said the strike was in honor of 
jerusalem the capital of our palestinian state and to protest 
oppressive measures and arrests 
israel says about 5000 palestinians have been jailed since the 
revolt began about half without trial

south of the gaza strip by hundreds of palestinian prisoners the 
army said two palestinians were shot to death in the riot and a 
third was wounded but it refused to elaborate saying the riot was

house speaker jim wright dtexas whose ethics have been 
scrutinized recently because he accepted a highly questionable fee 
from a book publisher has joined rep dan rostenkowski in 
proposing an outright prohibition on honorariums 
congress has seen fit to prohibit members of the executive

effect in the persian gulf ending one of the most brutal wars of

both iran and iraq claim victory but both are losers 
the bloody war was fought largely without any foreign observers 
but it is believed 1 million soldiers were killed and perhaps twice 
that number wounded rocket attacks on cities claimed thousands of 
civilian lives 
the cost in dollars is nearly as staggering at least 200 
billion in economic loss 
all for what purpose none that we know of 
the leaders of iran and iraq are guilty of attempted genocide 
that took terrible tolls but they never will be brought to trial 
since iran and iraq continue to proclaim victory in ignorance

the oppositions outcry only hands universal pictures a golden 
platter full of publicity 
equally troubling the calls for boycott and bans before the 
films release touch the raw nerve of censorship 
prior censorship violates the first amendmentprotected right of 
free speech an amendment all churches have an abiding interest in 
upholding the first amendment also provides for religious freedom

the brainerd minn daily dispatch on the last temptation of 
christ 
seldom has a movie received harsher criticism prior to its 
release than the last temptation of christ directed by martin 
scorsese 
the film has been labeled blasphemous by a number of religious 
groups most conspicuously fundamentalists for its portrayal of 
jesus 
in the most controversial scene jesus suffering agony on the 
cross imagines what life would have been like had he lived as a 
normal man in this delirium he is shown engaging in sex 
no doubt behind the public breastbeating of most religious 
critics lies sincere moral outrage 
these peoples opinions should be acknowledged and respected 
however they must be reminded that the same constitution that 
guarantees them freedom of religion also provides freedom of 
expression 
those who wish to experience the pictures message should be 
allowed to do so in peace those who dont should stay home and 
read the bible which is how christs message was meant to be 
conveyed in the first place

order requiring that independent prosecutors be appointed to 
investigate criminal allegations against members of congress 
attorney general richard thornburgh is the man who during the 
ford administration headed the criminal division of the justice 
department 
independent prosecutors are meant to step in when a conflict of 
interest might otherwise result in the course of an investigation 
but edwin meese himself dogged by two independent prosecutors 
ordered a broader use 
on his last day in office he signed an order requiring the 
appointment of a special prosecutor whenever serious allegations of 
wrongdoing are made against members of congress 
given no need for such a change it appears that congressional

costa rican president oscar arias continues to try to earn his 
1987 nobel peace prize but he gets precious little help from 
either side of the ideological wars of central america 
his latest contribution is an open acknowledgement that cubas 
role in the peace process must be commensurate with its role in the 
war 
president arias has used the occasion of ecuadors presidential 
inauguration to discuss the subject with fidel castro he reports 
that the cuban leaders response was moderate and constructive 
thats important because the costa rican president holds cubas 
client the nicaraguan government responsible for the breakdown of 
peace negotiations this summer 
for now oscar arias is the only major player who focuses on the 
fact that young boys are dying on both sides of nicaraguas 
fratricidal war and el salvadors as well 
he hopes to stop the killing and he is willing to talk with 
anyone from ronald reagan to fidel castro in pursuit of a peace 
that freedomloving central americans can accept

albuquerque nm journal on naming lauro cavazos as education 
secretary 
democrats got to have their cake and bash it too last week as 
president reagan nominated lauro f cavazos the 61yearold 
president of texas tech university and health science center in 
lubbock to replace secretary of education william bennett 
democrats got a nominee they can be happy with but they also 
got a selection they can bash as a cynical attempt to improve 
george bushs election hopes by naming a hispanic to a cabinet 
level position for the first time 
of course theres no advantage to a cynical move exposed as 
such that allows people across the political spectrum who are 
vitally concerned with education to focus on cavazos not the 
circumstances surrounding his nomination 
there are many who could run the department of education as 
competently but perhaps none so suited to tackle a critical 
dilemma of the us system its failure to engage hold and uplift 
the educational norm of minorities

uniontown pa heraldstandard on lead in drinking water 
the environmental protection agency proposed rules governing 
the amount of lead in drinking water for americans 
costs to consumers could run extremely high those getting water 
from smaller systems could see water bill increases of 367 per 
year 
epas action helps many to avoid the health hazards associated 
with lead in their water most families will be pleased by this 
but for many families especially those on lower or fixed 
incomes we must ask how these families are to pay water bills 
hundreds of dollars more each year when many cant afford to 
properly feed their young 
environmentalists are right in seeking lead reduction in water 
at the tap but to force families to replace plumbing systems would 
be a tremendous burden to many 
epa took some good first steps evaluating them within a 
reasonable time will help determine if additional lead restrictions 
are needed

daily news los angeles on the uscontra policy 
the senates democrats have just managed to wriggle out of a 
vote on military aid to the nicaraguan contras thereby sparing 
themselves the unpleasantness of having to take a clear and 
meaningful stand 
the senate narrowly decided wednesday aug 10 to continue us 
policy of sending nearworthless care packages food medicine and 
the like to those foes of the sandinista government 
while the contras technically get another crack at military 
supplies next month there is scant hope that congress will approve 
contra arms funding during the remaining five months of the reagan 
presidency 
thus the civil war between the contras and the marxist 
sandinistas may indeed be over depending on who wins the 
presidential election but even under a presumably procontra bush 
administration it might already be too late

the chattanooga tenn times on the iraniraq ceasefire 
the iraniraq ceasefire to begin on aug 20 is the essential 
first step down what can be expected to be a difficult road to 
peace in the persian gulf 
it also comes as additional and welcome evidence that the 
united nations can play an effective peacemaking role in the world 
the united nations could do little to forge solutions to 
regional conflicts when it was paralyzed by constant disputes 
between the united states and the soviet union 
but where there has been mutual superpower willingness to 
support un efforts the organization has proved its value 
even as the un enlarges its peacemaking role however it 
faces crippling fiscal constraints 
they are caused primarily by the refusal of the united states to 
pay its dues and its share of the cost of un peacekeeping 
operations 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan who sponsored legislation 
witholding full payment of un dues believes the time has now 
come for the united states to shoulder our responsibility for 
un funding

authorities have recommended that village public 
libraries remove from their shelves political and economic 
literature published before soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev took 
power an official said today 
the government newspaper izvestia in a letter attributed to a 
librarian referred to the move as an order 
but leonid bely director of the state culture agency in the 
crimea said today that the directive from the central ministry of 
culture in moscow was only a recommendation and was not politically 
motivated 
its for the cleaning out of the book fund bely said in a 
telephone interview from simferopol the crimean administrative 
center 
izvestia published the letter tuesday attributed to a librarian 
in the crimea a region of the ukraine saying libraries were 
ordered to remove works by former soviet leader leonid i brezhnev 
and other top officials now in disgrace 
the author complained that the order would create new blank 
spots or gaps in the soviet historical record 
but bely said no woman by the name given as the author in 
izvestia i zavgordnyaya worked in the crimeas libraries 
he said library workers were called to a meeting in may at which 
cultural officials recommended outdated political and economic 
literature be transferred from village to city and regional 
libraries the village libraries are becoming overstocked and do 
not have room for outdated materials and new works with little 
demand bely said 
he said the suggestion applied to village libraries throughout 
the soviet union 
the letter in izvestia said the directive suggested that library 
workers they tell people asking for the removed materials that they 
are all on loan the letter said it included works by former soviet 
leaders brezhnev and konstantin u chernenko and a series of 
other authors 
the letter did not say who issued the order and did not say 
whether it applied to public libraries throughout the soviet union 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said he was 
surprised by the letter and had heard of no order like the one 
mentioned 
but he said the action sounded like a local initiative by 
officials who were doing more than necessary to set the country 
on the right course 
he cited a russian proverb to say that some local officials were 
incompetent make a fool bow and he will be sure to knock his 
head 
brezhnevs rule from 1964 to his death in 1982 has been 
criticized as plagued by corruption cronyism and nepotism he and 
his aides have also been blamed for covering up the countrys 
problems and repressing independent political and cultural thinkers 
chernenko ruled from february 1984 until his death in march 1985 
according to the izvestia letter the order covered outdated 
material from 1961 until the march 1985 session at which gorbachev 
was named party general secretary 
the order seems to go against the new trend of taking the wraps 
off materials that were closed to the public for many years the 
letter said 
wouldnt this mean that while opening access to archival 
materials of a halfcentury ago we are creating new blank spots in 
our most recent history said the letter 
gorbachev under his policy of glasnost or openness has 
encouraged a more accurate and honest examination of soviet 
history he has called for elimination of blank spots taboo 
subjects such as the repressions of soviet dictator josef stalin 
as a result of the review stalin has been criticized for 
creating a cult of personality and brezhnevs tenure has been 
branded a period of stagnation 
before gorbachev almost every other soviet leader has 
encouraged the suppression of books and other works that deal with 
policies people or events that have fallen out of favor

president hosni mubarak agreed that the plo 
should establish a provisional palestinian government in the 
israelioccupied territories a senior plo official said 
mahmoud abbas a member of the plo executive committee spoke on 
egypt television tuesday night after meeting mubarak in alexandria 
he led a highranking palestine liberation organization delegation 
that arrived in cairo on monday 
we and president mubarak reached the conclusion that the plo 
should offer through a provisional government a political program 
that would be internationally acceptable said abbas also known 
as abumazen 
he said the political program would explain to the world the 
rational and logical plo objectives so as to corner the enemies of 
our peoples independence and selfdetermination 
he apparently referred to israel whose prime minister yitzhak 
shamir opposes palestinian selfdetermination that might lead to 
the creation of an independent palestinian state 
plo officials have said a provisonal government would be ready 
to recognize israel in exchange for israels recognition of a 
palestinian state in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the plo reportedly is debating whether to declare a state in the 
occupied lands home to about 15 million palestinians it is also 
considering whether to establish a provisional government or a 
governmentinexile 
these options were brought up after jordans decision this month 
to hand to the plo full responsibility for the west bank and gaza 
asked when an announcement of a palestinian government could be 
made abbas said this is premature because we cannot announce a 
governemnt before we have shaped its program and presented it to 
the palestine national council 
the council combining representatives from all plo factions is 
the legislative arm that makes all major policy decisions it is 
expected to meet in algeria next month

summer fun todays deputy news editor alastair martin said of 
the story about the mystery pilot nicknamed le baron or black 
baron 
we werent fooled but a whole lot of other people obviously 
have been martin said in a telephone interview

murdoch ran the fake story over an entire inside page along with 
a picture of a man dressed as a pilot standing beside a light

two gunmen today entered a 
grocery store and shot its 44yearold owner who later died in a 
hospital police said 
frederick otley was working in a rear storeroom of his store in 
a protestant section of belfast when the gunmen entered and asked 
for the owner when otley appeared they shot him several times and 
fled police said 
the irish national liberation army an extreme marxist offshoot 
of the irish republican army claimed responsibility for the 
shooting in a statement to the british broadcasting corp in 
belfast 
but the irish news a belfast newspaper said it received a 
statement claiming responsibility from the irish revolutionary 
brigade a group previously unheard of in northern ireland 
both news organizations said the statements they received were 
accompanied by authenticating passwords 
in 1985 otley was accused by an informer of terrorist crimes on 
behalf of the protestant paramilitary ulster volunteer force and 
was charged with a bombing at a social club which was meant to kill 
a force member during an interorganization feud 
the charges were dropped when the informer retracted his 
statement 
the british domestic agency press association reported that the 
murder may have been in retaliation for protestant guerrillas 
killings of two catholics last week in belfast 
seamus morris 18 and peter dolan 25 were gunned down in a 
shopping center in broad daylight in the catholic ardoyne area of 
north belfast the protestant action force reportedly linked with

dan quayle the soontobe republican vice 
presidential nominee refused today to discuss details of the 
florida golfing vacation he and two other congressman had with 
paula parkinson in january 1980 
that has been covered and there is nothing to it quayle 
told reporters at a joint news conference with george bush who 
will head the gop presidential ticket 
asked whether he had seen mrs parkinson on any other occasion 
quayle replied no 
quayle now the junior senator from indiana was one of three 
house members who shared a cottage with mrs parkinson a lobbyist 
who had claimed that she had sexual encounters with fewer than a 
dozen republican house members 
quayle has denied that he had an affair with mrs parkinson and 
bush aides believe that he has been effectively cleared of any 
wrongdoing in the parkinson scandal 
bushs new campaign chief james a baker iii said tuesday 
thats been looked into and theres absolutely nothing to it 
charles black another bush adviser echoed in this case to 
my knowledge the allegations already been shot down 
the justice department conducted in inquiry ayle selected for the 
no 2 spot on the 
republican presidential ticket could well be one of the wealthiest 
members of congress but the indiana senator lists as his only 
substantial asset newspaper stock valued at 250000 and above 
if quayles stock in the familycontrolled central newspapers 
inc headquartered in indianapolis were worth 250000 or so he 
would not be among the estimated onethird of senators who are 
millionaires 
but federal law requires financial disclosure by members of 
congress and other officials of only broad categories the highest 
category for assets is 250000 and above whether the asset 
is worth 250001 or more than 500 million 
in addition the laws do not require that the actual value of an 
asset be listed thus quayles statement uses book value for the 
newspaper stock which probably understates its value dramatically 
at a news conference wednesday morning quayle was asked about 
reports that his net worth totaled 200 million 
that figure is not correct quayle said and believe me 
you have caused me a lot of problems at home because my wife has 
asked me about that 
vice president george bush standing at quayles side added to 
the kidding why do you think i chose him he said 
quayle said he would make a full financial disclosure in a 
reasonable period of time bush who released 10 years of his tax 
records early in the primary campaign said we will challenge 
the democrats to release 10 years of tax records lay it out on 
the table 
the 41yearold quayle is reputed to be in line to inherit 
several million dollars worth of stock in the newspaper group 
whose holdings include the indianapolis star and indianapolis news 
in indiana and the arizona republic and phoenix gazette in arizona 
his uncle eugene pulliam is publisher of the newspapers 
the senators financial disclosure statement also lists his wife 
as owning a block of central stock with a book value of 100001 
to 250000 
except for the stock in central newspapers quayles only 
holdings last year were two retirement accounts totaling a maximum 
of 65000 a bank account worth up to 15000 and an account in 
the house of representatives credit union of 1000 to 5000 
quayle still holds the title of vice president and associate 
publisher of his hometown paper the familyrun huntington ind 
heraldpress that papers owner huntington newspapers inc paid 
him 2625 in directors fees last year he reported 
he listed three growthoriented mutual fund accounts in the 
names of his children totaling up to 45000 and a bank account 
in the childrens names worth 1000 to 5000 
like most other members of the senate quayle received thousands 
of dollars last year for making speeches to various 
specialinterest groups his honoraria which totaled 49255 came 
from such diverse sources as the health industry manufacturers 
association and the national stone association 
the indiana senator wrote several articles for pay including 
two for 40 each that he sold to the indianapolis papers he wrote 
a 1000 article for the army amp navy journal in washington 
to meet senate limitations on income from honoraria he donated 
14302 of the earnings to charity 
quayle is a member of the senates budget armed services and 
labor and human resources committees several of his paid speeches 
were to groups with a direct interest in the work of those 
committees a common practice among members of congress 
for example on march 18 1987 he was paid 2000 each for 
speeches to the national committee for quality health care based 
in washington and voluntary hospitals of america inc in irving 
texas general electric co a prime defense contractor paid him 
2000 for a speech on april 9 
quayle an avid golfer listed among his income last year a 250 
trophy for participating in the monterey peninsula golf tournament 
gifts he received included less than 200 worth of golf apparel for 
himself and his wife marilyn for participating in the pebble 
beach national proam tournament and 288 worth of golf 
merchandise from the kemper open in potomac md 
the most expensive gift received by quayle was 825 worth of 
golf merchandise from indiana pro fuzzy zoeller 
quayle and his wife were reimbursed by atampt a sponsor of the 
monterey tournament for a roundtrip flight to the california 
tournament he also listed reimbursements for travel to charity 
skiing competitions in utah and idaho and from the us telephone 
association abbott laboratories electronic industries association 
and the pharmaceutical manufacturers association for trips to 
phoenix waukegan ill ft myers fla and white sulphur 
springs wva

the truth about the political opposition he said 
bush said he tapped the 41yearold quayle to run with him 
because he is one of the rising young stars of the republican 
party 
with quayle standing at his side bush said yes hes young 
but also qualified to be one heartbeat away from the 
president 
i believe he will help our case in every part of the country 
because he understands that whats important is not only what weve 
accomplished but what we will accomplish bush said 
bush bristled when he was asked about criticism over his 
introduction of his three mexicanamerican grandchildren on tuesday 
as the little brown ones 
i find it personally offensive and ps i dont want to see 
these kids hurt he said his voice rising bush added i dont 
like it and this is my family and im going to protect them 
this heart knows nothing but pride and love for those children and 
youre going to see them with me every inch of the way 
there was a lighter moment as well at the first news conference 
by the republican ticket 
when quayle was asked about reports that he was worth a few 
hundred million dollars bush stepped to the microphone and said 
why do you think i picked him quayle said estimates of his 
wealth were vastly exaggerated 
the vice president opened his news conference with an 
announcement that pakistani president mohammad zia ulhaq and us 
ambassador arnold l raphel had been killed in an aircraft 
explosion in pakistan 
pakistan and the us have a very special relationship and the 
loss of gen zia is a great tragedy bush said he hailed raphel 
as an outstanding ambassador 
i knew him well said bush who has sought to make his 
experience in foreign policy an important ingredient in his 
campaign 
bush said he and quayle would each be campaigning across the 
entire country aides said they would head for quayles home state 
of indiana when they left the republican convention city on friday 
and would make a joint campaign swing over the weekend 
behind in the polls bush said were going to tell the truth 
and its going to seem like theyve engaged a couple of pit bulls 
bush and quayle met reporters in their nationally televised news 
conference after the vice president paid an early morning visit to 
the superdome to check out the hall where he will deliver his 
acceptance speech on thursday night 
bush joked from the podium banging the gavel and listening to 
the echoes as he repeatedly called the mostly empty convention hall 
to order 
earlier he had said the goal of his convention speech would be 
to show how i want to lead this country what my 
qualifications for leading the country are he said the speech 
would include some specifics some competence matters but i 
also think ideology counts 
i feel comfortable with what weve got now he said of the 
speech he has prepared and added that his wife barbara did not 
fall asleep when he tried it out on her 
democratic nominee michael dukakis had confessed that his wife 
kitty dozed off while reading an advance copy of his acceptance 
speech in atlanta last month 
bushs morning visit to the superdome was to familiarize himself 
with the podium and teleprompter system he told reporters he 
believes he can deliver a speech better with a prompting device 
than without one 
meanwhile the convention was buzzing about the selection of 
quayle many called it a surprising choice because quayle lacks 
the congressional track record and high profile of some of the more 
prominent people bush had considered 
but bushs new campaign chairman james baker said tuesday that 
the selection of the 41yearold quayle represents a bold stroke 
across generations 
hes the first babyboomer on a national ticket baker said 
this man is a man of the future he is a leader for the 
future he is an excellent campaigner baker told a news 
conference 
bush said he decided on quayle on tuesday morning before coming 
to new orleans he announced the selection at a welcoming rally on 
the banks of the mississippi river after a flashy arrival aboard a 
sternwheel riverboat 
the vice president had flown from washington aboard air force 
two to a naval base on the other side of the river 
the boyishlooking lighthaired quayle then bounded to the 
stage to join bush and proclaim lets go get em 
bush made the news public after telephoning the other potential 
nominees he had considered and sought personal and financial data 
from aides said the word leaked as bush was steaming across the 
river 
before crossing the river bush had a brief encounter with 
president reagan at the belle chasse naval air station as the 
president left new orleans and bush arrived 
when the two were about to go their separate ways bush 
whispered into the presidents ear aides later said he was 
confiding that the choice was quayle and that reagan was the first 
person the vice president told the second person he told was mrs 
bush said campaign press secretary sheila tate

whether the trust arrangement complies with federal law now that he 
is a candidate for vice president 
i have decided to open my trust so that not only the office 
but anyone who cares to may learn of my holdings i enclose a 
public report of the list of assets to be distributed together

worth exceeds 10 million

houston and founded an insurance company that later became a 
financial holding company 
bentsens records show gross earnings of 604587 and taxes of

exception of a slight elevation of systolic blood pressure to 148 
and two small lesions on the skin 
a followup examination found bentsens blood pressure was normal 
and the skin lesions had disappeared 
gotto told bentsen in a letter released as part of the report 
that he had a cholesterol count of 245 
in october government guidelines said that cholesterol counts 
of 245 milligrams per decaliter are considered high risk 
gotto said in the letter that after bentsen used a low dose of 
lovastatin a drug to lower cholesterol for about one month the 
cholesterol level was reduced to 200 a level the government 
guidelines say is desirable 
i am very pleased with this response to the medication as well 
as with the overall state of your health gotto said

vice president george bush today defended his 
description of his three mexicanamerican grandchildren as the 
little brown ones saying this heart knows nothing but pride 
and love for the children 
for anyone to suggest that that comment of pride is anything 
other than what it was i find it personally offensive bush said 
at a news conference with his running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana 
bush on tuesday introduced his grandchildren to president reagan 
at a brief airport meeting 
these are jebbys kids from florida the little brown ones 
the vice president said 
the three youngsters jeb jr noelle and george p are the 
children of bushs son jeb and his mexicanborn wife columba 
those grandchildren are my pride and joy and when i say pride 
i mean it bush said today 
i dont want to see these kids hurt and they werent hurt by 
what i said and if theyre hurt by misinterpretation that isnt 
fair and i dont like it he said 
this is my family and im going to protect them this heart 
knows nothing but pride and love for those three children and 
youre going to see them with me every inch of the way 
bushs little brown ones comment drew a mixed reaction among 
hispanic americans 
roy barrera jr a hispanic delegate to the republican national 
convention from san antonio texas said bushs comment was a 
remark of sincere affection that shouldnt be taken out of 
context 
all my discussions with the bushes has led me to believe that 
george bush cherishes the uniqueness of his family has an 
overwhelming love and affection for his grandchildren jebs 
children said barrera who accompanied the bush family on their 
riverboat ride on tuesday 
the former district judge said there is nothing at all vulgar 
or insidious or disrespectful about being brown or being black it 
is simply just a description 
in los angeles al belmontez vice president of one of the local 
labor chapters of the mexicanamerican political association said 
bushs remark reflected insensitivity 
just saying that means he knows theyre different he didnt 
say those are my grandchildren he didnt just refer to the kids 
by their names belmontez said in a telephone interview that 
just shows that hes insensitive 
belmontez said it was unlikely the remark would affect bushs 
standing with members of his own party 
republicans will support him no matter what belmontez said 
treasury secretary james a baker iii bushs campaign chairman 
told reporters the vice president is extremely proud of the fact 
that his grandchildren are 50 percent hispanic 
bush has often bragged about the family which lives in 
tallahassee fla 
george p bush 13 gave the pledge of allegiance at tuesdays 
session of the convention

mohammed zia ulhaq who seized power 
in military coup 11 years ago and became pakistans longest serving 
president ruled with an iron hand that bore the stamp of islam 
zia a strong us ally died today when his military plane 
exploded just after taking off from bahawalpur 330 miles southwest 
of islamabad he was 64 
the career military officer strongly supported afghan guerrillas 
in their struggle against the sovietbacked marxist government of 
afghanistan recently the soviets told him to stop allowing arms 
for the rebels to pass through pakistan while the soviets withdraw 
their troops 
zia kept up his nations military strength to guard tense 
borders with neighboring india he managed to retain control over 
the armed forces which had staged several successful coups since 
pakistan was created as an islamic nation in 1947 
but in recent months he has faced increasingly unified 
opposition led by benazir bhutto the daughter of former prime 
minister zulfikar ali bhutto who zia arrested and executed after 
taking power 
zia who was a general resisted a cult of personality and did 
not permit his portrait to hang in government offices or public 
places unlike pakistans previous military leaders he was married 
and had five children 
he was also the countrys first head of state to use pakistans 
national language urdu at all state functions he also encouraged 
officials in his government to wear national dress 
zia took power from bhutto in 1977 arrested the cabinet and 
proclaimed martial law two years later he ordered his predecessor 
executed on charges of conspiracy to murder under his 
authoritarian rule mass arrests and floggings were frequent 
in an interview earlier this month zia said he ruled 
reluctantly 
really you can say that a reluctant ruler but i am not a 
person to just give up in disgust and walk away i am determined to 
stay here until i solve all of the many problems that continue to 
face our country 
he was born into a middleclass family on aug 12 1924 at 
jallunder in what is now indias punjab state he became a devout 
moslem in his youth and later instituted islamic laws when in 
power 
in june zia issued a presidential decree making islamic law 
supreme bringing much of pakistani life under the supervision of 
islamic scholars and priests his great passion in life is 
islam said a close aide 
his rule was helped by geopolitics and luck the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan in 1979 led to more western aid and 
good harvests brought more food in the early 1980s 
in recent months however he has had to work a political high 
wire act to quell the unprecedented opposition challenge by ms 
bhutto and others 
last month zia announced free fair and impartial national 
elections would be held in november but he later issued election 
rules that restricted opposition campaigning 
several pakistani and western analysts said the shrewd leader 
had believed that running the country was not duty but destiny 
its not important what people say about you now zia said 
in a 1983 interview but what history remembers after youve 
gone 
ms bhutto leader of the opposition pakistan peoples party 
said from her karachi home life and death is in the hand of god 
we will not say anything 
us officials praised zia as a strong ally of the united states 
vice president george bush said pakistan and the united states 
have a very special relationship and the loss of gen zia is a 
great tragedy his comment came in new orleans the site of the 
republican party convention 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
zia and raphel had gone down to the remote area in southwestern 
pakistan to view a field demonstration of the usmade m1 tank 
pakistan was thinking of buying 
jeane kirkpatrick former us ambassador to the united nations 
today said zias death raises doubts about pakistans ability to 
support the afghan rebels zia was a very strong person she 
said also from the convention 
he was very important to the whole geopolitical strategic 
constellation of the region very important to the freedom fighters 
of afghanistan

and the loss of general zia is a great tragedy 
our ambassador arnie raphel an outstanding ambassador i knew 
him well and barbara and i express our most sincere regrets to the 
families 
after the excitement of yesterday i wanted to give everybody a 
chance to meet our unified republican ticket 
senator quayle is one of the rising stars in the republican 
party in fact the national journal called him a senate success 
story 
and i asked him to be my running mate for three main reasons 
first and most importantly hes qualified hes distinguished 
himself in the senate as the author of the job training partnership 
act hes an expert on defense and national security and hes 
worked hard to increase our farm exports he knows the agricultural 
business well 
and secondly we agree on the fundamental challenges that face 
this country how to create jobs by keeping taxes low how to keep 
america strong and secure as we work for peace and how to create 
opportunities for american families 
and while a midwesterner i believe he will help our cause in 
every part of the country because he understands that whats 
important in this campaign is not only what weve accomplished but 
what we will accomplish in the future 
as his own record of electoral success shows hes not only an 
excellent senator but an excellent campaigner as well hes done 
very very well and i am pleased and excited to introduce the next 
vice president of the united states sen dan quayle

county courthouse and threatened to blow the building up 
surrendered today after releasing his captives and reporting that 
his wife killed herself police said 
kevin patrick firth 30 was taken into custody at 915 am 
police sgt greg kuhn said 
authorities were uncertain pending an autopsy whether helen 
firth shot herself or was shot by her husband mesa county district 
attorney steve erkenbrack said 
shes gone helens shot said firth told police earlier 
this morning 
police said mrs firth had smuggled guns and possibly explosives 
into the mesa county courthouse tuesday just before her husband 
faced a hearing in a sexual assault case 
after firth surrendered a bomb squad began searching the 
courthouse but didnt immediately find any explosives erkenbrack 
said hostages had reported seeing wire tape and round objects 
inside the courthouse there apparently was something there to 
make the hostages believe there were explosives he said 
the last of the hostages had been released three hours before 
firth reported the shooting firth would not permit a doctor to 
enter the building 
firth appeared willing to give up at about 330 am but his 
wife balked and threatened many times to detonate explosives she 
had smuggled into the twostory building 
at 510 am firth reported his wife had shot herself when 
negotiators tried to calm him down he said i cant ive got to 
be with her its too late 
after several minutes negotiator john hakes asked firth to call 
on the telephone but firth refused and said get everybody off 
or ill blow this building helens about gone 
later in the morning firth agreed to negotiate by telephone 
the last thing he was heard saying over the radio was why did 
you push her was time all that important 
police refused to report the substance of telephone 
conversations between negotiators and firth 
all business was canceled at the courthouse today and businesses 
facing the courthouse were asked not to open 
i thought i was going to die said sheila shumway a court 
clerk who was the first hostage released on tuesday i blame that 
on the county commissioners we begged and begged for security and 
its always been money to them maybe theyll do something now 
im not going to work there again until they get me some 
security i wasnt hired to wear a bulletproof shield she said 
in a telephone interview today

during the ordeal police said firth 30 made no demands 
except to talk with investigators about the sexual assault case 
against him 
as the night wore on firth approached the brink of releasing 
his captives several times but changed his mind when he heard 
noises such as the air conditioning system and nearby trains or 
saw shadows flickering on the walls 
negotiators spoke with firth on a police radio that he had 
obtained from a jailer in the courtroom 
about 40 courthouse employees including two judges their 
families and news reporters huddled around police scanners in a 
darkened parking lot across the street from the courthouse as the 
drama unfolded 
police shut off the street lights and cordoned off the building 
for a block on all sides in the belief that firth may have wired 
the top floor of the courthouse with explosives 
when firth decided to free bailey just before 2 am he could 
be heard on the police radio saying theres a charge in one of 
these filing cabinets in front of the door and something inside 
it fell if these wires arent touching im in trouble

the tiny black homeland of 
venda in south africas northeast corner is in turmoil because of 
ritual murders and allegations that officials have tried to cover 
them up 
thousands of students have boycotted classes for two weeks 
demanding the justice minister be fired and workers joined the 
protest tuesday with a general strike that continues affecting 
government offices public transport shops and factories 
president frank ravele said after an emergency cabinet meeting 
tuesday that alfred tshivhase had been dismissed as justice 
minister to restore law and order but would be kept on as 
minister without portfolio 
police in venda confirm four ritual murders have been committed 
this year and are being investigated but have not disclosed 
details they deny charges of a coverup made by student and 
community leaders who claim the true number of killings is 15 
ritual murder is a term used in africa to describe killings in 
which parts of bodies are cut off ground up and used as an 
ingredient in potions children are the most frequent victims 
the south african foreign ministry said tuesday there had been 
false rumors of a coup in venda reports of political turbulence in 
the homeland have circulated since patrick mphephu the 
authoritarian president died in april after nearly 30 years in 
power 
venda is twothirds the size of lebanon and its population is 
about 500000 many of them migrant workers whose jobs are far from 
the territory it is one of four black homelands designated as 
independent by south africa but not recognized abroad 
a coup attempt failed earlier this year in bophuthatswana one 
of the homelands and a coup succeeded last year in another 
transkei 
venda was declared independent in 1979 and human rights groups 
have described its government as ruthless in suppressing political 
dissent 
the sowetan south africas largest blackoriented daily 
newsdpaper reported wednesday that suspects in two of the four 
confirmed ritual murder cases were connected with the government 
it said a member of the legislature was accused of killing an 
18yearold woman but freed when the attorney general declined to 
prosecute and a man working for the director of intelligence 
services had been arrested in the murder of a baby 
no official information has been released about motives for the 
murders 
the sowetan said many students involved in the classroom boycott 
have been arrested and fellow protesters were demanding their 
release 
another south african newspaper the star said wednesday that 
students submitted a statement to police alleging that tshivhase 
the justice minister was linked to the death last month of a 
32yearold high school teacher

sen dan quayle the conservative baby boomer 
who will be george bushs running mate today defended his 
qualifications to be president and said there was nothing to a 
weekend that he and other congressmen spent with a washington 
lobbyist 
the indiana republican also said it was a cheap shot for 
anyone to criticize his entering the national guard during the 
vietnam war 
and the 41yearold senator named as his no 2 by bush on 
tuesday said he is not as wealthy as some reports have suggested 
one story that put his net worth at 200 million has caused me a 
lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about that he 
joked 
in a joint news conference with bush quayle a relative unknown 
on the national political horizon faced a barrage of questions as 
he began the process of introducing himself to american voters 
bush aides have tried to compare quayle with john f kennedy 
who galvanized young voters nearly three decades ago bush called 
quayle a man of the future 
bush insisted quayle was the best candidate to be his vice 
presidential nominee but quayle was pressed on his presidential 
qualifications 
i have spent 12 years in the congress quayle said i know 
perahps as much about national security as anybody with few 
exceptions the senate armed services committee and my national 
security background gives me a very important background he 
said should an accident befall the president quayle said he would 
know what needs to be done to preserve the freedoms and 
opportunity in this country 
he added that he worked in executive positions in state 
government before going to congress including one as the chief 
inheritance tax officer for the state 
i was known as the chief grave robber of the state he said 
quayle gave terse answers to questions about his relationship 
with paula parkinson a washington lobbyist who was on a golfing 
trip in 1980 with quayle and two other congressmen quayle has 
previously denied any sexual relationship with parkinson a 
statement he would not expand on 
that has been covered and there is nothing to it he said 
asked if he had ever seen parkinson on other occasions quayle 
said no 
quayle objected to suggestions that he had ducked military 
service in vietnam by joining the national guard in 1969 
i do perceive that as being a cheap shot i have a deep 
affection for those men and women who sacrificed their lives in 
vietnam for anybody to imply anything differently is just not 
true he said 
quayle also denied stories painting him as a very wealthy man 
his relatives and a family trust own newspapers in indiana and 
arizona 
asked if quayle was worth 200 million bush cut in to joke 
why do you think i chose him 
quayle tried to also give a light answer to the question 
that figure is not correct believe me you have caused me a 
lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about that 
both men said they would disclose their finances fully 
the choice of quayle 41 a telegenic politician whose career 
rise has been meteoric brought stunned silence and then applause 
from supporters who watched bush make the announcement tuesday 
after days of suspense conservatives said they were pleased by the 
choice 
quayle bounced up and down on his toes at the riverfront area 
where bushs tour boat had cruised to greet supporters and could 
hardly contain his enthusiasm lets go get em he shouted 
sheila tate bushs press secretary said quayle was bushs 
first choice his only choice for the tickets no 2 spot he 
was picked over about a dozen hopefuls whom bush personally 
notified from belle chasse naval air station before phoning quayle 
at his hotel at 206 pm aides said 
bush and quayle enjoy a warm relationship and talk often by 
telephone or in bushs office in the old executive office building 
sen mitch mcconnell rky who polled senate republicans at 
bushs request two weeks ago said quayle was not among those they 
recommended for the spot but when mcconnell gave bush the 
recommendations bush asked what about dan quayle 
quayle is relatively unknown on the national stage but he 
quickly seized the moment at tuesdays riverfront festivities his 
right hand chopping the air in a gesture reminiscent of kennedy 
george bushs america believes and has the commitment to the 
american family that is so important to all of us he said his 
voice rising to a shout george bushs america understands the 
problems that confront us and can lead us to the future and the 
21st century 
quayle is married to the former marilyn tucker a lawyer and 
they have three children the oldest 14 he comes from a prominent 
indiana newspaper family and is the grandson of the late eugene c 
pulliam a multimillionaire publisher 
quayle made no major marks in two terms in the house before his 
senate bid defeating incumbent democrat birch bayh in 1980 and 
winning reelection handily in 1986 
in the senate quayle has not attained the stature of his senior 
indiana colleague richard lugar but in choosing quayle bush 
opted for someone with whom he felt comfortable rather than someone 
with instant name recognition 
james a baker iii bushs new campaign chairman said the 
choice was a bold stroke across generations and predicted that 
those republicans who dont now back quayle will be enthusiastic 
supporters of his once they look at his record and see him 
perform 
robert teeter bushs pollster said quayle should strengthen 
the ticket in the midwest where bush ran poorly in the primaries 
and also help bridge the celebrated gender gap problem bush has 
with women voters

democrat michael dukakis began a fourday 
campaign swing hoping to steal some of the spotlight from the 
republican national convention with a midday rally in this iron 
range town 
before addressing several thousand people at a community college 
stadium he told a welcoming gathering at the airport in nearby 
hibbing that minnesota has always been very good to democrats 
and i hope and expect to have a nice victory here in november 
appearing with him at the community college rally were former 
vice president walter mondale the democrats 1984 presidential 
nominee and state attorney general skip humphrey son of the late 
sen hubert h humphrey 
from here he was flying to minneapolis for a private reception 
and then miami for an address thursday to a greek organization 
dukakis spent monday and tuesday on a tour of central 
massachusetts but interrupted his busy schedule of state events 
long enough to turn reagans facts are stubborn things refrain 
on the republicans and their certain nominee vice president george 
bush 
facts are stubborn things dukakis agreed as he listed facts 
he said republicans are failing to acknowledge at their convention 
increases in the national crime rate and the federal trade and 
budget deficit 
this is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor 
nation in the world dukakis said in worcester today we are 
the largest debtor nation in the world thats the consequence of 
eight years of borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending 
facts are stubborn things and these are the facts we are going to 
be debating it will be mr bush who will have to respond to 
those facts 
he then shifted to foreign policy but kept the refrain first 
used by reagan in his address to the republican convention monday 
night as he reeled off a list of reagan administration 
embarrassments 
irancontra noriega beirut dukakis said facts are 
stubborn things 
dukakis said he expected the gop convention would help bush cut 
into his lead in the polls but predicted the effect would not be 
lasting and that reagan would not be a major factor 
things will settle down dukakis said this is an election 
between michael dukakis and george bush the question voters are 
going to be asking themselves is which one of us has the ability to 
lead 
dukakis also had his own interpretation of another remark from 
the reagan speech the presidents assertion that bush should be 
elected because the nation could not afford to have a president who 
would need onthejobtraining 
said dukakis the same might have been said of the republican 
nominee in 1980 referring to reagan the former california 
governor none of us comes to the presidency with onthejob 
training least of all vice presidents dukakis said 
dukakis also said he was not bothered by the harsh criticism of 
him at the republican convention 
if you went through what i went through in the mid70s its a 
day at the beach said dukakis who was voted out of office in 
1978 after countering a budget crisis by slashing welfare benefits 
and raising taxes in his first term he returned to office in 1983 
dukakis said he spoke to former rival jesse jackson on wednesday 
and that he expected a joint campaign appearance soon its going 
to be a close relationship dukakis said 
after the miami event thursday morning dukakis is scheduled to 
travel to alabama and spend the night in st louis fridays 
schedule includes stops in illinois arkansas and texas where 
dukakis also is to spend saturday campaigning with running mate

by selecting indiana sen dan quayle as his 
running mate george bush has reached out to a region whose voters 
have more clout than anyone else 
thanks to the nations changing population it will take fewer 
midwestern votes to win delegates to the electoral college than in 
any other region of the nation 
electoral college support is hardest to come by on the other 
hand in the south home to democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen and also claimed by the gops bush 
this is the case because despite the oneperson onevote 
theory americans dont elect their presidents directly instead 
they elect delegates to the electoral college who in turn actually 
pick the president and vice president 
and the number of delegates each state gets in the electoral 
college is based on the total number of senators and 
representatives that state has in congress every state has two 
senators while seats in the house are readjusted according to 
population after each national census 
that means that for this election representation in the 
electoral college is based on the 1980 national head count even 
though massive changes have occurred as people moved from state to 
state 
the south has the most electoral votes at 177 this year 
followed by 137 in the midwest 113 in the west and 111 in the 
northeast the census bureau estimates that as of july 1 1987 
the south had 63032000 residents aged 18 and over second was the 
midwest at 43952000 the northeast with 38402000 and the west 
at 37242000 
that means each electoral vote in the midwest represents 320817 
voters the fewest of any region and thus giving them the most 
clout as individuals when they do to the polls 
the western voter comes next in influence with each elector 
representing 335513 voters each elector from the northeast 
represents 339841 voters while in the south the ratio is 356112 
voters per electoral vote 
thus each voter in the midwest has 11 percent more influence on 
the election than someone going to the polls in the south

bourbon street is courting republicans but 
snugly sealed gop pocketbooks and free diversions elsewhere have 
made the exotic avenue a spurned suitor 
bar and food tabs are paltry tips are tiny and seats are empty 
in many bourbon street clubs and restaurants proprietors complain 
money and morals are factors they speculate along with the 
republican national conventions latenight schedule that leaves 
many conventioneers too pooped to party in the french quarter 
ive always kind of wanted to see bourbon street and now i 
have said alex day 19 a former pat robertson supporter from 
litchfield ky ive seen enough im going back to the hotel 
young republicans have spent the most money club owners said in

even other kinds of conventiongoers said harold tannenbaum 
manager of the krazy korner bar on bourbon street 
they are not much in the way of tipping tannenbaum said 
the girls have been complaining they havent been taking as much 
as they usually do 
robin parks who minds the door at ryans irish pub said the

lot of money she said i think the democrats would have been a 
little bit rowdier

a string of republican luminaries from 
certain nominee george bush on down ridiculed democratic nominee 
michael dukakis farm policies wednesday the day after a son of 
the midwest was picked for the no 2 spot on the gop ticket 
bush senate republican leader bob dole and agriculture 
secretary richard lyng took aim at a belgian endive comment 
thats dogged dukakis since the early days of the campaign 
dukakis got in trouble when he suggested that farmers could 
diversify their crops in part by growing belgian endive 
i dont think that belgian endive is the answer to american 
agriculture bush told a breakfast for farmstate republicans 
my wife likes belgian endive but i hate them 
poor michael he cant be blamed lyng said he grew up in 
the city and he doesnt know the difference between belgian endive 
and corn 
i thought it was part of his foreign policy said dole 
bush tabbed indiana sen dan quayle to be his running mate and 
there was instant speculation that the selection would bolster 
republican chances in the midwest where recession and drought have 
hurt bush 
bush lost a series of primary and caucus contests in the 
midwest before clinching the nomination some polls have suggested 
that dukakis is ahead in the traditionally republican farm belt 
the selection of quayle clearly buoyed the spirits of the 
midwesterners and bush and former rival dole were upbeat about 
republican chances 
its certainly an indication that he understands the 
importance of rural america dole said 
i am an optimist about agricultural america bush said 
main street is not going to dry up under a george bush 
administration as president i am pledged to helping rural 
america 
and bush wasnt subtle about how the quayle selection would fit 
into that effort 
i have suggested to the convention that a son of the midwest 
be on our ticket and dan quayle will be working hard to carry the 
message bush said

bush thanks dan 
now 
q can you really say to the nation today that senator quayle 
young and so relatively inexperienced especially compared to you 
sir is prepared to be a heartbeat away from the presidency 
bush yes i can 
his record is outstanding 
yes hes young and thats a tremendous asset 
hell have broad appeal for the election 
but in terms of being a heartbeat away ive listened since ive 
named him as the likely nominee since ive recommended to the 
national convention that he be nominated for that job ive 
listened to his peers and the accolades from the senators with whom 
he serves speak eloquently of dan quayles standing to be one 
heartbeat away from the presidency 
yes 
q senator what makes you think you are qualified to become 
president in the event something unfortunate should happen to mr 
bush what is it that you have that would make you qualified 
quayle well i have spent 12 years in the congress 
i know perhaps as much about national security as anybody with 
few exceptions 
ive worked hard particularly on the senate armed services 
committee 
the senate armed services committee and my national security 
background gives me a very important background for if some 
accident would befall the president to have an understanding about 
what needs to be done to preserve the freedoms and the 
opportunities in this country 
i feel prepared

pat robertson passed the remnants of his 
failed presidential campaign to george bush with spirit and gusto 
but reserved the right to make another bid for the white house 
throughout the convention week robertson held meetings with 
delegations from states where he scored well in this years series 
of primaries urging them to be good republicans and jump into 
this years election with a vengeance 
i want george bush to win robertson said at one point 
and what impact would that have on his own future 
im a young guy i can wait eight years said the 
58yearold television evangelist 
his supporters said thats just fine with them and many are 
finding ways to play a role in this years election to show their 
resolve 
were not a bunch of loonies said ann kincaid who ran 
robertsons virginia campaign but now works for bush it has to 
do with the maturity of what were doing 
robertson had long been out of the running for the gop 
presidential nomination but his role in the party far exceeded the 
88 delegates still loyal when he released them tuesday night 
he was awarded a primetime spot on the conventions podium and 
even drew a member of the bush family when he decided to formally 
throw in the towel a sharply conservative platform approved by the 
delegates reflected his stamp 
even bushs choice of conservative sen dan quayle of indiana as 
a running mate left robertson elated 
on issues like school prayer and abortion he is right down 
the line with evangelicals robertson said 
his backers were taking that cue 
im comfortable to know that im part of this party said 
john rondeno a new orleans activist who ran a reception center for 
robertson delegates when youre outside you have no influence 
sometimes you have to rebuild the foundation 
the only surprise backers argued was how quickly theyve been 
able to make the transition 
i expected a little tug and a little struggle but there 
wasnt said robertson spokeswoman marlene elwell 
that shows its not just a mancentered thing mrs kincaid 
said pat woke them up shook them up and pasted them to the 
republican party thats not something thats going to go away 
just as democratic nominee michael dukakis worked to win over 
jesse jackson without appearing too closely allied bushs forces 
quietly courted the fundamentalists 
robertson capped it with a ringing endorsement before a packed 
and cheering convention and a national television audience there 
are challenges for both sides 
along the way robertson committed occasional gaffes that raised 
eyebrows and doubts at a news conference wednesday he was asked 
what he learned about his evangelical base 
i learned they were not a monolithic group robertson said 
the second thing i learned was that if they had supported me in 
the strength that the black people supported jesse jackson i would 
be standing on the platform tomorrow night 
in essence the robertson forces must show they are capable of 
delivering mrs kincaid said there are spirited races across her 
state and the robertson forces must demonstrate they can turn out 
the vote or risk being labeled paper tigers 
weve got to show the state of virginia were going to work in 
the trenches she said weve got to show the republican party 
were in here for the principles and the philosophy and not just 
the man 
bush however will face pressure to adhere to the sharply 
conservative views that robertson espoused through the end of his 
campaign right to the floor of the convention 
robertsons carried out his part of the bargain with a ringing 
endorsement and call to action coupled with one of the 
conventions sharpest attacks on democratic nominee michael dukakis 
michael dukakis is a cardcarrying member of the american 
civil liberties union an organization dedicated to removing all 
public affirmation of religious faith in america robertson said 
as president michael dukakis will pack the courts with aclu 
radicals 
of bush 
this party is about to nominate a man that i have come to 
respect and admire robertson told the convention in television 
prime time this man can and will lead our nation proudly into 
the future 
he described bush as a principled conservative 
i release my delegates and alternates who have come to this 
convention and urge you and all of my friends across america to 
give your enthusiastic support to our party our candidates and our 
presidential nominee robertson said 
it matters to us and our children whether we vote democrat or 
whether we vote republican robertson said 
to further that aim robertson has established a political 
action committee and mrs kincaid said that will be linked with 
pacs in states across the country 
we feel confident its happening throughout the whole united 
states rondeno said

the folksy acrobats of the georgian state dance 
company energized broadways mark hellinger theater as the troupe 
made its first visit to the united states in 18 years 
the 75member company is one of the soviet unions greatest 
cultural gifts founded in the early 1940s by nina ramishvili and 
her late husband their son rengiz sukhishvili is artistic 
director mother and son choreograph keeping many regional 
traditions intact such as keeping couples apart when they dance 
together 
the airborne antics of the male dancers were dazzling and superb 
tuesday night jumping two feet in the air they tucked in their 
feet to do fast double turns flying to a landing on their knees 
and calves 
the men wore knee pads which certainly were needed for some of 
the other moves they so easily made four adolescent boys 
demonstrated their dexterity by whirling around the floor with 
their weight on their knees 
the men also were adept at dancing on their toes in some 
movements 
in khorumi a dance in which locations for battle are 
scouted one dancer jumped on the shoulders of another to scan the 
territory it was highly effective 
anyone who thinks all eastern european dance companies look 
alike will decide differently on seeing the georgian dancers there 
are no colorful flying hair ribbons for the women or red embroidery 
on dirndl skirts 
the women are garbed elegantly for every dance in several they 
look like a flock of brides in one where three made a triangle 
dancing back to back theyre dressed more regally 
also unlike many eastern european dance steps which involve 
hopping the women in this company do more of a gliding step 
the emphasis is on smoothness and patterns 
costumes muted but not dull were beautifully coordinated 
simon virsaladze who designs for the bolshoi ballet is said to 
have used the heritage of the georgian region in the costumes the 
mens costumes favored military coats worn with swords over black 
pants 
the company on a 12week us tour will appear on broadway 
through sept 4 it will then go to poughkeepsie ny trenton and 
atlantic city nj and orlando daytona sarasota and clearwater

the united states today detonated a 
nuclear device under this remote desert mesa in a historic test 
monitored by soviet scientists under an agreement allowing both 
countries to observe nuclear weapons tests 
scientists diplomats and military officials applauded in the 
control center after the nuclear device exploded at 10 am 
causing a ripple on the desert surface at ground zero the blast 
was not felt at the center 30 miles away where it was observed on 
television screens 
it was the first time soviet officials had been allowed to 
monitor a weapons test at the supersecret nevada test site 
the nuclear explosive with a blast nearly 12 times more 
powerful than the one that devastated hiroshima was buried 2020 
feet into the belly of a secluded picturesque mesa 130 miles 
northwest of las vegas 
the weapon was encased in a steel canister painted red white 
and blue by workers who planted the device three weeks ago 
in las vegas people in tall buildings reported the blast caused 
some swaying 
everything appears successful so far said nick aquilina 
manager of the nevada operations office which conducts the 
nations nuclear testing program the us and soviet scientists 
received the data they wanted he said 
in santa barbara calif white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater with president reagan on vacation called todays test 
a further positive step which reflects the success of the 
administrations practical and measured approach to nuclear 
testing 
diplomats who helped forge the agreement in geneva late last 
year gathered at the control point joining scientists and military 
officials who direct the nuclear weapons programs for the two 
superpowers 
at a news conference before the blast us and soviet diplomats 
who carved out the historic agreement expressed differing opinions 
on the cessation of nuclear testing 
igor palenykh head of the soviet delegation to the nuclear 
testing talks in geneva said his countrys goal is a total ban on 
testing 
i would like to emphasize that endeavor palenykh said 
through an interpreter as far as the soviet union is concerned 
we are prepared at any time to cease nuclear testing along with the 
united states 
he referred to the soviets 18month unilateral test moratorium 
that ended last year with the resumption of soviet testing 
unfortunately this action of ours has not been appropriately 
reciprocated this doesnt mean were not willing to resolve this 
problem step by step palenykh said 
us ambassador c paul robinson palenykhs counterpart at the 
nuclear test talks said the united states believes there is a 
need for nuclear testing as long as there is a need for nuclear 
weapons for national defense 
he said it remains to be seen how we will accomodate the 
differing views on the need for nuclear testing 
robinson said todays test indicates the two countries are 
still making progress for measures for a safer world 
the test was designed to measure the ability of each country to 
monitor the size of the others nuclear tests a requisite in 
preventing cheating on treaties signed in 1974 and 1976 limiting 
the size of nuclear tests to 150 kilotons 
both sides have accused each other of exceeding the limits 
president reagan first suggested such a verification test during 
a united nations speech four years ago 
the test code named kearsarge would be the ninth at the site 
this year and the 684th announced blast at the nevada site since 
testing began here in 1951 
fortyfive soviet nuclear scientists engineers and diplomats 
were on hand to witness todays blast a like number of american 
scientists will witness a test at the soviet site at semipalatinsk 
next month 
some of the soviet scientists were in the nearby town of mercury 
when six of the previous us tests were conducted this year but 
todays test was the first one in which they were present 
one possible hitch was eliminated monday when a patrolling 
department of energy helicopter picked up two antinuclear 
protesters in a remote desert canyon a spokesman for the 
antinuclear american peace test said the two had planned to hike 
to pahute mesa to delay todays test 
energy department spokeswoman barbara yoerg said the two never 
made it to the test site boundaries they were released on a 
highway off the test site without being charged 
the us and soviet scientists planned to monitor the blast via 
highlysophisticated equipment housed in unmanned trailers several 
hundred yards from ground zero 
the 25 million test was designed to measure the size of a blast 
and was not directly related to a possible test ban although 
scientists and diplomats say the experiment was a critical first 
step down that long road 
systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a key 
in ratifying the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 
peaceful nuclear explosions treaty the pacts limit nuclear tests 
to 150 kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceeding 
those limits 
c paul robinson the us arms negotiator who helped forge the 
test agreement called the test unprecedented the result of a 
breakthrough in negotiations between the superpowers the tests 
were agreed to by reagan and soviet general secretary mikhail 
gorbachev at the washington summit last december

q mr vice president its been said that in order to win this 
fall you have to nail down that part of the reagan coalition the 
independents and those people known as the reagan democrats its 
clear senator quayle will appeal to the right wing of your party 
and to conservatives how does he help you to nail down that center 
part of the electorate those people who are ideologically in the 
center 
bush he helps me nationally by the same way he did it in 
indiana 
take a look at the record in terms of votes take a look at the 
standing in terms of voter acceptance today the governor telling 
me that dan quayle has a higher standing with the voters democrat 
and republican than any other public figure in the state of 
indiana 
thats how we do it 
right over here jerry and then bob 
q mr vice president there are some people who say you should 
have done more to try to balance your ticket either have someone 
whos somewhat different from you or who comes who offers 
something you dont sir did you take that into consideration 
bush hes different from me 
im 64 and hes 41 
and thats good thats positive because his message of hope 
and opportunity his record of job creation will resound and have 
great emphasis in those particular in the areas of younger people 
and ive demonstrated ive already said that he has 
demonstrated his ability to get votes from women 
so if we can convey nationally what he has demonstrated in one 
state itll be of enormous help to this ticket

when george bush took the fabled torch of 
republican leadership from ronald reagan the first thing he did 
was promise the next pass to 41yearold dan quayle the decision 
to skip a generation leaves a number of party stalwarts with mixed 
emotions and uncertain ambitions 
count jack kemp phil gramm and who knows how many others 
among the wounded 
the disappointment may have been sharpest among kemp and the 
other republicans who had been considered by bush for the vice 
presidential nomination each of them knew that win or lose in 
november being on the bush ticket would provide a leg up for the 
next open presidential nomination 
if quayle acquits himself nicely between now and november his 
political clout good looks and reliable conservative record would 
make him a tough man to beat 
rep kemp had traipsed from state to state from year to year 
to earn a shot at the leadership of his gop generation he ran 
unsuccessfully against bush and now having failed to win the 
mantle he hoped to capture it the oldfashioned way by being 
appointed to it 
but kemp lost his chance for the ticket when he failed to win a 
single state and could not hope to deliver his own new york in 
november and so he could only wait forlornly by the phone on 
tuesday as bush anointed quayle the way reagan had anointed bush 
in remarks that were warm spontaneous and even included a 
respectable ronald reagan impression kemp admitted wednesday he 
was disappointed when bush telephoned him to give him the bad news 
im not going to get emotional kemp said clearing his 
throat but i was brought up by my parents to believe that all 
things work together for good i was brought up to believe that 
momentary disappointments in our lives turn out many times to be 
blessings in disguise 
now ill go back and play for the buffalo bills his old 
pro football team kemp joked in fact hell soon be out of a job 
having given up his congressional seat to challenge bush for the 
nomination 
it cant have been all that pleasant for gramm either 
the feisty 46yearold former democrat is considered by many 
conservatives to be next up for the reagan mantle he was 
foreclosed from the bush ticket because both men have a texas voter 
registration and probably hoped that bush would clear the decks 
for the next gop generation by choosing an older running mate 
someone fading from the scene like former gop senate leader howard 
baker or dole who would be 69 in 1992 and an unlikely inheritor 
of anyones mantle or torch or anything 
the quayle activities overshadowed gramms nominating speech a 
highlight of wednesday nights convention events but it gramm was 
concerned he wasnt saying so 
others watching the quayle ascendency with a wary eye would 
include 
presidential alsorans pat robertson and pete du pont sens 
john mccain of arizona and pete domenici of new mexico and a 
veritable plethora of governors and former governors richard 
thornburgh of pennsylvania gov carroll campbell of south 
carolina lamar alexander of tennessee gov john sununu of new 
hampshire gov thomas kean of new jersey among others 
add some names from reagan cabinets elizabeth dole william 
bennett and donald hodel 
bush bypassed them one and all and delivered quayle from 
anonymity 
hes different from me bush said of quayle im 64 and 
hes 41 
more to the point ronald reagan is 77 
bush got off air force two on tuesday and said the significance 
of his airport rendezvous with reagan was that the mantle was being 
passed he actually used the phrase before delegates had returned 
from their late lunches bush had plunked quayle from anonymity 
way to go danny he exclaimed after quayle had completed 
his first speaking assignment he called quayle a man of the 
future and handed quayle the greatest political plum in the gop

q mr vice president most polls have suggested that senator 
dole would have been a stronger ticket why did you choose senator 
quayle rather than senator dole 
bush it was a tough call 
there were several men and women who would fit the criteria that 
i spelled out ahead of time 
but i felt for the reasons ive given here that dan quayle is 
the best choice 
way back here 
q senator quayle during the irancontra hearings last summer 
there was testimony that your office served as a meeting place for 
people like john hull and rob owen who were involved in contra 
resupply during the boland amendment were you involved in this 
contra fundraising and resupply operation and did you have any 
contact with vice president bush or his office about it 
quayle none and the question is off base as far as any of 
those meetings going on 
q senator quayle since this is a family values campaign im 
sure youre eager to clear up questions about your relationship 
with paula parkinson the former lobbyist and playboy model i have 
a twopart question the first part is you have said that you went 
on a weekend with two congressmen one of whom brought her along 
that you saw her only once and you played golf the rest of the 
time first of all sir is that an accurate account 
quayle no 
q ok could you give us an accurate account 
quayle that has been covered and theres nothing to it 
q well the second part of the question then is have you 
seen her on any other occasion in washington perhaps other than 
that florida trip 
quayle no 
q thank you

george bush today called his new running 
mate sen dan quayle one of the rising stars in the republican 
party and said the youthful conservative is qualified to be one 
heartbeat away from the presidency 
bush said the 41yearold indiana senator would help the gop 
ticket in every region of america were going to tell the truth 
and its going to seem like theyve the democrats engaged a 
couple of pit bulls bush said 
we agree on the fundamental challenges that face this 
country the vice president said standing alongside his running 
mate at a news conference just hours before the republican national 
convention was to deliver bush its 1988 presidential nomination 
from his mountaintop ranch in california the vacationing 
president reagan telephoned quayle with congratulations tuesday 
night white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said a joint 
reaganbush appearance is being considered for next wednesday in 
los angeles 
bush and quayle will make their first campaign appearance on the 
road friday at a courthouse rally in quayles hometown of 
huntington ind 25 miles southwest of fort wayne 
traveling together around this convention city bush and quayle 
appeared at a news conference and at a rousing rally given by the 
california delegation hoping to capture the states huge cache of 
47 electoral votes bush said california is essential we will 
not overlook it we will concentrate on it 
california gov george deukmejian who earlier said that quayle 
would neither help nor hurt in california praised the choice of 
the hoosier senator bold and imaginative 
the first question at the news conference was whether quayle was 
qualified to step in as president should anything happen to bush 
the vice president said ive listened to his peers who speak 
eloquently of dan quayles standing to be one heartbeat away from 
the presidency 
describing his qualifications quayle said he had spent a dozen 
years in congress had experience in indiana state government and 
had met a payroll at his family newspaper in indiana quayle 
has been in congress since he was 29 years old 
quayle was asked about whether he had been involved with paula 
parkinson the key figure in a sexandinfluence scandal in 1980 
quayle and two other members of congress spent a weekend with 
parkinson in a florida condominium 
that has been covered and theres nothing to it quayle 
said asked if he had seen parkinson on any other occasion he 
said no 
quayle said he considered it to be a cheap shot to suggest 
that he ducked service in vietnam by enlisting in the national 
guard 
i have a deep affection for those men and women who sacrificed 
their lives in vietnam and for anybody to imply anything 
differently is just simply wrong he said 
he said it was not a handicap that he had not served in vietnam 
earlier in the day bush practiced his acceptance speech at the 
podium of the louisiana superdome convention hall where his 
nomination will be secured late tonight 
well do all right ill do ok he said of his acceptance 
speech set for thursday night 
quayle an heir to the pulliam newspaper publishing empire was 
asked about reports that his wealth exceeded 200 million 
that figure is not correct quayle said believe me you 
have caused me a lot of problems at home because my wife is asking 
about that he promised that a full financial statement would be 
forthcoming 
bush asked if the addition of quayle underscored the image of 
republicans as the party of the rich said i picked the best 
man its not a question of personal wealth 
bush was asked if it was smart politics to choose a running mate 
so much like himself hes different from me bush said im 
64 and he is 41 
bush said that making his choice was a tough call there were 
several men and women who fit the criteria i felt dan quayle was 
the best choice adding that he helps me nationally 
i didnt think i had to do something bold or different the 
vice president added 
bush bridled when a reporter asked him what he had meant tuesday 
when he introduced his three mexicanamerican grandchildren to 
president reagan as the little brown ones 
those grandchildren are my pride and joy the vice president 
said i find it personally offensive to suggest otherwise 
and ps i dont want to see these kids hurt this is family 
and im going to protect them 
bush opened his news conference by expressing how horrible i 
feel about the deaths today of president mohammad zia ulhaq and 
us ambassador arnold l raphel they were killed today when their 
pakistani military plane exploded in the eastern part of that 
country 
turning back to politics bush said he and quayle would be a 
formidable challenge to the democratic team of michael dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen 
describing quayle as one of the rising stars in the republican 
party bush said he picked the indiana senator for several 
reasons most importantly hes qualified bush said 
moroever he said we agree on the fundamental challenges that 
face this country how to keep america strong and secure how to 
create opportunities for american families while a midwesterner i 
believe he will help our cause in every part of the country 
the news conference provided bush with an opportunity to tweak 
the dukakisbentsen team about the differences on policy issues 
we arent going off in two different directions like the 
demcoratic ticket we wont have to debate each other the 
vice president said 
on the other hand paul brountas campaign chairman for 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis said quayle was 
relatively inexperienced he suggested bush seemed to make a 
decision that placated the right wing of the republican party 
many delegates admitted that they didnt know much about bushs 
choice but seemed enthusiastic anyway about the selection of the 
twoterm junior senator from indiana 
super super choice said john lindley iii chairman of the 
vermont delegation a real spark plug for bush said north 
dakota gop chairman layton freborg we need the female vote 
hell do the trick added sharon estrada of montana hes very 
cute

could tony bennett leave his heart in 
frisco bay 
thats the question being asked around town ever since the idea 
of renaming this small mountain community was floated at a town 
meeting earlier this month 
never mind that there are no little cable cars though there are 
plenty of cablepulled chair lifts for winter skiers 
theres no san francisco bay either but there is lake dillon 
robert philippe a real estate agent and vice chairman of a 
commission formed to develop the lake area is the proponent of the 
name change only 200 of the towns 17000 residents need to sign a 
petition he said at the meeting to put the name change on the 
ballot 
we think the name frisco bay is more descriptive of exactly 
what the town is said philippe 
frisco bay proponents have delayed a petition drive until after 
a vote on a homerule proposition that would help with financing 
such lakeside improvements as a marina and golf course 
not everyone is captivated 
karen mack manager of the frisco historical park said the name 
change strays from the towns heritage as an early colorado mining 
camp 
it isnt clear how the town got its name although one story is 
told in which a sign reading frisco house the name of a 
notorious bordello in nearby leadville was nailed to one of the 
first cabins in town and the name stuck

the room was a politicians dream 
red white and blue banners hung from the ceiling an orchestra 
a jazz band and a chorus of political and religious leaders lined 
the stage and more than 6000 potential voters sat in the audience 
backstage mayor sidney barthelemy was asked to deliver the 
pledge of allegiance and kick off a twohour ecumenical breakfast 
honoring the republican national convention and arranged by his 
wife mickey 
nah said the mayor almost mumbling my wife is the star 
of the program 
as his city basks in media attention scores of interviewers 
have forced the often bashful barthelemy to share the spotlight 
i dont seek it it just happens barthelemy said 
it began before dawn tuesday 
his face dabbed with makeup the mayor sat in the today 
show trailer nibbling grapes and watching television he did not 
introduce himself to the two political analysts sitting beside him 
on the couch 
when his turn came to be interviewed for the hundredth time 
this week he sighed jane pauley asked the two routine questions 
why is a democratic city hosting the republican national 
convention and whats the economic impact 
the mayor gave his routine answers the republicans were smart 
enough to choose new orleans and the economy needs help but the 
city is on its way 
then pauley threw in a surprise former arizona sen barry 
goldwater who forgot his credentials and had trouble getting onto 
the superdome floor monday called this convention the worst hed 
ever seen did the mayor have any comment 
the republicans run inside the dome and we run outside and 
thats where were doing a great job barthelemy said bringing 
warm applause from the audience 
they clapped the mayor said as he walked off the set he 
seemed surprised they almost made me lose my concentration

a subsidized housing plan to integrate the states fourthlargest 
city the plan was in accordance with a federal court order for 200 
units of lowincome housing and 800 units of moderateincome

another vote on the housing plan this weeks meeting was the first 
sands contempt ruling was the most serious step in his

q senator quayle vice president bush has made financial 
disclosure a hallmark of his career and also talked about it in 
this campaign are you prepared to pledge today full financial 
disclosure all your holdings your trusts at the outset of this 
campaign 
quayle yes and that will be done in a reasonable period of 
time 
bush and we will be challenging the democrats 10 years of tax 
returns starting this year going back 10 lay it out on the 
record fully i believe in full disclosure and so did he 
gabe 
q mr vice president the democrats including mr dukakis 
claim that there are big holes in the reagan safety net with 
millions of people in the large urban centers of this country 
including new york facing poverty and homelessness many of these 
are children what in an immediate sense can conservative 
ideology do for them 
bush we passed the mckinney bill 
it should be fully funded 
we should all work at all levels of government not just 
federal but state and local to provide housing 
ive made some specific proposals that relate to defense 
establishments 
theres a provision in the law where some of those can be used 
for housing 
the fundamental answer of course is to do better in terms of 
housing itself and that gets into the fundamental economic 
questions 
but it is a key issue 
its one that the senator and i feel strongly about 
and were going to keep on trying

housing construction rose a moderate 24 
percent in july the government reported wednesday but economists 
warned that rising mortgage rates could make the twomonth housing 
rebound a brief one 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were being 
built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 149 million units 
last month after advancing 44 percent in june 
housing starts had dropped a sharp 121 percent in may to the 
slowest pace in three years and rising mortgage rates were blamed 
the junejuly rebound was attributed to stabilized mortgage 
rates but last week the federal reserve boosted the discount rate 
the interest it charges for loans to member banks 
this move was widely interpreted as the opening salvo in a 
renewed battle by the central bank to drive up interest rates to 
fight inflation as a consequence a variety of other interest 
rates including the banks prime lending rate and mortgage rates 
have moved higher 
fixedrate mortgages rose to 1057 percent by the end of last 
week and analysts predicted mortgages would soon top 11 percent 
i believe we have seen the peak for housing starts this year 
as rising interest rates cut into sales said richard peach an 
economist with the mortgage bankers association 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of 
home builders said his organization was so concerned by the feds 
credittightening moves that he asked federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan in a letter for a more evenhanded approach 
clearly the fed views the housing industry and other interest 
ratesensitive sectors of the economy as being sacrificial lambs 
seiders said 
sales of homes and other highpriced items usually are the first 
to fall off when the federal reserve tries to dampen borrowing by 
raising interest rates 
michael sumichrast an economist and publisher of a construction 
industry newsletter said that if mortgage rates climb to 115 
percent or higher it would spell disaster for the housing industry 
he said home sales already have been hurt by big price increases 
in many parts of the country 
i dont think you can sell houses at 115 percent to 12 
percent mortgage rates in this market because of the price 
increases sumichrast said 
analysts say another worrisome sign is that housing permits 
considered a good barometer of future activity fell in july by 54 
percent to an annual rate of 141 million units it was the biggest 
permit decline since january 
james christian chief economist of the us league of savings 
institutions said the drop in housing permits probably reflects 
builders fears of rising mortgage rates 
he said the impact of higher rates should be moderated by a 
consumer shift toward adjustable rate mortgages which carry a 
lower initial rate 
the july increase stemmed from a big jump in starts of 
multifamily construction which offset a small decline in 
singlefamily units 
singlefamily homes were being built at an annual rate of 108 
million units last month down 08 percent from the june level 
construction of multifamily units shot up 121 percent to an 
annual rate of 409000 units following a 62 percent decline in 
june 
the multifamily sector has been depressed for nearly two years 
because of the adverse effects of the 1986 tax law on real estate 
investment but some analysts said the steep decline in apartment 
construction finally may have bottomed out 
by region housing starts were strongest in the middle west 
climbing by 121 percent to an annual rate of 296000 units 
construction rose 92 percent in the northeast to an annual rate of 
262000 units 
construction fell 32 percent in the west to an annual rate of 
368000 units and it slumped 12 percent in the south to a rate of 
563000 units 
for the first seven months of 1988 housing starts have been 
running 106 percent below the level of the same period in 1987

president mohammed zia ulhaq and 
us ambassador arnold l raphel were killed today when their 
pakistani military plane exploded in the eastern part of the 
country 
the crash apparently also killed us brig gen herbert m 
wassom pentagon sources said on condition of anonymity wassom was 
the chief defense representative to pakistan and would have been 
traveling routinely with raphel 
there was no official comment on the cause of the explosion but 
speculation focused on a possible explosion on board a missile 
attack or a collision with another aircraft 
the pakistan air force c130 transport plane with 37 people 
aboard had just taken off from bahawalpur 330 miles south of 
islamabad when it exploded about 430 pm 730 am edt 
official radio said a government statement read over the radio 
said no one aboard the plane survived 
besides raphel wassom and zia who was also army chief of 
staff the passengers included several senior pakistani army 
generals the radio said 
conflicting unofficial reports said the aircraft may have been 
struck by an antiaircraft missile another version said it 
collided with a helicopter neither pakistani nor us diplomats 
could confirm either report 
another rumor circulating islamabad said the plane may have been 
shot down by india bahawalpur is 80 miles west of the border 
pakistani officials refused to comment except to say an 
investigation was under way 
pakistan became independent from britain and separate from india 
in 1947 in 1971 east pakistan became the nation of bangladesh 
after a civil war 
india and pakistan each station tens of thousands of troops 
alongside their 1836mile border the site of three wars in the 
past 41 years a un observer force has manned the border in the 
disputed kashmirjammu region since 1949 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi said in new delhi he was 
deeply shocked and distressed about zias death and sent 
condolences to his family 
an earlier incorrect report said the plane crashed near the city 
of lahore 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
zia and raphel went to the remote area in southwestern pakistan to 
view a field demonstration of the usmade m1 tank pakistan was 
thinking of buying 
no other details on the crash were immediately available 
ghulam ishaq khan chairman of the pakistani senate immediately 
took over as caretaker president under the pakistani constitution 
officials said khan the cabinet and three armed forces chiefs 
were meeting to discuss the situation a government statement said 
the senate chairman planned to address the nation later in the 
evening the government announced 10 days of official mourning 
it was not immediately clear what effect zias death would have 
on general elections scheduled for nov 16 
gen zia 64 took power in a 1977 military coup and ruled with 
an iron hand under martial law until december 1985 he began 
sharing power with a civilian government in early 1986 but fired 
the government again on may 29 saying it failed to maintain law 
and order and to enact islamic law 
the career military officer and us ally strongly supported 
afghan guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked marxist government of 
afghanistan and kept up his nations military strength to guard 
borders with india recently the soviet union warned pakistan to 
stop allowing arms intended for the afghan guerrillas to pass 
through pakistani territory 
zia took power from prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto in 1977 
arrested the cabinet and proclaimed martial law two years later 
he ordered his predecessor executed on charges of conspiracy to 
murder under his authoritarian rule mass arrests and floggings 
were frequent 
his rule was helped by geopolitics and luck the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan in 1979 led to more western aid and 
good harvests brought more food in the early 1980s 
in recent months however he faced an unprecedented challenge 
by the countrys increasingly unified political opposition led by 
benazir bhutto the daughter of the former prime minister 
ms bhutto leader of the opposition pakistan peoples party 
said from her karachi home she was satisfied that constitutional 
powers were being followed 
whatever should have been done has been done we are sure the 
changeover will be as smooth as possible ms bhutto said life 
and death is in the hand of god we will not say anything she 
said 
elsewhere in karachi pakistans largest city with a population 
of 9 million life appeared normal but people were buzzing about 
zias death 
there were no immediate reports of unusual military activity in 
pakistan after the presidents death was announced 
raphel 45 and a native of troy ny was named ambassador to 
the southeast asian country in january 1987 by president reagan 
it was his second assignment to the country he served there 
from 1975 to 1978 as political officer in the us embassy raphel 
played a key role in negotiations to end the us hostage crisis in 
iran in 1981 
vice president george bush said at a news conference in new 
orleans the site of the republican party convention that pakistan 
and the united states have a very special relationship and the 
loss of gen zia is a great tragedy 
he called raphel an outstanding ambassador i knew him well 
secretary of state george shultz said in new orleans that zia 
has been a great friend and a great fighter for freedom as 
well as a supporter of the efforts that finally brought the 
departure of the soviets out of afghanistan 
shultz added we in the us have had a long friendly strong 
relationship with that country that will continue in that way 
jeane kirkpatrick former us ambassador to the united nations 
said zias death raises doubts about pakistans ability to support 
the afghan rebels kirkpatrick interviewed on television from the 
republican convention said she was shocked by the news of 
zias death 
zia was a very strong person she said he was very 
important to the whole geopolitical strategic constellation of the 
region very important to the freedom fighters of afghanistan

q senator quayle you have backed senator domenicis budget 
proposal that calls for 22 billion in tax increases are you going 
to be at odds with the platform of the republicans that calls for 
no tax increases 
quayle absolutely not because lets face it we have economic 
growth today because of the reaganbush tax cuts 
and the vice president has pledged and i support him in that 
pledge that we are simply not going to raise taxes 
it would be foolhardy 
why would we want to raise taxes and try to send this economy 
into a downturn 
we have gotten economic growth through tax cuts 
q why did you support a budget that called for a tax increase 
in fiscal year 83 of 22 billion 
quayle that was the budget the domenici budget it was a 
compromise worked out and in the legislative process you have 
compromise but were there is no compromise on raising taxes 
q start of question inaudible senator quayle that you are 
going to lead the charge against the democrats and words like pit 
bull have been used and so forth without using those words is 
that true are you going to be leading the charge against the 
democrats 
quayle well thats a new description i am going to be working 
with the vice president and campaigning and articulating a very 
positive agenda of the future of family and preserving our 
freedoms and preserving our hope and opportunity 
now obviously i intend to point out what would happen if the 
party of mcgovern carter mondale and dukakis would somehow get 
back in power 
i think it would be a disaster

weve had a convention and will i think when it finishes that 
have one where talk has been much more specific than the other side 
and we will be telling the truth about where we want to lead 
this country spelling out my priorities and dan speaking to the 
issues and trying to challenge the democrats to do the same thing 
competence is important 
but ideology is very important 
and were going to be talking on both 
yes two here on the front 
q mr vice president would you tell us a little bit about how 
you first met dan quayle and how well youve known him since then 
bush ive known him for many years 
i campaigned for senator quayle back in the 70s 
quayle 1978 
bush i campaigned again with him when he ran for reelection

president pw botha said 
wednesday that jailed black leader nelson mandela reportedly 
suffering from tuberculosis is getting the best possible care in a 
hospital and wished him a speedy recovery 
botha in his first public comment on mandelas illness said 
the 70yearold african national congress leader was in a special 
category of his own and was receiving individualized attention 
exceeding the normal high standards of medical care provided by 
the prisons and health authorities 
the presidents remarks were made in a letter to the rev frank 
chikane a prominent black activist who had expressed concern about 
mandelas care 
we are even more concerned and do wish mr mandela a speedy 
recovery botha said in his letter the text was released by the 
presidents office 
mandela who has been jailed since 1962 is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the whiteruled 
government he was transferred friday to tygerberg hospital in cape 
town from nearby pollsmoor prison 
his lawyer ismail ayob announced wednesday that doctors 
diagnosed mandelas illness as tuberculosis hospital authorities 
have refused to confirm or deny this and said mandela asked them to 
withhold comment 
tygerbergs superintendent dr jgl strauss said wednesday 
that mandela had a good prognosis for complete recovery 
mandela was up and about and responding well to treatment 
strauss said adding that mandela was satisfied with his treatment 
chikane on behalf of the mandela family had urged authorities 
to allow an independent medical team to examine mandela hospital 
officials said mandela turned down such an offer 
botha said mandela is being treated by doctors that are 
internationally recognized as experts in their fields 
i am therefore of the opinion that the medical team presently 
in charge of the treatment and mr mandela be allowed jointly to 
decide on whether other medical assistance should be called in 
botha said 
the illness renewed speculation that the government might 
consider releasing mandela the government has given no indication 
of any change in its stance 
the african national congress is the major guerrilla 
organization fighting the government and its apartheid system of 
racial segregation 
botha suggested in 1986 that mandela whom many blacks consider 
their paramount leader could be released if he renounced violence 
mandela said he would do so only if the guerrilla movement was 
unbanned and apartheid was dismantled 
justice minister kobie coetsee who oversees the prison system 
said tuesday he was deeply perturbed by the reports of 
mandelas ill health 
the entire issue as well as steps to ensure a speedy 
recovery are receiving my personal attention coetsee said 
doctors say mandela is in satisfactory condition after removal 
of a drainage tube from his inflamed left lung strauss said 
mandela has been steadily improving since his admission 
but ayob said mandela was bedridden for most of the past two 
weeks 
his condition has been deteriorating for some time ayob 
said he was short of breath he had a persistent cough his 
speech had been impaired and by last friday he had lost his voice 
completely 
he looked very thin and suddenly looked very much older 
ayob said

q senator quayle listening to the democrats trying to knock 
you down very quickly and this morning they were attacking you as 
someone who says hes tough on defense but from your era you 
didnt fight in the vietnam war im wondering if you think that 
thats a low blow from them or if youd like to respond to them 
going on the attack on you on that matter 
quayle yes i do perceive that as being a cheap shot 
i have a deep affection for those men and women that sacrificed 
their lives in vietnam 
and anybody to imply anything differently is just simply wrong 
q but my point is mr bush was a war hero in world war ii 
youre tough on defense do you think its going to be a handicap 
in the campaign that you didnt fight in vietnam 
quayle no i do not 
q mr vice president some of your staff have been at pains to 
point out what a bold stroke your choice of senator quayle was how 
important was it for you to show that youre your own man a 
risktaker willing to take a bold stroke 
bush well i dont think its a great risk because i think 
that when the country sees what i have already seen and when the 
country understands why these senators with whom this man works are 
so high on him that they will see it as a very natural choice 
so i dont think as i went through the decisionmaking process 
i wasnt i wasnt compelled to say ive got to do something bold 
or something different 
i went through a serious process 
i hope i did it in a dignified way 
i think we had control of the situation and as i the more i 
thought about it the more i thought this was the best possible 
choice i could make 
right here yes sir

conservative spokesmen on wednesday blessed 
the political union of george bush and dan quayle and said their 
sometimes divergent groups are united behind the 1988 republican 
presidential ticket 
paul weyrich of the free congress foundation said he thought the 
selection of quayle a conservative senator from indiana as bushs 
vice presidential running mate would boost the tickets prospects 
for winning 
i think the odds have gone from about 7030 against george 
bushs election to about 5050 weyrich said at a news conference 
attended by other conservative spokesmen 
weyrich said he was not swayed to support the republican ticket 
until after the adoption of the partys platform and bushs 
decision to choose quayle 
when i came here i was not sure i was going to leave with 
wholehearted support for the ticket he said 
quayles conservative credentials could compensate for some 
voters initial prejudice against him because of his wealth 
weyrich said 
former delaware gov pete du pont who ran for the 1988 gop 
presidential nomination and lost said he was delighted at 
quayle being added to the ticket 
all of us are here to celebrate a conservative ticket that 
espouses the principles that ronald reagan brought to our party in 
1980 du pont said 
others attending the news conference included don devine of 
citizens for free america and dr robert grant of christian voice

los angeles is having an identity crisis of 
monumental proportion 
a 40 million monument sort of statue of liberty west will 
be built downtown to greet those who drive into the citys core 
the airspace has already been donated money is no problem if 
corporate sponsors come through but how do you capture the mood of 
los angeles in a way that will make everyone happy 
more than 150 designs were submitted to an international blue 
ribbon panel appointed by mayor tom bradley the members reduced 
the choices to five on tuesday and will pare that to one by nov 6 
los angeles has an identity but we dont know eactly how to 
show this identity said french panelist roland schweitzer we

machinelike structure said to fit in with the automobile culture 
of los angeles that includes a giant video screen facing drivers a 
building offering live performances a library food stands and one 
emphasizing global communications complete with cinemas and

create a landmark visible for miles that will drown out traffic 
noise 
then there is the lineal structure projecting the historical

brought here as a material witness against younis was questioned 
about his identification of the defendant at a courtordered lineup 
earlier this year

the blue cross and blue shield health 
insurance plans reduced their payments to hospitals by 48 billion 
over a threeyear period as a result of cost containment 
strategies according to a study issued wednesday 
one significance of the study is that it tends to counter the 
common assumption that changes in the way the federal government 
reimbursed hospitals for medicare patients starting in 1983 would 
result in hospitals recouping losses from private payors such as 
blue cross 
about 40 percent of all hospital bills in the united states are 
paid by medicare the health insurance program for the disabled and 
people over 65 years of age 
but rather than turn to private insurors to recover losses from 
medicare payments the study suggested the same efficiencies 
imposed on hospital practices by medicare were reflected in the way 
private patients were treated as well 
under the prospective payment system medicare launched in 1983 
hospitals are paid a flat amount for certain procedures no matter 
what the actual cost is 
for example the medicare scale might call for four days 
hospitalization for a certain procedure and pay accordingly if a 
particular patient needs to stay five days the hospital absorbs 
the additional cost if a patient can be discharged after only 
three days the hospital gets to keep the additional money 
richard scheffler a california health economist who conducted 
the study covering the years 1983 to 1986 said hospitals tended 
to apply the guidelines set under medicares prospective payment 
system to their private patients as well 
it the prospective payment system ended up profoundly 
changing the overall operation of the hospital scheffler told a 
news conference 
he said some of the savings realized by blue cross and blue 
shield plans resulted from medicaredriven changes at hospitals and 
some from the private insurorss own costcontainment strategies 
for example the study found blue cross and blue shield plan 
customers had approximately 23 million fewer hospital admissions 
from october 1983 to the end of 1986 due to management techniques 
than in the previous threeyear period 
scheffler professor of health economics and public policy at 
the university of california berkeley also said the total number 
of days spent in hospitals by blue cross and blue shield customers 
was down by an estimated 167 million during the same period 
the blue cross and blue shield strategies ranged from reviewing 
the need for hospital stays to requiring a second opinion for 
certain surgical procedures said scheffler

the united states exploded a nuclear 
device wednesday as soviet scientists exercised their right to 
watch under a treaty allowing the superpowers to monitor each 
others tests 
dust rose and the desert rippled at ground zero as the test 
codenamed kearsarge exploded 2012 feet under the mesa at 10 am 
pdt 
us and soviet diplomats scientists and military officials in 
the topsecret nevada test site control center 30 miles away saw 
the surface effects on television monitors but did not feel ground 
motion 
thirty seconds after detonation viktor mikhailov leader of the 
soviet technical team took a telephone call and raised his right 
hand with an ok signal indicating the soviets had received the 
data they were seeking the signal was greeted with applause 
nick aquilina manager of the nevada operations office which 
conducts the us nuclear testing program smiled and shook hands 
with scientists 
everything appears successful so far he told reporters 
later 
james magruder the us test controller called it a 
resounding success 
observers included diplomats who helped forge the agreement in 
geneva last year igor palenykh head of the soviet delegation to 
the talks his deputy gen sergei zelentsov deputy head of the 
soviet delegation and us ambassador c paul robinson 
the test was a step down the road to a more stable world 
robinson said how far we go depends on what we negotiate on the 
weapons themselves i hope we can take the process to the point 
where there is no need for weapons at all 
palenykh told reporters before the test that the soviet unions 
goal is a ban on testing 
as far as the soviet union is concerned we are prepared at any 
time to cease nuclear testing along with the united states 
palenykh said through an interpreter 
the 25 million test was designed to determine the ability of 
each country to accurately measure the others nuclear tests in 
order to preventing cheating on treaties signed in 1974 and 1976 
limiting the size of tests to 150 kilotons 
both sides have accused the other of exceeding the limits 
the soviet union had 45 nuclear scientists engineers and 
diplomats on hand a similar number of american scientists will be 
on hand for a soviet test at the russian site at semipalatinsk on 
sept 14 
us and soviet scientists monitored the test with equipment 
placed in trailers a few hundred yards from ground zero the 
trailers were unmanned at the time of detonation 
the trailer areas are fenced and armed guards check those 
entering and leaving signs on the fences state security area 
deadly force authorized 
americans may enter the soviets trailer area at the soviets 
invitation 
president reagan first suggested such a verification test in a 
united nations speech four years ago the tests were finally agreed 
to by reagan and general secretary mikhail gorbachev at the 
washington summit in december 
soviet scientists were at the nevada test site when six tests 
were conducted earlier this year but kearsarge was the first event 
in which they were involved 
the test was the ninth conducted at the site this year and the 
684th announced shot there since 1951 
systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a key 
in ratifying the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 
peaceful nuclear explosions treaty both pacts limit nuclear tests 
to 150 kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceeding 
those limits 
the superpowers are testing their own systems to measure the 
size of the tests the us uses a system called corrtex 
continuous reflectometry for radius versus time experiment which 
measures the speed of the underground shock wave the soviets use 
similar systems to see if they obtain the same data 
the nevada test site has been the scene of large antinuclear 
protests but only about 20 antinuclear protesters were present 
when reporters entered the facilitys gates one protester sat down 
in front of a bus but was quickly dragged to the side of the road

egypt said wednesday it would put all its 
resources behind the palestine liberation organization and 
president hosni mubarak said the plo should establish a provisional 
palestinian government 
after a meeting between foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid and 
a highlevel plo delegation the two sides said they agreed on the 
plos options and would have further consulations 
president mubarak has reaffirmed that the palestinian cause 
has egypts complete support and that it is at the forefront of 
egyptian interests abdelmeguid said after a 90minute meeting 
the last after three days of talks with the plo delegation 
the group included mahmoud abbas and abdullah horani members of 
the plos executive committee and hani alhassan a political 
adviser to plo leader yasser arafat they met with mubarak on 
tuesday and planned to leave thursday 
egyptian television quoted abbas as saying that mubarak agreed 
tuesday that the plo should establish a provisional palestinian 
government in the israelioccupied territories that would draw up 
an internationally acceptable political program 
plo officials have said a provisional government would be ready 
to recognize israel in exchange for its recognition of a 
palestinian state in the occupied territories 
asked when an announcement of a palestinian government could be 
made abbas said any plan would first have to be presented to the 
palestine national council 
the council combining representatives from all plo factions is 
the legislative arm that makes all major policy decisions it is 
expected to meet in algeria next month 
abdelmeguid said egypt would continue consultations with the 
plo and stressed that coordination among egypt jordan and 
palestinian was still necessary 
asked about what egypt thought of a palestinian 
governmentinexile abdelmeguid said egypt will support what 
the palestinians decide upon 
horani agreed and said the talks with the foreign minister were 
on the basis of our meeting with president mubarak and his 
directives to put egypts resources at the disposal of the plo 
the palestinian delegation arrived monday from amman capital of 
jordan where they discussed with king hussein his decision to hand 
to the plo full responsibility for the west bank and gaza strip 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the plo reportedly is debating whether to declare a state in the 
occupied lands home to about 15 million palestinians it is also 
considering whether to establish a provisional government or a 
governmentinexile 
abbas who is also known as abumazen said the political 
program would explain to the world the rational and logical plo 
objectives so as to corner the enemies of our peoples independence 
and selfdetermination 
he apparently referred to israel whose prime minister yitzhak 
shamir opposes palestinian selfdetermination that might lead to 
the creation of an independent palestinian state

a research project to find ways of killing the 
asian cockroach a pest that invaded florida two years ago has not 
been ended and will continue at least through the next fiscal year

ralph a bram head of research on insects affecting humans and 
animals for the departments agricultural research service said 
the agency has not closed out any research program aimed at 
controlling these pests

parents educators lawyers and doctors 
marshalled forces wednesday against corporal punishment in schools 
weve reached the point of critical mass said robert 
fathman chairman of a coalition of 23 medical legal and 
educational organizations holding the first conference of its kind 
in more than a decade 
describing corporal punishment as a barbaric carryover from 
the days of charles dickens fathman said its no longer a 
question of whether well be able to abolish the practice but 
when 
eleven states and a number of school districts ranging in size 
from chicagos to that of seaford del have outlawed corporal 
punishment in schools since new jersey became the first to do so in 
1867 
explaining the conference theme the time is now fathman 
noted five states have passed measures banning the practice since 
1984 six legislatures have bills pending and six states will face 
the issue during their 1989 sessions 
keynote speaker bob keeshan known to millions of children as 
tvs captain kangaroo called corporal punishment a failed 
practice it rates an f because it does not meet its stated 
purpose of maintaining discipline because it treats the symptoms 
and not the cause of the underlying unruly behavior 
with that behavior a child is crying out help me help me 
and we answer with the compassion of the paddle said keeshan 
seventy years ago the soviet union outlawed the practice 
and it is the same now in virtually every country in the civilized 
world he said are we so backward that we havent learned what 
all these countries already know 
the purpose of the threeday conference that opened wednesday 
fathman said is to provide organizational skills and information 
to parents educators and other interested parties so they can 
effectively campaign at local and state levels to eliminate the 
practice in schools 
signs of progress are everywhere said fathman head of the 
national coalition to abolish corporal punishment in schools 
the little rock school district has banned corporal 
punishment and that in arkansas the worst state where 14 
percent of the students are paddled each year 
according to the us department of education more than a 
million incidents of corporal punishment are reported in public 
schools each year ranging from paddling to confining students in 
small spaces such as closets 
fathman said black children who represent 16 percent of the 
schoolage population make up 32 percent of those punished and 
that children in the deep south are 4000 times more likely to be 
paddled than their counterparts in the northeast where 
connecticut is the only state without a law barring the practice 
in a joint statement preceeding the opening of the conference 
the american medical association the american bar association the 
american academy of pediatrics and the american psychological 
association denounced corporal punishment and called for 
legislators to ban it 
conference participants said they expected their efforts would 
continue to be met with stiff resistance 
a study several years back found that 90 percent of parents 
use corporal punishment in their own homes said adrienne haeuser 
of the national association of social workers that tells us 
weve got a lot of educating to do

q senator quayle given your original reluctance to support the 
inf treaty and given your deep questions about the verification 
issues can you support a 50 percent reduction in strategic arms as 
the administration is now supporting 
quayle i support the ongoing arms control process and the 
positions that have been put on the table 
i believe that the arms control process and the inf treaty 
which i ultimately voted in favor of is a good process and i think 
the inf treaty seeing an actual reduction and the elimination of 
certain classes of weapons is a positive step 
i also believe that the lesson that should be learned from the 
inf treaty and this should carry over to the start treaty is that 
to get the soviet union to the bargaining table and to get any 
movement in arms control we have to have an adequate investment in 
national security 
bush way over in the far side no behind you over there got 
to give the standing room only crowd 
q thank you very much vice president inaudible new york 
mr vice president your last intervention in united nations at the 
inaudible was wonderful and very positive and the majority of 
ambassadors say it after your intervention question when youll 
be elected president of united states do you think its necessary 
to change the international system of un by the new inaudible 
more effective 
bush well id like to see changes in the united nations 
ive always favored charter reform 
it is very hard to accomplish when you have a vetoholding power 
like the soviet union 
but i am not a un basher 
i think it has a useful role to play and were seeing it playing 
such a role in the iraniraq controversy 
but i would not i dont agree with governor dukakis that every 
time a foreign policy crisis arrives we should turn it over to the 
united nations

a human rights group urged soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev to tell the truth about the 1968 
invasion of prague and name the czech leaders who allegedly invited 
the troops into their country 
we call on the soviet leadership to provide an open space 
for the factual assessment of the events of 1968 and to reach the 
appropriate conclusions charter 77 said in a statement 
according to palach press an emigre publishing house in london 
the charter 77 group said the military crackdown by troops and 
tanks from five warsaw pact nations on aug 2021 1968 the 
largest military operation in europe since world war ii had a 
direct influence on the way we live now 
the soviet union should admit its shared responsibility for 
the recent czechoslovak predicament it should do so not only in 
the interests of czechoslovakia but also for the sake of the 
credibility of its new policies charter 77 said 
the invasion crushed a movement of economic and political 
reforms espoused by alexander dubcek the communist party leader 
during the prague spring of 1968 since then czechs seemingly have 
been reluctant to renew their support for such reforms 
charter 77 also demanded in its statement that the names of 
czech leaders who allegedly invited the troops into their country 
be made public 
the soviet union bulgaria hungary poland and east germany 
published a statement in 1968 saying their troops were invited into 
czechoslovakia by leaders who were never publicly identified 
gustav husak a supporter of the 1968 reforms took over the 
communist party leadership from dubcek in 1969 milos jakes a 1968 
official who later oversaw a purge of half a million alleged 
supporters of dubcek succeeded husak in december 1987 
politburo member vasil bilak head of the communist party in 
1968 lost his post and was denounced as a soviet collaborator 
after the invasion he regained a powerful position in november 
1968 and still wields great influence 
gorbachev is subjecting the preceding era to extensive 
criticism the activists said and making czech leaders installed 
under leonid i brezhnev more and more isolated abroad and at 
home 
the group urged czechoslovakias 155 million citizens to 
shake off the burden of fear and speak openly about the events of 
1968 
the government is succumbing to panic the statement said 
since the government derives all its legitimacy from the 
authority of brezhnevs tanks it rejects almost in desperation any 
truthful account of what happened twenty years ago 
the invasion became de facto an overture to the later war in 
afghanistan to the suppression of solidarity in poland and to the 
policy of intimidation in general the statement said 
three charter 77 spokesmen signed the 1000word statement and 
planned to deliver it to the soviet embassy in prague on saturday 
if they are not detained by then several leading dissidents have 
received police warnings to leave prague during the anniversary 
weekend 
among charter 77s praguebased spokesmen are prominent 
activists milos hajek and bohumir janat

george bushs strategists portray the selection 
of sen dan quayle as his running mate as a bold bid for the 
nations younger generation but analysts warned wednesday that as 
a voting bloc the baby boom could prove a bust 
the problem is that the nations roughly 75 million baby boomers 
make up too large a segment of the population to fit into one 
ideological category experts said generational links do not 
necessarily mean shared politics 
they have different life experiences and certainly different 
values from their elders said democratic pollster peter hart 
but theyre such large share of the american population they 
cross all income occupational and ideological lines 
bush and his aides touted the 41yearold quayle as the first 
member of the baby boom generation usually defined as americans 
born after world war ii and before 1965 to run on a majorparty 
ticket for national office 
do i need help in this area sure said bush and have i 
gotten it by the selection of a young experienced united states 
senator i think so campaign chief james baker called it a 
bold stroke across generations 
but some cautioned that the stroke may prove too broad in 
general the baby boomers have not voted as a bloc said 
republican pollster neil newhouse moreover young people have 
never reliably voted he said 
quayle may be able to improve turnout among the onethird of 
baby boomers who already identify with the republican party 
newhouse said but he and others said the next step drawing new 
adherents may prove more difficult 
will it encourage younger democrats younger independents to 
cross party lines for a candidate of their generation who 
knows he said but theres a shot at that happening 
public policy researcher edward h crane president of the cato 
institute in washington said he doubted it while baby boomers are 
a diverse group he said they share some attributes that do not 
dovetail with quayles 
as a proponent of deregulation entrepreneurship and low taxes 
quayle fits on the economic stuff pretty well crane said but 
he said quayles foreign policy views are more hawkish and his 
social views more conservative than those of many babyboomers 
he doesnt have that combination of views that i would argue 
is unique to baby boomers said crane whose group which is 
nonpartisan has been a leader in analyzing the babyboom 
generation so he wont be able to appeal to a large group of 
them 
republican pollster linda divall said quayle could have an 
impact so long as it was not overstated 
i dont think anyone is saying that dan quayle singlehandedly 
is going to deliver the baby boom generation she said on the 
cbs this morning television program but i think its first 
time that either of the major parties has made an absolute gesture 
of basically passing the torch a couple of generations and saying 
this is the future leader of our party this is the way were 
going to go 
there are openings for quayle hart who studied the baby boom 
generation for rolling stone magazine said that younger adults 
could find it easier to relate to him at least in terms of 
appearance and metaphor and newhouse noted that baby boomers are 
less strongly committed to either political party than are older 
americans 
it goes beyond whether you are liberal or moderate or 
conservative to what kind of concerns you have newhouse said 
if he can demonstrate shared concerns over the things the baby 
boom generation is concerned about such as day care and 
education then he can have a tremendous impact

the city should use horse sense not just 
temperature readings to decide when the weathers too much for 
carriage horses a city lawmaker said wednesday 
regulations require that horses be given a day off when the 
temperature reaches 90 degrees humidity is not a factor although 
it should be city council majority leader peter vallone said 
a furor erupted after whitey a 9yearold gelding collapsed 
sunday en route from central park to his stable blocks away he has 
since recovered although the aspca has ordered him to stop working 
for 30 days 
on wednesday vallone and councilman robert dryfoos held a news 
conference along central park south where the carriages 
congregate to decry the horses working conditions 
it is time for city officials and the public to reach out and 
take extra steps to protect these animals not only for humane 
reasons but because they are an important symbol to the flavor and 
charm of this city said vallone 
i think today is the beginning of fantastic negotiations 
said grace randall a nurse who saw whitey collapse and helped save 
him 
but carriage drivers noting that race tracks allow horses to 
run even when its 100 degrees said they feel like scapegoats 
i had a woman come up to me yesterday and tell me id die in a 
rotten hell said eva haws driver of 6yearold bubba ive 
had people throw things at me spit on me push me 
wellintentioned ignorance is the most dangerous kind 
would i work in a business where there is outrageous cruelty 
im a vegetarian i belong to greenpeace and the antivivisection 
movement said ms haws adding that bubba gets to stop working 
when its 89 degrees and humid 
i watch the horses reactions at all times it doesnt have to 
be 90 degrees i know when the horse is in stress said the 
driver of 10yearold katie who wouldnt give his name 
drivers said long hot spell has caused them financial hardship 
business is pretty bad weve lost a lot of income said 
george corler driver of 9yearold fred a lot of people live 
off this 
katies driver said his business had dropped 60 percent because 
of the heat spell i just suffer it out thats all he said 
if the law says 90 degrees then thats it 
vallone and dryfoos urged the public to complain to police and 
drivers if they see carriage horses being worked in the extreme 
heat 
they also called for horse shelters and watering stations near 
central park 
one city official and a veterinarian are assigned to enforce the 
carriage horse ordinances but they dont work weekends 
primarily the task is left to eight aspca agents who are 
already overburdened in enforcing all animal rights laws throughout 
the city said vallone 
dryfoos said he is drafting a new ordinance to be introduced 
next fall covering such issues as weather rest and watering 
periods

two men walked in a grocery 
store wednesday and fatally shot its owner police said two groups 
claimed responsibility for the killing 
police identified the victim as frederick otley 44 who was 
working in a rear storeroom of his store in a protestant section of 
belfast when the gunmen entered and asked for the owner when otley 
appeared they shot him several times and fled police said 
the irish national liberation army an extreme marxist offshoot 
of the irish republican army claimed responsibility for the 
shooting in a statement to the british broadcasting corp in 
belfast 
but the irish news a belfast newspaper said it received a 
statement claiming responsibility from the irish revolutionary 
brigade a group previously unheard of in northern ireland 
both news organizations said the statements they received were 
accompanied by authenticating passwords 
in 1985 otley was accused by an informer of terrorist crimes on 
behalf of the protestant paramilitary ulster volunteer force and 
was charged with a bombing at a social club which was meant to kill 
a force member during an interorganization feud 
the charges were dropped when the informer retracted his 
statement 
the british domestic agency press association reported that the 
murder may have been in retaliation for protestant guerrillas 
killings of two catholics last week in belfast 
seamus morris 18 and peter dolan 25 were gunned down in a 
shopping center in the catholic ardoyne area of north belfast the 
protestant action force reportedly linked with the ulster 
volunteer force claimed responsibility 
the ira has been fighting to drive the british from the 
protestantdominated province and unite it with the overwhelmingly 
catholic irish republic under socialist rule

leonard bernstein says the only gift he 
wants for his 70th birthday is more time to write music 
i have everything i am blessed and grateful the nations 
bestknown conductor and composer said i have no further 
requests of fate except time 
of course id like to see a few more grandchildren he 
added 
the composer of west side story and candide held a rare 
news conference at the tanglewood music center where he began his 
conducting career 
the music festival is preparing a fourday extravaganza next 
week in honor of the illustrious graduates birthday among the 
performers at the birthday night performance aug 25 will be such 
friends as actress lauren bacall and diva beverly sills 
bernstein played down the festivities that tanglewood officials 
have promised will be one of the music worlds great occasions 
im not celebrating anything im just at tanglewood he 
said chainsmoking and sweating after a vigorous hour spent 
conducting the tanglewood student orchestra in his songfest in 
preparation for sundays performance 
the flamboyant maestro wearing his trademark red bandanna 
necktie forbade any mention of the word birthday saying 
every time someone says that word i feel a year older 
the celebration comes in the middle of a busy schedule for 
bernstein who has recently returned from conducting songfest 
in the soviet union he will tour at least 20 more cities by 
december 
despite his busy schedule however he said his chief aim was to 
write the tons of music i havent written yet 
he refused to talk about the pieces he is working on except to 
say he was collaborating with choreographer martha graham on a 
ballet and taking musical risks with his recent obsession with 
voice 
he recently conducted puccinis la boheme in rome with a 
cast of young americans 
ive always associated boheme with greenwich village and my 
life as a young bohemian he said bernstein was a member of the 
original tanglewood music center class of 1940 where he became a 
protege of tanglewood founder serge koussevitzky 
i feel i built the bloody place he said wednesday 
when koussevitzky retired in 1949 he tried to have the young 
bernstein named as his successor the boston symphony orchestras 
trustees however considered bernstein too young and tainted by 
popular music 
bernstein declined wednesday to sum up his prodigious 
accomplishments as recording artist conductor composer and 
musician 
thats your problem he told the 50 reporters and admirers 
at the news conference im too busy i cant think about things 
like that to assess myself or to place myself in various 
categories of ranks or to decide whether ive achieved everything 
or a portion or a fraction 
i feel as though ive lived many many lifetimes more than 
i had any right to expect

north korean and south korean 
delegates will meet friday to prepare for a joint parliamentary 
session on a nonaggression pact and the communist nations demand 
to be a cohost the olympics 
south koreas national assembly said north koreas supreme 
peoples assembly agreed wednesday by telephone to send five 
delegates to the truce village of panmunjom 
the meeting will be the first between the two nations in three 
years 
the last time was in december 1985 at red cross talks but the 
north shelved all dialogue in early 1986 to protest regular 
military exercises between south korea and the united states 
the latest flurry of overtures began july 21 when north korea 
proposed a joint session of the two parliaments to draft a 
nonaggression pact that was followed by another proposal that 
olympics issues be added to the meeting 
north korea has said it will boycott the sept 17oct 2 
olympics unless it is allowed to be a cohost south korea and 
international olympics officials rejected the demand but have 
offered several compromise proposals 
north korea originally proposed this weeks meeting be held 
wednesday but south korea suggested the switch to friday to avoid 
dampening celebrations marking a 30day countdown to the olympics 
south koreas opposition parties welcomed north koreas 
agreement 
we hope the southnorth parliamentary talks would provide an 
opportunity for realizing national unification said a message 
from the main opposition party for peace and democracy 
in wednesdays telephone message north korea did not mention 
its earlier demand for fullfledged parliamentary talks according 
to sources in the south korean assembly the two sides have been in 
disagreement over pyongyangs demand to include all representatives 
in the main legislative conference 
north korea also says fridays meeting should discuss only 
logistical arrangements for larger talks south korea wants to take 
up procedural matters including the agenda and the number of 
participants for the full negotiations 
the conflicting stands cast doubt on the prospects of main 
parliamentary talks between the two koreas left divided in 1945 at 
the end of world war ii 
south korean government officials have expressed doubts over the 
north korean proposal some officials interpreted it as an attempt 
to stir unrest before the olympics or to find an excuse to skip the 
games

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen zigzagged across texas looking for conservative votes 
wednesday and he flexed his muscles at the prospect of his matchup 
with sen dan quayle on the republican ticket 
back in washington bentsens office released financial 
statements showing his grossincome averaged 772181 annually over 
the past five years including more than 1 million in 1983 
medical records made public at the same time showed bentsen was 
in generally good health 
bentsen flew west from fort worth to meet with farmers and 
ranchers at a wool warehouse in san angelo and speak at a historic 
western fort he then viewed a medicinebytelevision project in 
lubbock and planned to return to east texas at days end 
i know that this county is principally republican bentsen 
told the 250 people at fort concho in san angelo i also know 
that lloyd bentsen carried this county by 58 percent last time 
he turned to the more difficult task of selling democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis to his fellow texans bentsen 
said his selection as the massachusetts governors running mate 
showed that dukakis was reaching out ready to listen to 
differing viewpoints 
bentsen also implied that george bush who was born in new 
england but claims houston as his home was not a real texan 
there is only one on the ticket who was born and reared on a 
farm in texas he told the crowd 
bentsen was accompanied during the day by rep charles stenholm 
of texas a leader of the band of conservative democrats in 
congress who supported president reagan in his first term 
stenholm told the san angelo meeting that bentsen was the only 
person on either ticket with tractorseat common sense the 
congressman didnt even mention the liberal dukakis name 
at texas tech bentsen took part in a demonstration of a twoway 
television hookup that enables doctors at the medical center to 
help diagnose and treat patients in rural areas where medical care 
is scarce 
bentsen said he helped win financing for the project in 
congress he decried the loss of 23 rural hospitals in texas in the 
past year a trend he said he was trying to stop as chairman of the 
senate finance committee by changing the rules governing federal 
hospital assistance 
bentsen seemed to relish the prospect of debating quayle tapped 
as bushs vice presidential running mate on oct 11 in omaha 
neb if quayle accepts the challenge 
i guess well have an early season on quail he told 
reporters 
bentsen 67 dismissed questions about the youth factor 
represented by the 41yearold quayle bentsen said he had worked 
out with weights on a treadmill in his hotel room wednesday 
morning and had increased his usual fourpound barbells to five 
pounds 
its not the miles on you its the depth of the tread he 
said implying that he considers quayle a political lightweight 
bentsens office released medical records which showed the 
senator was in generally good health although he was treated for 
high cholesterol and two small skin lesions 
reporters joked with bentsens wife ba that the doctors 
would report hed have the body of a 41yearold 
you bet she replied no question about it

q senator quayle id like to ask both of you this question 
but senator quayle you are it has been quoted that your net worth 
is 200 million is this correct and if so isnt this going to 
put off the blue collar 
bush why do you think i chose him laughter 
q isnt this going to off the blue collar vote and the low 
income vote 
quayle that figure is not correct and believe me you have 
caused me a lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about 
that 
and we will be releasing all of our tax returns and youll be 
able to figure out that its far less than what you said 
yes sir 
q mr vice president youve been very critical of governor 
dukakis for not being specific enough now that youve chosen a 
running mate will you be specific about how many times youll 
debate governor dukakis and in what forums 
bush well be addressing ourselves to the debate question very 
soon 
there will be debates 
im going to ask jim baker to initiate the discussions and i 
thought there was a little presumptuous to go charging forward 
before you even are officially nominated by the party 
yes sir 
q mr vice president as you reviewed your contenders the 
candidates for the office how important were the qualities of 
loyalty and compatibility to you 
bush well i said ahead of time before i selected senator 
quayle that there should be some philosophical compatibility 
now there are some issues where he and have differed and 
probably will differ but hes known for his frankness 
hell be able to come down if im elected and open that door to 
the oval office as i can do today and give me his judgment 
and thats what i want 
but we arent going off on two entirely different directions 
like the democratic ticket 
and well be presenting a unified forwardlooking message on 
the economy and on world peace and on education and these key 
priorities for the american people 
we wont have to debate each other so that the american people 
understand these differ norm

residents of dan quayles hometown are 
beaming with pride shaking off their surprise and putting partisan 
politics aside as they prepare a welcome for the gops soontobe 
vice presidential candidate 
with george bushs selection of quayle as his running mate 
huntingtons favorite son became overnight the favorite of gop 
delegates from thousands of american hometowns 
im really happy to see a younger person get involved said 
maxine miller a republican and 42year resident of huntington i 
think the country needs that 
delegates to the republican national convention in new orleans 
will ratify quayles selection after formally handing bush the 
presidential nomination wednesday 
huntingtons 16000 residents will get their first glimpse of 
quayle as a vice presidential candidate when he returns friday with 
bush for a noon ceremony at the courthouse 
by wednesday afternoon the town was shaking off its surprise 
that the 41yearold quayle had bested competition from older and 
betterknown candidates 
i guess sen robert dole and rep jack kemp werent my 
choices and i didnt think it would be a woman said ms miller 
over lunch nicks kitchen where quayle often stops for coffee 
you dont hear bad things about him around the town or the 
county 
during his two terms in the house and eight years in the senate 
quayle appears to have ruffled few feathers back home even among 
democrats 
im sure well have a good turn out friday said mayor ron 
schenkel a democrat and quayles former high school classmate 
its not going to be just a republican rally im sure i wont be 
the only democrat there 
russell j mccurdy 71 a retired marine corps lieutenant 
colonel says hes another likely democratic voter who will attend 
the rally more power to a local man that has made good and done 
good he said 
but the staunch conservatism of the quayle family and of the 
heraldpress newspaper published by his father does raise the 
partisan wrath of some including ray ade a retired democratic 
circuit court judge 
i know his father nice man fine fellow but ive never 
heard dan say a decent word about a democrat and thats about the 
way i feel about him said ade theres nothing wrong about 
dan but ive never heard anything great about him either 
despite the election of an occasional democrat huntington is a 
politically conservative city built by irish and german immigrants 
and dependent on light industry for jobs since the erielackawana 
railroad failed says michael v perkins the managing editor of 
the heraldpress 
quayles father james owns the paper and quayle himself 
worked as business manager in the 1970s before entering politics 
i think the community is surprised and proud and looking 
forward for the opportunity to put its best foot forward perkins 
said 
virgyle hougendobler an electrical contractor who rewired the 
quayle home when the senator was a boy remembers the youthful 
quayle as quickminded 
he was always curious he was always around behind you seeing 
what was going on he said 
in later years hougendobler said he was always kind of fun 
to run into because his mind was always running 
schenkel says he wasnt among quayles close friends in high 
school but remembers him as a normal student 
he liked to raise hell like all of us at that age and have a 
good time he said he was just a regular guy

a drunken soldier on leave 
accidentally exploded a hand grenade at a rural funeral killing 
himself and 12 civilians and wounding 20 others authorities said 
wednesday 
the grenade went off tuesday night in a home full of mourners on 
the outskirts of santiago de maria about 70 miles east of the 
capital said defense ministry spokesman col jose galileo torres 
speaking by telephone torres identified the soldier as hector 
tulio garcia mendoza he said the soldier was on leave and drunk at 
the time 
torres said the army tries to prevent soldiers from taking 
weapons when they go on leave but they always manage to take 
them out for their own protection when they visit their hometowns 
where the guerrillas know them 
many soldiers on home leave have been killed by rebels torres 
said 
the usbacked government has been fighting a war against 
leftist guerrillas for nine years with an estimated 65000 people 
killed mostly civilians 
a police source in santiago de maria said by telephone that the 
grenade went off tuesday night in a home where a childs wake was 
being held the child died earlier in the day of natural causes 
authorities gave no details on why the soldier pulled the pin 
from the grenade 
the soldier belonged to the armys 6th infantry brigade the 
source said speaking on condition of anonymity the unit is 
deployed in that area of usulutan province because of frequent 
activity by leftist guerrillas 
the explosion killed the soldier and 10 civilians almost 
instantly the source said he said two more civilians died soon 
after and 20 people were wounded

they say they eat food from garbage cans get 
their clothes in thrift stores and wander the country taking 
their politics seriously 
they might be called modernday hobos but they call themselves 
anarchists and at the republican national convention which has 
drawn few protesters this band stands out 
we dont think our lifestyle is appropriate for everyone 
says mark kynik of new orleans but we do think people should 
take control of their communities and resources the land the 
oil banks and use it for the good of all not just a few 
thats what anarchy is about he said 
anarchists see nothing good in american politics they also 
protested last month in atlanta at the democratic national 
convention about 30 are in town for the gop convention 
the group most in their early 20s say there are many more like 
them across the nation many met during the great peace march of 
1986 and have been protesting ever since 
their appearance in new orleans has made little impact it is 
likely that only a few if any delegates noticed 
the group staged one demonstration at a city park this week 
watched by a few policemen and a reporter or two it was 
guerrilla theater with the members banging pots with sticks 
then they destroyed a television set to smash illusions created 
by the media 
at another demonstration about 20 of them marched in the middle 
of rushhour traffic toward the superdome where the gop convention 
was being held 
karen eliot 21 who described herself as an army brat 
originally from north carolina said she became an anarchist after 
she dropped out of college to selfeducate herself 
this lifestyle is so much healthier to me there is no one 
telling you what to do she said as she took a break between 
protests and rolled a cigarette 
in new orleans many of them say they are staying at a house 
with steve vermont 22 sleeping on floors with blankets 
most of us know each other through anarchist networks says 
vermont in the winter a lot of us settle in one place maybe 
work as a janitor or dishwasher and save half the money then in 
the summer we travel 
they also sell their blood to blood banks and panhandle and 
dumpster dive gathering dayold bread and vegetables from 
trash bins behind restaurants and supermarkets the trash cans also 
are good source for clothes they favor tshirts jeans and 
militarystyle boots 
the anarchists do not seem miffed that few people appear to be 
heeding their message 
we work pretty quietly vermont said we dont have a 
party line or a rap were asking people to think for themselves 
you cant get that message across in five seconds on tv

q mr vice president president reagan ran pretty well among 
young people in 1984 and you havent what makes you think that 
the problem is just a lack of youth on the ticket 
bush i think i have 
i think i did well with young people in primaries 
i think we won the nomination earlier than a lot of us 
collectively thought id win it 
and you go back and analyze it i think youll see i did very 
well amongst young people 
now wait a minute do i need help in this area 
sure and have i gotten it by the selection of a young 
experienced united states senator i think so 
q well let me 
bush way in the back 
q mr vice president are you going to send senator quayle to 
the middle west and is that going to be the campaign battleground 
bush it there will not be a simple regional program where he 
spends all his time in one area and i spend my time in another but 
i feel that he can be extraordinarily helpful in the middle west 
we havent been in the back of the room yes sir 
q mr vice president you have said that its going to look 
like a fight between two pit bulls weve already seen governor 
dukakis referred to as a diminutive clerk or as pee wee herman is 
it going to get worse than that 
bush no i dont think either senator quayle or i will be that 
colorful rhetorically 
and i recall being on the receiving end of a barb or two at the 
democratic national convention 
didnt hurt much like getting hit with a marshmallow out there 
but i think all we have to do is talk about the issues and ill 
be doing a little of that in my speech tomorrow and both the 
senator and i will be doing a lot of that in the campaign 
and if we can spell it out if we can compel him to be as 
specific as i have been and as both of us will be then i think we 
will have made real headway 
you dont have to resort to namecalling out of the democratic 
convention or out of the republican convention

president raif dizdarevic said 
inflation is continuing at a runaway 190 percent this year it was 
reported wednesday 
statistics officials took issue with dizdarevics figures 
saying the annual rate of inflation actually has decreased compared 
with last year 
in a speech at a bosnian industrial town delivered monday 
dizdarevic said prices in the first seven months of this year had 
been rising at a rate of about 190 percent the official tanjug 
news agency reported 
the government had hoped to keep the inflation rate down to 95 
percent he said that is the figure demanded by the international 
monetary fund for rescheduling of yugoslavias 21 billion debt 
statistics officials however said the 190 percent inflation 
figure pertained to the entire period from july 1987 to july 1988 
for the first eight months of this year alone they expect 
inflation to be only 90 percent but then it is projected to rise 
to 150 percent by the end of this year the officials said 
even that would be down somewhat from the 170 percent inflation 
rate reached in the 1987 calendar year 
dizdarevic also said in his speech that foreign exchange 
reserves had increased significantly with hard currency from 
tourism and money sent home by yugoslavs working abroad the number 
of such workers is growing much faster than expected he said 
yugoslavia is undergoing economic reforms that include 
liberalizing price and import regulations to orient the economy 
toward the market dizdarevic said the federal body charged with 
carrying out the reform is optimistic tanjug said

q senator quayle theres been so much made of the fact youre 
a babyboomer maybe you can give us a little picture of yourself 
graduating in 1969 vietnam era you chose to go in the national 
guard rather than to serve in vietnam can you give us a little bit 
of what you were thinking during that time 
quayle well growing up in huntington ind the first thing 
you think about is education 
you think about what any small town person would think about 
eventually growing up raising a family 
i was fortunate enough to be able to go on to law school meet 
my wife we have been blessed by three beautiful children 
were very happy very content and looking forward to a very 
exciting campaign 
i did not know in 1969 that i would be in this room today ill 
confess 
q why the national guard rather than serving in the army the 
marines the navy and therefore going to vietnam 
quayle my brother and i two years younger both went into the 
service at the same time about the same time 
he went into the marine corps and i went into the national guard 
i went into the national guard and i served six years there 
1969 through 1975 
bush we got to go to this side of the room maria smith no 
whoops go ahead pat one two 
q mr bush you had originally planned to make this 
announcement either later today or tomorrow and there have been 
some complaints that making it on tuesday in effect diluted the 
message last night you didnt get the sharp criticism of dukakis 
out or the conservative message in retrospect was it a mistake do 
you think to go ahead with the announcement

bush no i think it was a sound decision i think it has 
captured the imagination of this convention and i really believe 
that it was the right thing to do and the delegates that ive 
talked to which havent been many and the people ive talked to 
again not too many because ive been working on my speech but as i 
move around saw some this morning at the agricultural breakfast 
theres great enthusiasm 
and let me tell you why i made this choice 
i set my mind i mean timing of it i set my mind to doing it 
making a decision before i got to new orleans 
i did that we had a thorough practice we did not make joint 
appearances with candidates and have the applause meter running out 
there to suggest who was the most popular 
but i did get some concern that having made up my mind that if 
we left it dangling out there there would be an accusation and 
properly so i felt that i was you know not treating those who 
had been considered for this job with the dignity to which they 
were entitled 
and thats why i sped up the process and it worked and i think 
its had wide yes maam here in the front 
q youve been campaigning very hard for the hispanic vote 
yesterday you made the comment about my three little brown 
children some hispanics have been offended by that can you 
clarify what you meant by that 
bush let me tell you something about that 
those grandchildren are my pride and joy 
and when i say pride i mean it 
and anybody that has ever traveled with me or knows the 
heartbeat of the bush family knows not only my sensitivity but my 
love for those children 
and for anyone to suggest that that comment of pride is anything 
other than what it was i find it personally offensive and ps i 
dont want to see these kids hurt 
and they werent hurt by what i said and if theyre hurt by 
misinterpretation that isnt fair 
and i dont like it 
and this is my family and im going to protect them 
and im delighted you raised it because i have heard the 
question raised 
and this heart knows nothing but pride and love for those three 
children and youre going to see them with me every inch of the way 
yes last one last one 
q mr vice president since you dont want the republican party 
to seem like a party of the rich for the rich once again a 
question about personal finance why pick another millionaire for a 
running mate 
bush i picked the best man to be vice president of the united 
states 
it isnt a question of personal wealth 
its personal how you keep this country going so more people 
can benefit by this the longest recovery in history 
its those who care about others and his leadership and this 
job training partnership act really something sensational 
and so i dont think its a question of personal wealth 
if it were the democratic ticket would be in deep trouble too 
thank you all very very much

george bush made extensive notes on potential 
running mates on legal pads and reviewed them closely last weekend 
before making his final choice of sen dan quayle aides said 
wednesday 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller also disclosed for the 
first time the complete list of 12 alsorans 
they included sen bob dole and his wife former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole new hampshire gov john sununu 
california gov george deukmejian south carolina gov carroll 
campbell gov jim thompson of illinois sens john danforth of 
missouri alan simpson of wyoming and pete domenici of new mexico 
rep jack kemp and attorney general richard thornburgh 
bush called the 11 on tuesday before talking with quayle fuller 
told a group of reporters 
the 12th person on bushs list sen nancy kassebaum of kansas 
was not called because she had removed herself from contention 
fuller said 
the list did not include some other prominent republicans who 
were thought to be under consideration including howard baker a 
former senator and chief of staff to president reagan and former 
tennessee gov lamar alexander 
robert teeter bushs pollster said that his own past work with 
quayle gave him added insight into the indiana lawmakers 
votedrawing abilities 
he is a firstrate campaigner teeter said he can help 
out among marginal democrats and bluecollar workers teeter did 
polling for quayle in his congressional races in the late 1970s and 
in his two senate races in the 1980s 
quayle never had a gender gap problem in any of those races 
teeter said teeter said he did not push quayle in his 
conversations with bush despite his long relationship with the 
indiana senator 
roger ailes bushs media adviser also helped quayle in his 
1980 and 1986 senate races i had a chance to observe him first 
hand ailes said in a separate interview he declined to say 
whether he had advocated quayles selection to bush 
campaign sources in fact said that ailes believed bush would 
select kemp 
it doesnt make any difference what we wanted what mattered 
is what the vice president wanted teeter said 
teeter and fuller described bushs process in reaching his final 
decision as complex beginning with surveying republican senators 
on whom they thought would be the best choice among themselves and 
doing the same with house members governors and party leaders 
but in the end bush kept his own counsel he wrote the names 
and information on each candidate on long legal pads and 
studied them in washington over the weekend to help make his final 
decision fuller said 
said teeter the presumption that we sat down and made a list 
of what we wanted demographically and tried to create a candidate 
is just not true 
quayles age 41 turned out to be a strong suit in bushs mind 
said teeter and so did chemistry 
one of the most important things about a candidate for public 
office is just to be interesting he said adding that quayle 
would be interesting to a large group of voters 
i think youve got a group of voters who now have a candidate 
of their own generation that alone will make him an interesting 
pick to a large number of voters 
someone of that age symbolically will be popular teeter 
continued 
questions on quayles association with former model paula 
parkinson and the fact that he went into the national guard in 1969 
instead of joining another service that could have brought him into 
combat in vietnam were closely scrutinized fuller and teeter said 
quayle as other candidates also was queried on whether he 
had ever used illegal drugs the aides said 
his response was that he had not they said

when lloyd bentsen and dan quayle face off in 
their first vice presidential debate it wont be the first time 
the senators have debated on television 
the senators went headtohead four months ago on public 
televisions macneillehrer newshour their segment concerned a 
trade bill eventually vetoed by president reagan for its 
controversial plant closing notification requirement 
pbs has released the transcript of the april 22 show billing it 
as the only known televised debate between the two candidates 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee 
called the 60day notification requirement a very mild proposal 
that says if youve been working for a company 25 30 years you 
deserve something better than a 7day layoff if your plant is 
going to close 
when i was in business and running a company i closed down a 
division bentsen added i gave them 90 days notice and it 
worked out very well 
rejoined quayle rind i think companies should give notice 
the objection to it is the federal government coming in and 
mandating on a legislative basis on how a company is going to close 
its plant our judiciary is now going to get involved in 
determining whether a plant is closed properly or not it takes 
away flexibility 
bentsen called the plantclosing provision a peripheral 
issue in a giant trade bill magnified by the administration 
even after senators accomodated objections in other areas he also 
said most companies already give 60day notices and those with 
fewer than 100 employees would be exempted 
but quayle countered that the bills financial penalties would 
deter businesses with just over 100 employees from taking risks 
and when bentsen contended the trade bill was critical to stem 
the nations rising trade deficit quayle retorted you would 
think that perhaps the economy is going in the wrong direction 
he then listed increases in exports industrial growth domestic 
auto sales and jobs 
quayle and reagan ultimately lost their battle 
the senate went on to pass the trade bill reagan vetoed it and 
bentsen devised the successful strategy of putting the 
plantclosing provision into a separate measure this time an 
electionconscious senate passed the provision overwhelmingly and 
reagan tacitly acknowledging defeat let it become law without his 
signature

defense attorneys accused prosecutors 
wednesday of trying to inflame public passion against john w 
hinckley jr by seeking to release letters written by the man who 
shot president reagan 
the attorneys asked us district judge barrington d parker to 
deny the governments application to release the letters the 
application prompted a mental hospital holding hinckley to withdraw 
a proposal to take him on a field trip with other patients 
hinckley has been held at st elizabeths hospital here since 
1982 when he was acquitted by reason of insanity of shooting and 
wounding president reagan white house press secretary james s 
brady and two others on march 30 1981 
by disclosing the sealed documents now the government hopes 
to inflame the public passion against mr hinckley the defense 
lawyers said in a court filing 
such publicity might prejudice his rights to fair and 
impartial treatment of his illness in the future because of the 
potential unwillingness of both mr hinckley and the hospital staff 
to deal with such a negative portrayal 
more importantly it risks damaging the very treatment 
relationship of confidence and trust that must exist for mr 
hinckley to make any progress in his fight against mental illness 
us attorney jay b stephens last week asked parker to release 
the letters hinckley wrote saying they were of great public 
interest 
defense attorneys vincent fuller and judith miller said hinckley 
had a property right to the letters which they contended were 
obtained only because government investigators had been given 
copies of hinckleys medical records to prepare for a hearing on 
the hospitals proposal to include him in the field trip 
the government did not obtain the materials at issue entirely 
on its own the lawyers said instead it relied upon the 
documents produced by the hospital in connection with the hearing 
about the field trip 
disclosure would be an abuse of governmental power and would 
destroy mr hinckleys right to privacy in his medical records as 
well as in the materials themselves the court filing said

george bush moved toward uncontested 
nomination at the republican national convention on wednesday 
promising that he and newly minted running mate dan quayle would 
work like a couple of pit bulls to whip the democrats this fall 
bush confidently made the rounds of the convention city as his 
hour of triumph approached campaign officials waited backstage for 
their cue to release 50000 balloons from the superdome ceiling in 
celebration 
bushquayle buttons sprouted on the lapels of delegates 
while the vice president pronounced his 41yearold political 
partner one of the rising young stars of the gop but 
qualified he quickly added to be one heartbeat away from the 
presidency 
at a joint nationally televised news conference quayle sought 
to fend off a barrage of questions about his youth and background 
and struck an aggressive campaign pose there is no compromise on 
raising taxes he said if the party of mcgovern carter 
mondale and dukakis got back in poweri think it would be a 
disaster 
i cant wait to get out there and tell the story about what 
america would look like under a george bush administration he 
said 
later quayle told indiana republicans elated over his 
selection boy do i look forward to going out there and 
campaigning against dukakis and bentsen 
gop officials said he would get his chance beginning friday 
with an appearance back home in indiana with bush 
despite a dozen years in congress quayle seemed like the new 
kid on the republican block but the day belonged to bush 
he spoke at a breakfast for farmers met with delegates from 
california and then made a brief visit to the superdome podium 
where he will stand to deliver his acceptance speech on thursday 
night well do all right ill do ok he said of the address 
that will launch his comefrombehind quest for the white house 
the presidential nomination was the main order of business at 
the conventions evening session and there was not the slightest 
doubt that it belonged to bush he earned it in stunning fashion 
during the republican primary season when he routed the field with 
a 14state primary sweep on super tuesday in march 
campaign officials tapped texas sen phil gramm to place their 
mans name in nomination penn state football coach joe paterno led 
a parade of seconding speakers 
with losing 1984 nominee walter f mondale at his side democrat 
michael dukakis opened a fourday campaign swing in minnesota with 
a jibe at the celebrants in new orleans while theyre partying 
on bourbon street were talking to people on main street 
dukakis said while they take a trip down memory lane were 
looking to the future 
running mate lloyd bentsen disclosed his income over the past 
five years averaged 772181 and he had paid 264453 in taxes 
quayle said he would be making a full financial disclosure and 
bush challenged the democratic ticketmates to make public their 
last 10 income tax returns 
bush and quayle stressed their agreement on fundamental issues 
at a news conference were not going off in two different 
directions on policy issues we arent going to have to debate each 
other bush said in a jab at dukakis and bentsen 
behind in the polls bush said were going to tell the truth 
and its going to seem like theyve engaged a couple of pit bulls 
competence is important but ideology is very important and 
were going to be talking on both 
the youthful quayle said he had been tempered by a dozen years 
in congress had experience as a young man in indiana state 
government and had met a payroll at his familys newspaper in 
indiana 
he made a stab at humor saying his wife had been asking him 
about press reports that he had personal wealth in the millions 
why do you think i picked him bush joked 
but quayle also snapped at reporters who questioned him about 
sensitive subjects 
that has been covered and theres nothing to it he said 
when he was asked about paula parkinson the key figure in a 
sexandinfluence scandal in 1980 
asked why he went into the national guard in 1969 rather than 
joining a service that might have sent him to vietnam he said i 
have a deep affection for those young men and women who sacrificed 
their lives in vietnqam and for anybody to imply anything 
differently is just simply wrong 
bush bristled as well when asked about the criticism hes 
received since introducing his mexicanamerican grandchildren to 
president reagan on tuesday as the little brown ones 
those grandchildren are my pride and joy he said and i 
find it personally offensive to suggest otherwise and ps i 
dont want to see those kids hurt this is family and im going to 
protect them 
one day after bush hailed the indiana senator as a man of the 
future campaign chairman james a baker iii was stressing the 
41yearold lawmakers experience he has more defense and 
foreign policy experience if i may say so than the democratic 
ticket combined baker said on nbc 
iowa gov terry branstad said quayle would help in the uphill 
race against the democrats hes a midwesterner he understands 
agriculture he is just 41 years old he is a prolife 
conservative 
but california gov george deukmejian said that while quayle 
wouldnt hurt bushs chances he wouldnt help him either in the 
state with the largest number of electoral votes 
quayles ascension left other republicanms pondering their 
future 
rep jack kemp of new york who contested bush for the 
presidential nomination and then campaigned to be his ticket mate 
confessed to disappointment im not going to get emotional he 
said clearing his throat as he met with the new york delegation 
but i was brought up by my parents to believe that all things 
work together for the good 
sen bob dole offered his customary quip i think he made an 
outstanding choice in dan quayle said the man who twice tried 
but failed to gain his partys presidential nomination i tried 
to call him and he called me the other day he was shaving first 
time

chunks of stone that fell from the 
4500yearold sphinx have been returned to their place and the 
statue will undergo emergency restoration at five other weak 
points an official said wednesday 
besides weathering the ravages of desert sands and winds over 
the centuries that caused the pieces to fall from the right 
shoulder of the halfman halflion the statue also has been 
victim of a bad restoration project which had further worsened 
its condition said zahi hawass director general of the pyramids 
area 
the sphinx is like a suffering old man who needs an 
operation hawass said of the worldreknowned statue which lies 
near the three famed giza pyramids on cairos western outskirts 
there are five weak points where stones can fall off any 
minute hawass said the worst problems he added stem from a 
rising water table and a restoration project that ended just last 
year 
hawass who was appointed to his post in 1987 estimated the 
repair cost at 10 million 
since the sphinx was built of limestone around a large rock 
about 2500 bc it has alternated between being buried under the 
sand or subjected to restoration projects that were begun by 
ancient egyptian pharoahs 
about 3000 years ago tuthmosis iv saw in a dream a suffering 
sphinx buried under the sand which promised him rule of egypt if 
he cleaned up the area tuthmosis had the sand covering the statue 
removed and soon afterward he became pharoah 
restoration work on the statue also was done during the 
grecoroman era 16 centuries ago and by enthusiastic foreign 
egyptologists in the early 20th century officials of the egyptian 
antiquities organization pitched in between 1982 and 1987 
closeup the proudlooking statue is a patchwork of the results 
of the various restoration operations the grecoroman and early 
20th century attempts involved giving the vulnerable parts of the 
statue a second protective skin of limestone 
the restoration that ended last year included giving the sphinx 
a 10inch thick coat of limestones using cement and gypsum to 
stick them together 
it is this last operation that hawass and other egyptologists 
have attacked saying the cement and gypsum did not allow the 
limestone to breath another problem they said was a rising water 
table that caused salts to weaken the limestone structure 
it was a very bad restoration project said hawass we 
have to remove this layer but when we tried that we found that it 
will hurt the original body of the sphinx so now we do not know 
what to do 
he said that egyptologists and scientists were trying to develop 
a chemical mixture to serve as mortar to hold the stones together 
while allowing them to breathe 
hawass stressed that no damaging cement or gypsum were used in 
tuesdays restoration the stones will be held in place with a wall 
of dovetailed pieces of limestone

two judges and a colleague were attacked and 
beaten last month while trying to deliver a court order it was 
reported wednesday 
one judge was kicked in the stomach and another judge and a 
court secretary were beaten with a stick in the attack by workers 
at the city bus company in xiangfan hubei province chinas legal 
daily said 
the attack began after officials of the bus company refused to 
accept a court document charging the company with selling old cars 
as new the report did not say whether it also set penalties 
against the company 
the bus company has a history of obstructing justice but had 
always gone unpunished the paper said 
lu tianbao deputy manager of the bus company threw down the 
court document when it was handed to him and kicked judge ma 
tingyi in the stomach when ma tried to give it to him a second 
time the report said 
ma judge ma dongshen and court secretary zhou daxin were 
attacked by a growing crowd apparently from the bus company as ma 
tried to tell them regulations on delivering a court order 
the incident drew more than 1000 onlookers and ended only with 
the arrival of police 
the daily known for its exposes of legal injustices said the 
local government and communist party committee had begun an 
investigation of the incident but so far no action has been taken 
against the assailants 
in the past decade china has tried to develop a body of law and 
guarantee rights to a fair trial but there are still frequent 
reports of police abuse of power and of lawyers and other court 
officials being harassed during legal proceedings

delegates to the convention say bush should step out from 
president reagans shadow and come out of the chutes raising 
hell to capture the white house some delegates believe bush must 
sharpen his image to succeed with the advice ranging from 
declaring his independence from president reagan to using fewer 
hand gestures wearing hornrimmed glasses and standing straight 
others prefer that bush ignore the suggestions and be himself 
although bush cited quayles strong appeal to women in 
introducing his choice for a running mate analysts of the 
republicans gender gap problem say youthful good looks wont be 
enough to attract womens votes it appears like the republicans 
are attempting to woo the womens vote rather than win it said

bush strategists portray the selection of quayle as his running 
mate as a bold bid for the nations younger generation but 
analysts warn that as a voting bloc the baby boom could prove a 
bust the problem is that the nations roughly 75 million baby 
boomers make up too large a segment of the population to fit into 
one ideological category experts said generational links do not 
necessarily mean shared politics theyre such large share of the 
american population they cross all income occupational and 
ideological lines said democratic pollster peter hart

as the initial surprise over the selection of quayle as bushs

secondterm senator brings to the republican ticket 
bush and his aides argue that the 41yearold indiana senator 
as a member of the huge postworld war ii generation will be a 
beacon toward the future for young american voters they also say 
he will attract votes in the midwest hit hard by farm woes but 
quayle is unknown outside his native state a blank slate for 
voters that the gop and the democrats alike will rush to write on

with the death wednesday of ambassador arnold 
l raphel the state department has lost one of its most seasoned 
experts in the tumultuous southwest asian region 
raphel the us ambassador to pakistan had spent most of his 
22year diplomatic career on the politics of that region before his 
death in a plane crash that also claimed the life of pakistani 
president mohammed zia ulhaq and 35 others 
he was appointed ambassador to pakistan in january 1987 having 
served an earlier tour of duty there as political counselor from 
197578 
during the iran hostage crisis of 197981 raphel was deeply 
involved in efforts to secure the captives release working as a 
special assistant to thensecretary of state cyrus r vance and 
vances successor edmund s muskie 
present and former colleagues of raphel 45 mourned his death 
vice president george bush told a news conference in new orleans 
that raphel was an outstanding ambassador and said he knew him 
well 
also in new orleans secretary of state george shultz called for 
a moment of silence at a luncheon he was attending he called 
raphel a man of immense ability whod been doing a superb job 
at the state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said we 
mourn the loss of ambassador raphel the united states has lost one 
of its best diplomats 
vance said in a statement issued from his office in new york 
that he was heartsick over raphels death 
he was a superb foreign service officer and a wonderful 
friend vance said our country and all of us who were 
privileged to know him have suffered a great loss 
with a mustache thick eyeglasses and a serious demeanor raphel 
had a professorial appearance his dress usually was more casual 
than that of his state department colleagues 
few countries are considered more important to the united states 
than pakistan reagans decision to send raphel there as ambassador 
was one reflection of the high esteem in which he was held 
pakistan was a conduit for us aid to rebels in neighboring 
afghanistan and zia was a favorite among conservatives here for 
his willingness to cooperate with american policy 
some conservatives including sen gordon humphrey rnh had 
deep reservations about the choice of raphel to be ambassador to 
pakistan expressing concern about his commitment to afghan rebels 
humphrey worked against raphels senate confirmation last year 
in pakistan raphel oversaw a us aid program totaling more 
than 600 million the third largest behind israel and egypt the 
administration felt pakistan was entitled to generous treatment 
despite concerns it was secretly developing a nuclear capability 
and was a source of heroin trafficking to the united states 
before his appointment by president reagan as ambassador to 
pakistan in 1987 raphel held senior positions in the 
politicalmilitary affairs bureau and the middle east bureau of the 
state department 
he was involved in southwest asian affairs for more than 20 
years beginning with his assignment to isfahan iran as a 24year 
old state department recruit in 1967 two years later he was 
assigned to tehran 
raphel was born on march 16 1943 in troy ny and received 
his bachelor of arts degree from hamilton college in 1964 before 
joining the foreign service he earned a masters degree from 
syracuse university 
raphel was recently married to nancy ely a state department 
official he had a daughter by a previous marriage 
in ventnor nj wednesday raphels family recalled that he 
wanted to be in the foreign service since he was a youngster 
as a boy raphel read books about foreign countries exploring 
ways he could someday visit the exotic locations said his brother 
murray raphel an atlantic city businessman and civic leader 
from the time he was 10 years old arnold wanted to be in the 
state department raphel said when he was 12 he wrote a 
letter to the secretary of state and asked how he could become a 
foreign service officer 
the secretary of state wrote back and said he should go to 
college even suggesting some good schools 
the family was concerned about the appointment because of the 
volatile political climate in the middle east raphel said 
but arnie never felt worried he said he felt he was 
performing a service for his country he honestly felt he could do 
the job better than anyone else

dan quayles voting record in the senate has 
earned him the admiration of conservatives and the enmity of 
liberals on labor education and civil rights issues 
the twoterm indiana senator tapped by george bush as his 
running mate is the father of the job training partnership act 
which replaced the old ceta program and provides training through 
the private sector instead of governmentpaid jobs 
he led the battle against the plant closing notification bill 
which president reagan eventually let become law without his 
signature and is currently opposing a bill to raise the minimum 
wage from 335 to 465 an hour 
on the senate armed services committee quayle has staked out a 
hawkish position on defense but at times he has also favored 
smaller pentagon increases than reagan wanted and pressed for 
military procurement reforms 
quayle voted twice this year against the civil rights 
restoration act once when it passed the senate 7514 on jan 28 
and again on march 22 when his colleagues overrode reagans veto 
7324 
he voted for confirmation of robert bork to the supreme court in 
a losing cause this year but led the successful 1986 fight to win 
confirmation of daniel manion a conservative south bend ind 
lawyer to an appeals bench 
the senates final approval of manion came on a 5049 vote with 
vice president george bush breaking the tie democrats had charged 
manion was inexperienced and a poor crafter of legal opinions 
civil rights groups are still upset with quayle for voting in 
1980 to weaken enforcement powers of the fair housing act the 
amendment quayle supported failed 205204 
from the perspective of civil rights dan quayle is a terrible 
choice said ralph g neas executive director of the leadership 
conference on civil rights 
on social security during the 1985 fight over a budget freeze 
backed by many senate republicans quayle voted with the majority 
5147 to kill an amendment by sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny to restore full costofliving increases 
the freeze never became law quayle voted last year against a 
move to trim the social security cola 
the national committee to preserve social security and medicare 
give quayle a 38 percent rating for the current session of 
congress thats far down in the pack said ken hoagland the 
groups associate director of public affairs its not a good 
senior voting record 
he was an early advocate of a tax simplification plan like the 
one eventually enacted in 1986 quayles 1982 self tax plan 
simplicity efficiency low rates and fairness would have 
squeezed deductions and compressed tax rates with a top rate of 30 
percent 
quayle supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion 
and has voted consistently against medicaid funding of abortion 
he has opposed democrats bills currently awaiting senate votes 
to require employers to offer workers a minimum package of health 
benefits and to offer parents unpaid leaves upon childbirth or the 
sickness of a child or parent 
and he has voted for tuition tax credits and for voluntary 
prayer in public schools 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association said were disappointed that bush who says he 
wants to be the education president didnt choose somebody with a 
strong voting record in education the nea gave quayle a 15 
percent correct voting record over the past seven years primarily 
because of his votes to cut education spending which futrell said 
wasnt a passing grade in any classroom in america 
americans for democratic action gave quayle 5 percent on its 
scorecard last year and the aflcio gave him a 20 percent rating 
quayle gets much higher marks from conservative groups 89 
percent from the us chamber of commerce and 81 percent from the 
american conservative union in 1987 a prodefense group the 
american security council gave him a perfect 100 percent score in 
1986 
he has voted for the superfund to clean up toxic wastes and the 
clean air act but in 1986 opposed an acid rain bill he said would 
impose staggering costs on the industrial midwest 
quayle was also one of a handful of gop senators who recently 
urged reagan to veto the 299 billion defense authorization bill 
quayle as chairman of a labor and human resources subcommittee 
worked with sen edward kennedy dmass to produce the job 
training and partnership act which replaced the 1973 comprehensive 
employment training act that reagan wanted to scrap 
quayle in leading the fight against the bill to provide 60 
days notice of plant closings said it would impose a 
legislative straitjacket on industry and would impede our 
capacity to compete in world markets 
but after the provision was cut from an omnibus trade bill that 
reagan vetoed and passed as a separate item quayle reportedly 
advised the white house to let it become law without reagans 
signature rather than lose another veto fight

to jail because of three prior convictions in prostitution cases

hometown of patoka ind where she was living with her parents and 
three children ages 7 8 and 10 
she was making arrangements to return to school to study

empire and cost him his credentials as a minister of the assemblies 
of god when he refused to stop preaching for a year

penthouse magazine accompanied by a series of explicit black and 
white photos showing the poses and things she said swaggart asked

five days after the truce begins peace talks between the 
combatants are scheduled to start in geneva with javier perez de 
cuellar the un secretarygeneral as mediator

american share is about 25 percent 
members of the 159nation general assembly adopted the budget 
committee recommendation by consensus without a formal vote 
a total of 1300 personnel from 24 nations will be involved in 
monitoring the truce including 350 unarmed military observers the 
un iraniraq military observer group will have headquarters in 
both baghdad and tehran 
according to a un report the operation should cost 756 for 
six months with the united states expected to pay about 23 
million the budget committee asked perez de cuellar to report back 
by oct 1 on the first phase and its costs 
japan has pledged 10 million to the peacekeeping costs and 
morocco has said it will donate 2 million

theres no business like show business and 
no one knows it better than the republican party theyre 
cameraready colorcoordinated and poised for what is billed as 
the worlds largest indoor balloon drop 
one hundredfiftythousand of them theyre due thursday night 
after george bush completes his speech five to seven minutes of 
reds whites and blues freed from their nylon nets by a carefully 
orchestrated flick of hands 
frame that and salute it every morning said an exuberant 
bob johnson assistant producer of the convention 
president reagan was feted with 20000 balloons after his speech 
monday night and another 50000 hung from the superdome ceiling to 
mark the moment bush won the nomination 
the 150000 after bushs speech will be staggerreleased 
alternating colors dropping from opposite sides of the arena onto 
delegates presumably wild with excitement and enthusiasm 
theres an art to what we do said sam kinnard the site 
manager for balloon art by treb a los angeles firm that also 
claims to hold the record for the largest outdoor drop 15 
million balloons for united way of cleveland two years ago 
no one is anywhere near the companys outdoor record 
kinnard boasted i think there is a group of japanese who did 
400000 
while the cleveland extravaganza was seven months in the making 
kinnard said the republican convention was almost a lastminute 
thing three weeks of preparation 
the company brought in 18 balloon art members from philadelphia 
new york and los angeles to supervise the drops the republican 
national committee has been providing 50 volunteers for each of 
three shifts a day to help blow up the balloons 
one woman in the convention production office said she tried to 
entice the city prison to send volunteers it didnt work she and 
her mother ended up among those enlisted 
this is the way a balloon drop starts a compressor feeds air 
into nozzles volunteers insert the balloons onto the nozzles 
inflate them tie them by hand then cram them like sausage 
stuffing into long nylon nets 
the balloon sausages are anchored to the ceiling in rows the 
nets are laced so that one tug on a string will release the cargo 
and send it drifting downward 
for thursday night kinnard has devised an elaborate release 
scheme a red sausage on the right side of the superdome ceiling 
will be unlaced followed by a white one and a blue one then a red 
sausage on the left side followed by white and blue and back to 
the right side et cetera 
itll come off in four stages which will make the release 
last anywhere from five to seven minutes kinnard said 
the timing will have to be exquisite but the balloon art folks 
consider the convention a piece of cake compared to their 
recordsetting united way balloon drop in cleveland 
the night before we had a hurricane that came through said 
kinnard it was almost a disaster but we managed to repair the 
damage and it went of without a hitch

authorities arrested another 
suspect in a 1985 rebel attack on two cafes that killed four us 
embassy marines two american businessmen and seven salvadorans 
the military said wednesday 
leftist salvadoran rebels said wednesday they will ask president 
oscar arias of costa rica to act as gobetween in an effort to 
renew peace talks with the usbacked government 
the military statement identified the man arrested as juan 
antonio morales lucero 38 also known as ruperto it said he 
is believed to belong to one of five rebel groups in the farabundo 
marti national liberation front 
in the attack in the capitals zona rosa entertainment district 
june 19 1985 guerrillas fired submachine guns at people in 
sidewalk cafes one attacker was killed by the rebels own gunfire 
but the rest escaped 
morales lucero confessed after questioning that he helped 
provide cover for the attack he identified the two gunmen who 
fired only by their pseudonyms of ulysses and william the 
defense department said 
according to morales lucero the gunmen fled to a guerrilla 
stronghold on the guazapa volcano 14 miles north of the capital 
immediately after the attack and were killed several months later 
in a gunfight with soldiers the communique said 
it did not say when he was arrested or give other details he 
was not listed with san salvador courts handling the zona rosa case 
three other men juan garcia melendez jose dimas aguilar and 
william celio rivas are being held for trial charged with 
providing cover to the gunmen 
a military judge last fall ordered the three released under a 
political amnesty the government decreed as part of a central 
american peace plan signed by five regional presidents aug 7 1987 
after the us embassy protested president jose napoleon duarte 
revoked the judges order 
the central american peace plan drawn up by arias aims at 
negotiating an end to civil strife in el salvador nicaragua and 
guatemala arias won the 1987 nobel peace prize for devising and 
negotiating the agreement 
a rebel statement broadcast by the clandestine radio venceremos 
said they would seek to establish contact with arias and ask him to 
act as an intermediary in reviving peace talks 
several rounds of talks ending in october produced no agreement 
on an end to the war which began in 1979 
the guerrillas insisted on sharing power in a provisional 
government but duarte wants them to stop fighting and join the

i still dont know what george bush said to them shultz 
said but by god they did it 
he said the vice president had also opened the human rights 
dialogue between the united states and the soviet union in a 
meeting with new soviet leader mikhail gorbachev at the funeral of 
his predecessor konstantin u chernenko 
gorbachev challenged bush to discuss human rights lapses in the 
united states shultz said and the vice president told him its 
a deal 
the agreement was that the us side would listen to soviet 
criticism as long as the soviets permitted a thorough discussion of 
alleged soviet human rights failures shultz said 
we now have the most farreaching human rights dialogue with 
the soviet union that weve ever had shultz said 
shultz also credited bush with persuading european leaders to 
accept the deployment of us mediumrange missiles on their 
territory a step he said led to the treaty banning such weapons 
as for quayle shultz said his tough challenges to that treaty 
as a member of the senate armed services committee had improved the 
pact 
senator quayle gave us a tough time on that treaty in the 
senate and wanted to know everything about it shultz said he 
wouldnt accept our explanations or staff papers he did his 
homework and ultimately he convinced himself it was a good treaty 
and he voted for it 
as vice president shultz said quayle will do his homework 
dig in persevere look at all the facts until he figures out what 
the right thing is to do and then he will do that right thing 
before beginning his speech to the foreign leaders here to 
observe the republican national convention shultz asked everyone 
to stand for a moment of silence to mourn the deaths of president 
mohammad zia ulhaq of pakistan and us ambassador arnold l 
raphel they were among 37 people killed wednesday when a pakistani 
military plane exploded upon takeoff 
shultz called zia a great fighter for freedom and a great 
supporter of the efforts that have finally brought the departure 
of the soviets from afghanistan where they shouldnt have been in 
the first place 
he called raphel a man of immense ability who was doing a 
super job in pakistan 
in speaking about foreign affairs shultz said the united states 
and its allies have a success on our hands 
by success i mean we are seeing the ideas we have stood for 
gaining ground gaining ascendancy he said 
shultz ticked off the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the 
settling down of the iraniraq war movement toward a 
settlement in angola the strengthening of democratic policies in 
the philippines and south korea and the development of more 
constructive and productive relations with the soviet union 
i could go on and on shultz said its really fun to do

tens of thousands of people are being 
evacuated from homes along the flooding nile and a government 
minister said hordes of locusts may be sudans next disaster 
according to news reports thursday 
the known death toll from the worst floods in sudanese history 
rose to 91 
alahram a semiofficial egyptian daily newspaper reported in 
its early thursday edition that people were being evacuated in 
khartoum its twin city omdurman across the nile and villages north 
and south of the capital 
a dispatch from khartoum in the egyptian daily alakhbar quoted 
agriculture minister fateh elteegany as saying locusts in had 
increased fivefold in western sudan in recent days swarms had 
reached the western regions darfour and kordofan and more were on 
their way from neighboring chad and nigeria 
he said the locusts would attack what was left of crops in 
central sudan in september and october unless they were stopped 
in the central gezira region which includes sudans richest 
agricultural lands tens of thousands of acres planted in cotton 
corn and vegetables were submerged by flood waters and the 
conditions helped the locust swarms grow the minister added 
egypts middle east news agency said 140 planeloads of relief 
supplies had reached khartoum since heavy rains aug 45 caused 
floods that left up to 2 million people homeless and caused more 
than 200 million in damage 
the agency report wednesday said authorities still had great 
difficulty distributing tents food and medicine to flood victims 
because many affected areas in central eastern and northern sudan 
were isolated and whole villages were swept away 
no complete damage estimate was available but officials have 
said 115000 homes were destroyed in khartoum alone standing water 
in the city has become stagnant and more rain tuesday made 
conditions worse 
mahmoud beshir gamma the irrigation minister was quoted by the 
egyptian agency as saying the large northern towns of atbara 
eldamer berber and dongola were threatened with flooding 
it said 18 sudanese drowned when their ferry overturned as it 
crossed the swollen errahad river a tributary of the blue nile 
it said three children were killed and dozens of people were hurt 
in omdurman when a house collapsed as a result of the flood 
water has begun seeping into houses along the nile and has 
almost completely covered the large island of tuti between khartoum 
and omdurman which normally has 13000 inhabitants 
the blue nile joins the white nile at khartoum to form the nile 
river 
british cartographers lent to the un relief operation are 
working on a contour map of the capital that will help determine at 
what height nile waters would start pouring into the streets

authorities arrested 87 people 
wednesday in a sweep through southern west virginia kentucky and 
ohio following an 18month investigation into the theft of 16 
million worth of cars trucks and heavy equipment 
terry ethridge assistant agent in charge of the pittsburgh 
division of the fbi said the investigation netted more than 120 
motor vehicles and heavy equipment some of which was displayed at 
a news conference at the huntington civic center 
officers also recovered five pounds of cocaine and numerous 
automatic weapons ethridge said 
the undercover operation was devised in early 1987 when law 
enforcement officials became aware that wed had a significant 
theft of property problem in this area he said undercover 
police simply put out the word that they were in the market to buy 
stolen auto parts vehicles and equipment 
it was relatively easy said michael carey us attorney 
for the southern district of west virginia 
the various thefts were not necessarily related to one another 
the two justice department officials said 
it would be wrong to assume all these people were part of one 
ring carey said 
the use of the term ring is misleading ethridge added 
if youre in the plumbing business you know other plumbers 
even if youre not in business with them 
carey called the operation the largest case in the district 
and one of the largest in the nation 
the thefts had a significant economic impact in the area 
especially when it came to heavy equipment tractortrailer rigs 
and coal trucks many of which are owned by independent 
owneroperators he said 
imagine if youre a coal truck driver waking up one morning 
and finding your truck gone the prosecutor said that puts you 
out of business for a long time 
we hope this will get the message out to all persons that 
the next time you sell a stolen car or truck you might be selling 
to a police officer he added 
on monday federal grand juries sitting in charleston and 
huntington returned a total of 27 indictments charging 69 
individuals with 141 counts of violating federal statutes 
including charges of conspiracy possession and transportation of 
stolen motor vehicles in interstate commerce altering 
identification numbers of vehicles and insurance fraud in 
addition other individuals charged in the case in federal and 
state court bring the total number charged to 87 officials said 
the arrests went smoothly ethridge said and federal agents and 
state and local police brought defendants to the federal 
courthouses in huntington and charleston 
more charges and arrests may result as agents follow up all 
the leads generated by the undercover operation he said

the united states will assist in pakistans 
investigation into the mysterious crash wednesday that claimed the 
lives of president mohammed zia ulhaq and american ambassador 
arnold l raphel 
until the results are known senior us officials are 
withholding any conclusions about the disaster which pakistans 
un ambassador said was preceded by an explosion aboard the plane 
there is no confirmation of any foul play but we are not 
taking anything for granted said a us official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity we offered to help and that offer was 
accepted an incident like this arouses suspicion 
there was no announcement of american participation in the 
probe publicly the reagan administration refused to speculate 
about any possibility of foul play 
while joining pakistan in mourning zias death the state 
department stressed that it anticipated no slowdown in the flow of 
us weapons to afghan rebels through the south asian country 
nor do us officials expect the loss of the proamerican 
strongman to have any noticeable impact on the soviet armys 
orderly withdrawal from afghanistan which pakistan helped arrange 
last april in geneva 
without announcement american and soviet diplomats met quietly 
in washington wednesday and agreed the pullout should continue the 
us official said 
questions remain on capitol hill and within the state department 
whether pakistan is bent on developing a nuclear bomb for us aid 
to continue president reagan must certify in october that pakistan 
does not possess an explosive nuclear device 
sen john glenn dohio has taken the lead in criticizing the 
administration for failing to get ironclad assurances that 
pakistan is not developing the bomb 
current us aid totals 611 million making pakistan the fourth 
largest recipient of us military and economic assistance after 
israel egypt and turkey 
after the crash of zias plane in southern punjab which also 
killed us ambassador arnold l raphel it also is unclear whether 
pakistan would proceed with elections scheduled for nov 16 
zia had dismissed his civilian government in may but did not 
call for elections within the 90 days prescribed by the pakistani 
constitution 
he also barred candidates from running with party labels zia 
took the position that partybased elections could mislead the 
voters 
critics said this would focus attention on local issues and work 
against zias main national opposition the pakistan peoples 
party that party is headed by benazir bhutto whose father was 
toppled in zias coup in 1977 and was later executed 
in light of pakistans help in afghanistan the administration 
was reluctant to make an issue of zias political maneuvers 
we will stress that elections should be free and fair but it 
is not up to the us government to prescribe how they should be 
held said one american official who spoke only on condition that 
he not be identified 
the state department was quick to express both condolences and 
us support for pakistan after the fatal crash 
we have a long history of close and friendly cooperation with 
pakistan department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said at this 
moment of extreme trial i want to reiterate our commitment to 
pakistan and our full support for the acting president and his 
government 
pakistan not only funneled us weapons to afghan rebels in 
their fight against soviet forces in afghanistan but provided haven 
for millions of refugees 
some anaylsts considered zias actions risky but the soviets 
did not retaliate nor did they menace pakistan after invading 
afghanistan in december 1979 mindful of the soviets long quest 
for a warmwater port the carter administration assured the region 
of us protection 
mrs oakley stressed that us aid to the afghan rebels would 
continue there is no reason to have any doubt she said 
in new orleans for the republican national convention secretary 
of state george p shultz said zia has been a great friend and a 
great fighter for freedom as well as a supporter of the 
efforts that finally brought the departure of the soviets out of 
afghanistan 
zias death is a great loss to the people of pakistan said 
shultz who noted there had been a quick and orderly transition 
of government 
jeane kirkpatrick former us ambassador to the united nations 
who also was in new orleans reacted to news of the crash with 
shock just shock 
she called zia a very strong person very important to the 
whole geopolitical strategic constellation of the region very 
important to the freedom fighters of afghanistan 
mrs kirkpatrick said zias death raises the question of 
whether pakistan can continue to as strongly support the mujahedeen 
and whether pakistan can resist the extremes of islamic 
fundamentalism 
through pakistan the united states provided stinger missiles 
and other arms to afghan rebels fighting soviet forces and the 
prosoviet government in afghanistan 
last month zia stirred alarm in washington with charges the 
soviets were replenishing their forces despite a commitment to pull 
all of them out by next feb 15 
it turned out the information was based on a statement by the 
soviet commander in kabul and pakistan subsequently retracted the 
allegation 
symobically zia ambassador raphel and us and pakistani 
generals had flown to the southern punjab to watch a field 
demonstration of the us m1 tank which pakistan considered buying 
from the united states 
pakistan is receiving 260 million in us military aid this 
year it recently struck a deal to lease up to half of 16 us navy 
frigates that are being retired for budgetary reasons 
state department officials said they did not know what caused 
the crash which also claimed the life of brig gen herbert m 
wassom 49 the chief us defense representative in pakistan 
mrs oakley said pakistan authorities were investigating 
she said the us air force was sending a plane to islamabad to 
return the victims bodies and raphels wife nancy to the united 
states

elmo r zumwalt iii son of the 
admiral who ordered the spraying of agent orange in vietnam and was 
exposed to the defoliant himself was remembered wednesday as a man 
with both a sense of mission and a sense of humor 
it did not take me long to realize elmo was a very special 
person said bob barrett a friend who first met zumwalt eight 
years ago he was full of fun always the life of the party and 
he had a teasing sense of humor that was punctuated with a loud 
laugh 
a few months ago the two said goodbye as zumwalt 42 was dying 
of cancer barrett remembered at the memorial service at a funeral 
home here 
he looked really sick and as i was leaving the house he gave 
a big bear hug barrett said i knew then i would never see him 
again i said elmo do me a favor give me your laugh and he 
laughed for me he could laugh and joke even in his tremendous 
plight lets not be sad well see him again someday 
zumwalt died saturday after a fiveyear battle with cancer 
john pekkanen one of the publishers of my father my son 
the book by the zumwalts also recalled zumwalts sense of humor 
he said zumwalt had just undergone a bone marrow transplant and 
was drifting in and out of consciousness when he would awaken 
pekkanen peppered him with questions 
pekkanen left the house for a minute when he came back 
zumwalt who appeared to be asleep began thrashing around he was 
moaning no more questions no more questions then he stopped 
moving 
he opened one eye then he opened the other eye then he burst 
into laughter i wasnt the only one struck by the zumwalt humor 
pekkanen said 
ten friends spoke at the memorial service which was attended by 
350 to 400 people 
zumwalt was exposed to agent orange while he was serving in 
vietnam in 1983 he was diagnosed with cancer his father adm 
elmo r zumwalt had ordered the spraying of the defoliant which 
contains highly toxic dioxin to push back the viet cong 
but zumwalt said he never blamed his father for his illness and 
his father said last week that his sons death would make him work 
harder for benefits for the veterans affected by agent orange 
walter anderson editor at parade magazine met zumwalt when the 
publication wrote a story about him and his father 
anderson said zumwalt had asked him to address his children 
elmo russell zumwalt iv and maya and his wife katherine directly 
to my children there is a loss of a father a feeling that i 
lost my dad anderson said actually you have not lost your 
fathers presence because when you have to decide what to do or 
between right and wrong you think what would daddy say you 
cant argue youve got to listen to him and he will influence you 
in more ways than you will know 
to his wife anderson said zumwalt left the following message 
as unlikely as it seems right now there will come a time when 
the pain of grieving will be less than the joy of remembering it 
will come 
james caldwell a longtime family friend and professor emeritus 
of history at the university of north carolina said some 
inherent quality made elmo believe he had to be tested to the 
limit that was true of school and it was true of vietnam he did 
not have to go to vietnam but he could not have lived with himself 
if he didnt

an anonymous telephone caller purporting 
to speak for islamic jihad said thursday that church of england 
envoy terry waite is alive and could be freed soon if britain 
showed good intentions 
there was no way to verify the call to a western news agency in 
west beirut as being authentic 
no one claimed responsibility for waites disappearance after he 
left his his west beirut hotel and vanished on jan 20 1987 
thursdays phone call was the first indication waite was with 
islamic jihad a shiite moslem underground faction loyal to irans 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the british hostage terry waite is alive and we might release 
him if the government of prime minister margaret thatcher showed 
good intentions said the caller speaking in classical arabic 
with a lebanese accent 
waite disappeared while bound for a rendezvous with the islamic 
jidah islamic holy war captors of two american hostages terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
and educator thomas sutherland 
waite 48 was acting as personal envoy for archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie in trying to secure the release of foreign 
hostages 
islamic jihad usually does not telephone statements and 
repeatedly warned news media against using any telephoned 
statements attributed to it 
it usually sends written arabic statements with a picture of one 
or more of the hostages it is holding for authentication 
but last may 4 islamic jihad telephoned the 
christiancontrolled voice of lebanon radio to say it was releasing 
three french hostages it was holding 
less than an hour later frenchmen marcel fontaine marcel 
carton and jeanpaul kauffman were freed

saint imam hussein and 40 of his followers in iraq 13 centuries ago

prosecutors say a onetime white house employee 
recalled seeing a memo detailing diversion of usiran armssale 
profits to nicaraguan rebels that had been attached to a letter to 
president reagan 
james r radzimski a former national security council aide 
told prosecutors that the memo by former nsc aide oliver l north 
referred to 12 million in armssale proceeds that went to the 
contras according to a filing in us district court 
norths memo to former national security adviser john m 
poindexter was attached to a letter that poindexter sent to reagan 
according to an account of radzimskis statements to prosecutors 
reagan has denied knowing about the diversion and independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh has said he found no evidence the 
president knew anything about it 
radzimskis statements were recounted in a letter walsh sent to 
norths defense lawyers and filed monday in court the former white 
house aide has also told congress he didnt know if reagan ever saw 
the memos 
during last summers congressional probe of the irancontra 
affair radzimskis name was dropped from a list of public 
witnesses who were to appear at the hearings after investigators 
decided that his memory of the affair was faulty 
he ended up testifying to the housesenate committee behind 
closed doors 
north poindexter and two arms dealers retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord and albert hakim are accused of illegally 
conspiring to divert armssale profits to the rebels 
radzimskis recollections about the memo were offered to the 
defense as evidence that might help exonerate north of wrongdoing 
walshs july 28 letter also includes statements by other witnesses 
that north told them that lawyers advised him his activities were 
legal 
north whose trial was recently postponed until after the 
presidential election could opt to offer these statements as 
evidence that he had no intention of violating the law since he 
acted under the assumption his activities were considered legal 
radzimski described norths memo as similar to one found by 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii in november 1986 that 
revealed the diversion of armssale proceeds according to walshs 
letter 
meeses investigation led to the dismissal of north and 
poindexters resignation 
north told congress last year that he intended for reagan to see 
his memo about the diversion but poindexter testified he never 
gave it to the president 
the memo radzimski recalls seeing was two to three pages long 
and was written by oliver north and addressed to john poindexter 
attached to the memo was a letter from poindexter to the 
president walsh wrote in the july 28 letter to norths lawyers 
radzimski told the house and senate committees that investigated 
the irancontra affair that he recalled seeing two memorandums 
one addressed to poindexter from oliver north and a second 
memorandum from poindexter to the president 
but he told the panel he couldnt recall whether the memorandum 
was delivered to reagan

hundreds of peruvians have been killed and 
thousands have been tortured or disappeared in provinces where the 
military has extraordinary power under a state of emergency 
amnesty international said thursday 
a report by the worldwide human rights organization said the 
disappearances and killings by the armed forces increased in the 
past two years after declining significantly following president 
alan garcias inauguration in july 1985 
londonbased amnesty said in a statement that it has received 
numerous new accounts of abuses since its report was prepared in 
may which appear to indicate a deterioration in the human rights 
situation 
amnesty called on peru to investigate impartially all the cases 
reported and bring those responsible to justice it said very few 
cases had ever been prosecuted 
the report said deaths and disappearances started in 1983 after 
the government introduced special measures to combat the 
maoistinspired shining path guerrilla group which is trying to 
overthrow perus elected government 
army officers were given military and political control over 
designated emergency zones which amnesty said enables the armed 
forces to sidestep human rights safeguards in peruvian law 
the greatest toll of victims has been reported from a remote 
mountainous area in ayacucho department which was the first 
emergency zone established the report said 
human rights groups in peru estimate 3200 people have 
disappeared since 1982 in ayacucho alone it said 
amnesty said other zones placed under military command since 
garcia came to power have been the scene of hundreds of other 
disappearances and killings 
today over 30 of perus more than 170 provinces are within 
emergency zones disappearances and extrajudicial executions 
continue to be reported on an almost daily basis in these areas 
the report said 
it said most victims were peasants students teachers 
community leaders trade union leaders lawyers and human rights 
workers in emergency zones where guerrilla groups have been most 
active 
amnesty also condemned killings and tortures by the shining path 
and other leftwing guerrillas 
in 1987 amnesty said it received reports of 201 disappearances 
175 of which remain unresolved almost half were in the ayacucho 
emergency zone 
amnesty said reports persist of civilians being seized and 
killed outright by troops or being found dead after being detained 
and of the killing of combatants after surrender 
among 36 possible militarylinked killings it cited in 1988 it 
said 29 were villagers in cayara in ayacucho department who died 
during an armed forces counterinsurgency operation may 14 
witnesses said five victims were taken by the military to the 
local church where they were beaten and hacked to death others 
were killed as they returned home from tending crops the report 
said 
reports of widespread torture included electric shocks burning 
beatings sexual abuse neardrowning and hanging by the arms for 
prolonged periods the report said

criminal charges wont be sought 
against the former president of westfield state college who 
resigned last month amid a trustees investigation into his alleged 
use of school trust funds for personal expenses 
hampden county district attorney matthew j ryan said wednesday 
he made the decision not to prosecute the former official irving 
h buchen after reviewing the trustees report 
i dont think a criminal proceeding at this particular time 
which would be a long drawn out process before a grand jury would 
be of any value to the commonwealth or westfield state college 
he said 
he said investigators found a great deal of slipshod record 
keeping and use of poor judgment but pointing to the broad 
discretionary powers college presidents enjoy in the use of trust 
funds he said it would be very difficult to establish criminal 
intent beyond a reasonable doubt 
ryan called on the legislature to tighten controls over the use 
of college trust funds current statutes give college presidents 
sole authority to use trust fund money for any item they feel will 
benefit the institution 
john st clair chairman of the westfield state college 
trustees declined to release the trustees report but said it has 
been submitted to a legislative subcommittee investigating the use 
of college trust funds he also said trustees were tightening their 
own policies 
buchen 57 resigned on july 27 after having headed the college 
for 15 months he succeeded francis j pilecki who left amid 
charges of sexual misconduct with male students and a furor over 
the payment of 10000 out of trust funds to one of the students 
the trustees launched their threeweek investigation in july 
after the unionnews of springfield had reported that buchen billed 
college trust funds for 3400 in expenses by submitting allegedly 
inaccurate or questionable vouchers for travel and dinners 
the newspaper said its review of the bills showed that buchen 
had been reimbursed for vacation expenses in florida his wifes 
travel and dinners with nonexistant faculty members he also 
billed the college for dinners in california and florida with other 
college presidents and a trustee who maintained they had not eaten 
with him 
he later paid back 1259

actress valerie harper said shes thrilled to 
be having her day in court against her former employers lorimar 
and nbctv as trial of their multimilliondollar suits and 
countersuits opened wednesday 
the bitter dispute over the tv series valerie began about a 
year ago and came to trial faster than most cases because of an 
unusual rentajudge program 
all parties agreed to share costs of about 15000 a week to 
hire retired superior court judge william hogoboom and a staff of 
court personnel to handle the case the hearing is expected to last 
five weeks 
if they had waited for a regular court assignment in the 
backlogged los angeles system it could have taken five years to 
bring the matter before a jury 
im very glad to finally have my day in court miss harper 
told reporters and its wonderful to have it settled in a very 
timely fashion im just happy that im here in court its 
thrilling 
miss harper was fired from valerie last summer after a 
heated dispute with lorimar and the shows producers they claimed 
she threw tantrums and was difficult to work with she claimed they 
fired her without reason 
also at issue was a dispute over miss harpers request for an 
increase in her 56750perepisode salary 
miss harper and her husband tony cacciotti who was 
coexecutive producer of the series sued lorimar as well as nbc 
which carries the show and two producers for 180 million 
alleging she was wrongfully fired cacciotti also was ousted from 
the show 
the defendants countersued miss harper the emmywinning 
comedian of the mary tyler moore show and rhoda before she 
launched valerie for 70 million alleging breach of contract on 
her part 
a portion of the original case which centered on the use of the 
name valerie in the shows title was resolved when the name of 
the show was changed recently to the hogans 
in the opening round of jury selection hogoboom told 
prospective jurors they would be seeing some famous faces in the 
courtroom 
in addition to miss harper he said witnesses are expected to 
include two current stars of the show justin bateman and sandy 
duncan comedian carol burnett also was listed as a potential 
witness 
merv adelson chairman of lorimar and the shows executive 
producers robert boyett and thomas miller also were named as 
witnesses along with brandon tartikoff head of nbcs entertainment 
division they are defendants in miss harpers suit

pakistani army generals all were reported killed 
unofficial reports and rumors circulated that the pakistan air 
force c130 was sabotaged hit by an antiaircraft missile or a 
helicopter or was shot down by india whose border was just 80 
miles away 
zia was a close us ally and ruled pakistan for 11 years 
longest of anyone in the nations 41year history in accordance 
with the constitution he was succeeded by senate chairman ghulam 
ishaq khan who declared a state of emergency and 10 days of

spokesman in bahawalpur where the crash occurred he said wreckage 
was strewn on a sandy plain about six miles from the citys 
civilian airport 
a us official in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press that the united states will 
assist in pakistans investigation of the crash 
there is no confirmation of any foul play but we are not 
taking anything for granted he said we offered to help and 
that offer was accepted an incident like this arouses suspicion 
no announcement was made of the us participation and publicly 
the reagan administration refused to speculate about any 
possibility of foul play

declared no no no when the president flies no other planes 
fly in the area 
neither pakistani nor us sources could confirm any of the 
reports about what caused the crash ishaq khan said sabotage could 
not be ruled out but officials refused further comment

the subcontinent became independent of britain in 1947 and the two 
countries have fought three wars east pakistan became the nation 
of bangladesh after a 1971 civil war in which india sided with the 
secessionists

along the 1836mile border and a un frontier observer force has 
been stationed since 1949 in the disputed kashmirjammu region

sharing power with a civilian government in early 1986 but 
dismissed it last may 29 on grounds it failed to maintain law and 
order and enact islamic law 
after the coup zia had the cabinet arrested and sent ousted 
prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto to trial for conspiracy to 
murder a political opponent who was not killed bhutto was hanged 
in 1979 and his daughter benazir later became zias main 
political foe 
life and death is in the hands of god she told the 
associated press on wednesday we will not say anything 
she said passing the mantle to the senate chairman was a 
positive development and added whatever should have been done 
has been done we are sure the changeover will be as smooth as 
possible

here are excerpts from the prepared text of 
the speech by sen phil gramm of texas nominating vice president 
george bush for president at the republican national convention 
wednesday night 
do you remember what the world was like in january of 1981 
when ronald reagan and george bush took the oath of office 
the amnesia merchants of the atlanta convention want us to 
forget that when the democrats left the white house inflation and 
interest rates were at the highest levels in american history 
given his record is there anybody here who doubts that a 
president dukakis would raise our taxes 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis would 
spend our workers into poverty is there anybody here who doubts 
that a president dukakis would cut defense and wimp america and 
endanger peace 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis would 
expand the power of government and its control over our businesses 
our families our churches and our lives 
we will never have to worry about george bushs willingness to 
stand up for america 
he knows from real life experience that peace comes through 
strength not through wishful thinking 
george bush was the youngest pilot in the navy on a 
bombing run at chichi jima his plane was hit and both of his 
crewmen were killed as flames swept over the wings and cockpit 
george bush remembered the first obligation of a leader is to 
accomplish the mission 
he stayed on his bombing run and dropped two tons of tnt on the 
target he then turned his crippled plane out to sea and bailed 
out with blood streaming down his face and a 38 revolver in 
one hand he paddled away from the shore with the other hand to be 
rescued by a submarine 
let me read from his citation for the distinguished flying cross 
by his superb airmanship courageous actions and loyal 
dedication to duty lieutenant bush reflected great credit upon 
himself and upheld the highest traditions of the united states 
naval service signed franklin delano roosevelt 
my friends when michael dukakis vetoed that bill providing for 
the pledge of allegiance to the american flag in massachusetts in 
public schools he was not representing the views of george bush 
george bush is the greatest vice president this nation has 
ever had he has always made us proud 
when the soviet union targeted a new class of nuclear weapons at 
western europe destroying the military balance and threatening 
peace vice president bush flew to europe to meet with our nato 
allies 
as chairman of the south florida task force george bush put 
together the nations first really successful effort to protect our 
children from illegal drugs george bush knows that the only 
way you can deal with drug pushers is to grab them by the throat 
 
with george bush as our president building on the success 
of the last eight years there is no limit to the future of the 
american people

secretary of education william j bennett 
said wednesday night that democratic leaders are embarrassed by 
efforts to teach schoolchildren values and the pledge of allegiance 
bennett in a brief address to the republican national 
convention said the reagan administration has sparked controversy 
by calling for teaching school children moral values and the 
judeochristian tradition 
but there are some fights worth having added bennett who 
leaves his post next month 
bennett the only democrat in the reagan cabinet until he 
switched to the gop two years ago said the democratic elites 
regard much of american history as a mistake to be corrected not a 
legacy to be extended 
the sanctity of human life moral standards personal and 
institutional responsibility even the pledge of allegiance too 
often these are the subject of denigration or embarrassment among 
leaders of the democratic party said bennett 
he charged that democrats have lost confidence in our 
principles and they have lost the will to defend our principles at 
home and abroad 
he said ronald reagan and george bush have helped advance the 
educational goals of the american people by pushing standards 
discipline choice accountability and the teaching of right and 
wrong 
bennett said the american people expect our children to leave 
school as better people better intellectually and better morally 
and they are right to expect this 
in reaffirming our beliefs republicans have looked to our 
founders to the declaration to the constitution and to our 
history and following lincoln we have sought guidance from our 
judeochristian tradition he said we have done this we have 
been criticized for doing this and we shall continue to do this 
reagan recently named lauro cavazos president of texas tech 
university as bennetts successor if confirmed by the senate 
cavazos would be the first hispanic cabinet member in us history

tass reported that 22 people had been killed and 107 were 
hospitalized the fatalities included children the newspaper 
izvestia said without elaborating 
trains on the moscowleningrad route typically operated at 
capacity 
the tv news program vremya said a rail inspection team had 
determined monday there was bad track near the town of belogoye 
and ordered trains be instructed to slow to 40 mph but rail 
dispatchers in belogoye did not inform engineers and the aurora 
sped onto the bad track at full speed the newscast said 
anatoly n sobin director of the leningrad railroad station in 
moscow the trains destination said the train was carrying 760 
passengers when it crashed about 190 miles north of the capital 
he told the associated press that 95 of the injured were 
hospitalized in bologoye and vyshny volochok the towns near the 
accident site 
sobin said he did not know the exact death toll from the crash 
but said it was not as deadly as a june 4 explosion aboard a 
freight train in the city of arzamas 240 miles east of moscow 
that blast killed nearly 100 people wounded 200 and forced the 
evacuation of 700 families 
tass said the moscowbound train left the tracks between the 
berezaika and poplavenets stations at 634 pm tuesday izvestia 
said 15 cars derailed 
izvestia said firefighting equipment could not approach the 
burning cars fast enough because they derailed in swampland it 
also reported that the first railway water tanker sent to the scene 
turned out to be empty 
residents of nearby villages soldiers and civilian emergency 
workers went to the scene to treat the injured izvestia said 
traffic on the moscowleningrad route was restored by wednesday 
morning and an investigation team headed by a deputy chairman of 
the council of ministers vladimir gusev was set up tass said 
disaster reports by soviet media still are slow in appearing and 
often lacking in important details but the accounts wednesday of 
the fatal train derailment less than 24 hours earlier reflect the 
closer watch soviet media have been keeping on public matters under 
communist party chief mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
greater openness on subjects affecting the population

a state lawmaker seeking to unseat us 
sen malcolm wallop got a boost to his war chest wedneday from the 
democratic national committee but the incumbent still packs a far 
greater punch 
state sen john vinich handily defeated two opponents in 
tuesdays democratic primary and wallop faced only token 
opposition on the gop side 
with the primary out of the way vinich settled down to woo 
voters in the heavily republican state away from wallop whom the 
democrats say has lost touch with his constituents in his 12 years 
in congress 
that task was made a little easier by the democratic national 
committees grant of about 16000 with hopes of more aid coming 
we always felt that it wyoming had the potential of being a 
strong opportunity state said dnc communications director anita 
dunn it was an impressive victory done the oldfashioned way 
vinich clearly earned it it was a hard campaign a good campaign 
with a very populist message 
while the race between vinich state schools superintendent lynn 
simons and university of wyoming law professor pete maxfield 
appeared tight going into tuesdays election the state senator 
from fremont county pulled away to a decisive victory 
unofficial returns showed vinich with 23165 votes or 47 
percent while maxfield collected 14595 for 30 percent and 
simons finished with 11312 votes or 23 percent 
although vinich closed the primary race with 40000 in debts 
his immediate cash flow problems for the general campaign will be 
eased a little by the dnc contribution 
federal law allows the committee to give candidates 17500 in 
cash contributions plus more in inkind contributions based on 
state populations in wyomings case vinich could get as much as 
another 109000 according to dunn 
inkind funds may be used in conjunction with campaign 
expenditures on such items as polls advertising and mailings 
according to dunn the dnc also may provide the campaign with 
technical assistance 
dunn said vinich would not begin receiving the inkind funds 
until some time after the dncs senatorial committee meets early 
next month 
panel members will decide then whether to give vinich any or all 
of the inkind funds based on how successful they feel he can be 
against wallop dunn said 
vinich will not get quite all the 17500 in cash because the 
committee had already given him about 1000 for the primary race 
the same amount that went to maxfield and simons 
wallops pocketbook is said to total more than 500000 and in 
tuesdays voting wallop polled more votes than the three democrats 
combined 55696 or 83 percent of the gop vote 
vinich acknowledged that he has a tough battle ahead of him 
well be working right along its an awesome task and i dont 
think we can let up now he said were on the downhill 
stretch

a man who took three hostages at a 
county courthouse surrendered peacefully to authorities wednesday 
ending a 23hour standoff during which he released his captives but 
reported his wife killed herself 
kevin patrick firth 30 was taken into custody at 915 am 
police sgt greg kuhn said he had reported four hours earlier that 
his wife helen had committed suicide 
authorities were uncertain pending an autopsy whether the 
woman had killed herself or was shot to death by her husband mesa 
county district attorney steve erkenbrack said 
the standoff began tuesday morning when firths wife slipped him 
a gun and the two took three hostages just prior to the jailed 
firths hearing on sexual assault charges a jailer was sprayed in 
the face with mace during the apparent escape attempt authorities 
said 
mrs firth said she had smuggled explosives into the courthouse 
according to police during the standoff firth threatened to blow 
up the twostory building 
a bomb squad searched the courthouse after firth was taken into 
custody but no explosives were found authorities said 
erkenbrack said hostages had reported seeing wire tape and 
round objects inside the courthouse there apparently was 
something there to make the hostages believe there were 
explosives he said 
the hostages court clerks joyce bailey and sheila shumway and 
receptionist linda romersberger were released one at a time the 
last walking out about 2 am wednesday 
shumway the first to be set free said firth made the hostages 
lie on the floor in a judges chambers 
we huddled together for two hours holding hands and 
praying she said 
shumway said she was more frightened of mrs firth than of firth 
himself she was aggressive and nervous and mad she said 
during a news conference by the three hostages wednesday he was 
relatively calm but i was only there for two hours 
shumway said she thought firth meant to kill her when he told 
her she was going home 
he told us not to cry and i said im sorry im scared and 
he said you get up youre going home i thought he meant he was 
going to kill me 
those 10 steps to the door to the landing was the longest 
walk of my life 
authorities said firth appeared willing to give himself up about 
330 am but his wife balked and threatened many times to 
detonate explosives 
at 510 am firth used a police radio he had taken to report 
that his wife had shot herself when negotiators tried to calm him 
down he said i cant ive got to be with her its too late 
police said they believe the incident began as an abortive 
escape attempt but firth made no demands except to talk with 
investigtors about the sexual assault case pending against him 
authorities said 
firth a delta auto mechanic was released from prison in 
october after serving time on a rape conviction 
he was arrested again on march 8 and charged with firstdegree 
sexual assault and kidnapping in the feb 24 attack on a grocery 
store employee 
erkenbrack said firth faces possible charges including taking of 
hostages kidnapping a felon in possession of a weapon and being a 
habitual criminal

dan quayle soon to be the republican vice 
presidential nominee began to tell his story to the nations 
voters wednesday but he was immediately bombarded with questions 
about his wealth his military record and his private life 
at the first news conference with running mate george bush 
quayle denied suggestions he had a sexual relationship with 
washington lobbyist paula parkinson on a 1980 florida trip with 
other congressmen theres nothing to it 
i went down and i played golf and i came home and anybody that 
knows me knows thats exactly what i did quayle said in a 
combative interview on the cable news network 
the indiana senator angrily dismissed as a cheap shot any 
suggestions that he joined the national guard in 1969 in order to 
avoid going to vietnam 
and quayle also knocked down reports of a personal fortune as 
great as 200 million pledging to disclose all his holdings fully 
on his first full day as the republican partys new rising star 
quayle held the joint news conference with bush and traveled with 
him to talk to the california delegation 
with his wife marilyn the nomineetobe greeted their three 
children tucker 14 benjamin 11 and corinne 9 after they 
arrived here on a chartered flight from washington 
quayle also got a thunderous ovation from the indiana 
delegation making an appearance that was scrapped tuesday so bush 
could introduce him at a rally as his choice for the vice 
presidential slot 
boy do i look forward to going out there and campaigning 
against dukakis and bentsen quayle told the cheering hoosiers 
quayle denounced suggestions that his looks he has been 
compared with actor robert redford would influence women to vote 
for him calling the suggestion sexist 
that is an insult to women quayle told cnn i think its 
absolute nonsense it is demeaning to women 
quayle sat with barbara bush the vice presidents wife in the 
superdome wednesday night to witness the presidential nomination 
roll call 
the news conference was a tough one for quayle as he faced a 
series of sensitive questions 
foremost among those was the issue of his relationship if any 
with parkinson 
in 1981 news reports said quayle was one of three congressmen 
who traveled to florida on a golfing trip with the washington 
lobbyist quayle denied having sexual relations with her at the 
time asked about his relationship with parkinson his answer was 
terse that has been covered and theres nothing to it 
asked whether he had seen her on any other occasion quayle 
simply said no 
later in a cbs news interview quayle said the matter would not 
be a campaign problem 
theres nothing there its not going to be a problem he 
said 
later bush aide robert teeter said that the parkinson matter 
had been investigated in detail by washington lawyer robert 
kimmitt who handled the probes of potential candidates for bush 
kimmitt looked into it very carefully and gave the vice 
president absolute assurance there was nothing there teeter said 
he added that bush and quayle had discussed potential questions 
before the news conference including the parkinson query 
the 41yearold politician also defended his qualifications to 
be vice president or president touting his knowledge of foreign 
policy and defense matters 
i know perhaps as much about national security as anybody 
with few exceptions he said the senate armed services 
committee and my national security background gives me a very 
important background for if some accident would befall the 
president to have an understanding about what needs to be done to 
preserve the freedoms and the opportunities in this country i feel 
prepared 
quayles claim of expertise brought up the issue of his military 
service quayle joined the national guard after graduating from 
school in 1969 thereby avoiding the possibility he would be 
drafted and sent to vietnam 
he bristled at any criticism of his choice 
i do perceive that as being a cheap shot i have a deep 
affection for those men and women that have sacrificed their lives 
in vietnam and anybody to imply anything differently is just 
simply wrong quayle said 
asked whether his lack of a combat record would be a handicap 
compared to bushs distinguished war record quayle said it would 
not 
teeter said quayle had been asked as part of the selection 
process whether he had used any family influence to get into the 
national guard which was flooded with applicants during the time 
of vietnam and the draft quayle denied invoking any such influence 
quayle heir to a family trust that owns several newspapers 
denied he was very wealthy 
when asked if he was worth 200 million quayle did not get a 
chance to answer immediately instead bush stepped forward to 
joke why do you think i chose him 
then the indianian tried a light answer to the question 
that figure is not correct believe me you have caused me a 
lot of problems at home because my wife is asking about that 
quayle said that in any case he would disclose his finances 
fully as will bush 
the indiana senator also explained that he had executive 
experience listing several executive positions in state government 
before going to congress including one as the chief inheritance 
tax officer for the state 
i was known as the chief grave robber of the state he said

the republican national convention is so 
short on protests that police officers working 12hour shifts have 
been left chatting among themselves in the sweltering heat 
the new orleans police accustomed to the raucous mardi gras 
celebrations have found that the staid republicans are an easier 
crowd to control a small number of demonstrations also have kept 
arrests to a minimum 12 as of wednesday and none in the 
designated protest site of lafayette park 
its not as intense said lt ra paisant who is 
supervising a handful of officers at the park 
on a rainy afternoon wednesday about 50 police officers ringed 
the free speech stage as 20 welldressed young people heckled a 
halfdozen skinheads who were using their scheduled 90 minutes 
to blame blacks jews and hispanics for all of the worlds troubles 
earlier an aids awareness group act up got heckled by 
collegeaged young people identifying themselves as young 
republicans 
police ringed the stage for that too although nobody in the 
park seemed tempted to do anything but shout insults back and 
forth about 100 people apparently office workers on their way 
home stood around under the live oaks and magnolia trees watching 
a young man who had been heckling the skinheads refused to step 
back when officers said he got too close to their line he was 
arrested the first person taken into custody at a demonstration 
in the park but his identity was not immediately available 
afterwards a phalanx of 25 officers including four on 
horseback surrounded the six skinheads and hustled them two blocks 
safely to their cars 
police are on 12hour shifts during the convention as they are 
during the twoweek carnival season leading up to mardi gras but 
the resemblance ends there 
no 1 the conventions only four or five days so you dont 
have everyone on 12hour shifts for 10 or 12 days you have the 
time cut in half paisant said 
also most convention events are during the day while mardi 
gras parades and parties are held at night and on weekends 
but the biggest difference is the size of the convention crowds 
which are smaller and more spread out than at mardi gras when one 
million people jam the parade routes and fill the french quarter 
while most of the estimated 30000 people are in the superdome 
when the convention is in session the rest of the time the 
delegates and delegatewatchers are spread out with many attending 
the more than 500 parties scheduled during the week 
when they do party outoftown republicans dont seem to get as 
rowdy as new orleans residents especially not mardi gras revelers 
theyre not as hard drinking paisant said 
moreover neither conventionrelated events such as a rally for 
vice president george bush held tuesday nor the demonstrations 
have drawn large numbers of local residents 
a lot of idle time appears to make for irritable police officers 
about 10 plainclothes officers became frustrated on monday night 
when a group of about 20 demonstrators marched toward the superdome 
and ended their protest on a lightlytraveled back street near the 
arena 
while there they handed out leaflets denouncing bush to the few 
republicans who passed by headed for the superdome and taunted the 
officers for watching them so closely 
the officers remained stonefaced arms folded in the 
lateafternoon heat 
when a reporter asked an officer what he made of the situation 
he snapped no comment the standard reply from most officers on 
the convention beat 
the busiest officers appear to be those directing traffic near 
the superdome 
a motorist who falls short of making it through a yellow light 
will get at least a glare and a growl from an officer if the car 
juts into the intersection 
and woe to the motorist who stops to let someone out at poydras 
and loyola streets the busiest intersection in the city these 
days such a transgression could warrant a tonguelashing 
one officer was asked to comment on the oppressively hot job 
no comment he snapped

as the initial surprise over dan quayles 
selection as george bushs running mate wore off wednesday 
questions were raised about just what this secondterm senator 
brings to the republican ticket 
politically i dont know what he brings to the party said 
richard bernstein a delegate from westchester county new york 
im not sure i understand the dynamics of it 
in particular questions have been raised about whether quayle 
is up to the job of vice president or president 
his reputation as a lightweight is overstated said norman 
ornstein a congressional scholar at the conservative american 
enterprise institute in washington when quayle applies himself 
he can do quite well he doesnt apply himself much 
bush and his aides argue that the 41yearold indiana senator 
as a member of the huge postworld war ii generation will be a 
beacon toward the future for young american voters they also say 
he will attract votes in the midwest hit hard by farm woes 
the conservative senator is an attractive energetic campaigner 
who is comfortable with television and the new campaign 
technologies of the 1980s they add 
but quayle is unknown outside his native state a blank slate 
for voters that the gop and the democrats alike will rush to write 
on 
and that clearly worried republican leaders 
interior secretary donald hodel told arizona delegates on 
wednesday to stop telling reporters they know little about quayle 
because anything negative will be reported and anything positive 
will not be 
but most delegates were willing to speak their minds 
it was a surprise to me e leroy owens a gop district 
leader from manhattan said of the quayle selection but i hope 
he does not have any skeletons in his closet 
quayle faced questioning about potential skeletons at a joint 
news conference with bush on wednesday 
quayle said there was nothing to speculation that hed had a 
sexual relationship with washington lobbyist paula parkinson on a 
golfing trip to florida with two other congressmen in 1980 he said 
suggestions he had ducked service in vietnam with national guard 
duty were a cheap shot and he said stories putting his net 
worth at 200 million were just wrong 
but the hardest and most important question quayle must 
answer with word and action is whether he is qualified to assume 
the presidency 
i dont think hes the right man for the job said jack 
dunlop a delegate from auburn ala i dont think the people of 
alabama will support him hes too young and too inexperienced 
dunlops choice for the no 2 spot was former united nations 
ambassador jeane kirkpatrick 
the democrats made it clear they would draw telling comparisons 
of quayles qualifications and those of their vice presidential 
candidate sen lloyd bentsen of texas a joke already making the 
rounds wednesday cracked that the bushquayle ticket could be 
called bush lite 
nobody ever asked any questions about whether lloyd bentsen 
was qualified to be president of the united states democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis said wednesday at a campaign 
stop in virginia minn 
ornstein who has studied congress for many years said quayle 
has potential but its just potential i would not describe 
dan quayle as a mature 41yearold ornstein said he would rank 
quayle only at the midpoint of all senators in any dimension of 
quality you want 
beyond the question of his qualifications quayle also comes 
under opposition fire as the darling of the gops far right as 
represented by sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire earlier this 
week humphrey threatened that conservatives would sit on their 
hands this fall if bush did not choose a true conservative 
it just showed that bush picked somebody from humphreys short 
list washington democratic chairwoman karen marchioro said in 
seattle if bush cant stand up to gordon humphrey god only 
knows what hed do with the ruskies 
even one of quayles assets his youthful good looks is turning 
into something of a liability 
several republicans were quoted as saying quayles handsomeness 
would attract female voters who prefer dukakis over bush by large 
margins in several surveys 
thats sexist its ridiculous nancy neuman president of 
the league of women voters said in an interview wednesday 
quayle agreed with that description of the idea 
women ought to resent the suggestion that they would vote for 
somebody on looks quayle said in an interview on cable news 
network that is an insult to women i think its absolute 
nonsense it is demeaning to women 
in addition quayles stance against abortion and the proposed 
equal rights amendment drew heavy fire from some womens groups 
with the nomination of dan quayle for vice president george 
bush has essentially written off the womens vote said kate 
michelman executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league quayle has an extraordinary antiwomen record in 
his tenure in the senate

nebraska gov kay orr said tuesday night the 
republicans took on the tough issues and didnt flinch in their 
platform and she urged skeptics to compare the gop and democratic 
platforms sidebyside 
orr the platform chairwoman told republican delegates the 
40000word document they approved earlier in the day was far 
far superior to the platform the democrats cobbled together in 
atlanta 
the difference is simple republicans share their vision with 
the american people democrats hide from the people mrs orr 
said 
the democrats wanted to hide their views from the american 
people because they knew that if the people ever found out what 
they really believed they would lose she said they dont 
want the people to know that they are still the party that will 
raise taxes and weaken our defense 
holding up a sidebyside comparison of the platforms prepared 
by her party she urged the delegates and television viewers to 
write the republican national committee in washington to ask for a 
copy or you can write your local newspaper and ask them to print 
it 
earlier orr told reporters the republicans dont yet know how 
much it would cost to implement all the proposals in the gop 
platform but they are working on an estimate orr has claimed the 
democrats platform would cost taxpayers 43 billion next year 
alone 
the firstterm nebraska chief executive said we took on the 
tough issues and didnt flinch 
our platform presents a vision of america that is optimistic 
bold and daring the democrats missed their chance to level 
with the american people we didnt she said 
she recalled george bushs recent slap at michael dukakis as 
the stealth candidate and said the democrats platform 
proves it 
you wont find some very basic words in the democratic 
platform words like tax or revenue or unemployment you 
wont find any mention of nato you wont find the words church 
or synagogue she said 
we say loud and clear what vice president bush has said so 
many times we wont raise taxes period she said 
she singled out planks in the gop platform favoring a child care 
tax credit college savings bonds an end to ocean dumping and 
mandatory sentences for drug dealers 
on issue after issue the contrast is clear democrats say 
nothing or else they cloak their views in empty rhetoric but 
republicans tell the american people exactly what we stand for and 
exactly where we will lead this country she said 
orr ended her speech by saying that despite the tough and 
painful times farmers have endured recently republicans are 
optimistic about the future of american agriculture 
she said the party rejects the democrats idea of mandatory 
production controls but wants to open markets abroad and find 
new uses for farm products 
as governor of a farm state i know that the future of 
american farming will be secure with george bush as president 
she said michael dukakis knows so little about agriculture that 
he told the farmers of iowa that they ought to try growing belgian 
endive

israel expelled four arabs wednesday and 
ordered 25 more deported the military said israel television 
reported that a 9yearold palestinian girl was killed when 
soldiers put down a west bank riot 
hospital officials said israeli troops beat 105 arabs in the 
occupied gaza strip where a curfew was imposed for three days in a 
row and soldiers barred west bank palestinians from entering 
jerusalem during a daylong protest strike 
early thursday the army lifted the curfew in the main gaza strip 
cities but curfews remained in effect in several of the coastal 
strips refugee camps 
eight west bank villages also were under roundtheclock 
curfews but the orders did not prevent scattered protests in which 
nine palestinians were wounded israeli radio reported six wounded 
in the nablus area of the occupied west bank and the army said 
three were wounded in the gaza strip 
in the west bank town of jenin 9yearold rasha artawi was 
killed while troops dispersed a riot israel television said it 
quoted arab reports as saying the girl was killed by a stray bullet 
however army officials told the television that a local doctor 
said the girl was killed by a stone an army spokesman reached by 
the associated press said he had no information about the case 
the fatality brought to 248 the number of palestinians killed in 
the 8monthold uprising four israelis also have been killed 
the four deportees allegedly were members of outlawed 
palestinian guerrilla groups and incited the arab uprising the 
army said 
they were flown by helicopter to lebanon given 50 each and 
released military sources said they were identified as mohammed 
gharableh ahmed abu muailek yusri darwish al hums and fathi 
ibrihim shakaki all from the gaza strip 
the united states has protested israels policy of deportations 
but israel defends the measure as the most effective means of 
deterring violence since the dec 8 start of the uprising 33 
palestinians have been deported 
the army also handed deportation orders to 15 more arabs from 
the west bank and 10 from gaza accusing them in a statement of 
leading the uprising and taking direction from terrorist 
organizations 
the statement said the 25 arabs belonged to local palestinian 
committees that intended to fill a power gap left by king husseins 
decision to disengage jordan from the west bank 
defense minister yitzhak rabin warned wednesday that israel 
would crack down on the local committees with whatever force we 
are allowed by law 
i wish we could end violence by spreading flowers i wish we 
could end it by sitting around the table sipping coffee but i 
believe these are not practical options rabin said 
tensions remained high following a riot tuesday at a prison for 
palestinians in which army troops killed two arabs 
i have never seen anything like it in my life an israeli 
officer who witnessed the riot in ketziot near the egyptian border 
told the daily haaretz nearly 1000 prisoners as though on 
order started rioting in block no 1 throwing stones and 
climbing the walls 
the inmates also threw tent poles and pieces of cots at prison 
guards israel staterun radio in arabic reported 
another senior official described prison conditions as crowded 
and tense the place is a time bomb he told haaretz neither 
was identified by name in keeping with army regulations 
the prison which houses about 2500 inmates in tents circled by 
barbed wire was opened in march to hold arabs jailed for 
participating in the rebellion against israeli rule 
military officials disagreed on the cause of the riot with some 
saying it appeared triggered by news reaching ketziot of an 
indefinite curfew imposed on gaza others said the inmates began 
protesting when they saw visiting red cross representatives 
in geneva red cross spokeswoman francoise deron confirmed 
representatives visited the prison tuesday but told the ap the 
riots occurred in a section the delegates did not tour she 
declined to comment on conditions in the prison 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai the gaza strip commander visited 
the prison wednesday and appointed a committee to investigate the 
riot 
a copy of a letter written by inmates and smuggled out of 
ketziot complained of brutal conditions and called on 
authorities to close the prison immediately 
the letter was not specific about conditions but said the 
inmates were beginning a hunger strike yes to the pangs of 
hunger no to surrender it said 
in gaza shifa hospital officials said 105 palestinians were 
treated for beating injuries mostly bruises said dr ahmed 
yazeji shifas chief surgeon 
he said the injuries appeared caused by beatings with clubs 
and rifle butts and kicking with heavy military boots 
he added that 90 percent of the victims said they were beaten in 
their homes by troops searching for suspected stonethrowers 
an army official said he could not confirm the beating injuries

more temperature records fell wednesday as the heat wave of 88 
kept its grip on a wide area from the carolinas to the upper 
midwest 
its miserable said photographer chuck novara of 
murphysboro ill we have a window fan you wake up you sweat 
the temperature hit 104 in baltimore 101 in washington and in 
louisville ky 103 in nashville tenn and 104 in both des 
moines iowa and paducah ky all records for the date the 
national weather service said 
beckley wva broke its alltime temperature record when it 
reached 96 degrees but its a town where official weather records 
date back only 25 years the old high was 94 degrees which was 
reached two times last month 
the tennessee valley authority having already set backtoback 
summer power usage records monday and tuesday issued an urgent 
appeal wednesday for customers to conserve 
but despite the request power usage climbed again setting 
another tva summertime record 
the federally owned utility has never been forced to reduce 
electricity to residential customers but if electrical usage is 
not reduced sufficiently some areas may experience an interruption 
of service said robert c steffy jr senior vice president of 
power tva serves about 8 million people in tennessee and parts of 
six other states 
among the other cities for which hightemperature records were 
set or tied were cleveland where it hit 99 columbus ohio 97 
detroit mich 97 indianapolis 99 madison wis 102 
milwaukee 100 norfolk va 98 philadelphia 94 pittsburgh 
100 raleigh nc 98 and richmond va 99 
in the usually breezy mountains of north carolina the 
temperature at the grandfather mountain tourist attraction sizzled 
up to 80 degrees for the first time in five years one man said it 
was time to take those sweaters off 
most homes dont have air conditioning said katherine 
morton a spokesman for the attraction i have a fan going in my 
office right now i dont know what the creative people who dont 
have to work are doing but i imagine some people are finding a 
cold stream 
another tourist attraction was affected by the heat in boston 
the famed minuteman statue the 113yearold tribute to new 
englands revolutionaries has begun dripping a black substance 
from its musket making it look like the statue was melting 
but experts believe that a resin applied in 1975 to make a 
plaster casting of the monument seeped into the statue and is now 
being liquefied by heat and humidity said ed mcmanus a national 
park service conservator in boston 
at the illinois state fair in springfield officials reported 
the scorching heat was reducing attendance and killing at least 
seven birds and two sheep on display 
and in chicago animal control director peter poholik urged the 
citys three main horse carriage companies operating along the 
lakefront to suspend all daytime service while temperatures remain 
above 90 degrees 
members of the poughkeepsie ny town council had a 
tongueincheek way of fighting the heat they unanimously declared 
it illegal for anyone to record a temperature above 89 degrees 
since the resolution was approved monday night the thermometer 
in the hudson valley college town has behaved with wednesdays 
midafternoon high a chilly 84 degrees 
paradoxically scientists said this week the same overall 
weather pattern that is creating record temperatures is contributed 
to unusually cold water at east coast beaches this summer 
southwesterly winds are pushing warm surface water away from the 
shoreline and the surface water is being replaced by colder water 
from the oceanic depths 
its nothing new but its usually not noticeable on the 
eastern seaboard said james a eberwine a national weather 
service forecaster in atlantic city nj 
on the july 4 weekend we had water temperatures in the 50s 
we had to put out an alert notice for hypothermia people just 
cant believe it 
satellite photographs show unusually cold water extending from 
just south of long island all the way down to virginia beach said 
dorothy kropp a weather service meteorologist in camp springs md

penn state university football coach joe 
paterno said wednesday that george bush had expressed regrets to 
him about a controversy dogging the coachs speech at the 
republican national convention 
paterno has drawn criticism from pennsylvanias democratic 
governor for agreeing to deliver a brief address on wednesday 
seconding bushs presidential nomination 
bush telephoned paterno last week and said gee i hope i 
didnt get you into a mess up there the coach told reporters 
paterno 61 admitted he had second thoughts about giving one of 
the seven speeches on behalf of bushs nomination but decided to 
go forward because of his admiration for the vice president 
in his speech paterno said i know a lot of you are wondering 
what an italianamerican football coach from brooklyn is doing 
here so am i but after 40 years of trying to help young men and 
women reach their potential as human beings im here as an 
educator 
recalling the spirited defense of bush from former president 
gerald r ford earlier this week paterno shouted ill be damned 
if ill sit still while people who cant carry george bushs shoes 
ridicule him 
pennsylvania gov robert casey has said it was probably not a 
good thing for the university for paterno to make the televised 
appearance at the political convention 
seth williams penn states student government president said 
its wrong for an academic institution to actually involve itself 
in partisan politics 
asked before his twominute speech whether he had any second 
thoughts paterno replied to be frank with you a little bit 
after the flak came out and then i said thats ridiculous because 
i really want to do it let me put it this way because i have 
that kind of respect for bush 
paterno worked on behalf of bushs presidential primary campaign 
in the state and said he knew the vice president through mutual 
friends 
paterno said that if asked he would even appear in a campaign 
commercial for bush 
the coachs speech marked his return to the superdome where his 
football team has won one sugar bowl game and lost two paterno won 
his first national championship at the arena by beating georgia in 
1982 
paterno dismissed suggestions that his speech could serve as a 
springboard into politics saying he liked to participate in 
campaigns but has no personal political ambitions 
i have not prepared for that i have not sat down and tried to 
figure how you get legislation passed and figure out politics in 
the best sense of the word paterno said im always hoping 
there is somebody out there like a george bush who has dedicated 
himself for a job

the presidency said wednesday he has the experience the 
character and the strength to lead this great land and declared 
that opponent michael dukakis would wimp america and endanger 
peace 
gramm a texan best known for the budgetcutting plan that bears 
his name described bush as a certified war hero committed to a 
strong defense 
he has always made us proud gramm said 
gramm addressed delegates to the republican national convention 
who began a long flagwaving demonstration on the floor of the 
louisiana superdome after he formally placed bushs name in 
nomination 
a cascade of rainbowcolored balloons floated from the stadiums 
giant domed ceiling as delegates celebrated in anticipation of the 
traditional roll call of states that would deliver bush his partys 
mantle 
gramm was followed by several seconders including penn state 
football coach joe paterno and an unannounced seconding speech by 
87yearold actress helen hayes 
im here paterno said because ill be damned if ill 
sit still while people who cant carry george bushs shoes ridicule 
him 
gramm combined praise for bush and for the accomplishments of 
the reagan administration with a strong denunciation of democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 
he said dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term as 
governor of massachusetts by raising taxes and in his second term 
increased state spending and brought on massachusettss 400 
million deficit 
he taxed the poor taxed the rich taxed the young taxed the 
old and taxed the middle class gramm said of dukakis he taxed 
businesses and he taxed families 
given his record is there anybody here who doubts that a 
president dukakis would raise our taxes gramm said 
he said dukakis has opposed every major new weapons system 
that we have deployed 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis 
would cut defense wimp america and endanger peace he said 
gramms senior colleague from texas lloyd bentsen is the 
democratic vice presidential nominee gramm was elected to the 
senate after leaving the democratic party 
gramm referred to the legislation with which is name is 
associated the grammrudman law that set automatic 
deficitreduction targets as trying to do the lords work in the 
devils city 
he praised the reagan economic record as creating 17 million new 
jobs and leading an economic boom 
but while the world calls our economic rebirth a miracle the 
democrats call it a disaster gramm said they long for the 
failed policies of the past 
gramm recounted bushs war record and credited him with coolness 
when the airplane he was piloting was shot down in the pacific 
during world war ii he recounted his business experience in texas 
bushs adopted state and government jobs leading up to his 
election as vice president 
george bush is the greatest vice president this nation has 
ever had gramm said 
i am honored to place in nomination the name of a man who has 
served america in war and in peace who has the experience the 
character and the strength to lead this great land he said

here is a transcript of the speech by 
education secretary william j bennett to the republican national 
convention wednesday night 
ladies and gentlemen theres a story about a young legislator 
who sought the advice of a much older wiser legislator about how 
to conduct himself on the first day of a legislative session 
the older wiser legislator said stand up say what you have 
to say and sit down and thats what i plan to do 
over the past seven years it has been my privilege and pleasure 
to work for the greatest president in my lifetime ronald wilson 
reagan 
and tonight we are here to nominate his successor the vice 
president of the united states the leader of our republican party 
and the next leader of the free world george bush 
ladies and gentlemen as you know the reaganbush 
administration has helped advance the educational goals of the 
american people i know cause ive been there ive visited and 
ive taught at over a hundred elementary and secondary schools 
plato taught that there is above all one crucial political 
question it is the upbringing of children the american people 
understand this 
when asked what they want from our schools americans 
consistently call for two things teach our children they say 
teach our children how to speak and write and count and think 
correctly and second help them develop reliable standards of 
right and wrong to guide them through life 
the american people expect our children to leave school as 
better people better intellectually and better morally and they 
are right to expect this 
in the past eight years the vital terms of the education debate 
in this country have changed now the national debate and 
discussion on education are focused on issues like standards and 
accountability its focused on discipline on instilling 
selfdiscipline in children and getting drugs out of schools 
its on learning math history geography and science and its 
on mastering the english language its on honoring our good 
teachers like jaime escalante its on teaching our moral and 
political principles its on schools forming character and now 
finally its focused on giving parents a choice in deciding where 
their children will go to school 
bringing these issues front and center has provoked controversy 
from time to time but there are some fights worth fighting 
in education as with other issues we have witnessed a crucial 
shift in the very terms of our national discourse in reaffirming 
our beliefs republicans have looked to our founders to the 
declaration of independence to the constitution and to our 
history 
and following lincoln we have sought guidance from our 
judeochristian tradition we have done this we have been 
criticized for doing this and we shall continue to do this 
the extent of our success can be measured by the emptiness of 
the new democratic party platform democratic leaders once used to 
celebrate their liberalism unabashedly today theyre reluctant 
even to utter the word the democratic leadership wont come clean 
but make no mistake they are still liberals and their liberal 
policies will not sustain the traditions will not sustain the 
institutions will not sustain the moral values that are at the 
foundation of our society 
consider the family the democratic leadership would make 
government not the ally of the family but its replacement the 
sanctity of human life moral standards personal and institutional 
responsibility even the pledge of allegiance too often these 
are the subject of denigration or embarrassment among leaders of 
the democratic party 
once it could be said that the leadership of the democratic 
party the democratic party of truman kennedy and jackson 
thats scoop jackson not jesse jackson was a proud defender of 
freedom but todays democratic leadership is not 
todays democratic leaders waver they are not resolute they 
have lost confidence in our principles and they have lost the will 
to defend our principles they have lost that will both at home and 
abroad 
why ill tell you why because the democratic elites regard 
much of american history as a mistake to be corrected not a legacy 
to be extended those democratic leaders need to learn that in the 
long history of nations and peoples the american achievement 
stands high it is rare and that achievement is worth defending 
ladies and gentlemen the democratic leadership doesnt 
understand this but george bush does 
george bush knows about the importance of standards discipline 
choice accountability and the teaching of right and wrong 
george bush has the experience and the guts to lead this 
country he will protect our precious freedoms he will help to 
educate our precious children tonight i am proud we are proud 
to stand with our principles and to stand with george bush 
thank you very much

alas poor dan quayle some television game show 
fans didnt care to hear about him even if he was chosen tuesday as 
george bushs vice presidential running mate 
station wlstv owned and operated by abc ran a bulletin 
shortly before 4 pm cdt announcing that sen dan quayle of 
indiana was bushs longawaited choice but the announcement came 
in the final two minutes of the popular game show jeopardy 
which as aficionados know is the time for final jeopardy 
so while quayles name may have been the answer to the biggest 
question of the republican national convention to jeopardy 
viewers it blocked out the eagerly anticipated final answer and 
question 
we probably got about 50 to 60 angry telephone calls said 
wls spokeswoman fran preston we had to run the final answer and 
question on the 4 oclock news to keep everyone happy 
the answer which always precedes the question was hamlet 
called him a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy

president mohammed zia ulhaq was a 
dictator who blended firmness with political shrewdness in a 
formula that kept him in power 11 years longer than anyone else in 
pakistans 41year history 
zia imposed martial law and executed the man he overthrew but 
did not instill the fear of prison and midnight knocks on the door 
he was a zealous moslem who stamped islamic law on his nation 
but did not enforce such cruel punishments as amputation for theft 
and stoning to death for adultery

as the initial surprise over dan quayles 
selection as george bushs running mate wore off wednesday 
questions were raised about just what this secondterm senator 
brings to the republican ticket 
politically i dont know what he brings to the party said 
richard bernstein a delegate from westchester county new york 
im not sure i understand the dynamics of it 
bush and his aides argue that the 41yearold indiana senator 
as a member of the huge postworld war ii generation will be a 
beacon toward the future for young american voters they also say 
he will attract votes in the midwest hit hard by farm woes 
the conservative senator is an attractive energetic campaigner 
who is comfortable with television and the new campaign 
technologies of the 1980s they add 
but quayle is unknown outside his native state a blank slate 
for voters that the gop and the democrats alike will rush to write 
on

when george bush took the fabled torch of 
republican leadership from ronald reagan the first thing he did 
was promise the next pass to 41yearold dan quayle the decision 
to skip a generation leaves a number of party stalwarts with mixed 
emotions and uncertain ambitions 
count jack kemp phil gramm and who knows how many others 
among the wounded 
the disappointment may have been sharpest among kemp and the 
other republicans who had been considered by bush for the vice 
presidential nomination each of them knew that win or lose in 
november being on the bush ticket would provide a leg up for the 
next open presidential nomination 
if quayle acquits himself nicely between now and november his 
political clout good looks and reliable conservative record would 
make him a tough man to beat

george bushs strategists portray the selection 
of sen dan quayle as his running mate as a bold bid for the 
nations younger generation but analysts warned wednesday that as 
a voting bloc the baby boom could prove a bust 
the problem is that the nations roughly 75 million baby boomers 
make up too large a segment of the population to fit into one 
ideological category experts said generational links do not 
necessarily mean shared politics 
they have different life experiences and certainly different 
values from their elders said democratic pollster peter hart 
but theyre such large share of the american population they 
cross all income occupational and ideological lines 
bush and his aides touted the 41yearold quayle as the first 
member of the baby boom generation usually defined as americans 
born after world war ii and before 1965 to run on a majorparty 
ticket for national office 
but some cautioned that the stroke may prove too broad in 
general the baby boomers have not voted as a bloc said 
republican pollster neil newhouse moreover young people have 
never reliably voted he said

vcrs are turning television viewing into 
video campfire gatherings kids and parents not only watching more 
primetime tv together but also talking to each other more recent 
studies show 
when a vcr comes into a household and the household has 
children people tend to talk to each other more said southern 
illinois university professor carolyn lin who has studied home 
video cultures since 1984 
they have to negotiate about what videos to rent and when to 
play these videos ms lin explained if someone wants to 
timeshift record a show for later viewing the person will have 
to get consent from the other people as well 
more communication is only one side effect of families adding 
video cassette recorders to their television sets although many 
homes have more than one set vcrs are bringing people together to 
watch a single screen much like the campfires of yesteryear 
in a survey of 233 vcr homes in three midwestern communities 
ms lin found that after adding a video recorder 58 percent of the 
people spent more time watching tv with the family and 35 percent 
spent more time having video parties at home 
prerecorded cassettes appear to have brought back family 
viewing during prime time said debra krayson of agb television 
research prime time tape viewing not only brings the family 
together but also appears to be a social event agb data show a 
significant number of guests in the audience 
agb a britishowned firm that recently withdrew from the battle 
for us use of people meter measurement of viewers per set 
tracked national vcr recording and playback last april 
the number of primetime viewers watching movies and other 
prerecorded tapes averaged nearly three persons per household 
according to agb regular primetime tv programs averaged 17 
persons per household 
studies by academic and commercial researchers now provide a 
profile of the impact of vcrs now found in 56 percent of us 
homes just five years ago only 10 percent of households had video 
recorders said tom lederback of the electronic industries 
associationconsumer electronics group 
vcrs were reported by nearly twothirds of those polled in a 
gallup survey of homes with telephones for the electronics trade 
group last spring video recorders were second in popularity only 
to tv sets themselves found in 99 percent of the households 
the gallup survey found 78 percent of the households with 
children had vcrs versus 63 percent of the twoadult homes and 40 
percent of the singles 
children are the vcrs most avid users spending 50 percent more 
time watching tapes than adults according to the agb study 
released last month children under 18 spend an average of 34 
hours a week watching videotapes while adults average 23 hours 
weekly 
teenagers developed their own versions of video campfires 
often watching tapes in groups at parties often they have little 
adult supervision said ms lin 
despite parent group fears that racy adult videos are the 
biggest video moneymakers 1987 video software dealers association 
figures show comedy and actionadventure tapes are tops with nearly 
20 percent of the dollar volume apiece adult videos rank fourth 
behind drama at 114 percent 
though video stores have reigned as the place to find vcr tapes 
more convenience stores record shops supermarkets and bookstores 
are now stocking cassettes according to a survey of the booming 
business released at the recent software dealers meeting in las 
vegas 
last year and this year business has been real good said 
association spokesman ray gianchetti sixtysix percent of the 
video merchants surveyed by the group said business went up from 
1985 to 1987 according to the poll released at last weeks 
convention 
tape rental prices averaged 245 per tape in 1987 video stores 
stock an average of 2832 titles and the number of videos rented 
per visit was 23 the survey revealed while most video time is 
spent viewing prerecorded tapes some folks use their vcrs to 
record programs for later viewing 
of the seven hours of an average week when the vcr is in use 24 
hours are spent recording programs and 47 hours viewing tapes agb 
reported last march twentythree percent of the time is used 
taping shows for later viewing known as timeshifting 
homes with pay cable channels spent more time recording and less 
time playing tapes than those without cable the study found most 
taping is during evening primetime hours or during weekdays and 
most viewing is during weekend days late nights and early 
mornings

</TEXT>

jean and gordon chase have been feeding 
their dairy cows an apple pulpandcereal mix so that their hay 
supply practically wiped out by the drought of 88 will last the 
year 
but now they question the wisdom of their hardheaded planning 
their feed supply means they may not be eligible to buy as much 
discount corn as they hoped from the federal government under a 
droughtrelief plan just signed into law 
the chases are disappointed but they arent surprised 
all along what these government programs have done is allow 
the poor manager to last longer says gordon chase shaking his 
head and wiping his brow in the heat of the family den 
farm subsidy programs are a sensitive subject for the chases as 
they are for other farmers who pride themselves on their 
independence they insist they dont want handouts but acknowledge 
they do need help and are frustrated when they dont qualify 
you hear more and more farmers talking about that now than 
ever before that a handout is not what we want says jean 
chase we dont want something that helps temporarily but will 
help us establish solutions for these kinds of problems in the 
future 
part of that solution may be federal crop insurance 
with their son kurt and his wife dena the chases farm 1100 
acres of wheat soybeans and corn here in southwest michigan 
they took out only enough crop insurance this year to cover 66 
acres of string beans they were growing for a canning company they 
plan to expand their coverage next year although they dont know 
by how much the chases saw the advantages of insurance after their 
beans though intensely irrigated died under the hot sun 
the chases grow frustrated when they see farmers receiving large 
government relief payments after they have been careless in their 
business 
we dont like to take it and yet were greedy and get upset 
when we dont qualify when we see other people who do says mrs 
chase 51 
it also bothers the chases that the subsidies create some public 
resentment toward farmers 
theyve caused some hard feelings among other businesses and 
thats tough to deal with says gordon chase 51 as he sips iced 
tea in the 95degree heat 
but the chases know they cannot afford to ignore the subsidies 
they have applied for government assistance under the new relief 
law anticipating at least a 35percent loss in crops because of 
the drought the minimum loss covered by the washington aid program 
the governments 39 billion droughtrelief plan will 
compensate farmers for 65 percent of the crop revenues they lose 
above that minimum up to 100000 
although many of the chases 350 acres of corn are lost some 
plants were revived by recent rains and are growing small 
underdeveloped ears their wheat harvest was healthy but their 200 
acres of soybeans will survive only if more rain falls 
with the harvest still weeks away they cannot be sure of their 
yield 
youd rather have the crop that youve worked so hard on 
mrs chase says but at this point we dont even know if well 
be getting any assistance at all 
because of their feed shortage the chases hoped to get a 
discount on lowcost government corn but the local agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service office says the chases will 
be eligible to buy only 90 days worth of feed at the discounted 
price less than they sought for feeding their 300 head of dairy 
and beef cattle 
one bright spot the droughtrelief law cancels a planned 
reduction in dairy price levels under the governments 
marketsupport program under the plan the price farmers get for 
their milk would have been cut to 1010 per hundredweight from 
1060 
for the chases whose 125 milk cows each produce an average 
19000 pounds of milk per year that 50cent cut would have hurt 
reducing price supports was to have been one of a series of 
moves to cut back on the accumulation of costly surplus stocks of 
dairy products but the chases believe such methods may actually 
add to the financial plight of farmers 
under the dairy termination program part of the 1985 farm bill 
the federal government paid dairy farmers to get out of the 
business the program was partly funded by farmers who chose to 
stay in dairying 
the chases estimate about 1500 came out of their milk checks 
each month to fund the 18month program 
when they cut your prices to help take care of a surplus at 
least from our standpoint it doesnt work chase says 
because were in debt we have to have a certain amount of 
money flowing through this business every month so when they cut 
your prices you have to do something so we milked more cows 
chase says that defeats the whole purpose of what the 
governments trying to do but you have no choice 
the chases are quick to admit they dont have any answers but 
they like the sound of a quota system like one in canada under 
which the government pays a relatively high price for a certain 
amount of crops or milk from each farmer then cuts the payment 
drastically for anything beyond that set amount that system keeps 
surpluses down 
a twist of nature however like the drought of 88 can undo 
any system 
when you have a year like this i dont think there are any 
real answers chase says

recent increases in shortterm interest rates 
could hurt homebuyers and homeowners whose monthly payments are 
based on variablerate mortgages no question about it 
but credit card users could be hurt even worse 
first reactions to the increases focused almost entirely on 
housing since by far the greatest variable debt is owed in this 
category but interest on most home mortgages remains 
taxdeductible most credit card debt isnt 
moreover much credit card interest is at rates actually double 
that on many home mortgages in addition many credit card users 
incur fees that if added to the posted rate would bring it beyond 
20 percent a year 
credit card debt is especially sensitive too whereas most home 
mortgage loans vary only on a sixmonth to threeyear basis 
meaning delays in increases could be that long credit card 
interest can change very quickly 
in addition home mortgage debt is actually an investment in the 
sense that increases in home prices might entirely offset any rise 
in interest costs 
most credit card debt offers no such offset generally it is 
used to pay for items that have been completedly consumed such as 
vacations or for items of eroding rather than increasing valuue 
and of course uncle sams tax code does very little to help 
credit card users adjust to the higher costs 
until 1986 all credit card interest constituted a deduction on 
federal income tax returns the tax act of 1986 cut that to 65 
percent in 1987 and 40 percent this year the percentage falls to 
20 in 1989 and 10 in 1990 
because of its relatively low interest rate and full 
taxdeductibility home mortgage debt remains the only tax shelter 
available to most people and it is an enormous one 
so great is it and so much of a departure from the treatment 
afforded other debt that real estate and housing people are 
convinced an attack on it will be launched in congress next year 
meanwhile statistical evidence suggests americans are very 
aware of the friendly treatment accorded housing debt despite 
interest rates edging higher sales of existing homes in june rose 
for the fifth straight month 
the latest interest rate increases to 65 percent for the 
federal reserve discount rate and 10 percent on the prime lending 
rate may eventually take a toll on home sales and housing starts 
but even this is not a certainty 
in their august analysis for example economists of the 
national association of realtors said expected rises in interest 
rates might encourage many potential homebuyers to purchase home 
earlier than they had planned 
such a phenomenon would not be new in the 1970s many couples 
bought houses earlier than they had planned in order to beat rising 
prices and the same behavior has long been observed in automobile 
markets 
besides there is a fair chance that higher interest rates 
might in the long run be offset entirely by increases in the 
market value of the house that is purchased with the debt what 
could be more comforting than that 
or on the other hand what could be more distressing than to 
pay increasing rates of interest for goods or services whose value 
is declining or already used up 
that is the situation in which credit card borrowers might find 
themselves

on many trains speed thrills scenery 
flashes past and passengers dart from side to side to view this 
mountain or that river 
not so with a pair of popular rail excursions that amble through 
wilderness in northern california barely faster than the 
stagecoaches that preceded them more than a century ago 
what the skunk and north coast daylight trains lack in miles per 
hour they make up for in dense redwood groves remote river 
canyons and allaboard camaraderie 
the revival of the north coast daylight for a second straight 
summer run has enabled railroad buffs to witness a rare sight in 
this town 130 miles north of san francisco two passenger trains 
arriving at the same time 
it reminds me of the old days said jim claveo of san 
francisco arriving on the daylight after the 10hour 144mile 
trip from eureka theyre very friendly more friendly than on 
most trains 
you ride it for the scenery and you also ride it for the 
nostalgia 
the skunk train running along a 103yearold line through 
mendocino county woods to fort bragg on the coast has been full of 
likeminded tourists all summer despite last years complaints 
about heavy logging spoiling part of the view 
bob reid who has crammed 151 tourist pins onto his crowded 
conductors cap keeps travelers amused in his role as 
ticketchecker guide and gladhander 
ive been working for this railroad for 27 years and its 
still fun said the fort bragg resident every day i meet new 
people from all over the world theres only one skunk train 
there was no north coast daylight train for almost two years 
following its illfated summer debut in 1985 
on one of its early runs that year the train was stranded by a 
landslide in the eel river canyon just 27 miles out of willits 
financial problems and winter track damage caused suspension of the 
run and service didnt resume until a year ago when eureka 
southern took over the line 
the train is a reincarnation of the old shasta daylight that 
served the west coast decades ago it generally consists of eight 
cars turquoise coaches shasta daylight lounge cars with plush 
interiors and padded seats a rare southern pacific club car with a 
standup bar decorated in ranch motif and a classic frisco line 
parlor car where passengers may be served calzone or lasagna 
winding through the canyon on weatherbeaten tracks that slow 
its speed to 10 mph the north coast daylight can hit a rollicking 
30 mph on straightaways twentynine tunnels enliven the trip much 
of which is through wild terrain far from the nearest road 
in addition to the usual sunworshipers and skinnydippers 
passengers on one recent trip were treated to the sights of deer 
bears raccoons river otters wild pigs an elk and an osprey 
clutching a trout in its beak along the peaceful banks of the eel 
the eel river canyon is one of the most beautiful river 
canyons ive ever seen said anne tolleson of santa rosa its 
a great ride if youre not in a hurry 
further north the train chugs through the redwood forests of 
humboldt county and past one of the worlds largest redwood mills 
in scotia the town of fortuna and the dairy community of loleta 
before ending the outbound half of the journey on the coast at 
eureka 
eureka southern has a halfdozen more weekend trips with 
overnight layovers in eureka scheduled from august through 
midoctober business has been good enough at 150 to 200 
passengers per trip that the railroad plans to expand the schedule 
next year according to business manager steve branstetter 
the skunk meanwhile continues to lure enough train fans to 
operate yearround 
gerald allen general manager of the fort braggbased california 
western railroad that took it over in 1987 says the train should 
match last years nearrecord total of 70000 passengers taking the 
daily trips out of either fort bragg or willits about half the 
riders hail from the san francisco bay area 
the line was founded as a logging railroad in 1885 steam 
passenger service began in 1904 and was extended to willits seven 
years later 
gas engines replaced steam in 1925 and the trains famous 
moniker was born shortly thereafter by trainmen who remarked that 
the smelly fumes had the aroma of a skunk todays trains are 
almost all dieselpowered but the name has proven longerlasting 
than the polecats pungency 
the serpentine route could be a roller coaster climbing from 
sea level to 1740 feet crossing 31 bridges and trestles and 
disappearing into two pitchblack mountain tunnels 
but top speed of 20 mph the average is 13 mph keeps this a 
leisurely family experience the skunk even stops to pick up 
campers or deliver groceries mail and medicine to areas 
inaccessible by car 
passengers are let out for half an hour in deep woods at 
northspur the lines midway point where they can buy snacks and 
gaze up at coastal redwoods towering more than 300 feet 
repeat patrons may notice a few more bare patches than in past 
years on the fort bragg half of the line 
we never considered clearcutting to be a major problem but 
there are certainly some areas out there that are not the avenue of 
the giants by any stretch of the imagination said allen 
everybody wants a redwood deck and thats where they come 
from

cleaning up the savings and loan debacle will 
cost at least 40 billion and perhaps 100 billion experts say 
already several littleknown thrifts have required bailouts larger 
than chrysler corp the commonly cited cause is the economic 
downturn in the southwest but there is much more behind the 
headlines is a story of fraud and greed mismanagement and 
government bungling it all adds up to one of the most expensive 
fiascoes in us history 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
don r dixon had all the trappings of success a 
california beach house trips to european spas a 5 million in 
art rolls royces and 110 perfume bottles for his wife 
he traveled on corporate jets relaxed on a corporate yacht 
entertained politicians dixons salary and benefits ran in the 
millions 
federal officials say that the indulgent and opulent 
lifestyle right down to the perfume was financed by the savings 
bank dixon owned vernon savings and loan 
ultimately however the us government paid vernon sampl was 
declared hopelessly insolvent and was closed it cost the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp more than 13 billion to pay off 
vernons depositors making it one of the biggest bailouts in us 
history and about the same size as the chrysler corp rescue 
dixon faces a civil suit accusing him of falsifying financial 
statements and systematic looting and wasting the assets of 
vernon which was named for a small texas town hes moved to 
california filed for personal bankruptcy protection denied the 
accusations in court but declined to answer questions before 
regulators 
two former vernon vice presidents and a former president have 
pleaded guilty to various bank fraud charges and agreed to 
cooperate with prosecutors one has even admitted hiring 
prostitutes for a board meeting dixon authorities say is a top 
target of the most extensive whitecollar criminal investigation in 
justice department history 
and don dixon is something more an example of the roots of the 
us savings and loan crisis 
while the sampl catastrophe has been triggered by the downfall of 
the southwest economy it has been exaggerated by the highflying 
antics of entrepreneurs in texas california and other states 
who either through fraud mismanagement or bad decisions created 
billiondollar messes 
for some few unscrupulous individuals it was simply an 
accepted way of doing business said marvin collins the us 
attorney for north texas that small percentage had a tremendous 
impact 
about onesixth of the nations 3000 sampls were insolvent at the 
end of 1987 they stretched from alaska to florida texas had 128 
most were wellmanaged institutions that fell on hard times 
regulators say but as congress tries to save the industry credited 
with financing the american dream of home ownership it has become 
increasingly clear that the sampl story is not simply one of an 
economic downturn 
without the fraud you dont have the problem you have 
today said m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board and the nations chief sampl regulator there are others 
besides vernon that will prove to have been fraudulent 
and theres more regulators themselves have been called on the 
carpet by congressional committees and others for failing to watch 
over the industry 
the federal regulatory staff in california fell from 200 to 40 
in the early 1980s the southwest office lost most of its staff 
when it moved from little rock ark to dallas some texas sampls 
didnt have audits for three years questions were raised about 
vernon in 1983 but nothing was done because of insufficient staff 
regulators say 
texas regulators were also stranded when the state legislature 
redirected fees from savings and loans to help balance the general 
budget a governors task force found 
there was no one looking after the shop said banking 
analyst frank anderson of d latin amp co the people in 
washington before danny wall came in 1987 had no clue 
sampl executives including tom wageman chairman of sunbelt 
savings in dallas blame a series of rules changes for causing 
havoc and opening the dirty dealings door 
even the cleanup has been troubled 
for months after the problems were discovered losses for the 
industry continued at the rate of 1 million an hour because the 
fslic didnt have enough money to close down the insolvent thrifts 
healthy institutions must pay special assessments to cover the 
losses a policy one leading sampl banker has dubbed vampire 
economics 
walls southwest plan was scheduled to sell or close at 
least two insolvent sampls a week but in its first six months 
handled only a handful 
some in congress have complained the bank board has been 
handing out the few billions it does have without proper debate 
it is incomprehensible to me that a sense of crisis has yet to 
develop around this issue said rep charles schumer dny a 
house banking committee member 
and not everyone is convinced the questionable practices have 
ended 
i originally predicted that the bulk of this activity was 
historical said collins the federal prosecutor 
unfortunately i think there is still some of it going on

need an office building apartment complex 
condominium hotel or maybe a bowling alley or exotic car 
dealership call the government 
how bout a bedandbreakfast resort a halfmilliondollar 
luxury yacht a wild animal park a wine store a restaurant or 
even a livestock ranch 
yup uncle sams got what youre looking for 
as savings and loans have failed and been taken over by federal 
regulators much of the property and perks behind all those bad 
loans has ended up in the hands of the government which has become 
one of the southwests biggest landlords 
in all the federal savings and loan insurance corp currently 
has 765 billion worth of received assets 
some of the millions of square feet of living and working space 
is for sale some is simply being held back until the southwest 
real estate market improves 
some of it is already built rented and occupied a lot of it is 
vacant and abandoned and may never sell empty office buildings are 
called seethroughs a few abandoned apartment complexes are 
referred to as sampl slums 
vernon savings and loan a highflying thrift whose failure has 
cost the fslic 13 billion had 21 billion worth of assets 
right now the government is offering part of that loot 101 
former vernon assets valued at 600 million said larry akins 
whos handling the vernon portfolio 
the offerings include former vernon owner don dixons 4 million 
exotic car dealership in la jolla calif as well as the high 
spirits a 112foot luxury yacht that is a sister ship to the 
former presidential yacht sequoia 
the fslic and the agency set up to help dispose of much of the 
property the federal asset disposition association each publish 
monthly catalogues with all the stuff thats on the block 
in addition to the standard condos apartments strip shopping 
centers and office buildings theres an aircraft hanger a houston 
convenience story a truck terminal and a medical building or two 
most of it is good quality attractive stuff akins said 
its not all in texas off course wild bills motel in carson 
city nev is for sale as is a palm springs calif guest ranch 
a nonoperating health club in mandeville la westwood bowling in

the 2000 acres of pastureland in south fort worth 
may not seem like much but at one time the property was so hot 
youd think it held both gold and oil 
back in 1983 the land sold twice in one day then again three 
days later then again and again and again and again seven 
times in less than two years and the price kept going higher from 
more than 17 million to almost 65 million 
federal officials say the tract is an example of land flips 
an illegal practice where a piece of land is sold rapidly 
sometimes even several times the same day at wildly escalating 
prices justified only by fraudulent appraisals 
developers and savings and loan executives flipped land to 
drive up the price to unsuspecting buyers to generate cash or 
improve the bottom line of their loan portfolios regulators say 
and analysts say flips were one of the major contributors 
to the huge losses at several insolvent thrifts 
these guys that were out there doing flips they were 
artifically inseminating the market said banking analyst frank 
anderson of the d latin co in dallas there was a perception of 
a boom that wasnt 
land flips are part of a massive investigation launched by the 
justice department into the savings and loan debacle 
and they were at the center of the collapse of empire savings amp 
loan federal officials have said empire failed in 1984 and a 
fouryear investigation has yielded charges against 110 people 
officals said the probe culminated in an 88count indictment 
against seven people charging a 100 million conspiracy to defraud 
five sampls based largely on elaborate land flips

it was a quiet latesummer tuesday and nothing 
extraordinary was happening in the financial world 
in washington a central intelligence agency official testified 
at the irancontra hearings in boston a judge ruled that warning 
labels on cigarette packs protected tobacco companies from 
productliability suits 
and in new york where the high temperature for the day was a 
benign 76 degrees the stock market reached a record level for the 
55th time since the start of the year 
nobody knew though lots of people later claimed to have called 
it that on aug 25 1987 one of the mightest bull markets in 
history was breathing its last gasp 
from its closing peak that day of 272242 the dow jones 
industrial average was about to embark on a slide of almost 1000 
points in less than two months it has not been anywhere close to 
2700 since 
a year after the bulls last romp wall street is still 
struggling to pull itself back together while stock prices have 
rallied from their lows of late 1987 the recovery has been 
tentative and sluggish 
at the same time a good many analysts have begun to see 
disturbing parallels between todays economic setting and the 
circumstances that prevailed in the summer of 1987 
a strong economy has touched off fears of renewed inflation and 
the federal reserve which raised the discount rate last sept 4 
has once more increased that influential interest rate 
if you believe as i do that the october crash was no 
accident that it was a response to certain events and an early 
warning of problems to come then the answer would be yes it 
could happen again said charles laloggia in his investment 
advisory letter laloggias special situation report 
in laloggias view credittightening by the fed and other 
nations central banks set the stage for the drop last year 
these same central bankers are now making the same mistake all 
over again he contends 
more optimistic observers argue that whatever similarities 
exist there are important difference in todays climate from that 
of a year ago 
then the dollar was spiraling downward in foreign exchange 
markets recently it has rebounded to the extent that policymakers 
have taken steps to try to keep it from rising too fast 
stock prices themselves are of course much lower than their 
yearago levels and by any standard statistical measure do not 
reflect the degree of exuberance they showed last summer 
the crash was a reaction to a ridiculously overpriced 
market argues roger engemann head of a pasadena calif 
investment management firm that bears his name 
there is no reason in the world to believe that the next five 
to 10 years are going to be worse than the last five to 10 in the 
economy the current period of hesitation in the stock market will 
resolve itself with a substantial rise engemann says 
if stocks today are lower than they were last august are they 
cheap you can get a good argument either way right now 
depending on which analyst you ask 
the pricetoearnings ratio of 30 stocks in the dow jones 
industrial average stood at 147 to 1 early this month down from 
205 to 1 a year earlier in the bear markets of the 1970s 
however it spent a long time in the neighborhood of 8 to 1 
another closely watched indicator the spread between yields on 
highgrade corporate bonds and the blue chip stocks that make up 
the dow industrials stood recently at 605 percentage points not 
a whole lot below the 677point differential of a year ago 
that shows some observers argue that stocks are almost as 
vulnerable as they were last year to stiff competition from 
interestbearing investments 
whatever the market does from here on out brokers say at least 
it will not have to face selling of huge bundles of stocks prompted 
by the phenomenon known as portfolio insurance this approach 
to professional money management which was widely blamed for 
exacerbating the crash is much less popular now than it was before 
the fall 
with the advantage of hindsight the market peak stands as a 
monument to the hazards of forecasting stock prices 
there was for instance the analyst who told a reporter on the 
very day that prices topped out confirmation of unit volume 
growth in the economy is unleashing the market to another explosive 
move on the upside which could easily take us through 3000 on the 
dow

polaroid corp will remain a takeover 
target despite new barriers to hostile bids analysts said after 
the company rejected a buyout offer from a california investment 
firm owned by a disney family member 
polaroids 13member board of directors unanimously rejected as 
inadequate a bid valued at roughly 3 billion tuesday from roy e 
disneys shamrock holdings inc and said it planned to remain 
independent 
polaroid also said it was lowering to 20 percent from 40 percent 
the stock ownership threshold that automatically triggers its 
antitakeover poison pill which is designed to make a hostile 
merger prohibitively expensive 
it says theyre clearly intending to fight this thing said 
alex henderson of prudential bache securities i think its 
significant in that polaroid is willing to be proactive in 
expanding its defenses 
but he said polaroid probably would be willing to entertain a 
lucrative offer the ultimate weapon in all this is money said 
chuck ryan of merrill lynch capital markets in new york if the 
offer is high enough what was unfriendly can become friendly 
shamrock which owns 69 percent of polaroid last week 
sweetened its offer of 40 a share to include 40 percent of any 
settlement in polaroids 57 billion patent infringement case 
against eastman kodak co 
the base 40 a share values the company at 288 billion or 
248 billion if shamrock succeeds in rolling back a recent issue 
of 10 million shares that it objects to 
the payment of 40 percent of the kodak settlement could add 400 
million to 800 million to the value of the deal assuming the 
kodak settlement falls in the range of 1 billion to 2 billion 
the polaroid board concluded that shamrocks proposal is 
inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its 
stockholders polaroid stated 
shamrock spokesman thomas reed declined to comment on polaroids 
rejection or his firms future plans 
analysts said they were not surprised polaroid that rebuffed the 
buyout offer and expected shamrock to make a hostile bid soon 
polaroids rejection came as shamrock received federal clearance 
tuesday to buy 50 percent or more of polaroids outstanding shares 
and a new york investment house reportedly made a friendly takeover 
proposal for polaroid 
in its statement polaroid said the board also voted unanimously 
to remain independent in light of the business financial 
condition and bright future prospects of the company including the 
status of the pending eastman kodak litigation 
the board determined it would be in the best interests of 
polaroid and its stockholdersto continue as an independent 
publicly owned company and that the sale of the company would not 
be appropriate 
analysts were divided over whether polaroids statement that it 
would remain independent means it will not consider any future 
takeover offers or is simply ruling out shamrock 
ive always had the impression they would want to remain 
independent and not be taken over by these people said william 
relyea of eberstadt fleming inc they take into account the 
direction of the company and the employees more than other groups 
might tend to 
shamrock has interests in three television and 14 radio 
stations an energy services company and 56 home entertainment 
software stores in los angeles 
separately the wall street journal reported tuesday that 
polaroid had rejected a friendly takeover proposal made by the new 
york investment firm of forstmann little amp co but said the firm 
may pursue a bid at a later time forstmann and polaroid declined 
to comment on the report 
forstmann a private new york leveraged buyout firm with 
diversified corporate holdings has more than 25 billion in

the family feud over the future of rp scherer 
corp hinged on a proxy battle waged today at the capsule 
manufacturing companys annual meeting 
the proxy fight the culmination of months of legal wrangling 
pitted karla scherer fink daughter of the companys founder and 
her brother against peter fink her husband who also is scherers 
president and chief executive officer 
fink who together with brother john s scherer controls about 
38 percent of the companys stock is seeking three seats on the 
11member board of directors to help further her push to sell off 
the company the worlds biggest producer of gelatin capsules for 
the pharmaceutical and vitamin industries 
as the companys largest shareholder fink already is a board 
member her brother is up for reelection 
results of the vote were not expected to be known immediately 
fink has been pressing for some time to sell the company as a 
means of disposing of her stake and maximizing shareholder value 
she reportedly filed for divorce in midmay about two weeks after 
the board rejected her proposal to sell the company 
the people who own the company should make this decision 
john scherer said in a statement last month there are members of 
management who obviously believe otherwise for their own 
selfserving reasons they are wrong to think their harassment can 
intimidate karla into backing off 
in a july 28 letter to stockholders karla fink and her brother 
noted that peter fink and scherer chairman wilbur h mack earned 
more than 3 million between april 1 1985 and march 31 
in our opinion it is perfectly clear who are the real 
beneficiaries of scherer managements economic policy the top 
executives the letter said 
peter fink responded in a letter to shareholders that he was 
dismayed by criticism over the very compensation his wife had 
approved while serving as a scherer director 
he linked the companys strong performance to management skills 
and urged shareholders to reject his wifes handpicked nominees 
scherer reported net income of 128 million up 44 percent in 
the fiscal year ended march 31 sales jumped 27 percent to 2907 
million 
karla fink and her brother said the strong financial performance 
made it an opportune time to sell the company but peter fink said 
the board was convinced that shareholders would be served best by 
remaining independent 
still pending tuesday before the michigan court of appeals was a 
ruling on stock carrying a potentially pivotal 93 percent of 
scherers voting power 
the court action involves a block of 470000 shares in two 
family trusts administered by manufacturers national bank karla 
fink and her brother beneficiaries of the trusts argued that 
manufacturers national bank had conflicting interests 
a probate court judge named an independent fiduciary on monday 
to decide how to vote on the stock but wayne county circuit judge 
kathleen macdonald vacated that ruling tuesday reinstating the 
bank as trustee and allowing it to vote the block at the annual 
meeting 
attorneys for karla fink appealed the ruling to the state court 
of appeals said beth lyons spokeswoman for the mrs fink and her 
brother 
troybased scherer employs about 2800 people at 22 facilities 
in 13 countries

the drought may be hindering a rally in 
the value of upper midwestern farmland but most agricultural 
bankers expect stable land prices going into the fall according to 
a new survey 
the survey of 500 bankers in five states indicates the value of 
farmland in the region rose only 1 percent during the second 
quarter of 1988 peter heffernan an analyst with the federal 
reserve bank of chicago said in a recent interview 
nevertheless the rising prices represented the sixth 
consecutive quarter of increases following a slump in land values 
over the first half of this decade 
regional land values were hardest hit by the drought in 
michigan where prices dropped nearly 2 percent and in wisconsin 
where prices fell 1 percent the survey indicated 
illinois land values rose 14 percent during the apriljune 
quarter iowa land values rose 32 percent and indiana land values 
remained stable 
undoubtedly the problems and uncertainties surrounding the 
effects of the drought had a significant bearing on their 
responses said heffernan the bankers expectations regarding 
the third quarter trend in farmland values is less optimistic than 
in earlier surveys 
heffernan said 31 percent of the bankers expected land prices to 
decline during the third quarter of 1988 while 60 percent 
predicted stable land values during july august and september 
nine percent expect prices to rise this quarter he said 
intense heat and one of the worst droughts of the century have 
combined to severely damage key us farm crops such as corn and 
soybeans the fall harvest of those commodities is expected to be 
sharply reduced 
but university of illinois land economist john scott said his 
survey of more than 400 farm appraisers in illinois iowa indiana 
and ohio suggests the drought will have only a minor impact on land 
prices 
the consensus that emerged from the responses was that if the 
drought has any impact at all it will only last one year and might 
represent a short decline in land values said scott 
he said the appraisers expect any crop losses in 1988 to be 
offset by a good production year in 1989 and then land prices 
will move to higher levels in coming years 
scott also said higher commodity prices resulting from the small 
harvest and the reduction of the grain surplus will help the land 
market rally 
while those factors might tempt farmers to invest in more land 
to expand their operations scott urged caution 
only when a farmer is financially capable and can pencil out 
through his revenue projections the ability to pay for the land 
should he consider buying it said scott 
he said the next rally in land prices would be different from 
the one in the 1970s which was fueled by inflation he said some 
farmers thought inflation would pay for the land and they spent 
more for it than they ever could recover from farm earnings

an upturn in the energy industry could pose a 
serious labor problem for some oilfield services companies because 
of a lack of experienced oil workers industry officials say 
a shortage of offshore oil workers already has developed in 
parts of the gulf of mexico officials said but that problem could 
spread industrywide if drilling increases 
ocean oil weekly report said monday that some offshore companies 
could double their work load if they could find enough skilled 
workers the shortage of qualified personnel is threatening to 
hamper the slight surge in drilling activity the newsletter said 
the decline of oil prices in the early 1980s forced layoffs that 
drove oilfield employees into other businesses and the depressed 
wages now offered in the oil industry are not big enough to draw 
them back said jim redden editor of the newsletter 
some rig laborer jobs earned 11 per hour on offshore platforms 
in the early 1980s compared with the 7 per hour they now are 
paid according to ed mcghee of the international association of 
drilling contractors bargemasters who made 48000 per year now 
are being paid about 30000 
zapata gulf marine had to mothball a few of its 98 supply 
vessels working in the gulf because of a lack of sailors and 
maritime engineers zapata spokesman barney white said monday 
were really having a manpower crunch he said last 
month we had three boats that we couldnt work because we didnt 
have crews 
zapatas recruiters have been working to locate maritime 
personnel white said the company has maintained enough workers 
for its six gulf rigs by recalling former employees who had worked 
on the two dozen rigs it operated in the gulf several years ago he 
said 
most offshore drilling companies have enough roustabouts tool 
pushers drillers and roughnecks said mcghee 
but if drilling were to increase sharply the need for labor 
would be great he said divers mechanics electricians welders 
pipefitters and boat hands are in short supply redden said

over the next decade exports by young 
hightechnology companies could help reduce the national trade 
deficit according to economists who unveiled a new survey of such 
firms 
as we evolve into a technologydriven type manufacturer 
these companies do start exporting shortly after they are 
born james m howell bank of bostons chief economist said 
tuesday in this environment they can be substantial 
contributors to exports 
the banks survey of nearly 400 firms nationwide indicated many 
hightech firms are exporting soon after formation and not 
experiencing a significant competitive disadvantage 
hightech companies which are concentrated on the two coasts 
will play a significant role in job growth in the next five years 
and could make a fairly substantial contribution to reducing 
the foreign trade deficit by the mid1990s howell said 
the commerce department said tuesday that the us trade deficit 
for june increased to 125 billion a 285 percent increase over 
mays 98 billion imbalance and the worst monthly figure since 
february 
the bank survey was mailed earlier this year to 6539 companies 
in the fields of biotechnology advanced materials photonic and 
optics automation and test and measurement 
hightech exporters formed during the 1980s with annual sales of 
under 10 million have had about the same or in some cases faster 
sales and employment growth rates as nonexporting firms the 
survey indicated 
most of the jobs in the country get created by young hightech 
companies growing up howell said theres a difference between 
a digital equipment corp growing up from the 50s to the 80s 
and a corner drug store not growing at all 
the survey indicated sales increased by 50 percent and 
employment by 23 percent among young export firms in the most 
recent fiscal year compared to 44 percent and 26 percent 
respectively among nonexporting firms 
technology concentrations in the form of manufacturing firms and 
research facilities are a major source of new development because 
they serve as the spawning ground for entrepreneurs and as a 
significant source of new products and processes the survey said 
the young exporters perceive europe and japan as their primary 
sources of comptition but in only one of the five fields did a 
majority of companies think that competition is unfair sixtyseven 
percent of test and measurement companies thought competition was 
too stiff compared to 22 percent in biotechnology and 18 percent 
in photonic and optics 
gaining market share in a rapidly expanding global market is 
viewed as being far more important than the fairness of the 
marketplace the survey said 
this finding strikes us as significant and suggests that the 
current preoccupation with protectionism misses the mark it 
said from a policy perspective it will be more productive to 
focus on the issue of creating a hospitable environment for 
business starts

the dollar rose against most major currencies in 
moderately active european trading this morning as bullish 
sentiment overcame the effect of disappointing us trade figures 
for june 
gold prices fell 
foreign exchange dealers said the market was surprised by the 
dollars quick recovery from the effects of the announcement that 
the trade gap widened to 125 billion in june from a revised 98 
billion in may 
they attributed the recovery to bullish sentiment created by 
relatively high us interest rates and the conviction that the 
us administration wants a strong dollar at the time of the 
november presidential election 
the firmer dollar seems to be politically motivated as the 
republicans want to use it for their electoral campaign said 
gerhard sunderdiek client manager at bank of america in frankfurt

the dollar rose 007 yen to a closing 13315 yen later in london

discuss a 49 billion buyout offer from batus inc but warned it 
still has reservations about the proposed friendly merger 
on a separate front in the eightmonth takeover battle the 
insurer vowed to appeal a ruling by regulators in illinois tuesday 
giving a tentative green light to a farmersbatus merger in that 
state 
farmers offer to negotiate was the first significant easing of 
the companys opposition to a buyout by batus a louisville 
kybased tobacco and retailing company 
despite the offer of negotiations farmers has a number of 
objections to a merger said leo e denlea jr farmers chairman 
and chief executive 
farmers board of directors has made no decision concerning a 
sale of the company denlea said in a news release we will 
have to address the issues being raised in the insurance regulatory 
hearings and the concerns of our insurance exchanges in a 
comprehensive fashion if there is to be any prospect for a 
transaction 
a batus spokesman said the company had no immediate comment but 
was preparing a statement 
batus a subisidiary of bat industries plc of britain is 
seeking to acquire farmers to gain a foothold in the american 
financial services business farmers is the nations third biggest 
auto and home insurer and seventh biggest property and casualty 
insurer 
top management of farmers declined to negotiate after batus 
announced its initial proposal early this year and batus took its 
offer directly to shareholders with a cash tender offer 
that offer now stands at 63 a share or about 44 billion 
last week batus announced it would be willing to pay 72 a share 
for the company if farmers management agreed to back the bid 
it was the latter proposal which values the company at 
approximately 49 billion that won farmers agreement to 
negotiate 
farmers has contested batus overtures in mailings to 
shareholders in court and in hearings before insurance regulators 
in nine states where authorities must approve such a merger

takeover by batus as long as the company agreed to maintain 
farmers fees and various lines of insurance and to continue 
nonsmoker discounts batus spokesman wilson wyatt said the company 
has already agreed to meet those conditions 
a farmers spokesman said the company intended to appeal the 
decision 
in the various insurance hearings farmers noting batus owns 
the company that makes kool and viceroy cigarettes has suggested a 
buyout could bring an end to the companys insurance discounts for 
nonsmokers though batus officials have maintained they would do 
no such thing farmers representatives have suggested an insurer 
owned by batus would deemphasize antismoking policies and 
advertisements 
ohio regulators have approved the merger with conditions similar 
to those made by illinois and arizona regulators also approved the 
deal idaho washington and oregon have rejected it and decisions 
or hearings are pending in texas and kansas california regulators 
rejected the merger but that decision was overturned by a state 
court 
most of the decisions are in various stages of appeal 
farmers has 684 million shares outstanding and employees hold 
options to buy an additional 15 million new shares bringing the 
total of shares likely to be bought in an unfriendly takeover to

the last pontiac produced in pontiac by 
general motors corp has rolled of the assembly line ending more 
than 60 years of auto production in this city which lent its name 
to the automobile 
the last two sporty fieros produced at the plant tuesday were 
turned over to two workers who won raffles they were among the 
1400 group employees placed on indefinite layoff with the plant 
closing 
as the last fieros moved off the line workers were hoping 
transfer slips would be awaiting them when they got home 
itll be there said utility worker otto hardwig 38 of 
oxford if not ill do dishes or sweep floors 
id gladly return the car to get my job back said mike 
kelley a truck driver at the plant who won the twoseat vehicle 
that was discontinued due to slow sales 
more than 370000 cars had been built since they were introduced 
in the 1984 model year the last vehicles came off the production 
line about 1030 am tuesday 
my father had seven sons who have over 100 years in this 
place said daniel lemaster 51 all that service now 
this 
though some gm trucks and engines still are built in pontiac 
cars named for the city will be built in factories in eight other 
cities including lansing and ypsilanti 
the shutdown is the latest in a series of plant closings and 
cutbacks at the complex a rearwheeldrive assembly line and a 
foundry were closed last year 
in an effort to comply with terms of its 1987 labor pact with 
the united auto workers prohibiting plant closings gm listed the 
shutdown as an idling implying the plant might reopen 
the automaker however has made no plans at this point that 
would pump new life into the old factory which dates back to 1925 
when the old fisher body co originally erected the building 
the fiero initially was a hit with consumers but by mid1985 
sales went into a long slow decline that never reversed the slide 
was intensified by a shift in consumer preferences away from 
twoseaters 
workers at the plant were praised by the company for their 
efforts in refining the team concept and creativity in improving 
productivity 
general motors is pretty pleased with the contributions the 
fiero team and fiero plant made to gm it will have a lasting 
impact on gm said gm spokeswoman kathy tanner 
layoffs at the fiero plant began last week and will be completed 
by sept 15 gm officials said 
once the shutdown is complete about 50 hourly workers will 
remain at the fiero plant to tend the idled machinery and take care 
of other jobs related to the plants idling the automaker said

maxicare of utah inc has announced it has 
withdrawn from utah leaving its 20000 healthcare subscribers 
uninsured 
the announcement was made at a news conference tuesday at which 
officials of the healthmaintenance organization said they were 
ceasing immediately all healthcare coverage in utah 
harold c yancey state commissioner of insurance said he hoped 
health care providers would honor maxicare contracts until the 
state can come up with a solution to the vacuum left by maxicares 
sudden departure 
maxicare of utah which operated under the national corporate 
umbrella of maxicare health plans opened its utah operation in 
january 1984 
yancey characterized maxicare of utah inc as being in an 
insolvent situation 
he said utah officials will meet with 10 other health 
maintenance organizations doing business in the state in the hope 
that one or more will be able to cover maxicare contracts 
were still holding meetings in the department to try and find 
some coverage for all of the enrollees in maxicare yancey said 
we hope providers will continue to see their patients and 
honor the agreements with maxicare the commissioner said the 
health providers are going to have to make a business decision 
but their claims may or may not be paid 
yancey said state officials became aware of maxicares problems 
last spring when a state financial examination of 1987 records 
revealed the health maintenance organization was in trouble 
he said the parent company had hoped eventually that the company 
would be able to turn a profit in utah 
maxicares losses and the misfortune of other health maintenance 
organizations in utah are part of a nationwide problem yancey 
said it is not a unique utah problem hmos all over the us are 
in dire trouble he said 
he said factors making it difficult for hmos to make money 
include escalating medical costs exotic new treatments that are 
costly inadequate premiums and subscribers taking record numbers 
of trips to the doctor 
the customers are taking more advantage of their health care 
than ever before yancey said

the first time since july 17 noted its extreme irritation 
wednesday at the trade bill passed by the us congress 
government spokesman claude evin speaking after the meeting 
said both president francois mitterrand and premier michel rocard 
manifested their irritation and accused the united states of 
creating a new policy without international consultation

will have the occasion to examine the consequences of the decisions 
taken in the united states 
the spokesman refused to discuss possible retaliatory measures 
he said the minister of agriculture was particularly concerned 
by the bill and noted that the common market has already termed it 
protectionist 
among other things the bill focuses unfairtrade investigations

coherent inc has entered an agreement 
that will end its status as one of the last holdouts in a 
protracted patent fight over who invented the laser the company 
said 
the palo altobased company said tuesday it will pay tiny patlex 
corp of chatsworth calif license fees on the sale of most of

the agreement with patlex covers gas discharge lasers made by 
coherent and it protects coherents customers from patent

in licensing income from patents it has secured over the years for 
inventor gordon gould gould came up with a design for a laser in 
the 1950s while he was a graduate student at columbia university

townes a former physics professor at columbia who was a consultant 
to bell laboratories and arthur schawlow then a bell laboratories 
scientist 
in october the us patent office gave gould a patent for the 
invention of the gas discharge laser

million gtech also has contracts in iceland and ireland but has

when gtech installed its computer terminals in mexico in june 
1987 it marked the first time mexicos lotto game had been 
automated about 20 percent of mexican lotto agents are outfitted 
with gtech terminals said markowicz gtechs terminals account for 
about half of all lotto sales in mexico he said

objections by directors to some proposed changes 
on the general motors corp board and a retreat by chairman roger 
b smith may show the auto companys management that board approval 
can no longer be taken for granted 
smith was startled at a recent board meeting when outside 
directors protested changes that would affect the makeup of the 
board and stood their ground the wall street journal reported 
today 
gms board isnt undercutting management the newspaper 
quoted a source close to the board as saying but theres a 
feeling that perhaps the board wasnt as involved in some past 
decisions as it should have been 
one director was quoted as saying theres no doubt that the 
board has a sense of wanting to be less spoken to and more 
consulted with we are getting a little more ventilation in a 
place where the windows havent been open 
the discussion at the boards june 27 meeting did not involve a 
major strategic decision for the company 
following a decision by elmer w johnson an executive vice 
president and board member to resign smith proposed a series of 
executive changes 
he wanted to name william e hoglund robert t oconnell and 
john f smith jr as executive vice presidents and place them on 
the board as had been customary for executive vice presidents 
but outside board members objected to replacing one inside 
director with three which would give management eight of 20 seats 
or 40 percent of the votes rather than six of 18 or 33 percent 
a compromise was worked out in which the three will sit at the 
board table but without full director status 
the original proposal never came to a vote rogers smart he 
can count one director told the newspaper 
smith said tuesday it would be improper to discuss the meeting 
but maintained the outside directors have long been active and 
independent 
i dont think theyre more questioning or critical now than a 
year ago smith said 
gm president robert stempel an inside director acknowledged 
plenty of discussion at the meeting though he said i dont want 
to use the word disagreement our outside board members always 
offer us counsel they certainly in this matter have given us 
copious advice 
automatic support for management began to falter in 1984 when 
gm acquired electronic data systems corp and put its founder h 
ross perot on the board perot voted no the following year when gm 
decided to acquire hughes aircraft co 
one possible area of increasing board involvement is the 
question of tying executive pay more closely to results which some 
directors advocate 
another looming question is management succession with vice 
chairman donald j atwood who oversees gms hightech 
subsidiaries retiring next year and smith scheduled to step down 
in july 1990 
some directors said an atmosphere encouraging free discussion 
was strengthened by the 1982 appointment of john g smale 
innovative chairman of procter amp gamble co to the board and the 
1986 appointment of james d robinson iii chairman of american 
express co

a top official of the us department of 
transportation has ordered a lower level official of the department 
to reconsider a recommendation that american airlines replace 
united airlines on the lucrative seattletokyo route 
chicagobased united the nations largest airline expressed 
confidence tuesday that the department will reverse the 
recommendation on the transpacific route which united has flown 
since 1983 
united became a major player in the far east market in 1985 
after acquiring pan am corps pacific routes for 715 million in 
what was then the largest airline route deal in history 
but in april dot officials argued that united had diverted much 
of its tokyo traffic around seattle to san francisco and los 
angeles the department also said fort worthbased american has a 
better financial base and its traffic pattern from the midwest 
would better serve the seattle base 
united has been flying the route since 1983 but its service is 
under review as a condition of government approval of its purchase 
of pan ams pacific routes 
taking the route away from united which has served it 
faithfully for more than five years is not in the best interests 
of the united states and does not make sense said united 
chairman stephen m wolf 
wolfs remarks tuesday came one day after richard walsh 
director of dots office of economics recommended the route shift 
from united to american the secondlargest us carrier 
assistant transportation secretary matthew scocozza instructed 
walsh to review his recommendation in advance of the departments 
final decision expected in midseptember 
walshs recommendation also contradicted a june 10 finding by 
administrative law judge burton kolko that united should retain the 
route 
american welcomed walshs recommendation 
obviously were excited and delighted at the recommendation 
said al becker a spokesman for american we think that we have 
made the strongest case for the route 
becker said american would spend many millions of dollars 
expanding its operation at seattletacoma international airport to 
1700 employees and would pump 400 million into the seattle 
economy annually if it won the route 
the seattletokyo route is viewed by the airline industry as one 
of the most prized in the expanding pacific travel market 
northwest airlines is the only other us carrier allowed by 
japan to fly the route in competition with japan air lines 
the japanese ministry of transport last year set a goal of 
doubling the number of outbound japanese travelers to 10 million by 
1991 many are expected to choose seattle as their first us 
destination

jane e smitt prefers being known 
as a residential organizer than michigans closet queen 
but no matter how she describes it what smitt does for a living 
is make big bucks by arranging wealthy peoples closets 
at least they start out as closets she turns them into 
fabulous spaces behind doors that can turn even the worst slob 
into an organized fashion plate 
except while shes at it she gets rid of the closet doors 
my premise is that you should be able to see everything you 
have it should all be out in the open smitt said 
nothing is strewn on the floor in smitts own closet which is 
more like an entire room in her west bloomfield home nothing is 
hidden in even the remotest of corners and clothes are not so 
crammed that they come out wrinkled there are nooks to stash 
purses and crannies to hang belts long spaces for dresses and 
pants shorter spaces for tshirts and skirts and little drawers 
for underwear and socks 
on top of all that the clothes are color coordinated by season 
black to white and cotton to wool 
even her 75 pairs of shoes have a place most of my clients 
have about 125 pairs she adds in a futile attempt not to appear 
excessive 
indeed theres a place for everything and she doesnt have to 
ask her clients to get rid of anything 
i cant stretch walls but i generally can double and 
sometimes triple the space in a closet she said my goal is to 
make everything visible and to make it more functional my business 
is so custom some of my clients let me open all the doors some 
people dont some people store a case of toilet paper some people 
buy four rolls at a time 
the key is listening to them just to find out about their 
lifestyles and know how they live then you can better direct them 
and better advise them 
like if you know a guy isnt going to walk a few steps to put 
a shirt in the laundry you need to know that so he doesnt end up 
in the same situation hes already in or maybe the mirror needs to 
go right near the tie rack otherwise hes going to walk out with 
his tie crooked 
her clients are equally serious about the business 
before when i wanted to wear something i didnt know which 
closet it was in said adria aronovitz who used to have to 
disperse her garments in three closets throughout her home 
aronovitzs son moved out and smitt converted his room into a 
closet 
now aronovitz who sells jewelry from her home loves her closet 
so much she treats it like a showcase bringing guests in to see it 
it is easier now i just love it it makes such a big 
difference she said i spend a lot of time in there 
smitts designs reduce junk collecting and disorder because 
theres a specific place for everything high heels wont fit in a 
slot for tennis shoes and a dress will not fit in a shorter space 
intended for a skirt the compartments are all adjustable to allow 
for inevitable fashion changes smitt even provides pullout hooks 
for unused hangars 
smitt 35 has charged from 250 to redo an existing closet it 
takes two weeks if drawers arent needed to 15000 for all the 
closets in a birmingham home she began work on before it was built 
that took a year and a half single closets range from 250 for a 
5foot lineal closet to 6000 for a 15footby18foot room 
her price includes her design fee materials aesthetics belt 
and tie racks hooks and any other gadgets she needs to make the 
closet fit the customer some ask for shoe shiners pant steamers 
or a space to pack suitcases 
smitt confesses she didnt always have a tidy room but she was 
the type of child who felt she had better things to do than listen 
to her teachers during school 
i loved to organize my pencil drawers i used to take all the 
pencils out of the drawer and put them back in and when i went 
home id take everything out of my looseleafs and make it really 
organized she said still today i like making the silverware 
drawer stacked in neat piles i like to do it 
it just became a natural i love it i love what i do 
smitt said she earned a college degree at the request of her 
father but she never really found her niche in life until she 
started working in kitchen sales her business developed from that 
she has been in business for herself about six years and now 
employs an accountant and a parttime assistant who helps with 
designs she says she has never advertised she relies on 
wordofmouth by happy clients 
smitt organizes all spaces behind doors including linen 
closets and kitchen pantries shes even done a yacht 
her service is not unique she has competition in the nearby 
affluent detroit suburb of grosse pointe and shes a member of the 
los angelesbased national association of professional organizers 
but smitt says shes one of the few organizers who will return 
after the design is complete and the carpenter is finished to hang 
up each piece of clothing 
you have to give them order in their life and if you give 
people order then generally they can maintain it smitt said

an investigation of alleged fraud in 
government defense contracts could harm the business united 
technologies corp does with the military the company has told its 
shareholders 
united technologies which does about 4 billion worth of 
business each year with the defense department made the suggestion 
in an aug 12 filing with the securities and exchange commission 
the company based in hartford is one of about three dozen us 
defense contractors searched by federal agents investigating the 
fraud allegations 
if the corporation were charged with wrongdoing as a result of 
the investigation the corporation or its units could be suspended 
as a government contractor united technologies said in its sec 
filing 
the filing was made after the sec warned companies under 
investigation of their obligation to inform shareholders of 
developments that might affect the companies finances 
united technologies said in its filing that some of its 
operating units were searched and received grand jury subpoenas in 
the case no one has been charged with wrongdoing 
also noted in the filing is that the investigation into 
procurement practices has prompted the defense department to 
require two united technologies subsidiaries pratt amp whitney and 
norden systems to sign certification of business integrity 
when bidding on future government contracts 
united technologies and other defense contractors are seeking a 
modification of the directive which asks them to affirm they have 
not obtained confidential bidding information 
according to the sec filing the investigation and certification 
requirement and the uncertainty they are creating in the defense 
industry may adversely affect the corporations ability to obtain 
government business 
united technologies spokeswoman peg hashem said tuesday the 
company thought the filing was appropriate because of the secs 
advisory and the defense departments certification requirement 
charles larson a spokesman for the sec in washington said the 
commission didnt specifically request united technologies to make 
its filing in its standard financial document called a form 10q 
i think some of the contractors are responding to our 
statement that publicly traded companies have the responsibility to 
put out full and timely information about the investigation 
larson said 
northrop corp of los angeles another target of the pentagon 
investigation also has made two public disclosures to its 
shareholders through sec filings larson said the sec is not 
keeping track of which other defense contractors have made similar 
filings

crop futures opened mostly lower today on the 
chicago board of trade as the market registered disappointment in 
the slack global demand for us grains and soybean products 
with the end of the growing season approaching the focus of 
grain and soybean traders is gradually shifting from weather to 
demand concerns especially in exports analysts said 
in the corn market which has recently been the leader among the 
crop futures there is very little nearterm demand and nothing 
to hold it in the short run said cathy leow a grain trader for 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
the approaching corn harvest traditionally brings lower corn 
prices she said adding i just look for the softness to 
continue 
cooler temperatures and showers were expected to reach the 
droughtstricken corn belt on thursday which should give the 
struggling soybean crop a break from recordsetting heat 
wheat futures weakened on news the agriculture department had 
rejected egypts bid for 250000 metric tons of subsidized wheat 
in early trading wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 387 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 5 cents lower with september at 282 a bushel oats were 
3 cents to 5 cents lower with september at 274 a bushel 
soybeans were 10 cents to 13 cents lower with august at 853 a 
bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 17 cent to 40 cent higher with august at 
7020 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent lower to 20 cent 
higher with august at 8185 cents a pound hogs were 27 cent lower 
to 28 cent higher with august at 4690 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were unchanged to 70 cent higher with august at 3440 
cents a pound

a federal judge was urged today to block the 
partial merger of detroits daily newspapers by a lawyer who 
contended that former attorney general edwin meese iii ignored the 
law in approving the deal 
william schultz representing michigan citizens for an 
independent press argued that neither the detroit free press nor 
the detroit news could qualify as failing newspapers under the 
law that allows joint operating agreements of dailies in the same 
city 
you have a situation where the two competing newspapers are in 
a struggle for control and its not at all clear who is going to 
win schultz told us district judge joyce hens green at a 
hearing on his groups bid for a temporary restraining order 
the two newspapers are scheduled to combine their commercial and 
production facilities thursday under a joint operating agreement 
approved last week by meese before he left office 
the news which is owned by gannett co inc and the free 
press owned by knightridder inc will maintain separate 
editorial staffs but publish joint editions on weekends 
the news now a 24hour paper will publish evening editions 
during the week 
schultz said meese ignored an administrative law judges finding 
that neither paper was in danger of financial collapse the 
administrative law judge recommended against approval of the joint 
operating agreement under an antitrust exemption provided by the 
newspaper preservation act 
philip lacovara representing knightridder said the partial 
merger is the only solution to a bad situation 
although the merger will result in 500 layoffs 1500 jobs would 
be lost in detroit if the free press closed its doors lacovara 
said knightridder had threatened to close the paper which has 
lost 562 million since 1980 if the joint operating agreement 
were not approved 
the free press cannot survive cannot become profitable so 
long as it is in commercial competition with the news lacovara 
told the judge who reserved decision on the injunction 
the free press has no unilateral way out the competitive 
situation is such that it cant get in the black by unilaterally 
raising its prices lacovara said 
the plaintiffs who include advertisers a state senator and 
one parttime printer who was told he would no longer have a job 
under the joint operating agreement have also filed suit for a 
permanent injunction against the merger 
the suit filed tuesday charged that meeses order allowing the 
joint operating agreement is arbitrary and capricious contrary 
to law and not supported by substantial evidence that either 
daily qualified as a failing newspaper under the newspaper 
preservation act 
the merger will remove the beneficial effects of competition 
on the quality in terms of editorial coverage diversity and news 
reporting and is likely to cause a rise in the prices of 
newspapers in the detroit areas the complaint said 
the suit also said the combined operation will result in 
increased advertising rates 
the plaintiffs say meese violated justice department regulations 
by meeting with members of michigans congressional delegation in 
june to discuss the newspaper merger 
the lawsuit contends that meese ignored recommendations by 
morton needelman the administrative law judge that the losses by 
both newspapers were the result of a marketing strategy designed to 
drive the competition out of business or force creation of a joint 
operating agreement 
needelman also found that the free press was not in a downward 
spiral financially nor was it dominated by the news 
the plaintiffs include democratic state sen john f kelly and 
public citizen a consumer lobby organization founded by ralph 
nader also joining the suit were w edward wendover a journalism 
professor and publisher of the weekly plymouthcanton community 
crier and david a kersh president of metro publications inc 
which sells coupon books and advertises in the news

housing construction climbed 24 percent in july the government 
said today but a companion report indicated that higher mortgage 
rates may stifle the construction business in coming months 
building permits for future construction fell 54 percent the 
biggest decline since a 9 percent fall in january the commerce 
department said analysts said higher borrowing costs could be 
discouraging the market 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were being 
built at an annual rate of 149 million units in july it was the 
second consecutive monthly increase following a 44 percent rise in 
june 
stocks weakened today after a higher opening but brokers said 
the market signaled no clear direction the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks which partly recovered tuesday from a 
threemonth low was higher during much of the morning before 
retreating and was down 568 points to 201583 by noon edt 
on tuesday stocks bonds and the dollar rose in spite of a 
government report that the nations merchandise trade deficit 
widened to 125 billion in june 
tuesdays report caught the market off guard and hurt prices at 
first but investors eventually found reasons to be content with 
the biggest trade gap since february 
investors also failed to be unnerved by a federal reserve report 
that american industry operated at 835 percent of capacity in 
july that was the highest operating level in eight years and 
could be an indicator of rising inflation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 1724 to 
202151 on tuesday recovering about half the loss it sustained 
monday in falling to a threemonth low 
the dollar which lost more than 1 percent of its value right 
after the trade report finished the day with halfpercentage point 
gains against the british pound west german mark and japanese yen 
bond prices strengthened after morning losses with the yield on 
the bellwether 30year treasury bond dipping to 940 percent from 
943 percent late monday 
the markets reaction was far more positive than in april when 
the commerce departments report of a 144 billion february 
deficit contributed to a 10146point drop in the dow jones 
industrial average 
basically the trade number wasnt bad it may not have been 
spectacular but it was quite all right said arnold moskowitz 
senior vice president and economist for dean witter reynolds inc 
moskowitz said the deficit was not far above expectations 
considering the wide fluctuations that are typical and he said 
some of the record imports that swelled the june deficit probably 
should have been recorded in may when the deficit was unexpectedly 
low 
investors also were impressed with an upward revision in may 
exports which led to a reduction in the may deficit to 98 
billion from 109 billion 
the factory use report added to concerns that the economy is 
overheating but moskowitz said recent fed moves to raise interest 
rates are beginning to cool off consumer spending leaving slack 
for exportdriven industries to continue their expansion 
this onemonth jump in the trade deficit is not cause for 
alarm us trade representative clayton yeutter said in a 
statement monthly numbers will always be erratic and it is more 
instructive to focus on the longterm outlook 
exports fell by 24 percent in june to a seasonally adjusted 
268 billion while imports surged to an alltime high of 394 
billion 
even with the deterioration the us trade deficit for the 
first six months of the year was running at an annual rate of 140 
billion down sharply from the record deficit of 1703 billion set 
in 1987

more than a year after the united states slapped 
penalty tariffs on japan for allegedly violating an agreement on 
semiconductor trade japanese officials are stepping up pressure on 
washington to remove the penalties before president reagan leaves 
office 
us officials counter that the japanese government continues to 
renege on a pledge to boost the market share of imported us chips 
the 300ffs since reduced to 165 million were 
the strongest trade retaliation the united states has taken against 
japan since world million in tari war ii 
the problem remains of a lack of market access said a 
senior us trade official speaking on condition of anonymity 
there is a certain goal and the japanese side is not living up 
to it 
the japanese claim sales of american semiconductors here soared 
75 percent in the first quarter of this year over the same period 
last year 
i dont know any people who are so greedy that theyre not 
satisfied with a 75 percent increase in one year makoto kuroda 
exvice minister of the ministry of international trade and 
industry told journalists this month 
miti chief hajime tamura has urged us trade representative 
clayton yeutter to lift the sanctions before the end of the reagan 
admistates isnt in danger of being dethroned as 
the worlds soybean king but the royal attire is a bit ragged and 
some other countries that produce oilseed crops stand to make a 
little profit 
based on aug 1 indications the agriculture department 
estimates the 1988 soybean harvest at 147 billion bushels or 23 
percent less than last years production the yield was put at 26 
bushels per acre compared with 337 in 1987 
two years ago according to usda economists soybeans brought 
farmers an average of 478 per bushel in the 198788 marketing 
year that runs through the end of august prices are expected to 
average 620 per bushel 
even before the drought was fully developed this summer it was 
apparent that the us soybean supply was running low and that 
demand would boost prices in june usda forecast bean prices in 
198889 the year that will begin on sept 1 would be in the 
range of 575 to 775 per bushel 
in july after the fierce heat and drought spread deep into corn 
and soybean areas the usda upped the price forecast to 675 to 
925 per bushel 
the august analysis put the 198889 soybean price range at 725 
to 975 per bushel 
when the new marketing year begins sept 1 the us soybean 
stockpile is expected to be about 280 million bushels down from 
436 million a year ago by this time next year the bean reserve 
may be 100 million bushels or less according to the usda 
projections 
an updated crop report and analysis of the supplydemand 
situation along with new price forecasts will be issued by the 
department on sept 12 hot dry weather during the soybean plants 
critical flowering stage since aug 1 has caused concern that 
harvest prospects have continued to decline 
meanwhile the soybeans international importance as an oilseed 
continues to come under scrutiny by usda experts other sources of 
vegetable oil and protein meal such as rapeseed cottonseed and 
other crops also are drawing close attention 
overall based on august indications the departments foreign 
agricultural service estimated world oilseed production in 198889 
at 2014 million metric tons down 2 percent from the july forecast 
and also 2 percent below the 198788 output 
lower production of soybeans in the united states and china 
because of droughtreduced yields account for most of the 
decline the agency reported partially offsetting the 
reductions from last month are a projected 500000ton increase in 
brazilian soybean production substantial improvement for indias 
peanut crop and a 403000ton rise in us cottonseed output 
the report added high relative prices for soybeans are 
expected to stimulate area gains plantings in brazil 
brazil is the secondlargest soybean producer and is the biggest 
competitor of us farmers in world markets 
the 1988 us harvest of 147 billion bushels translates into 
about 401 million metric tons there are about 367 bushels of 
beans in a ton 
comparatively brazils 198889 crop is forecast at 20 million 
tons followed by china 12 million and argentina 11 million the 
12nation european economic community is expected to produce 155 
million tons of soybeans this season and paraguay 12 million 
other countries are expected to produce the remainder 
while soybeans are the largest component of the global oilseed 
production forecast of 2014 million tons they still comprise less 
than half of the total other sources include cottonseed 3307 
million tons peanuts 22 million sunflowerseed 2123 million 
rapeseed 2149 million flaxseed 2 million copra 473 million 
and palm kernel 285 million 
because they are in the southern hemisphere and thus on a 
different calendar cycle for growing seasons latin american 
producers are finding the us drought is affecting their plans 
in an effort to capitalize on higher prices before the us 
harvest in 1989 brazil and argentina are forecast to increase 
their exports of soybeans the report said 
brazil is expected to export 39 million tons of soybeans in 
198889 up from 27 million last season and argentinas shipments 
are forecast at 32 million tons up from 24 million in 198788 
but the higher prices are dampening the demand for soybean 
imports in some major markets the report said the soviet union 
for example is expected to reduce bean imports in 198889 to 15 
million tons down 17 percent from this season the soviets are 
also expected to reduce imports of soybean meal to 27 million 
tons down 100000 tons from this year 
the major us foreign market for soybeans is the european 
economic community and the higher prices are expected to reduce 
shipments to 112 million tons in 198889 down 19 million tons 
from this year the report said however us sales of soybean 
meal are forecast to rise slightly from 13 million tons in 198788

the majority of personal computers recently 
tested by the federal communications commission failed to meet the 
agencys standards on radio interference according to a published 
report on wednesday 
some 75 percent of the personal computers tested failed to meet 
the standards and the consequent interference can disrupt 
television sets or cause problems with other home appliances and 
equipment the san francisco chronicle reported 
companies allegedly are using a variety of tactics to evade the 
fcc standards including instances where a firm will modify a 
personal computer to pass the tests but will not incorporate the 
modification in other machines it manufactures 
those machines are what we call laboratory queens said 
jerry freeman the fccs national coordinator for 
computermarketing enforcement the manufacturers dont market 
exactly what they submitted to us 
some of the more flagrant violations have been committed by 
small offshore companies especially from asia said freeman 
however others claim that bigname companies have also had 
problems with the fcc in recent years 
theyve all had problems said terry mahn a washington 
dc attorney who represents companies in proceedings before the 
fcc 
merle coe president of washingtonbased haar industries inc 
said his company recently tested about 150 computers before finding 
one that passed fcc standards 
haar industries which makes software and accessory circuit 
boards found deficiencies in personal computers made by such large 
companies as international business machines corp hewlettpackard 
co and mitsubishi electric corp 
the fcc attempts to force compliance by levying 2000 civil 
fines which mahn labeled an insufficient threat mahn said that in 
some cases the agency has successfully forced companies to reform 
by threatening to seize and liquidate thousands of computers in 
inventory 
freeman said the fccs spot check included computer models that 
had originally passed the agencys class b standard based on 
earlier tests of sample machines supplied by the manufacturers the 
class b standard regulates emissions of machines sold for use in 
the home 
those standards are designed to keep various kinds of products 
from causing dangerous interference like disruption of emergency 
signals from police or other government agencies freeman said 
interference could also cause other computers to lose data 
the problem for personal computer manufacturers has been 
obtaining certification various components in a computer generate 
radio waves and companies must make exacting tests with their own 
equipment or through independent testing laboratories before 
submitting a product for review by the fcc 
the agency reviews the submitted data and makes its own 
additional tests before issuing certification in the fastmoving 
pc market many companies cannot afford to wait that long 
the problem is the offshore guys plain and simple said jim 
johnson president of amdador corp a minnesotabased testing 
laboratory

for the apriljune period new housing construction slipped 9 
percent to 406882 units compared with 446955 units built during

the report followed the release of commerce department 
statistics saying housing construction climbed 24 percent in july 
to an annual rate of 149 million units that was the second 
consecutive monthly increase following a 44 percent rise in june

threequarters of its peak volume reached in 1986 when apartment 
construction was being subsidized by tax incentives said george 
a christie chief economist for fw dodge which reports 
regularly on construction activity 
christie said most of the decline has been in rental housing

eastman kodak co has decided to keep the 
household products group it acquired in the 51 billion 
acquisition of sterling drug co company officials said wednesday 
kodak concluded the lehn amp fink unit of sterling which sells 
lysol disinfectant dcon rat poison and other wellknown products 
is too important to lose said kay whitmore kodaks president 
and executive officer 
in recent weeks published reports and rumors on wall street 
indicated that kodak planned to sell the montvale njbased unit 
which had sales of 594 million last year 
im not surprised theyre keeping it said mark obenzinger 
an analyst with wood gundy amp co in new york they couldnt get 
the price they wanted they paid top dollar for it so they have to 
get top top dollar for it 
eugene glazer an analyst for dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york agreed noting that one reason kodak needed to hang a higher 
pricetag on the unit was to cover a hefty tax that would have been 
levied on the deal 
tax law changes in 1986 make it more expensive for companies to 
buy another firm and sell off the unwanted parts of it glazer said 
because of the new law kodak would have to pay hundreds of 
millions of dollars in taxes if it sold lehn amp fink he said 
while lehn amp fink still does not fit into kodaks strategic 
plans analysts said its a successful and wellrun company that 
wont hurt kodaks bottom line 
whitmore told lehn amp fink employees wednesday he envisioned lehn 
amp fink marketing products developed by kodaks chemical division 
kodak using its strength in convenience store outlets to get lehn amp 
fink products onto more store shelves and kodak helping market 
lehn amp finks products overseas 
kodak bought sterling drug co for 51 billion earlier this 
year as a white knight for sterling which was trying to avoid 
a hostile takeover attempt by swiss multinational pharmaceutical 
giant f hoffmanlaroche amp co

in the first uneasy truce in a lengthy 
takeover battle officials of farmers insurance group inc and 
batus inc met wednesday to discuss batus proposal for a friendly 
49 billion buyout 
but both sides professed themselves prepared to continue the war 
they have waged for eight months in the stock market the courts 
and before state regulatory bodies 
batus chairman patrick sheehy was in los angeles farmers 
headquarters and was expected to meet with farmers chairman leo 
e denlea according to spokesmen for both companies no details of 
the talks were released 
the meeting came one day after farmers agreed to discuss a 
sweetened 72ashare offer from the louisville kybased 
tobacco and retailing company in making the offer last week batus 
set a deadline of friday for negotiation of a definitive agreement 
farmers spurned batus offer of a negotiated purchase early this 
year and the companies have since been sparring over batus 
hostile bid to acquire a controlling stake in the open market 
batus 63ashare tender offer to shareholders remains in 
effect and the company has indicated it would continue that 
hostile takeover effort if the talks with farmers are fruitless 
for its part farmers reaffirmed wednesday it would appeal 
tuesdays regulatory ruling giving conditional approval to the 
merger in illinois one of nine states in which insurance 
regulators must endorse the deal 
batus whose holdings include retailers led by saks fifth avenue 
and the maker of kool and viceroy cigarettes is the us 
subsidiary of bat industries plc of britain

grain futures closed mostly lower wednesday while 
most soybean contracts advanced in a fourth day of volatile trading 
on the chicago board of trade 
theres no rhyme or reason to it necessarily said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc its just the 
same choppy pattern weve seen last several days and i think were 
going to continue in this vein 
with the end of the growing season approaching grain and 
soybean traders are paying more attention to global demand factors 
than the weathers effects on supplies analysts said 
in the corn market which has recently been the leader among the 
crop futures there is very little nearterm demand and nothing 
to hold it in the short run said cathy leow assistant 
vicepresident in charge of grain futures trading for thomson 
mckinnon securities inc 
export demand for wheat and soybean products also has been 
slack possibly because of high prices linked to the summerlong 
drought lespinasse said 
high prices discourage demand so thats been a drag on the 
market he said lower prices will enhance demand maybe thats 
what the markets trying to tell us 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 390 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 3 cents higher with september at 285 a bushel 
oats were 4 cents to 7 cents lower with september at 270 a 
bushel soybeans were 7 cents lower to 16 cents higher with august 
at 877 a bushel

a former merrill lynch amp co stockbroker 
pleaded guilty wednesday to engaging in a scheme in which he 
illicitly obtained advance copies of business week then reaped 
profits from trading stocks mentioned in the magazine 
william dillon 33 who was dismissed last month from merrill 
lynchs new london is the first person to be criminally charged in 
the widening insidertrading scandal involving leaked copies of 
business week 
in a 25minute hearing before us district judge ellen burns 
dillon pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud as part of a plea 
agreement he is cooperating fully with investigators 
the government said dillon paid 10 to 30 for advance copies of 
the business magazine to various emoloyees of rr donnelley amp sons 
co which prints the weekly publication at two plants including 
one in nearby old saybrook 
dillon of old lyme acknowledged that he bought nonpublic 
copies of the magazine on thursday mornings between late 1986 and 
july 1988 the publication is released to the public after the 
markets close on thursdays 
according to prosecutors he bought stock in about 129 companies 
mentioned favorably in the inside wall street column then sold 
the securities after the magazine was made public and prices rose 
dillon did not make any statements during his brief court 
appearance and would not discuss the case outside the courtroom 
he was freed on a 5000 bond and was scheduled to be sentenced 
oct 12 
the government contends that dillon made about 94000 through 
the illegal activity 
some of the profits were made through a trading account in the 
name of a yet unidentified person who engaged in the activity with 
dillon prosecutors said 
dillons mother elizabeth baird maintained an account through 
which some trades were made based on the information from business 
week the government said 
neither baird nor dillons wife diana dillon who worked 
briefly at donnelley will face any charges as a result of his plea 
bargain 
both dillon and his mother will be required to turn over all 
profits realized through the scheme to the government prosecutors 
said 
the us attorneys office last week announced that dillon would 
plead guilty and cooperate with investigators in the probe that has 
extended to a number of brokerage houses 
rr donnelley has fired five employees from its old saybrook 
plant and one from its torrance calif facility another 
donnelley employee resigned 
assistant us attorney peter jongbloed said dillon usually held 
his shares less than one week before cashing them in for profit 
dillon also admitted tipping off others to information he illicitly 
obtained the government said 
in the complaint to which dillon pleaded guilty wedneday he was 
charged with using wire communications on sept 24 1987 to 
purchase 8000 shares of the common stock of valhi inc 
jongbloed said dillon sold the shares four days later for a 
profit of more than 10000 
dillon also has agreed to plead guilty sept 6 to another wire 
fraud count stemming from the same scheme in us district court 
in new york 
prosecutors said they would recommend that dillon serve 
sentences for the connecticut and new york charges concurrently 
the wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a 250000 fine 
dillons attorney henry putzel said wednesday there may be 
some small facts we quibble with but he said his client 
acknowledged that the governments evidence was strong enough to 
lead to a conviction if he were tried

two big institutional shareholders in texaco 
inc want a voice in nominating directors to texacos board and 
some analysts said wednesday the move could run into stiff 
resistance from texaco management 
officials of the california public employee retirement system 
and the new york state employees retirement fund will ask for a 
formal longterm role in choosing texaco directors they plan to 
make the request at a meeting on aug 24 with texaco president 
james w kinnear said richard koppes general counsel of the 
california fund 
the new york pension holds 3 million texaco shares and the 
california fund has 783000 of the companys 2443 million shares 
outstanding the california system is the largest public employee 
pension fund in the country with more than 46 billion in assets 
while the new york fund controls 39 billion 
two seats on the texaco board are expected to open within the 
next year the two pension funds want institutional shareholders in 
texaco to be permanently represented on the boards nominating 
committee by independent delegates who are neither executives 
nor shareholders 
the two funds are not seeking to place direct representatives on 
the boards nominating committee koppes said since they would get 
access to confidential information about texaco that could conflict 
with their fiduciary responsibilities as money managers 
the pension officials could be tempted to buy or sell texaco 
stock on the basis of that information and probably would have to 
give up the right to trade the stock before joining the board 
this could very well be an important development for all of 
corporate america said rosario ilacqua vice president of equity 
research at the investment firm nikko securities co international 
inc 
texaco declined comment on the issue anita larsen a 
spokeswoman at the companys headquarters in white plains ny 
would only reiterate kinnears recent public promise to meet with 
representatives of the institutional investors 
texaco emerged from bankruptcy court reorganization in april 
after filing the largest chapter 11 petition in us corporate 
history 
in its successful proxy battle in june with texacos largest 
shareholder financier carl c icahn management won the support of 
the california and new york pension funds by promising to consider 
their request for a voice in nominating directors 
the shareholders proposal probably makes some sense but 
it does present a lot of problems said bruce lazier an analyst 
at the investment firm prescott ball amp turben inc 
the pension funds and texaco management might be more likely 
to accept a special advisory role for the big shareholders that was 
below the level of board representation 
but even that may be difficult some observers said 
texacos record has not been very good regarding its 
treatment of shareholders ilacqua said although he conceded 
management had turned something of a new leaf since the bankruptcy 
and had been forced to become more responsive under pressure from 
icahn 
if the pension funds succeed it would mark a major 
groundbreaking victory for institutional shareholders seeking a 
bigger say in how corporations are run 
institutional shareholders have scored similar but less 
ambitious successes this year at aluminum company of america 
general mills inc minnesota mining amp manufacturing co sara lee 
corp and loral corp 
koppes the california funds general counsel acknowledged that 
there was pessimism about the two big shareholders prospects for 
success in their initiative he said he remained optimistic 
however 
were confident mr kinnear has publicly promised to engage 
in meaningful dialogue on this and we expect that will happen 
koppes said in a phone interview from his office in sacramento 
calif

global arms sales are on the decline 
and the superpowers are losing an important source of political 
leverage as nations that once relied on them for weapons turn 
elsewhere a research group said wednesday 
international arms trading reached 35 billion last year the 
stockholm international peace research institute said in its 1988 
report 
it said 247 billion worth of weapons were delivered to third 
world countries india was the worlds largest buyer with 52 
billion 
the united states the soviet union france britain and china 
supplied 80 percent of the international market said the report 
written by aaron karp a researcher at the institute 
the report also said iran and iraq have spent about 200 billion 
to fight their 8yearold war about half their total earnings from 
oil it said the war which resulted in an estimated 15 million 
casualties has become the most destructive conflict ever fought 
between two third world countries 
the institute an independent group mostly funded by the swedish 
parliament monitors worldwide developments in weapons and arms 
control 
its 600page annual report said the 35 billion of arms 
delivered last year was 28 billion more than in 1986 and was the 
highest in six years it attributed the increase to us and soviet 
supplies of jet fighters ordered in the early 1980s 
but it said developing countries are reducing their dependency 
on the superpowers for weaponry buying less and varying their 
sources and military hardware is not the foreign policy tool it 
was in the 1960s and 1970s 
developing countries it said cannot afford usbuilt weapons 
systems they dont want inferior sovietbuilt equipment and they 
are turning to other manufacturers 
the report said that if the wars in afghanistan and the persian 
gulf end the trade in major weapons could drop precipitously 
last year the iraniraq war dominated the arms trade and 
spawned a thriving black market according to the report 
it said iraq spent from 111 billion to 132 billion on its 
war efforts or nearly 30 percent of its gross national product 
iran spent an estimated 88 billion to 107 billion on the war 
annually or roughly 5 percent or 6 percent of its gnp the report 
said 
virtually all western nations found themselves embroiled in 
controversies over illegal arms sales said the report a gray 
market of officially approved covert sales was thought to be 
worth 2 billion last year the report said 
illegal or covert sales to iran in the last few years included 
antitank missiles and hawk antiaircraft missiles from the united 
states explosives and speedboats from sweden artillery shells 
from france and czech ak47 assault rifles 
governmenttogovernment sales dominated the arms market with 
more deals involved licensing agreements technology transfers and 
the modernization of outdated systems 
the arms business is becoming less tidy it has diversified 
into many new forms making the trade less predictable and harder 
to evaluate said the report 
the institute also reported that 
at the end of last year 36 major wars were in progress as 
defined by more than 1000 fatalities 
the soviet union and the united states deployed a total of 
1250 new longrange missiles last year britain and france moved 
toward jointly producing a new missile and china continued its 
military modernization 
the five countries that admit they have nuclear arms conducted 
test explosions last year at an average rate of one per week the 
soviets conducted 23 tests the united states 14 france 8 china 1 
and britain 1 
a reexamination of seismic data revealed that the united 
states conducted dozens of unannounced tests from 1963 to 1986 
last year 85 satellites were launched with military 
functions or about 75 percent of all satellites put into orbit 
the soviet union reported four launch failures compared with two 
for the united states and three other soviet satellites

capital spending he said this offers us opportunities in the 
months ahead

million shares vs 16279 million tuesday but discounting 
institutional trading in stocks with highyielding dividends it

growing attractiveness of bonds and moneymarket funds as 
alternative investments since they offer relatively high return 
with little or no risk 
the stock market is going to be anemic unless theres a big 
fundamental change in the rates available in the money markets 
groveman said theres just too much competition out there for 
stocks to do better

time in two months wednesday on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange amid signs of rising world supplies 
on other markets crop futures were mixed livestock and meat

narrowly mixed and stockindex futures were unchanged 
sugar for october delivery plunged 063 cent to 986 cents a 
pound the lowest closing price for nearterm delivery since june 
16 when the july contract finished at 969 cents a pound 
the price for october sugar has fallen nearly 37 percent in the 
past month after reaching a sevenyear high of 1530 cents a pound 
on july 19 
sugar futures had rallied on increased asian buying after china 
moved to increase the availabilty of the sweetener to its citizens 
analysts said but far eastern buying stalled in midjuly and 
futures prices have slipped steadily lower as the nearterm supply 
picture improved 
analysts said wednesdays selloff was rooted in a french 
agencys estimate that the current european sugarbeet crop would 
produce 1351 million metric tons of sugar compared with last 
years 128 million metric tons the same agency had previously 
estimated a 200000metricton decline in european sugar production

same choppy pattern weve seen last several days and i think were 
going to continue in this vein 
with the end of the growing season approaching grain and 
soybean traders are paying more attention to global demand factors 
and less attention to the weathers impact on supplies analysts 
said 
export demand for corn wheat and soybean products has been 
slack possibly because of high prices linked to the summerlong 
drought lespinasse said 
wheat settled 3 cents lower to cent higher with september at 
390 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with 
september at 284 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 7 cents lower 
with september at 270 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents lower to

enjoyed booming sales

rp scherer corps largest shareholder 
waging a proxy battle wednesday that could lead to the sale of the 
company her late father founded and estranged husband runs said 
theres no reason to believe the capsule makers brisk earnings 
pace will continue 
karla scherer fink addressing shareholders at the companys 
annual meeting here in an effort to win three seats on scherers 
board said the companys strong financial position makes this an 
opportune time to sell 
but after an hour of civilized wrangling chairman wilbur mack 
adjourned the meeting until 10 am edt next wednesday when he 
said results of the balloting would be announced ballots were 
turned over to the accounting firm of arthur young amp co for 
tabulation 
meanwhile mrs fink and her brother john s scherer were 
given an eleventhhour boost when a state court of appeals judge 
ordered that a block of 93 percent of scherers stock held in 
trust for them not be voted the trustee of the block 
manufacturers national bank indicated it would back management 
in nationwide overthecounter trading scherer closed up 137 
to 2625 
speaking to about 200 people attending the meeting mrs fink 
daughter of the companys late founder robert p scherer said 
there are interested potential buyers watching closely what goes 
on here but they will not come forward in the kind of hostile 
environment the management has created 
mrs fink filed for divorce from peter fink scherers president 
and chief executive several months ago after the board rejected 
her proposal to sell the company 
in his address to shareholders fink countered that to divert 
and to distract management and employees with a continuation of the 
controversy that has marked these past several months would be a 
grave disservice to the company and the shareholders 
while management does not intend to put a forsale sign on the 
door he said if a bonafide offer were to emerge it would 
clearly be our boards duty to give it thorough and full 
consideration 
after the meeting mrs fink refused to predict the outcome of 
the vote were hoping she said 
in a statement released later john scherer said the pair was 
confident our candidates had won the two board seats we were 
not certain about the third seat but as the meeting progressed and 
we learned the bank could not vote the trust our optimism 
increased 
fink said the company wants to first determine what the 
outcome of this election is fink added that we simply cannot 
afford to be sidetracked by a headlinemaking personality 
conflict 
scherer employing about 2800 people at 22 facilities in 13 
countries is the worlds largest maker of gelatin capsules for the 
pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries the company 
had 2907 million in sales and 151 million in net income in its 
last fiscal year ended march 31 
mrs fink and her brother control about 382 percent of the 
company but are seeking control over an additional 470000 shares 
or 93 percent that are held in two family trusts set up by their 
father 
the support of another shareholder cilluffo associates brings 
the total shares backing the pair to 399 percent 
the two had sought removal of manufacturers national bank as 
administrator of the trusts claiming it had conflicting interests 
a probate court judge named an independent fiduciary to decide how 
the stock should be voted a circuit court judge overturned that 
ruling and the two asked the state court of appeals to reverse the 
circuit judges ruling 
the dispute has been marked by letters and calls to 
shareholders advertisements and news releases

striking miners ratified a government 
agreement wednesday to end a crippling monthlong walkout and 
return to work a labor official said 
more than 150 delegates from miners unions across peru approved 
a backtowork agreement hammered out late tuesday between top 
government and strike officials said saul cantoral secretary 
general of the leftistled federation of mine metal and steel 
workers 
cantoral whose group claims to represent 75 percent of the 
nations 90000 miners said the workers would begin returning to 
work thursday 
strike official eliseo macha told the associated press the 
settlement was contingent on the government publishing a decree 
agreeing to miners collective bargaining demands 
the strike organized by the federation of mine metal and steel 
workers began july 18 since then it has cost peru more than 100 
million in lost production according to president alan garcia 
prime minister armando villanueva and cantoral with more than a 
dozen other top government and union officials signed the 
agreement late tuesday night according to the official gazette el 
peruano 
the pact calls for the nations miners to return to work and 
gives tentative approval to a major strike demand that all labor 
contracts be negotiated jointly el peruano said 
the government and the national society of mining and petroleum 
a private mine owners trade group earlier had rejected strikers 
main demand for joint negotiations arguing that each company faced 
unique problems 
analysts said mine unions were seeking to enhance their 
bargaining power position by unifying contract negotiations 
an official decree recognizing the demand for joint negotiations 
was to be issued thursday officials said 
garcia on sunday accused communists of manipulating strikers to 
destabilize the nation and threatened to declare the vital mineral 
industry in a state of emergency 
peru is a leading world producer of silver and copper and major 
source of gold lead and zinc the country traditionally receives 
more than 50 percent of its revenue from mineral exports which 
last year totalled 12 billion 
the miners federation said the strike had paralyzed 90 percent 
of the mineral activity 
industry analysts said the strike had reduced silver output by 
75 percent and copper by 70 percent staterun centromin the 
nations largest mine company halted exports of copper lead and 
zinc on july 29 
perus mineral industry has been battered with labor strikes 
this year due to a declining national economy centromin alone has 
undergone 36 strikes prior to the nationwide strike company 
officials said

imported car dealers lost a onetime profit edge 
and new car dealers overall saw profits decline as prices went up 
in 1987 according to the national automobile dealers association 
pretax profits for the average us dealership fell 121 percent 
in 1987 after declining nearly 2 percent decline in 1986 nada 
said tuesday 
the declines followed steadily rising dealer profits from 1981 
through 1985 
the nada said consumers paid an average of 13450 for a new 
1987 car or truck up 38 percent from an average of 12950 in 
1986 
profits dropped partly because fewer vehicles were sold nada 
said also a decline in the us dollar forced makers of imported 
cars to raise prices more than did us companies the trade group 
stated 
figures compiled by nada indicated import dealers accepted lower 
profits rather than pass the full amount of their price increases 
on to customers in an effort to remain competitive 
import dealerships generally were more profitable than domestic 
dealerships in the early 1980s and sometimes were able to sell cars 
above list prices increasing their profit margin the association 
said 
that brought a scramble among dealers to add foreign brands but 
imports now apparently are no more profitable than domestic cars 
nada said 
average pretax profits at dealerships in 1987 were 188 percent 
of sales down from 216 percent in 1986 and 22 percent in 1985 
the association said 
the average us dealer had 107 million in sales last year up 
from 106 million in 1986 
the number of new cars sold was 10277900 down 10 percent from 
11459300 in 1986 
nada is the major trade association for the nations 25000 new 
car dealerships

opec secretarygeneral subroto said wednesday 
he expects a slight cut in oil output when iraq returns to the 
cartels production ceiling after a ceasefire takes effect in its 
war with iran 
for oil prices to stabilize it would be desirable for iran 
and iraq to have a daily production of 23 million barrels a cut 
of between 6000 and 7000 barrels a day subroto said in a news 
conference on arrival here 
by adjusting production in addition to remedying the 
situation the prices of the fuel will be higher said subroto 
the ceasefire that is to take effect saturday in the 8yearold 
persian gulf war has raised speculation that the fractious cartel 
could make progress in its attempts to meet production limits aimed 
at boosting world oil prices 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has a 
production ceiling of 1506 million barrels per day in an attempt 
to support its benchmark price of 18 a barrel but iraqi 
production has not been counted under the ceiling 
actual world market prices currently are 2 to 3 a barrel lower 
than the benchmark 
subroto who plans to visit iran and iraq after leaving mexico 
also said crude oil prices next winter may be as high as 15 a 
barrel 
in the decade of the 90s the prediction is that oil prices 
will be strengthened he said 
since he was elected secretarygeneral of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries last june subroto has been seeking a 
consensus over the means to stabilize oil prices as part of the 
effort he has visited the united arab emirates ecuador and 
venezuela and plans to visit all opec members and independent 
producers 
mexico the worlds sixthlargest producer of crude is not an 
opec member but follows the cartels pricing and production 
policies when it believes they contribute to stability in the 
market 
subroto said he would meet here with president miguel de la 
madrid and energy secretary fernando hiriart 
mexico produces about 25 million barrels of crude a day and 
exported 135 million barrels a day in july about half the exports 
go to the united states 
separately in caracas former venezuela oil minister humberto 
calderon berti said wednesday that the opec price monitoring 
committee tentatively was scheduled to meet sept 20 in jakarta 
indonesia 
the date and place of the committees meeting will be confirmed 
within the next few days according to calderon berti who said he 
consulted with subroto privately tuesday in caracas 
members of the price committee are venezuela indonesia 
algeria nigeria and saudi arabia the committee monitors factors 
especially crude output which affect opecs to meet its benchmark 
price 
calderon berti also said subroto said he supported raising 
opecs production ceiling to between 175 million and 18 million 
barrels per day in a new production accord to be hammered out at 
the cartels regular conference in november 
the new ceiling would allow opec to incorporate iraqs output 
currently around 25 million barrels a day into a new accord 
without cutting the production of other member countries
