three dartmouth students have appealed the 
dismissal of their lawsuit against the college which they claim 
discriminated against them because of their race and conservative 
beliefs a lawyer said tuesday 
us district judge shane devine last month dismissed a lawsuit 
filed by the three white students who were suspended after a 
february 1988 classroom confrontation with william cole a black 
music professor 
christopher baldwin of hinsdale ill john sutter of st louis 
and john quilhot of fort wayne ind worked for the dartmouth 
review a conservative offcampus weekly newspaper that had 
described cole as part of dartmouths dynamic duo of mediocrity 
they accused cole of grabbing quilhot by the arm and breaking 
the flash on his camera during the encounter but a campus 
disciplinary board found them guilty of harassing cole and they 
were suspended in march 1988 
its in our best interest to go through with the appeal 
baldwin said tuesday 
the students lawyer francis murphy jr said the three 
disagreed with devines ruling that even if the students 
demonstrated that they were treated unfairly because of their 
conservative politics and affiliation with the review they would 
not have a case under the racial discrimination statutes they cited 
the appeal was filed monday in the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals in boston murphy said 
sutter and baldwin successfully sued the school in state court 
to have their suspensions lifted in december but sutter dropped 
out last month four months before he was to graduate 
state superior court judge bruce mohl ordered baldwin and sutter 
reinstated on the ground that one member of the panel that 
disciplined them had been biased against the review

a high school principal has pulled a story from 
the school newspaper about the senior class valedictorian a 
straighta honors student who is pregnant with her second child 
chester smith principal of jack yates high school vetoed an 
article by a student reporter about carrie mae dixon who is five 
months pregnant and carries a full load of classes including 
physics calculus and economics 
the story titled against all odds student becomes 
valedictorian despite motherhood details miss dixons first 
pregnancy how she was shuffled among relatives after her mother 
died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings and her 
dream of a middleclass home and a middleclass life 
miss dixon who spends two to five hours a night with her books 
has no one to babysit her 18monthold daughter terrisha 
keandrea she keeps the child occupied with paper and a pencil and 
she writes while i write 
miss dixon 17 has been accepted to the university of houston 
and has two scholarships she plans to major in chemical 
engineering 
a school reporter first tried to do a story about miss dixon 
last year after she was spotted on a cold rainy day standing at a 
bus stop holding an umbrella over her daughter while studying a 
math text a school official blocked the story 
according to newspaper editor shuronda robinson smith rejected 
the story thursday when she submitted the newspaper for approval 
smith told reporters tuesday that he thought the article was too 
personal to be printed in the newspaper and houston independent 
school district superintendent joan raymond agreed 
in his judgment the article was too highly personal 
sensitive to the young lady and he did not permit it to be 
published she said i have read the article myself and i will 
further tell you that i would have made the same decision 
miss robinson said the newspaper staff offered to edit the story 
to satisfy smith but the offer was rejected he also rejected a 
request to run a blank space or the word censored in place of 
the story 
although miss dixon has worried the school officials will bar 
her from giving her valedictory address on graduation night june 
10 ms raymond said she will be allowed to speak and participate 
in any graduation activity

put some racy glittery commercials with lots of 
naked bodies on movie screens in france and the audience goes wild 
but do the same thing in the united states with the glitz but 
without the nudity and the ads go over as big as sticky floors 
stale popcorn and overpriced candy 
richard dodderidge senior vice president for corporate 
marketing at amc entertainment in kansas city mo said when amc 
tried the ads in theaters audiences went beserk 
there was public displeasure indicated by throwing popcorn 
boxes at the screen and people wanting their money back he said 
they left home to avoid commercial television they paid money 
and expected relief 
ive been in theaters where people booed said barbara 
lippert advertising critic for ad week magazine on paper they 
sound great but they can only be successful if theyre really 
artfully done and surprising 
in france audiences get about 30 minutes of commercials which 
must by law be 90 percent entertainment in american theaters 
though audiences who are often asked to pay as much as 10 a 
ticket resent the intrusion 
the ads would have more staying power if they helped lower 
ticket prices said ed swanson senior vice president of sales and 
marketing for modern talking picture service in chicago which 
distributes corporatesponsored films he recalled a recent movie 
outing with his family in which he paid 22 for four tickets 
after a 50 dinner check if id have sat there and seen a 
commercial id have been peeved 
nobody likes commercials said terry laughren president of 
screenvision cinema network a new yorkbased company that 
distributes commercials but theres a tremendous fascination in 
this country for good advertising 
the clutter of commercials on television has been one force 
behind the advertisers quest for a more captive audience toyota 
motor corp general motors corp 7up dr pepper lee jeans 
pepsi co memorex and the us marines have reeled out dollars to 
give movie advertising a try 
it seems to be growing pretty steadily said larissa 
alexandra vice president of screenvision in los angeles with 
tv what you are trying to do is talk through clutter to get some 
attention theres no chance to get the emotional aspects of the 
product 
creators insist the ads are distinctly different from typical tv 
commercials and some of them can be edited for television 
dave danzer national advertising manager for toyota said the 
directors hired to do the ads often have experience with feature 
films and stunts such as car chases he refused to divulge how much 
toyota spends on theater ads 
one of screenvisions most recent commercials features toyota 
it is hard to find anybody who reacts negatively said 
laughren about the ad to the concept yes there is negative 
reaction but then they say oh god that was a great 
commercial 
in the toyota ad which danzer likens to the adventure formula 
of raiders of the lost ark a man dreams hes being chased 
through a jungle in his toyota fourwheeler by an imaginary threat 
theres no dialogue until he wakes up looks out his window and 
sees his toyota sitting outside then an announcer says toyotas 
new v64x4 get it before it gets you 
danzer didnt know if the ads helped sales but he said they 
were especially good at reaching males 18 to 34 years old who are 
typically light tv viewers 
in the theater 95 percent of the people see your ad danzer 
said they might be eating popcorn but they see the ad with 
television you have no idea whether they are going to look at it 
michael bernacchi a professor of marketing at the university of 
detroit has studied theater advertising and thinks companies 
increasingly will want to see their products featured on the big 
screen 
right now its an outstanding way to communicate with 
consumers he said viewers will tend to receive them with 
more interest and maybe chagrin they may reject them in their 
hearts but they are probably going to stay in the saddle and 
witness them 
the reason is a moviegoers state of mind bernacchi said the 
expectation is much different when people actually seek 
entertainment 
few people go to the movies with the idea of just sitting and 
casually attending you go there with a purpose he said 
bernacchi thinks the ads will thrive because in theaters there 
is much less competition for a viewers attention and because the 
cinema unlike vcrs dont offer the option of handheld controls 
however some theater chain executives are less optimistic they 
say reaction from audiences has been so overwhelmingly negative 
they risked losing business if they didnt pull the ads 
weve tried it from time to time in different parts of the 
country said russ duncan chicago regional manager for general 
cinema the company felt the good will between the patrons and 
the company was somewhat compromised and we valued the good will 
of the patrons more than running the ads 
duncan and dodderidge said they werent aware of any plans by 
their respective companies to try the ads again but thats not to 
say their theaters are without commercials both general cinema and 
amc feature ads on slides 
the slides are very low key said neil katcher detroit 
district manager for amc you dont have to watch them if you 
dont want to nobody complains about them

many japanese workers transferring to 
their companies us branches have a problem american schools 
dont prepare their children for the tough competition to get into 
a japanese university 
japans solution and a testament to the growing japanese 
presence in this country is tennessee meiji gakuin high school 
which will be the first fully accredited japanese high school in 
america when it opens may 10 
our goal is to give education to the children of overseas 
assigned business people though the first class of 25 includes 
only one student whose family lives in the united states said 
director hiroshi jo 
although we said it will be for americanbased people it will 
be two to four years before we have enough enrollment to operate 
that way jo said he said families in japan may have been more 
familiar with the parent school meiji gakuin university than 
workers already in the united states 
nothing is more important to japanese families than the 
education of their children said former gov lamar alexander 
president of the university of tennessee and scheduled keynote 
speaker for the opening college entrance is very competitive and 
determined almost exclusively by results 
if they fall behind while theyre in the us that is a very 
dramatic problem for a japanese family 
owned and operated by the tokyo university with the support of 
japans ministry of education the coed school will open with 
grades 10 11 and 12 on the japanese school year april through 
march with 250 days of class 
school was to start saturday but students and teachers ran into 
problems getting visas jo said i think maybe because this is 
the first japanese high school immigration officials are 
carefully handling reviewing this matter 
sending a student to tmg as its called will cost about 
19000 a year 
it may be more expensive than some can afford but many send 
kids to colleges that are quite expensive jo said i also 
think some companies will begin to subsidize overseas education 
that need is more and more confirmed by both the people of japan 
and the government 
the academic life will be pretty restrictive he said they 
will have to check out of the dorms if they want to leave and they 
will have a lot of study requirements that will take a lot of their 
time 
but the students expected to number around 200 within two 
years will be encouraged to take advantage of being in another 
country they will go to class six days a week as in japan but 
the sixth day will be for outside activities 
the students will certainly have a lot of contact with the 
community jo said the students can do regular high school 
studies plus have such a valuable experience as living in this 
country 
for sweetwater a town of 5310 between knoxville and 
chattanooga it could be sort of a stayathome cultural exchange 
program 
it will be a culture shock both ways for the japanese coming 
here and for the community their philosophies of education and 
living are different so i think it will be an educational 
experience for all of us said sweetwater chamber of commerce 
president charles chamberlain 
meiji gakuin paid 24 million for 144 rolling acres and 13 
buildings including two gymnasiums a library and three 
dormitories that can house a total of 220 students it spent 15 
million on renovation 
tmg recruited in japan and hired 12 teachers four of whom two 
single people and a married couple will live on campus the 
teachers will be paid what their counterparts in japan are paid 
there were many applications for every subject jo said 
alexander who as governor from 19791987 heavily recruited 
japanese businesses said the school could be a magnet for 
industry and i think it will be a wonderful thing for our own 
educational system because it will give us a basis for comparison 
i think its healthy to have it means we dont have to go half way 
around the world to discover what the competition is doing 
there are 71 japaneseowned businesses in tennessee employing 
12600 the largest is the nissan truck plant in smyrna others 
include acom which makes panasonic electric components in 
knoxville sharp matsushita and komatsu 
tmg will employ 12 people from sweetwater and the surrounding 
area eight of them fulltime including two cooks 
they are in america jo said so they should eat some 
american food spaghetti cheeseburgers

after years of preaching racism and 
hatred the rev richard butler has lost some of his fire and 
brimstone 
at 71 he walks slowly and breathes with difficulty still weak 
from a heart attack suffered two years ago while awaiting trial on 
charges of scheming to overthrow the us government 
many followers of his white supremacist aryan nations church 
have been jailed or scared off by fbi investigations and publicity 
from civil rights organizations 
but this aging aryan warrior hangs onto his dream of an 
allwhite homeland in the pacific northwest seeking inspiration 
from an unlikely source skinheads 
theyre the last hope the only hope of the white race he 
said in an interview with the associated press 
where others see menacing young thugs who shave their heads and 
tattoo their bodies with swastikas butler sees the next 
torchbearers of racism butler is sponsoring the first national 
neonazi skinhead conference here this weekend to mark the 100th 
birthday of adolf hitler on april 20 
the meeting worries law officers and rights activists who until 
recently were noting with satisfaction that membership in racist 
hate groups seemed to be declining nationwide 
now with skinheads you have a pool of violenceprone 
ideologically sympathetic people who are being courted to join the 
mainstream of the rightwing movement said marvin stern 
northwest regional director for the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith 
the jewish group notes that many skinheads band together without 
racist motivation those who can be classified as neonazis 
however number about 2000 in 21 states with the greatest 
concentrations in southern california and the northwest stern said 
in portland ore skinheads are awaiting trial in the death 
last november of an ethiopian man who was fatally beaten with a 
baseball bat another skinhead is accused of stabbing a black man 
in spokane wash swastikas painted on synagogues and assaults on 
jews homosexuals and other minorities have additionally been 
linked to skinheads in the region 
butler is not alone in courting skinheads hes competing with 
groups such as the ku klux klan and the white aryan resistance led 
by tom metzger in fallbrook calif 
until now skinhead groups have been mostly autonomous and 
localized stern said any network butler puts together bears 
watching 
the networkbuilding was visible last week as butler and his 
followers prepared for this weekends conference at his northern 
idaho compound 20 wooded acres tucked away on a gravel road near 
the resort town of hayden lake 
two men hammered away in one of several rustic guest cabins a 
barefoot young woman leaned over a long canvas banner stenciling 
in aryan nations now 
taking time for an interview in the compounds modest church 
butler resembled not at all the tough urban youths he is wooing 
dressed in a sweater vest wool slacks and loafers the 
grayhaired bifocaled butler played the part of a kindly country 
preacher 
butler shrouds his racist message in religion using scripture 
to support his claims of white supremacy he conceded that biblical 
quotations may turn off skinheads not known for steady church 
attendance 
many skinheads listen to the racist lyrics of skrewdriver an 
industrialgrade british rock band butler wishes they would listen 
to beethoven 
we want them to be able to think he said you cant think 
if youre listening to the hardrock jungle beat 
despite the generation gap butler feels he offers something 
these alienated youths can understand a call to power in the name 
of racial pride 
the white male through affirmative action has been made a 
noncitizen he said this is why you have skinheads theyre 
beginning to wake up to the fact that theyve been conquered and 
that the land their fathers bled and died for has been taken away 
his little church in the pines has a guard tower thats higher 
than the steeple inside sunlight filters through stained glass 
onto a huge nazi flag a poster showing a young man with an assault 
rifle exhorts join us aryan freedom fighters 
kids like that kind of stuff it gives the idea that theyre 
in battle butler said quickly adding that talk of battle was 
only talk 
butler moved to idaho in 1973 and over the years built up a 
following based on his dream of a territorial imperative for 
whites he considered the northwest an ideal homeland rural 
conservative and lacking many blacks jews and other minorities 
his dream was blocked not only by resistance from local 
authorities but also by the violence of his own followers 
some former members impatient with waiting for revolution 
formed a group known as the order the groups founder robert 
mathews died in a fiery shootout with fbi agents in 1984 on an 
island in washingtons puget sound ten order members have been 
convicted of racketeering and 12 more pleaded guilty to various 
crimes in a scheme that included murder armoredcar robberies and 
plots to overthrow the us government 
two years ago butler and 14 other white supremacists were 
charged with plotting to overthrow the government they were 
acquitted last april but butlers arrest and the costly trial 
crippled his alreadyweakened organization 
butler said weekly church attendance which once peaked at 60 
now hovers around 40 outside observers put the number even lower 
an aryan nations computer billboard once touted as a hightech 
communications network for white supremacists was discontinued 
after the computer was stolen butler said 
but just when his opponents figured he was washed up butler 
announced plans for this weekends skinhead conference at first 
officials expected up to 250 skinheads and butler promised a march 
down the streets of nearby coeur dalene 
in the face of fierce opposition from locals butler backed off 
he said he didnt want his supporters catching aids from 
counterdemonstrators and now he says hes expecting just 75 to 
100 skinheads 
hes planning a weekend of lectures karate workshops and 
campfire fellowship he said lawyers will offer the skinheads 
tips on how to build power legally 
i hope to keep them from going to prison or getting killed 
they can do a lot more for the cause on the streets butler said 
i want them to become a political force that can come when they 
have knowledge when you have knowledge you have power 
the idea of a white homeland in the northwest is little more 
than rhetoric bandied about by ideologues doomed by their own 
extremism and violence said norman gissel president of the 
kootenai county task force on human relations the group is among 
several planning civil rights activities this week to counter the 
skinhead gathering 
these people are their own worst enemies gissel said now 
theyre down to a church that has about 10 members and a handful of 
kids 
but butler warns against writing off the racist cause 
the old men like myself are going to die off very soon he 
said but this is the first time that ive seen a spirit of 
regeneration

this quiet resort town may have been 
slow to recognize the racist threat of richard butlers neonazi 
sect but civil rights leaders say their vigilance is now wideeyed 
and alert 
butler targeted the northwest for an allwhite aryan nations 
homeland partly because of the regions conservative politics and 
tradition of tolerance 
the aryan nations miscalculated said tony stewart 
president of the northwest coalition against malicious harassment 
they did not find acceptance in the northwest 
this week as butler prepares for a neonazi skinhead conference 
at his compound a few miles from coeur dalene civic leaders in 
northern idaho are planning a march a picnic and an interfaith 
church service to celebrate cultural diversity 
butlers activities did not always provoke such responses his 
aryan nations church established in 1973 was all but ignored for 
years 
you have a lot of kooks and nuts anywhere you go said 
norman gissel president of the kootenai county task force on human 
relations in north idaho especially the sentiment is that you 
leave your neighbor alone if he wants to be left alone 
that started to change in 1981 when swastikas appeared on a 
jewishowned restaurant in hayden lake the task force was formed 
but community participation remained low until 1985 when court 
trials revealed ties between butlers aryan nations and the order 
a violent group that masterminded murder bombings and armed bank 
robberies 
coeur dalenes liveandletlive demeanor changed forever the 
morning of sept 29 1986 when three bombs exploded in town 
planted by white supremacists as a diversion during a foiled bank 
robbery 
the next summer when butler held his annual aryan world 
congress for about 200 white supremacist leaders a civil rights 
rally in coeur dalene drew 1000 people 
the task force on human relations has served as a model for 
about a dozen watchdog groups now operating in the northwest 
gissel said the coalition stewart heads is another offshoot 
monitoring hate crimes throughout the region 
state lawmakers have also joined the fight against racism 
idaho now has the most comprehensive antihate crime 
legislative package in the united states said stewart 
idaho is one of 18 states and the only one in the northwest 
with laws against paramilitary training a malicious harassment 
law makes it a felony to assault someone on the basis of race 
religion or ethnic background and that law will be strengthened by 
another measure passed last month it calls for an annual report on 
hate crimes and requires law officers investigating any crime to 
note whether harassment was involved 
civil rights leaders are confident the white supremacists will 
never find their promised land in the northwest but they do 
not plan to relax their vigilance 
as long as they exist in any organized form there is going to 
be harassment to people of color jews and other minority groups 
gissel said were going to do whatever we can to hasten the day 
when those types of activities cease to occur

a littleknown early 16thcentury german sculptor 
niclaus weckmann the elder became a major figure in art history 
when a woodcarving of his sold at auction for 423000 christies 
said 
the price was a very high one for such a work said mark 
wrey a spokesman for the auction house after the sale tuesday of 
the weckmanns adoration of the magi 
the seller was described only as a continental nobleman 
the buyer was anonymous but charles avery the firms head of 
sculpture said the work may be going back to south germany 
which would be appropriate as that was weckmanns homeland 
the limewood carving more than five feet tall and four feet 
wide was once part of an altarpiece and depicts the wise men 
presenting their gifts to the infant jesus 
it had been in the private chapel of a noble family in styria 
austria for 100 years or so and probably no one else saw it 
avery said if we knew where it had been for the 300 years before 
that it would been even more costly as a complete antique 
provenance adds to value he said 
weckmann lived from about 1460 to 1520 his works were 
attributed to other artists until 1968 when he was identified as 
one of the greatest sculptors working in the town of ulm around 
1500 
avery said he was so impressed by the unsigned carving when it 
arrived for auction that he asked for a study of it from alfred 
schaedler chief curator of sculpture at the national bavarian 
museum in munich 
schaedler is the expert on weckmann and he attibuted it to him 
on grounds of style and type it is one of the largest and most 
splendid pieces of gothic german wood sculpture to be auctioned in 
recent times avery added

a satanism expert is teaching police at a 
fiveday seminar that has drawn about 80 participants to recognize 
signs of devil worship 
the state policesponsored seminar on cults and the occult was 
planned before the discovery earlier this month of a ritual mass 
slaying blamed on drug smugglers in matamoros mexico 
even before that discovery we had inquiries from law 
enforcement groups from throughout the state wanting to know if we 
had any seminars on the topic state police lt dan ducote said 
by telephone from baton rouge where the seminar is being held 
theres a lot of interest a lot of officers had read in the 
news media about areas with animal mutilations and such they 
wanted some knowledge on how to recognize the signs said ducote 
the fiveday seminar which began monday and involves law 
enforcement officers from around the state is taught by tom wedge 
author of the satan hunter he has been a guest on several 
national television talk shows 
i wanted to know the difference between fact and fiction 
whats rumor and whats fact in whats occurring in satanism 
said trooper bob buckley a homicide investigator 
i have felt that on two or three major crimes there was a 
possiblity the suspects were involved in satanism i want to be 
able to go to a scene and tell buckley said 
ducote said devil worship is not illegal but most of the 
activity is a front for dealing in drugs he said 
some ministers and businessmen recently announced plans to ask 
the legislature to outlaw satanism 
businessman fred huenefeld a bankruptcy trustee from monroe 
said the interest in satanic worship stems from drugs and 
louisianas poor economy 
im handling 600 bankruptcies and i can tell you the impact on 
the family unit he said the poor are looking for a way out 
and a few misguided ones are looking to these cults and drugs 
tend to get kids involved in these things

burt reynolds who couldnt make it 
to a weekend barbecue for vice president dan quayle isnt really a 
member of the republican party after all 
in fact the palm beach post reports he hasnt voted since 1980 
and is a registered democrat 
the issue is what does a person consider himself said 
reynolds agent david gershenson if hes technically registered 
as a democrat i know he considers himself a republican 
reynolds was invited to the quayle barbecue in north palm beach 
but sent his regrets because he was taping his bl stryker 
television series 
despite a post story saying reynolds was a democrat he told 
jupiter mayor mary hinton that he was a republican 
publicist kenny miller said reynolds registered in palm beach as 
a democrat in 1980 to vote for jimmy carter because he got to know 
the former governor while making movies in georgia

impressionist george kirby says he 
usually imitates the stars of yesteryear because the voices of 
todays celebrities lack character and cannot be easily 
distinguished 
kirby said methodacting has replaced the melodrama that actors 
once lent to their speech 
there are no more sydney greenstreets peter lorres jimmy 
cagneys or jimmy stewarts said kirby who is appearing in 
atlantic city through may 1 
if you took three of the oldtimers and put them behind a door 
and let them talk you can tell which is which kirby said but 
today you put three actors in that room and you cant tell them 
apart except for arnold schwarzenegger

has kept most of his baseball memorabilia but admits he sold the 
bat he used in 1985 to break ty cobbs record 
rose sold the bat along with a corvette he received from reds 
owner marge schott to his insurance agent steve wolter for 
175000 rose still owns the bat he used for his 4256th and final 
hit which he said he considers more significant than the one he 
used for no 4192 which broke cobbs record 
ive got the bat that broke the record its 4256 said 
rose the last hit i got is the record and it will be the record 
until somebody gets 4257 
rose put his three world series championship rings on display 
monday to counter what he says are erroneous reports that he gave 
his 1975 world series championship ring to a convicted 
massachusetts bookmaker 
a boston newspaper reported sunday that rose gave the ring to 
bookmaker joseph cambra of somerset mass as payment for a 
gambling debt rose said the 1975 ring that cambra has is a replica 
that rose had authorized for him 
the baseball commissioner announced last month he was

israeli army officers serving in the occupied 
lands complain of feeling like stone fodder thrown into a 
futile battle with palestinians and say settler and army brutality 
have corrupted israels morals 
i am reaching the end of my thoughts about zionism in this 
country my next war will be against jews thats what i feel 
said one officer uri dan 
his comments and those of 10 other reserve officers appear in 
commanders reflections a 34page booklet published by the 
kibbutz artzi movement that unites 85 of israels 160odd 
kibbutzim or communal farms 
the booklet released on tuesday quotes remarks made by the 
officers members of kibbutzim in a february conversation with 
maj gen amram mitzna head of the armys central command their 
ranks were not given 
the officers single out army regulations on opening fire lack 
of proper ammunition pressure of increased reserve duty and their 
feeling of futility in dealing with the palestinian revolt 
the 16month uprising known to arabs as the intefadeh in 
the occupied west bank and the gaza strip has claimed at least 439 
palestinian and 18 israeli lives 
once in four five months you are called to intefadeh and you 
see that nothing has changed maybe it only got worse i can even 
say that in a certain way you feel like stone fodder said 
omri frish of the kibbutz mesilot 
army rules on opening fire which forbid troops to shoot live 
ammunition unless a danger to life exists still leave the final 
last and only consideration to the lonely soldier in a side 
alley frish said 
frish said that as to the alternative plastic or rubber bullets 
these may be hard to find 
the means we have at our disposal are very poor a soldier 
asks his commander why we have no rubber bullets or helmets or 
this or that and its a problem he said 
other officers criticized even the use of plastic bullets 
avi ofer of kibbutz maanit in central israel said rules allowing 
such bullets to be fired for riot dispersal were illegal 
there are socalled plastic bullet ambushes one soldier 
provokes the residents one of the duped residents hurls a stone 
and another soldier is ready with a plastic bullet said dani 
gal of the kfar menahem kibbutz 
elisha shapira of ein hashofet said he complained to army 
authorities who took action against two lieutenantcolonels posted 
in nablus the largest west bank town 
they engaged in manhunting they were just driving around 
looking for a possibility to harm an arab shapira said without 
elaborating 
some officers said they reached a breaking point during night 
searchand arrest raids 
i dont think i can enter at 2 oclock at night into a house 
where 10 small children are crying and take people away their 
father or somebody this is not my job this is not what i was 
trained for in the army said yehiam yogev of kfar menahem i 
just cannot do this 
an army spokesman asked for comment said the military had no 
opposition to the expression of officers opinion as long as its 
done by proper channels he said no official statement on the 
booklet was expected 
the spokesman who commented anonymously in keeping with 
military rules said that in specific cases when the reservists 
see something that is not acceptable in society or in the 
framework of army rules they can complain through the many 
existing channels and many have done so 
however one senior officer indicated the army establishment was 
worried by the appearance of groups that used their military 
ranks for political statements 
the booklet was especially painful for the military although 
israels kibbutz movement is traditionally leftist many of its 
members volunteer for service in elite army units seeing it as a 
supreme value 
the booklet also contains strong attacks on some of the 70000 
jewish settlers living in the occupied territories among 17 
million palestinians 
we have encountered several events in which the settlers 
took the law in their hands made a real pogrom beat the arabs 
said one participant identified only as yair 
others spoke of the existence of armed settler militias 
i know these exist i personally spoke to a man who told me he 
was organizing 40 boys with ammunition belts and radios so they 
respond properly said dan of nir oz kibbutz 
the commanders said they opposed refusal to serve in the 
occupied territories but expressed fear about the implications of 
the continuing conflict there on the army and on israeli society as 
a whole 
they make us kill them the jewish people will not be able to 
withstand this said elie bengal of baram i am telling you 
they will not be able to withstand this

contra rebels attacked a rural house 
in southeastern nicaragua killing three people and injuring two 
the defense ministry announced 
the attack announced by the government tuesday occurred monday 
night in the rio kama area in the zelaya sur province 400 miles 
southeast of managua 
a military source said the attack was launched by mercenary 
forces loyal to the terrorist policies of former somoza colonel 
enrique bermudez 
bermudez head of the miamibased nicaraguan resistance said 
during talks with nicaraguan opposition political leaders last week 
in guatemala that he had ordered his forces to observe a ceasefire 
gustavo tablada a socialist leader in nicaragua who met with 
bermudez last week said bermudez told him some rebels might be 
working in concert with common criminals 
the nicaraguan resistance which heads up the contra rebels has 
received us backing to fight the leftist sandinista government 
since 1981 but the contras now receive only nonlethal aid and are 
mostly in honduran camps 
the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 popular revolution by 
defeating former president anastasio somoza

gov george deukmejian is urging 
californians to listen to their mothers 
the governor joined jackie stallone and georgia holt the 
mothers of actors sylvester stallone and cher in kicking off a 
campaign on tuesday to promote ride sharing and vanpool programs 
to help unclog freeways 
but he was a little late because of traffic congestion 
the campaign will feature the theme of rather universal motherly 
sayings one advertisement depicts a woman who says were not 
the first one to try to talk some sense into you about sharing 
other celebrity moms taking part include laurie williams mother 
of comic robin williams and christine johnson mother of los 
angeles lakers basketball star earvin magic johnson 
your mother as this campaign says always told you to share 
and it was good advice then and i think its very good advice now 
and its going to help us to meet our transportation challenges 
deukmejian said 
deukmejian said california is the sixthlargest economic power 
in the world but each day workers lose about 400000 hours of 
productivity while stuck in traffic 
last year 224 million vehicles were in the state and there 
will be 238 million by the centurys end there is an average of 
12 persons per vehicle in peak hours but congestion could be 
eliminated if that improved to just 14 per vehicle deukmejian 
said

state sen bob swain got little attention 
when he introduced a bill to designate an official state dog but 
now the plott has thickened 
the senate rules committee quickly endorsed the bill to make the 
plott hound north carolinas official dog lucy a 10yearold 
plott owned by former rep hugh lee wagged her tail in silent 
approval 
all other breeds pale in comparison said swain a democrat 
who said the hound is the only dog indigenous to north carolina 
its a favorite of mountain bear hunters he said 
its the only dog i think would be proper for a state dog 
lee told reporters after the meeting tuesday 
you talk about a plott youre talking about the kit carsons 
the davy crocketts and the daniel boones of the dog world lee 
said they were frontier people they went out hunting and lived 
by their instincts and they were from western north carolina 
the plott hound is a descendant of a german breed used for boar 
hunting swain said an immigrant named jonathan plott brought it 
to north carolina in the mid1700s 
the plott hound is an officially registered breed swain said 
the typical plott has brownblack coloring and weighs about 75 
pounds 
i think without any question it has all the qualities of a 
good north carolinian swain said hes loyal he is fearless 
he has perseverance 
the rules committee approved swains bill without dissent it 
now goes to the senate floor

the missouri senate passed a bill 
making the 250millionyearold remains of a plantlike animal the 
official state fossil 
but some senators objected to spending time on the matter with a 
may 12 adjournment and several major bills pending 
is it any coincidence that you are trying to make the state 
fossil a spineless animal sen jay nixon asked tuesday whats 
next perhaps the bat will be the state bird because its blind 
the state bird is the bluebird 
nixon said the crinoid fossil bill reflects the quality of 
legislation so far this session he said he was concerned the 
headlines would read senate spends afternoon making spineless 
wimp the state fossil 
but the bills sponsor sen robert johnson called the measure 
an important civics lesson for an eighthgrade science class in his 
district that first proposed it 
now theyve seen an idea from their classroom go through both 
chambers for a possible signing by the governor he said 
crinoids commonly known as sea lillies flourished 250 million 
years ago when most of missouri was covered by shallow seas they 
are found throughout the state mainly in limestone deposits

state health officials ordered a laboratory 
to offer to pay for repeat pap smear tests for more than 3 million 
women diagnosed as cancerfree after learning the labs error rate 
was greater than 20 percent

performed 33 million pap smears over the past five years was 
ordered closed last week after a state audit showed an error rate

health services director it was totally unacceptable that they 
had such a high error rate 
the lab which also worked under the name central diagnostic 
laboratory processed nearly 700000 smears last year more than 
half of all of the tests in southern california 
pap smears from california arizona chicago and philadelphia 
were processed at the companys tarzana area lab 
in its order delivered to the lab monday the health department 
said all women in california and other states who had received 
reports indicating no abnormalities from either central pathology 
or central diagnostic within the last five years needed to be 
offered the opportunity for a repeat pap smear 
the lab which closed monday was given 30 days to contact the 
women and recommend they see their doctors about retaking the tests 
elsewhere 
central pathology said in a statement it was a 27yearold 
facility with a perfect inspection record to this point and that 
it had recently instituted what it called the most stringent 
qualitycontrol standards in the nation 
the pap smear which costs about 25 is a routine test used to 
detect cervical cancer and other medical abnormalities 
the industry average for misdiagnosing pap smears is about 5 
percent but some pathologists said top labs make even fewer 
mistakes 
kizer said state officials plan to inspect 10 other pap smear 
laboratories within the next six weeks he did not identify them 
we need to get an idea of the other labs error rates and set 
some kind of standard kizer said

barry manilow master of the big ballad brought 
his talent for showmanship to broadway on tuesday night for a 
monthlong engagement 
mixing showbiz sophistication with pure corn barry manilow 
at the gershwin is strong entertainment 
the production is sleek with costumed backup singers and 
projections on the back wall manilow inserts a rock beat in a few 
numbers tackles the motown sound a couple of times and does one 
superfast lambert hendricks and ross jazz number cloudburst 
that he admired early 
though hes no slouch with those styles the lengthy romantic 
ballad given a big buildup to an emotional finish is his 
strongest suit he started the second half of the evening with 
three new songs of that type pointing up once again that his style 
is grounded in a performance tradition older than rock 
in an autobiographical portion of the show the singerpianist 
picked up the accordion which he said he learned and hated at 
age 11 two years before he learned piano in front of a set 
representing the brooklyn apartment where he grew up he 
demonstrated that even bruce springsteens born in the usa 
sounds oldfashioned on an accordion 
he also talked about being a pianist for singers auditioning for 
broadway but didnt mention his hitch as musical director on bette 
midlers 1973 tour after which he got a recording deal and had his 
first hit mandy 
manilow ended the evening with a medley of many hits including 
one voice the old songs i dont want to walk without 
you copacabana this ones for you tryin to get the 
feeling again its a miracle somewhere in the night 
and i write the songs

senate sponsors of a compromise bill to 
control airborne toxic chemicals say they expect stiff opposition 
despite growing information on poisons in the nations air 
this bill will be critized by some for going too far and by 
others who dont think it has gone far enough senate majority 
leader george j mitchell dmaine said tuesday after he and 11 
other senators introduced the legislation 
the bipartisan and diverse group said their language remains 
subject to hard bargaining but emphasized they have a consensus on 
how to control the estimated 27 billion pounds of poisonous 
chemicals released into the atmosphere each year 
the environmental protection agency in its first such 
compilation said april 12 that the toxic air emissions are among 
more than 22 billion pounds of toxic wastes sent into the air 
water and land each year 
the legislation to control toxic emissions into the atmosphere 
represents a major compromise for lawmakers pushing for new clean 
air legislation this year senate clean air sponsors said they will 
introduce the other components of their legislation in coming 
months proposals to bring metropolitan areas in compliance with 
air quality standards and language to control acid rain 
the air toxics compromise would require companies emitting 10 
tons or more of any airborne toxic chemical to install the best 
available control technology 
the environmental protection agency would set emissions 
standards for industries releasing the chemicals but to encourage 
polluters to make immediate and largescale reductions they would 
be granted exemptions if they used technology that achieves a 90 
percent cutback in emissions by the end of 1992 
if technology did not achieve the required reduction a company 
would have to meet tough emissions limits based on a chemicals 
risk of causing cancer or other illnesses 
the legislation would replace a system that has regulated only 
seven toxic chemicals out of nearly 300 emitted into the air 
the epa is currently required to assess the risk of each 
chemical and then develop chemicalbychemical emissions standards 
designed to protect public health with an ample margin of safety 
the assessment for each chemical takes several years and when 
the epa has made proposals the agency has been sued on grounds it 
went too far or not far enough 
the bill also would direct epa to establish a national urban air 
toxics program to reduce the release of toxic chemicals from motor 
vehicles wood stoves dry cleaners and gas stations 
in a provision to prevent catastrophic accidents the bill would 
require epa to list 50 extremely hazardous substances facilities 
handling those materials would have to complete reviews to identify 
potential accidents a chemical safety board would be established 
to investigate accidents and make recommendations for preventive 
measures 
sen max baucus dmont the manager of senate clean air 
legislation this year told reporters there is a public health 
crisis that will worsen if we dont act 
ed barks spokesman for the national clean air coalition said 
the environmental groups in the organization believe the bill needs 
improvements 
he said that under the bill the epa could take between five and 
13 years to set standards for emission reduction for polluters who 
fail to qualify for the exemption that timetable is too long he 
said 
announcing the compromise were sens david durenberger rminn 
frank lautenberg dnj john breaux dla baucus john chafee 
rri quentin burdick dnd daniel patrick moynihan dny

small communities like gallup nm and 
greenwood miss should flourish in coming years as people flee 
both big cities and suburbs while businesses seek out new markets 
says population researcher g scott thomas 
although attention and headlines focus on the major metropolitan 
areas micropolitan america may become increasingly popular 
thomas says in the may edition of american demographics a magazine 
focusing on population issues 
an increasing number of people are growing tired of central 
cities where crime rates are getting out of sight thomas said 
tuesday in a telephone interview in the suburbs as well housing 
prices are getting extremely high schools are crowded people are 
showing an interest in getting away to areas where they have more 
control of their lives 
smaller cities are as influential in their regions as 
metropolitan areas are on a larger scale reported thomas who 
operates the research firm niagara concepts in tonawanda ny a 
suburb of buffalo 
thomas defines a micropolitan area as a county with a population 
of at least 40000 people with a core city including at least 
15000 but not a part of a metropolitan area metropolitan areas 
which are officially designated by the federal office of management 
and budget are economically related counties generally focusing on 
a central city of 50000 people or more 
he reports that between 1980 and 1986 some 83 micropolitan areas 
grew faster than the nation as a whole that amounted to 38 percent 
of micropolitan areas he said in the same period 45 percent of 
the larger metropolitan areas were growing faster than the national 
rate 
many of these communities are already showing their popularity 
leading the small city growth was rio rancho nm which 
increased by 486 percent over the six years helping was that 
citys nearness to fastgrowing albuquerque thomas reports 
like metropolitan areas the fastest growing micropolitans 
tended to benefit from sun belt locations indeed of eight that 
increased by more than 25 percent over the six years seven were in 
the sun belt 
quick growers between 1980 and 1986 besides rio rancho were 
bullhead citylake havasu ariz 371 percent vero beach fla 
352 hilton head island sc 310 huntsville texas 294 
myrtle beach sc 288 san luis obispoatacasdero calif 265 
and fairbanks alaska 253 
torrington conn had the highest per capita income of the more 
than 200 micropolitan areas studied by thomas 
torrington reported incomes of 13381 per resident he said 
fairbanks was second at 13079 followed by bartlesville okla 
13035 key west fla at 12319 and vero beach fla 12155 
many micropolitan areas are the homes of major universities 
thomas observed resulting in several communities with high median 
educational levels 
corvallis ore and pullman wash led that list with 142 
years of schooling completed for the typical resident aged 25 and 
over bozeman mont was next at 135 followed by ames iowa at 
134 others with medians of 13 years of schooling or more were

a positive outlook on life appears to promote 
natural killer cell activity for fighting disease in certain cancer 
patients as well as healthy individuals according to studies 
presented today 
it doesnt seem to be so much whether one is exposed to stress 
or not but how people are reacting to similar types of stress 
said dr ronald herberman director of the pittsburgh cancer 
institute and part of the research team 
if theyre not as well adjusted we have indication that it 
has health consequences 
herberman and dr sandra levy an associate director at the 
institute say they have found that colon and skin cancer patients 
who combine standard medical care with psychotherapy have higher 
natural killer cell activity than those who do not undergo 
counseling 
in a separate study being presented at a medical symposium at 
johns hopkins university they said healthy people with positive 
outlooks have higher natural killer cell activity than physically 
fit complainers 
the upbeat subjects suffered fewer colds and other viral 
infections their ailments also did not last as long as illnesses 
suffered by those expressing more hostility and anger about their 
life said herberman who followed the subjects for six months 
these findings based on an analysis of 120 men and women 
between ages 18 and 45 confirm the results of a smaller pilot 
study conducted by herberman and levy three years ago at the 
national cancer institute 
we were looking at how serious the stresses were to them 
their hassles things that happen to all of us fights with the 
boss that kind of thing levy said in an interview tuesday night 
james zabora director of patient and family services for the 
johns hopkins oncology center in baltimore and the symposiums 
codirector called the findings interesting but said they must 
be kept in perspective 
theyre moving into a very difficult area zabora said 
the immune system is an incredibly complicated system and maybe 
to this point in time we have examined 1 percent or 05 percent of 
what the immune system is all about 
researchers currently can only speculate why happiness seems to 
promote activity of natural killer cells which comprise 5 percent 
to 10 percent of all white blood cells according to herberman one 
theory is that a positive perception of stress produces certain 
hormones that affect the bodys immune system 
it isnt clear whats going on levy said all were 
asking is whether behavior or central nervous systemmediated 
factors play some role for some tumors if they do thats 
important because behavior can be changed 
to test that notion herberman levy and dr judith rodin 
professor of psychiatry at yale university followed 30 people 
between ages 18 and 45 with colon cancer or malignant melanomas 
all had had their tumors surgically removed and the disease had 
not reached advanced stages 
eighteen received individual counseling once a week for eight 
weeks the remaining 12 received only standard medical care both 
groups were identical in background 
by the end of psychotherapy the 18 with counseling showed 
significantly higher natural killer cell activity than those 
without levy said the counseled group reported less depression 
and anger and seemed better able to cope with their lives she said 
the 12 who did not undergo psychotherapy tended to blame 
themselves for their problems levy said 
we dont believe that your psychological status is going 
to make the difference as far as whether the disease is present or 
not herberman said but on top of all the physical issues the 
nature of the disease and the bodys immune response to it the 
psychological factors can have a significant effect 
additional studies are needed before any recommendations can be 
made regarding psychotherapy 
time will tell as to how much that is going to make a 
difference as far as survival or staying tumorfree herberman 
said

president bush says farmers who signed up in 
this years crop programs will soon get speededup payments 
totaling about 850 million to help them with spring planting 
but bush also warned tuesday that perilous budgetdeficit 
times will mean cuts in other farm programs he did not say what 
other cuts may be involved 
bush and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter participated in a 
telephone interview program with a group of farm broadcasters the 
president said he authorized the acceleration of pricesupport 
payments to provide some extra money to farmers early in the crop 
year 
the 850 million in payments will be made after may 15 to 
producers of wheat feed grains rice and cotton who signed up in 
the 1989 programs and requested advance payments 
while bush said the speededup payments show that we are with 
the american farmer in these tough times a principal goal of the 
change is to reduce the red ink in his fiscal 1990 budget 
the payments now shift the 850 million out of fiscal 1990 
which begins on oct 1 and into the current fiscal year 
about 313 billion in advance payments were already paid to 
farmers during the program signup period which ended on april 14 
the 850 million will be on top of those advances 
bush putting on headphones in a small usda broadcast booth 
answered questions from agricultural broadcasters for about 15 
minutes the program was sent out over the agencys agricultural 
radio network 
the president also announced creation of a working group on 
rural development to be headed by yeutter he said the group would 
evaluate existing federal ruraldevelopment programs and make 
recommendations 
events such as last years drought reinforce the need to 
develop and diversify the rural economy in the years ahead bush 
said 
the price announcement made by bush makes an additional 10 
percent available to farmers in socalled advance deficiency 
payments 
tuesdays action raised the size of advance payments wheat and 
feedgrain farmers can collect from 40 percent to 50 percent and 
the share rice and cotton farmers can collect in advance from 30 
percent to 40 percent 
the advances are against anticipated government subsidies to 
help farmers recover the difference between market prices and 
federally set target prices 
one interviewer asked bush how he reconciled heavy cuts in farm 
programs under the budget compromise recently negotiated by the 
white house with his campaign vow not to balance the budget on 
farmers back 
we are in perilous budgetdeficit times weve got to get the 
deficit down and the best thing we can do to help the american 
farmer is to get these interest rates down and the best way to do 
that is to make the tough decision on the spending side of our 
budget he said 
yes ag is taking a hit but so is a wide array of programs 
across the board 
asked if the speedup in payments would be the sum total of 
federal help for producers who are being hurt by the drought 
gripping kansas and much of the winter wheat area bush said 
this should not be viewed as the definitive answer we hope it is 
something that will help the farm family 
yeutter added clearly we dont have an open spigot that just 
spits out federal dollars in any situation today but well be as 
sympathetic and as accommodative as we can be within rather severe 
budgetary restraints 
after bush left to return to the white house yeutter continued 
taking questions from the broadcasters asked about reports that 
the governments program to subsidize exports of wheat and other 
farm commodities is being scuttled yeutter said no such plan is in 
the works however yeutter reiterated that the usdas export 
enhancement program or eep will come under review 
but no eep allocations now in effect will be curtailed he said 
the program provides subsidies to private exporters for the sale of 
designated commodities to specific countries at reduced prices the 
object is to make us products competitive with those from other 
foreign suppliers notably the european economic community 
all that is at issue at the moment is any future allocations 
that might be made under eep he said those will be considered 
on a casebycase basis primarily because of our stocks of 
grain condition and the weather conditions that now prevail 
some consumer advocates have urged cancellation of eep because 
droughtreduced production last year helped trigger a heavy drain 
on us grain stockpiles moreover with drought persisting in some 
areas particularly in parts of the great plains wheat belt there 
is much uncertainty about 1989 production

president bush is being pressured by two 
senators to investigate whether the reagan administration failed to 
turn over documents detailing secret arrangements to help the 
contras including bushs involvement 
the white house said tuesday that the reagan administration had 
made the documents available in 1987 but did not specifically 
say whether they had been turned over to congress 
the documents which emerged at oliver norths criminal trial 
spell out president reagans approval of a deal in which honduras 
got more than 110 million in extra us aid as payment for 
supporting the contras in 1985 
bush informed the honduran president of the extra aid but it 
isnt clear whether the thenus vice president knew the 
assistance was a payoff for contra backing bush has refused to 
comment on what he knew 
we address this letter to you personally to underscore the 
gravity of the matter if there has been in fact a failure to 
produce these documents to congress said the letter released 
tuesday it was written the previous day by senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine and sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
inouye was chairman of the senate irancontra committee and 
mitchell was a member 
we respectfully request that you direct an immediate and 
thorough investigation and report to determine whether any 
documents were not provided to the senate select committee 
stated the letter 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater responded tuesday that 
all documents identified in the letter from mitchell and inouye 
were available to the independent counsel and the irancontra 
investigating committee 
he added that all such documents related to the irancontra 
case were certainly accessible to the independent counsel the 
federal bureau of investigation and the irancontra committee 
the congressional irancontra committees uncovered thirdcountry 
support for the contras but it didnt turn up the quid pro quo 
arrangements which helped secure the foreign contra backing 
the honduran deal was part of a secret approach the reagan 
administration made to at least 11 countries in which it sought 
help for the rebel force due to a congressional cutoff in us 
military aid 
another document sought by the senators describes reagans 
apparent approval of airdropping intelligence and rifles to the 
contras to destroy armsbearing ships headed for nicaragua the 
document dated oct 30 1985 also concerns reconnaissance 
overflights of nicaragua 
another document sought by mitchell and inouye spells out 
reagans phone call to honduran president robert suazo cordova 
which resulted in the release of a contrabound arms shipment the 
honduran military had seized 
mitchell and inouye also asked for other documents related to 
these matters 
documents on honduras which emerged at norths trial describe 
how the reagan administration conditioned extra aid to honduras on 
contra support and the lengths to which the administration went to 
keep such arrangements secret from congress 
an interagency crisis preplanning group on feb 7 1985 
approved an agreement under which reagan would send a letter to the 
honduran president urging contra support and offering several 
inducements 
the enticements included speededup deliveries of military 
supplies release of economic assistance and cia support 
reagans letter urging contra support was to be followed by the 
visit of an emissary who would orally outline the conditions 
attached to the extra aid the cppg didnt want to include the 
detail of the quid pro quo arrangement in writing 
north and nsc staffer raymond burghardt subsequently became 
concerned over how the plan was to be carried out 
there was to be no special emissary conditioning the extra aid 
on contra support instead us ambassador to honduras john 
negroponte was to deliver the text of reagans letter and to take a 
softer approach saying that reagan had directed extra assistance 
to date all administration officials have been able to state 
to the congress that we have not approached any other government to 
support the resistance north and nsc colleague raymond burghardt 
said in a feb 20 1985 memo the memo to thennational security 
adviser robert mcfarlane is one of the documents the two senators 
want included in a review by bush 
if the state departments approach is carried out we will no 
longer be able to make such a claim and any of the appropriate 
committees may place a call for all relevant cables on this matter 
at any time said the memo 
amb negroponte who will be called upon to testify during his 
confirmation hearings for assistant secretary will undoubtedly be 
queried on whether or not such overtures were made to the 
hondurans 
the northburghardt memo said that notwithstanding our own 
interpretations of the boland amendment cutting off military aid 
to the contras it is very clear from the colloquy during the 
debate that the legislative intent was to deny any direct or 
indirect support for the militaryparamilitary operations in 
nicaragua the amendment had gone into effect in october 1984 
in short the decision to proceed without an emissary places 
both amb negroponte and our hopes with the hill at increased 
jeopardy we still believe that our original concept of an emissary 
is the proper way in which to proceed 
north and burghardt apparently prevailed 
north wrote a followup memo on feb 25 1985 saying that 
reagans signed letter urging contra support will be delivered 
to suazo by burghardt

president bush is exercising one prerogative 
of being president changing his mind 
but when a president changes his mind the ramifications can be 
farreaching and sometimes costly 
for instance bush planned to spend last weekend at his vacation 
home in kennebunkport maine 
he was to make a fourday event of it with education speeches 
in union nj on the way up and in rochester ny on the way 
back 
bush delivered the speech in new jersey on thursday but 
scrubbed the long vacation weekend in maine so he could be on hand 
for fridays unveiling of a budget compromise with congressional 
leaders 
then he added a new destination for monday scrapping upstate 
new york for hamtramck mich where he announced a package of 
economic incentives for poland 
white house aides wanted a locale with a large polishamerican 
population and rochester didnt quite fit the bill 
canceling the kennebunkport trip meant dozens of reserved hotel 
rooms obtained by white house aides security agents and 
reporters had to be ditched at the last minute and a fleet of 
five dozen rental cars returned 
it also meant elaborate advance and security preparations in 
rochester where bush was to visit an eastman kodak plant and speak 
at a school went for naught 
the white house goes where the president goes said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
last month a planned trip to california and other western 
states was scheduled then postponed and finally canceled now the 
west coast trip is on again but in modified form for later this 
month 
in the meantime another kennebunkport trip scheduled for may 
56 was scrapped and a presidential visit to lockerbie scotland 
site of last decembers pan am flight 103 disaster was penciled 
onto the presidents itinerary for his fournation european trip in 
may then suddenly taken off 
bush flipflops of course include more than trips 
on semiautomatic assault rifles bush initially said he opposed 
any attempts to control or restrict them but he later moved to 
suspend imports of these weapons 
then he tightened that ban angering congressional guncontrol 
opponents in the process amid hints that the administration would 
come out with permanent new restrictions on both domestic and 
foreignproduced assault weapons 
he admitted to a pulse change on the subject of gun control 
bush also did an aboutface on federal involvement in cleanup 
operations in the alaska oil spill first praising exxon for the 
job it was doing and voicing opposition to a federal takeover then 
moving a week later to put one in effect 
bush also executed a turnabout on us funds for the nicaraguan 
contras first he echoed the reagan administration position 
favoring continuing military support for the antigovernment 
rebels but he wound up going along with a bipartisan agreement 
sharply scaling back us support for the contras 
he also has seemed to come down on both sides of the issue of 
tuition tax credits 
when a student at a white house session on march 29 asked him if 
the parents of a child in private school should get a federal tax 
credit for the tuition they pay he said no they shouldnt 
but he told a group of conservatives and evangelical christians 
this week that he supports the idea of tuition tax credits 
although budget constraints prevent him from proposing one at this 
time 
bushs flips and shifts prompted washington post political 
cartoonist herblock to depict him as a gaunt figure atop a 
weathervane flopping one way then the other a finger jutting up 
to catch the shifting winds of public opinion 
but bush after all is the president and theres no 
prohibition against changing his mind either on trips or on issues 
and kinder and gentler only goes so far if youre too polite 
in life you get stomped on bush told a youngster who was 
hesitant in raising her hand at a questionandanswer session at 
the white house

rain lightning and 125 years have taken such 
a toll on the giant bronze statue of freedom atop the capitol dome 
that it will be removed probably by helicopter and restored 
the capitol architect says 
the operation will leave a large hole in the top of the lantern 
which supports the statue on top of the dome the hole will be 
fitted with a temporary cover to keep out rain during the sixmonth 
long 250000 restoration project according to architect george 
white 
but white said the iron dome itself is in excellent condition 
and needs no major repairs 
the 14985pound figure which rises 19 feet six inches from the 
top of the soaring dome is a symbolic castbronze image of a female 
warrior draped in flowing robes and clasping a sheathed sword 
it has been a capitol symbol since its head the last of five 
sections was hoisted aloft and bolted in place on dec 2 1863 
it hasnt been touched since that time white said when 
we had the dome repainted last summer we confirmed that the statue 
is in very serious condition 
white said cracks had developed in some of the interior 
fastenings of the statue and that an exterior chunk of its robes 
fell out last year the statue consists of five separate pieces of 
cast bronze bolted together and attached to a castiron base 
the whole thing is in really bad condition white said 
bronze does deteriorate 
in preparation for removing the statue a protective cage will be 
built around it white said and added well probably take it 
down by helicopter 
the project could begin soon although no firm date has been set 
the statue is the finishing flourish of the soaring dome which 
was completed during the middle of the civil war although the iron 
of which it is crafted could have been used for the war effort 
president lincoln ordered work on the dome to continue as a symbol 
that the national union of states was also continuing 
many of the 15 million tourists who see the statue from a 
distance mistakenly believe it depicts an american indian because 
of its elaborate headdress 
actually the statues head is covered by a helmet circled with 
stars and topped with a crest composed of an eagles head and 
decorative feathers 
white disclosed the renovation project at a ceremony launching a 
multimilliondollar fundraising effort seeking private donations 
for restoration work at the capitol and to create a fund to buy art 
works associated with its past 
in another project the parking lot which has covered the 
capitols east plaza since the beginning of the automotive age will 
be closed and the space filled with decorative stone paving 
two marble fountains carved during lady bird johnsons 
beautification campaign in the late 1960s but never installed 
because of a lack of funds will be placed in the center of the 
plaza 
the newly created us capitol preservation commission will 
coordinate the fund raising and restoration under the direction of 
former postmaster general preston tisch 
tisch said the aim of the new organization will be similar to 
that of the foundations created to refurbish blair house the 
presidents guest house and to acquire historic objects for the 
white house and the state departments reception rooms 
the commission also will receive half the profits from the sale 
of special coins to be issued later in the year to commemorate the 
bicentennial of congress 
tisch said the first fundraising effort will be a bicentennial 
banquet on june 20 which is intended to raise at least 15 
million

nearly 150000 pontiac fieros may be in danger 
of catching fire from oil that escapes if owners fail to keep the 
crankcase filled according to complaints that prompted an 
intensification of a federal safety probe 
the national highway traffic safety administration said tuesday 
it had upgraded a preliminary evaluation of the general motors 
corp cars to an engineering analysis investigations are typically 
raised to the higher level when engineers see reason to believe 
there might be a safety problem with vehicles 
gm in 1987 agreed to recall 126000 1984model fieros after 
similar reports of fires nhtsa said the 1985 and 1986 fieros had 
the same oilsystem design as did the 1984 models said david 
hudgens a gm spokesman in detroit 
according to the complaints driving the fieros with low oil 
levels can cause a connecting rod to break 
oil escaping from the resulting hole would catch on fire when 
it contacted the exhaust manifold or hot exhaust components the 
agencys engineers said in summarizing the alleged defect 
the agency said it has received 148 complaints regarding the 
fieros including reports of six injuries 
the engineering analysis affects 147571 1985 and 1986 fieros 
nhtsa said 
hudgens said failure of drivers to maintain their cars properly 
may be part of the problem 
if you ran out of oil and then that coupled with some 
aggressive driving perhaps and maybe not changing the oil very 
often you end up with a broken rod and thats where the 
connecting rod came in hudgens said it is still the owners 
responsibility to check the oil 
the fiero went out of production in 1988 in what was strictly 
a marketing decision hudgens said 
nhtsa also opened a new preliminary evaluation into unconfirmed 
reports of powersteering loss in gms 1987 abody cars with 
4cylinder engines 
the abody cars are the buick century chevrolet celebrity 
oldsmobile ciera and pontiac 6000 
nhtsa said it had received nine complaints including one 
accident with an injury of fluid leaking from the powersteering 
pressure hose which resulted in a sudden loss of steering 
assistance 
that investigation involves 527459 cars nhtsa said 
nine other preliminary evaluations were opened by the agency 
into 
erratic cruise control in about 10000 1987 chrysler jeep 
cherokees 
windshield wiper failure in 300000 1988model gm corsica and 
beretta vehicles 
erratic cruise control in 1988 gm suburban and jimmy vehicles 
with 57 liter or 74 liter engines 
excessive windshield fogging in 115000 1986 hyundai excel gl 
vehicles 
gasoline splashing from the filler pipe due to alleged faulty 
venting in 180000 1988 ford town cars 
rearbrake jamming due to a faulty retaining ring in 900000 
19861987 gm buick lesabre oldsmobile 88 and pontiac bonneville 
jamming of the steering mechanism in 800000 1985 and 1986 gm 
gbody cars the models using the now discontinued gbody were the 
chevrolet monte carlo and el camino pontiac grand prix and 
bonneville oldsmobile cutlass supreme and brougham and buick 
regal 
rearaxle seal failure in 576000 1985 through 1988 gm astro 
and safari vehicles 
nhtsa also raised two preliminary evaluations to the engineering 
analysis level they involved jamming of the frontseat lap belt in 
394500 19871988 toyota camry vehicles and windshieldwiper 
failure in 465500 1986 through 1988 ford aerostar minivans 
the agency closed three investigations finding there was no 
defect trend the investigations were into complaints of 
taillight wiring fires in 19871988 chrysler omnis 
airbrake emergency valve defects in the navistar 1988 sseries

democrats leading the effort to raise the 
minimum wage say they are willing to make concessions but only if 
president bush does the same 
nothing is concrete rep austin murphy dpa said 
tuesday just about every provision in this is negotiable 
but murphy and other lawmakers on a conference committee to 
resolve differences between house and senatepassed minimum wage 
bills said they will not offer any concessions unless bush drops 
his repeated veto threats and first offers a compromise of his own 
the prospects for such a development appear slim knowing that 
the democrats intensified their efforts to portray bush as turning 
his back on the working poor a pitch that itself is part of an 
effort by the democrats to make political hay of any bush veto of 
minimum wage legislation 
we will send you this bill and we will send you another bill 
and we will make you wish that you didnt have the power to veto 
said murphy were asking for some leadership not the threat of 
a veto 
sen edward m kennedy dmass questioned the motives of 
bushs refusal to negotiate by pointing to a number of recent 
agreements between congress and the white house on issues ranging 
from contra aid to the savings and loan crisis 
why not on the minimum wage kennedy said to millions of 
lowincome americans the answer must seem obvious the 
administration doesnt care enough about them to listen to their 
position kinder and gentler does not mean you 
senate majority leader george mitchell compared bushs stance on 
the minimum wage with his proposal to expand capital gains tax 
breaks that would be enjoyed predominantly by wealthy americans 
the president ought to have as much concern for the poor as he 
does for the rich mitchell said 
the conferees said they hope to have a final product in about 
two weeks and indicated it would be stripped of a number of senate 
amendments unrelated to the minimum wage including one that would 
raise the outside earnings limit for social security recipients 
bush has repeatedly said the only minimum wage bill he will 
accept is his own an offer to raise the minimum from its current 
level of 335 an hour to 425 by january 1992 provided employers 
can pay all new workers less than the minimum for up to six months 
both the house and senate measures would raise the minimum wage 
to 455 by october 1991 and allow a subminimum to be paid to 
some newly hired workers for just two months 
murphy said that if no compromise is reached he is considering 
a number of other approaches to raising the minimum wage including 
a simple oneyear increase of the base wage instead of the 
incremental boosts contained in the current measures

philippine vice president salvador laurel who 
met recently with ferdinand marcos at his sickbed says the exiled 
former president should be allowed to leave hawaii and return home 
to die 
i think he should be allowed to return not only to die in 
his own country but to face whatever charges will be filed against 
him let the philippine people decide the case laurel said 
tuesday in an interview 
the vice president who has broken politically with president 
corazon aquino was meeting this week with several members of 
congress during a private visit to the united states he was 
scheduled to deliver an address today before the center for 
democracy a private research group 
laurels position is in direct opposition to mrs aquinos 
the mere idea that the former dictator might return to the 
homeland he ruled for 20 years is an extremely sensitive national 
question mrs aquino has repeatedly rejected marcos requests 
citing security concerns 
but the vice president dismissed the idea that marcos return to 
his homeland dead or alive would spark unrest 
i dont buy that i think they are overrating marcos laurel 
said i dont think his return would cause that kind of 
destabilization 
the vice presidents trip to marcos bedside in february was the 
subject of some speculation in the philippines that he was looking 
for support from marcos supporters as he began to work with an 
opposition party in advance of the 1992 elections 
as a former opponent of the marcos regime laurel said he was 
surprised to receive the invitation from imelda marcos to go to 
hawaii he said he returned to the philippines with a message for 
mrs aquino from the dying former president but mrs aquino 
refused to see him 
laurel said his interest was national reconciliation he 
said marcos message which he would not reveal did not involve a 
deal but was something that might straighten out things 
marcos has been hospitalized in honolulu since jan 16 
suffering from bronchial asthma and pneumonia in december he was 
hospitalized twice with congestive heart failure 
marcos was ousted in 1986 in a popular uprising that later swept 
mrs aquino and her running mate laurel into office 
in september 1987 laurel resigned as foreign secretary citing 
widespread differences with mrs aquino on the 20year battle 
against a communist insurgency and other issues such as the 
countrys economic development 
the marcoses are under indictment in new york on racketeering 
charges the couple would need permission from the us attorney 
general and the us district court in new york to leave the united 
states 
the indictment accuses the ousted philippines dictator and his 
wife of stealing more than 100 million from the philippine 
treasury to buy real estate and expensive art objects in new york 
overall the philippines says the couple took 35 billion in 
cash and property 
mrs marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in the 
us indictment marcos has said he is too ill to appear in new 
york for legal proceedings 
laurel argued that as a man who is charged with looting the 
philippines marcos should face charges there first 
the philippines has a prior claim over the united states 
it may be that the us has a valid case against him but 
offenses committed against the filipino people should be decided by 
the philippine courts laurel said

in a costcutting move the soviets are bringing 
their cosmonauts home from their space station mir next week and 
leaving it unmanned until august the stations deputy flight 
director says 
viktor d blagov said no technical problems had cropped up in 
the 3yearold orbiting complex that is the showcase of the soviet 
space program 
his comments tuesday came a day after the magazine aviation week 
and space technology reported in the united states that mir had 
developed a serious electrical power problem 
mirs solar batteries blagov said were experiencing some power 
loss but that it was within expected levels and was not causing any 
problem 
blagov said plans to keep soviets aboard the station 
continuously were abandoned for several reasons 
by this action we are of course economizing some sum which 
can be used for other purposes he said by telephone from the 
mission control center in kaliningrad north of moscow 
he did not identify the other purposes but the public has 
called for the untold millions of rubles spent on space to be 
diverted toward ending chronic shortages of consumer goods and food 
blagov said soviet scientists were swamped analyzing information 
gathered from mir which was launched feb 20 1986 they now must 
pause to review what we have accomplished and decide whats 
next 
tentative plans call for a module the same size as mir to be 
attached to the station at years end and until then there is no 
need for a crew blagov said a launching of a replacement crew 
originally scheduled for today has been canceled 
cosmonauts alexander volkov sergei krikalev and valery polyakov 
are to mothball the mir and return to earth on april 27 a new crew 
will be sent up in midaugust to prepare for the attaching the new 
module blagov said 
the attachment contains a space bicycle for cosmonauts a solar 
battery to supplement that of the mir an east german optical 
experiment and an airlock through which cosmonauts can pass to take 
spacewalks 
one module a space laboratory was attached to mir in april 
1987 and three others are planned including one to be put up at 
the end of this year or early next year in which crystals will be 
grown for semiconductors electronic parts used in computers and 
other devices blagov said 
one reason for putting mir on automatic mode is to give a rest 
to its support staff at mission control and tracking stations that 
have been working continuously for three years blagov said 
people are tired they havent had vacations we owe them 
this he said 
officials have said a ground controller sent an erroneous 
command to an unmanned mars probe phobos i in september leaving 
it useless a sister ship phobos ii was lost for still 
undetermined reasons last month 
blagov said mir uses different controllers than those who worked 
on phobos but indicated all are susceptible to fatigue 
tiredness can lead to an increase in mistakes and a break 
gives a positive effect to a persons work blagov said 
during the threemonth break he said scientists will continue 
to gather data from automatic mir instruments studying a supernova 
photographing the ocean shelf and monitoring meteorites 
engineers are boosting the mir to a higher orbit to keep its 
orbit from decaying blagov said 
in 1974 the vacant american skylab 4 space station fell into 
the earths atmosphere and disintegrated upon reentry

environmentalists are gearing up for an 
international earth day 1990 that they hope will dwarf the 
original of 20 years ago an event that helped make us laws more 
sensitive to environmental concerns 
the purpose of earth day in 1970 was to organize a nationwide 
grassroots demonstration of public concern for the environment 
former sen gaylord nelson who founded the event said tuesday 
though much has been achieved in many areas in the past 20 years 
we continue to lose ground in the fight to improve our 
environment 
denis hayes coordinator of the first earth day and sen john 
kerry dmass and rep bill green rny who were local earth day 
activists 20 years ago joined nelson at a news conference to 
announce plans for the april 22 1990 event 
nelson who now is counselor to the wilderness society called 
on president bush to lead other heads of state into a battle to 
save the earth 
hayes said the observance is meant to start a decade of 
environmental concern showing that countries throughout the world 
have a shared set of values and commitment to save the planet 
he said that organizers have talked to members of the white 
house staff but have not yet approached bush directly 
nelson said no president campaigns against environmental 
policies but none since theodore roosevelt has understood what 
needs to be done leaders of other nations have been similarly 
shortsighted he said 
in the leading industrial nations prime minister thatcher and 
president mitterand have joined president bush in paying lip 
service to global environmental problems nelson said none has 
yet said anything important about their plans for resolving these 
problems or made any serious proposals for addressing them 
green said the united states has adopted laws to begin cleanup 
but isnt keeping up with the problems 
of 1200 major hazardous waste sites just 34 have been 
cleaned up he said and while congress in 1980 allocated 16 
billion to help clean up such sites estimates of the federal share 
now range up to 300 billion

an official ceremony honored the more than 
4300 polish officers killed in the world war ii katyn massacre and 
a new inscription didnt blame either the nazis or the soviets for 
the atrocity 
instead the tablet that was unveiled tuesday at warsaws 
powazki cemetery said only to polish officers killed in katyn 
the previous inscription blamed hitlerite fascists 
polish generals speaking at the ceremony indicated the issue of 
determining guilt for the massacre a highly emotional issue in 
polishsoviet relations has not yet been resolved to polands 
satisfaction 
after the ceremony ended some people among the several thousand 
spectators placed a sign on the granite memorial reading soviet 
murder 
up until this year polands communist governments officially 
accepted soviet claims that the polish officers shot at katyn near 
the soviet city of smolensk and buried in mass graves were killed 
by the nazis after germany invaded russia in 1941 
western historians have concluded that the massacre was 
committed by soviet secret police on josef stalins order in 1940 
the officers the cream of polish society called up from the 
reserves were among about 15000 interned by the soviets when they 
occupied eastern poland in 1939 the fate of the other 11000 is 
not known 
polish members of a joint polishsoviet commission investigating 
the massacre say they have tentatively concluded that the soviets 
were to blame but the soviets have not acknowledged that account 
speakers at the ceremony did not speak of soviet culpability but 
made it clear the issue remains open 
this event indicates a victory of new thinking in poland 
said gen roman paszkowski who led the official delegation 
although you know your husbands and sons are not alive please 
remember they will stay forever in our hearts and minds 
gen franciszek skibinski said it is not possible to change 
the course of history but it is necessary to reveal the whole 
truth i hope the polishsoviet commission will soon complete its 
work and the whole truth will be made public 
during the ceremony an urn of soil from the graves of the 
massacred officers was embedded in the monument 
an official delegation that included relatives of the victims 
had gone to katyn and brought back two urns on tuesday one urn 
was brought to the cemetery and the other placed at the tomb of the 
unknown soldier 
soldiers lined the cemetery walkways and an honor guard of boy 
scouts stood at the flowercovered memorial 
a woman whose husband and brotherinlaw were killed at katyn 
said she expected the whole truth will come out now

the nations secondlargest waste hauler is 
asking the supreme court to reverse a 6 million jury verdict 
against it as an example of bloated irrational and excessive 
awards in liability lawsuits 
in a case that businesses say could have an enormous impact on 
their insurance costs and the overall competitiveness of american 
industry browningferris industries inc argued tuesday against 
what it called huge punitive damage awards 
bfi attorney andrew l frey told the high court that enormous 
punitive damage awards violate the constitutions eighth amendment 
prohibition against excessive fines as well as due process rights 
and common law 
the case centers on a lawsuit brought by kelco disposal inc of 
burlington vt againt houstonbased bfi accusing the texas 
company of predatory pricing to drive kelco out of business 
a vermont jury awarded kelco 51146 in compensatory damages in 
contrast to the much larger punitive total 
kelco lawyer h bartow farr iii argued the eighth amendments 
prohibition against excessive fines does not apply to punitive 
damages awarded in a private state court tort action and 
applying it would be intrusive secondguessing of jury verdicts 
farr said state laws provide for punitivedamage awards to be 
reviewed by the courts and such awards are routinely reduced 
the courts below upheld this award under traditional common 
law standards farr said damages are simply not fines 
dozens of friendofthecourt briefs were filed as 
manufacturers publishers insurers broadcasters pharmacists the 
red cross defense attorneys and us chamber of commerce officials 
all urged the justices to place some limits on punitive damages 
they say unfettered jury decisions allowing huge penalty awards 
are driving up insurance rates and discouraging the marketing of 
products from medical equipment to football helmets 
trial attorneys and consumer groups who argue punitive damages 
are the best protection against bad business practices have sided 
with kelco which survived bfis price cutting and in 1985 forced 
the larger company out of town 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice sandra day 
oconnor questioned whether ruling for bfi would force the court to 
review all future punitivedamage awards that someone considered 
excessive 
frey said that applying the excessivefines provision in such 
civil cases would sharply curb a growing trend toward excessive 
awards that has prompted tort reform by state legislatures 
justice antonin scalia insisted frey was seeking a national 
standard that all 50 states would have to follow rather than 
allowing each state to set its own punitivedamage limits 
the court is expected to announce its decision by july 
the case is browningferris industries of vermont inc vs kelco 
disposal inc 88556

a 1990 budget plan reflecting the deal reached 
between the white house and congress is working its way through the 
senate budget committee but a separate 47 billion spending bill 
for this year is ruffling republican feathers 
the senate budget committee began debating the fiscal 1990 
budget resolution on tuesday and hoped to finish its work today 
on tuesday it voted 194 to reject an amendment by sen j 
bennett johnston dla to institute deep acrosstheboard 
spending cuts in place of the compromise reached last week 
johnston complaining that the bipartisan pact does not cut 
the budget at all said his plan would sent a message to start 
all over again to do a real job of budgeting 
joining johnston was sen j james exon dneb who said if 
anyone thinks rosemarys baby was ugly i suggest taking a close 
look at this newly hatched baby 
administration officials and congressional leaders ended a month 
of negotiations last friday by announcing a deal for 12 trillion 
budget that claims a deficit of 994 billion 
the budget committee is charged with producing a congressional 
resolution that will guide later spending and tax bills for fiscal 
1990 which begins oct 1 chairman jim sasser dtenn said he 
would oppose any plan that did not follow the white house pact 
but trouble was brewing across capitol hill on a socalled dire 
emergency spending bill for this year 
the house appropriations committee approved a 47 billion 
supplemental spending bill for fiscal 1989 a measure that if 
approved could put congress on a collision course with president 
bush 
on a unanimous voice vote the house appropriations panel sent 
the wideranging spending bill to the house floor 
but first in a partyline 2818 vote the committees majority 
democrats rejected a republican effort that would have shaved about 
15 billion in new spending from the measure 
the worst thing we could do here is report a bill perceived to 
be fiscally irresponsible and a budget buster said rep silvio 
conte rmass ranking republican on the appropriations panel 
the bush administration renewed its threat to veto the socalled 
dire emergency bill stating in a letter that the president 
favored the less expensive gop alternative 
in my view fiscal responsibility requires that we go no 
further administration budget director richard darman wrote to 
conte 
last month bush had asked congress to approve a 22 billion 
version of the measure the committee more than doubled its size 
as passed by the committee the bill provides 12 billion for 
veterans programs 892 million for the guaranteed student loan 
program for college students 822 million for drug efforts 600 
million to fight last summers forest fires 423 million for 
foster care and adoption programs and 100 million to pay for the 
costs of immigration increases from the soviet union southeast 
asia and africa 
the measure also contains 127 million for workers whose jobs 
are lost due to foreign competition 71 million for the federal 
aviation administration to hire more air traffic controllers 
inspectors and security officers and 35 million to prosecute 
fraud cases involving the financially reeling savings and loan 
industry 
amendments tuesday added 153 million for programs for the 
homeless 88 million to help subsidize public housing projects 
and 200000 to provide aid to poland for upcoming elections 
one provision would prohibit the interior department from 
spending money to make the chicago home of mobster al capone a 
historic site 
with the 1989 deficit already projected at more than 163 
billion the spending measure would push the governments shortfall 
13 billion deeper the white houses office of management and

president bush signed into law a bipartisan 
plan to give the contras nonmilitary aid even as state department 
officials looked into human rights allegations that could block the 
498 million package 
the administration was trying to determine the veracity of a 
report tuesday in the washington post that the nicaraguan rebels 
failed to expel a commander who was convicted of covering up a 
murder the story said the rebels ignored a warning by a top state 
department official that they were required to take such action in 
order to remain eligible for the new us aid 
the new aid the product of a march 24 bipartisan agreement 
between the administration and congress calls for cutoff of the 
money if there are human rights abuses by the contras 
the state department said the contras own military tribunal on 
march 23 expelled six contra members for human rights violations 
including the rebels head of intelligence known as commandante 
mack 
but the post citing rebel sources reported that mack was still 
working at contra headquarters despite his conviction and expulsion 
his attendance at any official resistance function would be 
forbidden under the expulsion order said a state department 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the official said that commandante mack and a regional commander 
known as commandante nolan both had appealed their convictions to 
the contra directorate 
deputy assistant secretary of state chris arcos confirmed 
tuesday that he had made clear to the rebels during a meeting 
within the last three weeks that they were expected to remove the 
violaters from their ranks 
legally we would have the basis to halt the aid if they did 
not arcos said he said the admininistration was trying to find 
out if the newspaper report were true 
he said the contra military tribunal last month had convicted a 
commander with the nom de guerre commandante mack but that the 
leader was seen in the contra camps subsequent to the time he 
should have been expelled 
arcos said that he was reassured then by the contra 
leadership that they did intend to expel anyone convicted of human 
rights abuses and now he was trying to find out if that had 
occurred with commandante mack 
bush signed the legislation on tuesday that will provide 498 
million in nonmilitary aid to sustain the rebels until nicaragua 
holds elections early next year the legislation was hammered out 
after two months of negotiation between administration officials 
and congressional leaders 
bush restated his backing for a diplomatic solution in nicaragua 
after years of a promilitary policy advanced by president reagan 
bush also repeated his call for the soviet union to help bring 
peace to the region by ending its military aid to nicaraguas 
leftist government 
the soviet union must match its rhetorical support for the 
peace process with concrete action to halt military aid to end 
subversion in that region and to promote genuine democracy in 
nicaragua bush said monday 
in brief remarks in a rose garden signing ceremony bush was 
flanked by democratic and republican leaders of the house and 
senate 
he said that prospects for peace depend on full and honest 
sandinista compliance with their repeated pledges of democracy and 
freedom 
its clear that close international scrutiny and sustained 
pressure will be critical to induce sandinista compliance he 
said 
the package calls for nonlethal aid to the rebels until the 
nicaraguan elections scheduled for next february 
the money administered through the state departments agency 
for international development also can be used to repatriate the 
contras 
the package also includes 42 million to be administered by 
the roman catholic church in nicaragua in medical assistance for 
civilian victims of the civil war 
the contras whose numbers are estimated at 11000 are encamped 
along the honduran border

opens today at the smithsonian institutions national museum of 
american history 
touring the exhibit of 200 artifacts and more than 100 
photographs tracing the history of us television provost paused 
for a nostalgic look at the costume he wore as timmy in the 
original lassie series 
provost had made a gift to the smithsonian of the redcheckered 
sports shirt blue jeans and blacktopped tennis shoes he wore on 
the show from 1957 until 1964 the actor was 7 years old when he 
began filming the series and quit the show when he was 14 
it really was a thrill to be asked to donate them to the 
smithsonian he said

a coalition of television producers unions 
and station owners says it will fight any attempt by abc cbs and 
nbc to reenter and dominate the lucrative syndicated tv market the 
networks were forced to leave in 1983 
the motion picture association of america on tuesday announced 
that a 207member coalition would stand in the way of the networks 
if they attempt to gut the socalled financial interest and 
syndication rule 
mpaa president jack valenti said the coalition was putting the 
networks on notice that we will not lag or hesitate to defend the 
rule and hold it in place 
a 1983 consent decree between the networks and the justice 
department forced the networks out of the syndication business 
that agreement expires in 1990 and the networks and producers have 
been negotiating to try to reach a new accord without further 
government intervention 
but the talks have reached an impasse the coalition to preserve 
the financial interest and syndication rules said 
independent producers say they owe their very existences to the 
1983 decree under which the networks were allowed to keep the 
programs they broadcast for four years and then return them to 
producers for sale to independent tv stations and network 
affiliates 
hit programs such as the cosby show and miami vice can 
make many millions of dollars in this syndication market 
unlike before the networks were barred from holding any 
financial interest in programs they license from outside producers 
but the networks take all advertising revenues from a programs 
network run 
the program producers on the other hand are paid a licensing 
fee by the networks typically 1 million to 15 million for an 
hourlong program that usually doesnt meet the total costs of the 
production 
but the producers can profit enormously in syndication with a 
hit show 
the rule is working the coalition said the number of 
independent tv stations has grown so has the number and quality of 
producers creating programming for network and syndicated 
exhibition meanwhile the three major networks remain 
profitable and dominant 
an nbc spokesman in new york joe rutledge said the rules 
which first were adopted by the federal communications commission 
in 1970 have had exactly the opposite effect from what was 
intended 
he said the fcc in 1983 recommended the rules be repealed 
because the rules had concentrated power in the hands of a small 
number of studios rather than adding to diversity 
jay kriegel senior vice president at cbs in new york said he 
hoped the addition of independent producers to the studionetwork 
negotiations will be good for the talks 
he said the hollywood studios who are in the present coalition 
were trying to consolidate their gains against the networks in 
numerous areas half the mpaa members are in direct competition 
with the networks kriegel said every leader in that community 
is now going into our business very aggressively 
the coalition includes the mpaa the alliance of motion picture 
and television producers the association of independent television 
stations the communications workers of america the directors 
guild of america general mills the international alliance of 
theatrical stage employees the screen actors guild and the 
consumer federation of america

president bush was presented a wide 
range of options for modernizing americas nuclear arsenal and 
pursuing star wars research but made no immediate decisions 
according to defense secretary dick cheney 
the pentagon chief who arrived here this morning for his first 
nato meeting since assuming office told reporters he didnt expect 
to learn of bushs decisions on those two critical issues until the 
end of the week 
cheney said some of his own decisions about where to cut the 
pentagons fiscal 1990 budget would depend on what the president 
decided 
bush is grappling with whether he can afford the type of 
financial commitment to star wars made by former president ronald 
reagan and with whether the united states should build a small 
mobile nuclear missile or place the giant mx missile on rail car 
launchers 
congressional and administration leaders agree the united states 
needs a mobile missile to better deter a soviet attack but not on 
which missile is best 
cheney appearing relaxed on his air force jet as he embarked on 
what he called his maiden voyage to nato refused tuesday to 
discuss his own recommendations to bush 
but the washington post reported today that cheney told bush he 
favors building a railroadbased version of the mx nuclear missile 
and scrapping the planned midgetman missile 
both weapons are designed as successors to the minuteman which 
has formed the heart of the nations landbased atomic missile 
force for two decades the pentagon has built 50 mx weapons for 
deployment in silos in nebraska and wyoming 
if cheney favors the railbased mx over the midgetman he would 
be taking the position long favored by the air force the midgetman 
has chiefly been supported by democrats who control congress 
but the defense secretary acknowledged there were still sharp 
divisions within the administration on how best to proceed and that 
bush had received a wide range of opinions during a closeddoor 
national security council meeting at the white house tuesday 
obviously there are strongly held views within the 
administration on these questions cheney said and there are 
different views within the administration on these questions 
while bush is still debating nuclee pentagons original 1990 
budget proposal by 10 billion 
bush and congressional democrats agreed last week on that cut 
which will force the pentagon to settle for a budget that fails to 
match the inflation rate the new total for military spending is 
3055 billion 
while cheney declined to discuss any of his specific budget 
decisions an aide who demanded anonymity said the defense chief 
planned to kill the marine corps v22 osprey aircraft program and 
force the navy to accept a cut in its aircraft carrier fleet 
the v22 is a hightech hybrid aircraft that can take off 
like a helicopter and fly like an airplane thanks to engines that 
swivel at the ends of its wings 
at a cost of more than 20 million per plane however cheney 
has a hard time accepting this as a costeffective way to carry 20 
marines into combat the aide said 
as for the nato meeting cheney said it was important that the 
alliance proceed with modernizing its lance shortrange nuclear 
missiles now that all intermediaterange missiles had been 
abolished by treaty with the soviet union 
but the defense secretary added he expected no final decisions 
at this weeks meeting on the timetable for replacing the lance 
west germany has expressed reservations about the issue 
dividing the alliance by suggesting further armscontrol talks with 
the soviet union might obviate the need for modernizing the lance 
the issue is particularly sensitive in west germany since most 
shortrange nuclear missiles are deployed there and would be used 
there in the event of war

rep joseph moakley dmass has proposed 
requiring that food products include easily understood details of 
fat and cholesterol content to help consumers reduce their chances 
of heart disease 
you could starve to death in the supermarket just reading the 
labels complained the 61yearold lawmaker 
under the measure the food and drug administration would 
require food manufacturers to list the different types of fat 
saturated polyunsaturated and monounsaturated and their amounts 
federal regulations now require food producers to list only the 
total fat content 
the ninthterm boston democrat said the current labeling 
provision is particularly disturbing since some fats increase 
blood cholesterol and other types of fat actually lower ones 
cholesterol 
the bill also would require food manufacturers to specify 
amounts of dietary cholesterol which also has been linked to heart 
disease there currently is no cholesterol labeling requirement

the tax court has turned thumbs down on a 
minnesota undertaker who took a business tax deduction for 11000 
of expenses of wedding receptions for two daughters 
william l mcreavy of minneapolis and his wife kathleen 
claimed the receptions as an advertisingentertainment expense 
contending that 82 percent of the people invited were clients or 
referral sources for his washburnmcreavy funeral chapels inc 
the personal element of the expenses for the mcreavys 
daughters weddings was so prominent that we believe that even a 
person not versed in the tax law would know that the corporation 
could not deduct them the court held on tuesday 
the court was so unimpressed by the argument that it allowed the 
internal revenue service to add a negligence penalty to the 
mcreavys bill

a group of house republicans are hoping to 
repeal parts of the new catastrophic health expansion of medicare 
mainly the income tax surcharge imposed on the welltodo elderly 
to help finance the program 
the proposal unveiled at a news conference tuesday would keep 
most major benefits of the program but revamp a prescription drug 
benefit and make its more generous provisions apply only to 
lowincome medicare beneficiaries not poor enough to qualify for 
medicaid 
the law passed by overwhelming margins in both the house and 
senate last year despite vocal opposition from opponents of the 
surcharge and was signed into law by thenpresident reagan with 
great fanfare 
the surcharge has provoked a barrage of letters to lawmakers 
even though it does not apply to 60 percent of all 32 million 
medicare beneficiaries who do not have enough income to pay federal 
taxes 
of the 40 percent subject to the surcharge only those couples 
with annual incomes of 100000 or so would be subject to the 
maximum surcharge of 800 a person 
rep michael bilirakis dfla a lead sponsor of the 
legislation acknowledged that many of his own constituents who 
have complained mistakenly believe they will be subject to an 
income tax surcharge

finished at yet another high 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues finished at a 
record 3336383 gaining 4217 points or 013 percent the index 
had gained 1333 points to a 3332166point close the previous day

economy the dollar closed at 13141 yen in new york overnight 
the us labor department reported tuesday the nations consumer 
price index in march rose 05 percent up from februarys 04 
percent while the commerce department on the same day said us 
housing starts in march fell 54 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 1397 million 
but the us currency gradually moved upward from its opening as 
speculative investors began buying dollars due to expectations of 
higher interest rates in the united states a trader at bank of 
tokyo said on condition of anonymity 
there is no new reason or economic factor to encourage the 
dollarbuying in tokyo but as long as there is an interest rate 
gap between the united states and japan demand for the dollar 
remains stronger he said 
on the stock exchange the nikkei rose following a 4161point 
overnight gain in the dow jones industrial average in new york the

a general strike against the military 
government turned violent as police battled demonstrators in 
santiago and other cities and about 50 bomb attacks blacked out 
much of the capital 
police said they killed two extremists and arrested more 
than 130 demonstrators on tuesday before calm was restored at 
midnight large areas of the capital and other cities had been left 
without power for several hours 
demonstrators fought police in downtown santiago during daylight 
tuesday and then at night in the slums that ring the city 
the strike called by the nations largest union to protest the 
incarceration of two labor leaders failed to generate support from 
workers but there were clashes between helmeted riot police and 
demonstrators in santiago and other cities 
police said six officers and a security agent were injured in 
clashes but they did not report injuries among protesters 
hospitals reported receiving numerous injuries 
the interior ministry said 138 protesters were arrested 
nationwide and that police resorted to using tear gas and water 
cannon to scatter the mostly young demonstrators 
at night demonstrators blocked traffic at intersections in 
santiagos slums erecting fire barricades local radio stations 
said unidentified gunmen in speeding cars were seen shooting at 
demonstrators manning the barricades 
in the most serious incident police said two extremists 
were killed in a clash with security forces when they were caught 
planting a bomb near an electrical tower in northern santiago 
the strike was called by the opposition united workers central 
chiles largest labor federation with 300000 members the union 
said the strike was to press for the release of its president 
manuel bustos and its vice president arturo martinez 
both leaders have been banished in small provincial towns since 
september after a court sentenced them to 541 days internal exile 
for calling another general strike in 1987 
tuesdays strike however seemed to have little effect as most 
factories and businesses operated near normalcy although school 
attendance was notably lower than normal 
the government pronounced the strike a total failure 
labor minister guillermo arthur said there has been no strike 
in chile today he said around 95 percent of the nations 45 
million workers were on the job in spite of a cutback in the public 
transportation system 
several of the bomb blasts destroyed or damaged power towers 
blacking out large areas of santiago and several other cities for 
several hours until power could be restored

scientists umberto colombo and francesco scaramuzzi 
say they achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using a 
different technique than the recent cold fusion experiments which 
prompted their tests 
colombo head of the national agency for alternative energy at 
frascati just outside rome and scaramuzzi who performed the 
experiments at the agency both emphasized that it was too early to 
say if their process would prove practical for generating energy 
their experiments produced large emissions of neutrons but too 
little energy to register the two men reported 
a neutron is an uncharged elementary particle of an atom 
emissions of neutrons are evidence of fusion 
fusion produces energy when the cores of two hydrogen atoms 
fuse it is the process that powers the sun fission is 
atomsplitting the method employed by conventional nuclear power 
plants 
the italians began their experiments after stanley pons a 
chemistry professor at the university of utah and his british 
colleague martin fleischmann of the university of southampton 
announced to the world on march 23 that they achieved nuclear 
fusion at room temperature using common laboratory equipment 
researchers have long sought a way to harness nuclear fusion 
standard experiments have used extremely high temperatures 
pons and fleischmann said their experiment ran for more than 100 
hours and produced four times as much energy as it used 
their experiments used electrolysis in which an electrical 
current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes 
where the atoms were apparently forced to fuse because of proximity 
researcher steven jones of brigham young university in utah says 
he found evidence of only very low energy output in a similar 
experiment 
scaramuzzi told reporters on tuesday after jones experiment 
i asked myself how important is electrolysis there must be more 
than one road to fusion 
the italian experiments did not use electrical current to 
trigger the reaction nor did they use heavy water which 
contains a heavy version of hydrogen called deuterium 
colombo reported the experiment is totally different from 
former ones we have paved the way for a new road to fusion 
research what we dont know yet is if the energy generated is 
sufficient to justify practical application 
scaramuzzi 60 said if this experiment were not of such 
great importance to the public we would never have announced the 
discovery at this point we are still in a very preliminary phase 
he said that on two occasions they measured high emissions of 
neutrons after placing a sample of the element titanium and 
deuterium gas in a special metal tube and subjecting it to various 
pressures and temperatures 
the neutrons appeared in one case after applying high pressure 
and low temperature and in another at low pressure and room 
temperature 
scaramuzzi said the energy output of his experiment at this 
scale was too low to be registered 
pons meanwhile said monday that further experiments yielded even 
more energy than the earlier ponsfleischmann efforts and ran more 
efficiently he said a controlled fusion reaction was sustained for 
more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy water and a 
palladium electrode and that recent tests produced roughly eight 
times the energy consumed 
pons said researchers measured the production of 20 to 30 watts 
of electricity from the experiment or about 67 watts per cubic 
centimeter of electrode compared to 26 watts per cubic centimeter 
in the earlier experiments 
he reported that more than 60 university and private 
laboratories partly verified the claims he made last month with 
fleischmann 
the official czechoslovak news agency ctk said tuesday that a 
team of czechoslovak physicists led by pavol povinc also produced 
roomtemperature fusion through the electrolysis method 
the team from the comenius universitys faculty of mathematics 
in bratislava capital of slovakia said they achieved fusion on 
monday

descriptions of dismemberment and a 
skull being split open were read in court from statements of 
accused members of an occult group of drug smugglers that 
authorities said killed 15 people 
separately the godfather of the group and his girlfriend 
were among 11 people indicted tuesday by a grand jury in mcallen 
texas 
alfonso de jesus constanzo sara aldrete and the others were 
charged with conspiracy to import marijuana importing marijuana 
conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and possession with 
intent to distribute authorities said 
constanzo aldrete and four others remained at large 
with judge francisco salador perez of the fourth federal court 
presiding late tuesday court officials here read aloud from the 
statements given by the five men arrested in connection with the 
killings the victims included mark kilroy a texas student 
abducted during a springbreak outing to matamoros in march 
the five stood together handcuffed and silent during the 
preliminary hearing 
they smoked occasionally as they listened to the description of 
the horrors that occurred during ceremonies in a wooden shack on a 
ranch near where most of the killings took place 
the accused said those ceremonies were part of a ritualistic 
cult 
four of the men refused to corroborate or deny the written 
statements arguing that their attorney was not present they 
declined a courtappointed counsels help 
defendant elio hernandez told reporters near him that the 
statement read to him did not agree entirely with what i 
declared 
the judge said that the accused can submit additional statements 
or have their own attorneys later he now has three days to 
consider the evidence and decide whether to continue to hold them 
without bail 
the accused have identified constanzo as the groups leader who 
offered them luck and protection in exchange for the human 
sacrifices 
besides hernandez those under arrest are his brother serafin 
hernandez sergio martinez david serna and ranch caretaker 
domingo reyes 
reyes was the only person who ratified his original statement 
that led police to the ranch and the discovery of the bodies 
the godfather asked us for a gringo for a sacrifice read 
the statement by serafin hernandez 
he said the brains had to be placed in a pot 
serafin hernandez described how they picked up kilroy by 
offering him a ride the student later tried to escape but was 
caught and taken to the ranch blindfolded 
also described was how kilroy was killed with a machete blow to 
the back of the head 
we called the godfather at the hotel and told him what he 
wanted was ready he came in the next day the godfather and 
elio and others were inside the shack we heard a noise like a 
coconut being cut open and they took out his brains and 
part of the spine and they cut his legs 
sernas statement described how the group once raided another 
ranch stealing nearly 660 pounds of marijuana and abducting three 
people 
they were brought back to the ranch tied and blindfolded 
we dug a hole and the godfather threw them in still alive and 
machinegunned them 
juan benitez ayala commander of the federal judicial police in 
this border city said four of the 15 men found buried were 
randomly chosen human sacrifices the rest probably were drug 
traffickers the organization found necessary to eliminate he said

nbc captured its fourth straight ratings 
victory but the broadcast networks audience continued to dwindle 
the networks blamed the scriptwriters strike cable and 
independent tv stations and negative reviews 
the three networks combined share of the primetime tv audience 
was 68 percent the lowest in television history and about 3 
percent below last season according to the ac nielsen co 
last years fivemonth writers guild of america strike delayed 
the usual september start of almost every series forcing nbc abc 
and cbs to produce writerproof programs such as news specials 
and new productions of old scripts from series like mission 
impossible 
nbc escaped the brunt of the strike because it broadcast the 
1988 summer olympics and the world series popular sports specials 
unaffected by the labor dispute 
it won all 30 weeks of the septembertoapril season the first 
time any network has done so since 196364 and claimed three of 
the four most popular series nielsen said tuesday 
the networks margin of victory 24 percent was the 
secondlargest in nielsen ratings history the network said for 
the 19561957 season cbs had a 256 rating 27 percent ahead of 
nbc which had a 201 rating 
its something were all very proud of said robert wright 
nbcs president and chief executive officer 
what the writers strike did is hurt the new product said 
david poltrack cbs senior vice president of planning and 
research the strike had an impact it was not an even impact it 
helps the established competition 
the strike also boosted the performance of the fox broadcasting 
corp poltrack said it was during the strike period that 
married with children and americas most wanted started to 
produce big numbers he said 
boosted by its situation comedy roseanne the seasons 
highestrated new series abc finished in second place cbs came in 
last among the big three for the second consecutive year 
abc and cbs disputed nbcs calculations saying the television 
season really began oct 24 although both networks reported the 
same order of finish their numbers depicted nbcs victory in less 
overwhelming terms 
based on nbcs figures the network had a yearly rating of 160 
followed by abc with 129 and cbs with 126 or a combined 415 
last year the combined rating was 428 since each rating point 
equals the 904000 households with televisions the networks loss 
was an estimated 1175 million homes

house democrats looking warily toward the 
task of judging speaker jim wrights ethics have heard his defense 
and now turn their ears to their constituents 
when this hits the house floor its not going to be about 
justice lamented rep ron dellums dcalif its going to be 
about how it will play in peoria 
members began spreading across the nation to their home 
districts after the house adjourned tuesday for a long passover 
holiday weekend 
before they left wright worked hard to fortify democrats for 
the inevitable onslaught of questions they will face during the 
town meetings picnics and barbecues of hometown politics 
meanwhile the washington times reported today that wright is 
considering repaying 145000 he is accused of receiving through 
improper gifts the paper quoted an unidentified house democratic 
leader as saying the suggestion had been made to wright and that 
the speaker apparently was considering it the paper said wrights 
office declined comment on whether he would repay any money 
wright knowing he had to talk to his members before they hit 
the road had committee chairmen cancel any meetings that 
conflicted with a special caucus of all house democrats 
he spoke for 40 minutes in the closed session disputing the 
ethics committee charges that he violated house rules in 69 
instances involving his unusual book publishing deal and his 
benefits from a business partnership 
i told them i intend to fight and i intend to win he said 
supporters were charged up theres a lot of outrage about how 
this whole process has become a frankenstein thats consuming 
congress said rep james scheuer dny theres never any 
allegation that he did anything with corrupt intent 
rep joseph kennedy dmass a secondterm member said 
wrights speech was a very important first step in gaining the 
confidence of the members 
rep bill alexander dark said he would remain a staunch 
supporter of the speaker unless the facts show he did something 
wrong constituents might not understand at first he said 
you get beyond the beltway what have they got besides a 
perception he asked for some members public perception would 
be the only issue he said with a tone of disapproval 
you know who they are he said licking his finger and 
raising it in the springtime air 
along with his appeal to his members wright has begun an effort 
to win support in the general public through careful management of 
his public statements 
in fighting a charge that he accepted improper gifts from fort 
worth developer george mallick a longtime friend and business 
partner who the committee suggested had interest in legislation 
wright has focused his defense on the 18000 salary his wife 
received from the partnership a salary the ethics committee 
labeled a gift 
the fact is my wife worked she earned her pay he told 
reporters at a news conference at which he refused to answer 
questions which might dilute his message that he was a proud 
husband 
wright said he would spend more time later discussing his book 
publishing deal which the ethics committee said appeared to be a 
scheme to evade limits on outside income from speaking fees 
the speaker received 55 percent royalties on his 595 
paperback reflections of a public man the committee found 
that 98 percent were sold in bulk to interest groups who bought the 
book instead of paying him a speaking fee 
wrights supporters told reporters that it was unfair to 
criticize the speaker for taking advantage of house rules which 
clearly exempt book royalties from the limits they compared it to 
the average citizens right to take advantage of every break in the 
tax code 
do i think the speaker found a quite inventive way to finagle 
the rule yeah said rep david obey dwis chairman of the 
committee that wrote the royalty rule 12 years ago but who now 
criticizes the committees interpretation 
several democrats said the speakers troubles could remain even 
if theres no major sanction from the committee the committee 
could recommend anything up to an expulsion from the house 
although thats not now contemplated 
of course the general public gets its perceptions from a wide 
variety of sources besides their lawmakers and new reports wright 
could not have been cheered that he made the monologue of nbcs 
the tonight show 
a lot of people dont realize it but jim wright is a very 
gifted guy host jay leno said monday night the trouble is a 
lot of the gifts havent been reported 
rep pat williams dmont said ethics is a very serious issue 
with the public and wrights toughest challenges lie ahead i 
think the speaker is in hipdeep water and the white rapids are 
straight ahead of him he said 
ethics committee members said tuesday the committees work might 
last into june house republicans with few exceptions have 
adopted a strategy of refraining from criticizing the speakers 
ethics while the case is still undecided 
but the gop is hoping wrights troubles make the public more 
receptive to its message that it is time to make republicans the 
majority party for the first time since president eisenhowers 
first term 
house minority leader bob michel rill and rep mickey 
edwards rokla held a news conference tuesday to announce their 
partys agenda and complain about the pace of legislation this year 
its time for democrats to help govern or get out of the 
way edwards said

the us dollar fell today against the japanese 
yen while the tokyo stock exchanges key index rose slightly to 
another record high 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues closed at 
3336383 up 4217 points or 013 percent the index set its 
previous high of 3332166 points on tuesday when it edged up 
1333 points 
the dollar closed at 13188 yen down 022 yen from tuesdays 
13210yen finish it opened at 13138 yen but generally moved up 
during the day while ranging from 13135 yen to 13195 yen 
traders said the currencys lower opening in tokyo followed a 
drop on overseas markets where discouragement over us economic 
figures released late tuesday in washington led to dollarselling 
the us labor department reported tuesday that the nations 
consumer price index in march rose 05 percent up from februarys 
04 percent while the commerce department said us housing starts 
in march fell 54 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
1397 million 
but market players in tokyo began buying back the dollar 
toward the end of the morning session for their position 
adjustments because they thought they had sold too much ahead of 
the report said a trader with mitsubishi bank speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
there were not enough dollarbuying incentives to push the 
dollar above 132 yen he added 
on the stock market the nikkei index started higher following a 
4161point gain in the dow jones industrial average in new york 
overnight said a dealer with nomura securities speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
participants took the us economic indicators positively as 
showing a slowdown in the nations economy he said 
such a slowdown now would ease fears of inflation prompt 
expectations of lower interest rates and encourage stock 
investment lower us interest rates however make the dollar 
less attractive to foreign investors 
the dealer added that japans political uncertainties have 
largely discouraged foreign and institutional investors who hardly 
participate these days major players are only individuals 
todays trading was active with first section volume estimated 
at 14 billion shares up from tuesdays 11 billion among gainers

scientists at stanford university say 
their experiments with cold fusion prove the energy generated could 
not have come from a chemical reaction as some skeptics have 
suggested 
the researchers revealed their findings tuesday one of several 
announcements made around the world related to the discovery of 
university of utah chemist stanley pons and british colleague 
martin fleischmann 
in rome italian scientists said they achieved fusion at room 
temperature with a different process than the one in the utah 
experiments which used electrical currents in heavy water to 
trigger the reaction we have paved the way for a new road to 
fusion research said umberto colombo head of the national 
agency for alternative energy 
in czechoslovakia a team of physicists said they also produced 
roomtemperature fusion 
in new mexico pons said he wants to help los alamos national 
laboratory scientists duplicate his cold fusion experiments so the 
lab will collaborate with him on research 
the apparent discovery of cold fusion was announced march 23 by 
pons and fleischmann who set off an international debate about 
whether the process was indeed fusion 
pons and fleischmann said they had achieved fusion using 
ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperatures standard 
experiments have used extremely high temperatures making them 
impractical for largescale energy production because they use more 
energy than they produce 
since the announcement scientists have been trying to duplicate 
the experiment and its results if fusion can be created as easily 
as pons and fleischmann claim scientists say it could be a 
relatively inexpensive and virtually inexhaustible energy source 
the stanford finding came from a team of seven researchers led 
by roert a huggins professor of material sciences 
displaying a simple experiment with palladium electrodes in 
tubes of heavy water and plain water in a plastic picnic basket 
huggins said the energy generated was not the result of any known 
chemical reaction 
huggins wouldnt speculate on why the experiment produced a 50 
percent energy gain in heavy water but he acknowledged the most 
likely cause was some kind of fusion process 
were seeing excess heat thats above and beyond any possible 
chemical reaction he said it means the effect is real and is 
substantial 
the energy may result however from a different type of fusion 
than is commonly known he said 
huggins team ran five experiments over two weeks using a tube 
of deuterium oxide or heavy water and a tube of plain water if 
the experiments produced the same results they said it would 
indicate the energy was not from fusion 
instead they found much higher temperatures from the heavy 
water which meant the energy was not a chemical reaction because 
there is no essential chemical difference between the two kinds of 
water 
last week two graduate students at the univeristy of washington 
said they had detected cold fusion in an experiment conducted with 
heavy water but they could not get the same results using ordinary 
water 
on monday pons said the apparent cold fusion discovery had been 
partly verified by more than 60 university and private 
laboratories but none has reported observing both the production 
of neutrons and the high level of heat that he and fleischmann 
produced the experiment at stanford was not designed to measure 
neutrons 
neutrons are a telltale sign of fusion the process powering 
the sun in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when 
hydrogen atoms fuse in contrast conventional nuclear power plants 
use fission the splitting of atoms

large numbers of us diplomats canceled seats on 
pan am flights in the weeks before the bombing of flight 103 
according to a us congressional panel that saw internal pan am 
documents a british newspaper reported today 
the independent a respected daily said documents sent to a 
house of representatives panel probing the dec 21 bombing show 
that christmas holiday traffic for us embassies had been heavily 
rebooked prior to the bombing 
the report noted that relatives of those who died in the bombing 
have been angry that warnings of a possible bombing of a pan am 
flight from frankfurt to the united states were not made public 
all 259 people on pan am flight 103 and 11 on the ground were 
killed when the new yorkbound boeing 747 was blown up over the 
scottish town of lockerbie the flight had originated in frankfurt 
west germany 
a private house of representatives transportation subcommittee 
memorandum on the documents which has been seen by the 
independent said that it had asked pan am for all internal 
documents relating to security procedures and for information about 
who knew of the threat the paper wrote 
included among the documents it received were internal company 
telegrams and memoranda the subcommittee memo said that one pan am 
internal request read that specific details on lost revenue for 
us state department officials were required a second was a 
request for public information guidelines in view that about 80 
percent of holiday traffic of embassy is rebooking 
the subcommittee memo dated 13 march goes on to say that pan 
am needed to be asked what were the details of lost revenue since 
pan am was obviously keeping track of threatrelated 
cancellations 
the us government has denied that its officials acting on the 
warnings had thus avoided pan am flights the report said 
copies of what the independent described as a supposedly 
secret alert bulletin from the us federal aviation 
administration were posted on notice boards at the us embassy in 
moscow on or around dec 13 
the faa bulletin was drawn up after an anonymous caller to the 
us embassy in helsinki said a bomb attack would be made in the 
two weeks after dec 5 the faa bulletin was sent to embassies so 
that they could inform foreign governments 
since the lockerbie bombing the united states and the finnish 
police have maintained that the telephoned warning was a hoax but 
no attempt was made to withdraw the bulletin in the days before the 
bombing the independent said 
relatives of those who died on flight 103 have maintained it was 
inevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin warning 
friends and relatives and canceling pan am reservations 
on april 7 clayton mcmanaway the us ambassadoratlarge for 
counterterrorism told the us senate that is not true the 
newspaper note 
the report said mcmanaway pointed out then that 31 us 
government personnel died in the bombing 
he added that the decision of the us embassy in moscow to post 
copies of the warning was not in accordance with us government 
policy and that steps were being taken to prevent it happening 
again

nicaraguan rebel leaders say the leftist government 
has broken recent peace accords by killing dozens of contra 
supporters the allegation received backing from the human rights 
group americas watch 
the sandinista government is massacring supporters of the 
resistance contra director aristides sanchez said at the groups 
miami headquarters tuesday they are wiping out our entire social 
base 
with elections approaching the contras charged that the 
nicaraguan military has been slaughtering between 40 and 50 
civilians during the past two months in northern nicaragua where 
the usbacked rebels once found their strongest support 
sandinista soldiers the contras said killed 13 rebel 
supporters in the town of apantillo alone 
in washington americas watch which has frequently criticized 
the contras backed up the contra version of events 
we have written the nicaraguan government and are waiting to 
see what they are doing about this said spokesman juan mendez 
we cannot dismiss them as isolated incidents any more 
the contras withdrew from the northern region after a recent 
series of peace accords said adolfo calero another of the seven 
rebel leaders 
but that withdrawal left rebel supporters open to repression he 
said 
they are taking advantage of the truce and the peace 
agreements to eliminate all our supporters calero said 
another charged raised at the contra news conference was that 
the sandinistas have mined roads along the honduran and costa rican 
borders 
calero said nicaraguas supreme electoral council set to 
oversee planned national elections next year violates sandinista 
promises made at a meeting of central american leaders in el 
salvador that a balanced commission would be created 
he said nicaraguan president daniel ortega and the national 
assembly controlled by the sandinistas are planning to appoint and 
approve all five members two members were to be chosen by the 
opposition 
this is no way to initiate the electoral process in 
nicaragua calero said and we expect the central american 
presidents to demand it be changed 
in managua nicaragua the defense ministry reported tuesday 
that contra forces killed three people and injured two in an attack 
on a home in the rio kama area 400 miles southeast of managua

junior high school girls played with 
polymers peered at a horse embryo and checked animal pulses in a 
daylong laboratory visit that hampshire college teachers hope will 
persuade them to seek careers in science 
we never did all this stuff in class tasha galbreath 13 
of springfield said tuesday in a break from comparing a roosters 
pulse with her own my mother even wanted to come today but i 
told her shes not coming 
the annual day in the lab at the private college was started 
four years ago by women faculty members concerned about statistics 
showing fewer girls were choosing math and science courses 
we wanted to show them science is something that women indeed 
do and something exciting and personal not separated from their 
lives said merle bruno dean of natural sciences 
this years program was dedicated to denice oneill a premed 
student who played an integral part in the event until her death 
dec 22 in the crash of pan am flight 103 in scotland on her return 
from a semester abroad 
all three floors of the science building were decorated with 
balloons and turned over to the girls who jumped rope and ran on 
treadmills to check their pulses chewed gum to measure the rate at 
which sugar dissolves heard lectures on aids and saw a horse fetus 
through an ultrasound machine at the nearby school farm 
bruno said the college expected 30 girls in the programs first 
year but got 117 this year the number of preregistrations climbed 
over 200 as word spread about such seminars as superballs and 
slime and blood n guts 
several girls returned from previous years bringing along 
friends sisters and parents east longmeadow science teacher 
richard roz who has participated three years accompanied three 
students from his eighthgrade class his daughter and two friends 
from her secondgrade class 
ive never worked with slime before said gina potorski one 
of roz students who mixed liquid polyvinyl alcohol and sodium 
borate into a putty its cool 
she later mixed sodium silicate and ethyl alcohol to make a 
highbouncing polymer called a superball 
the college sends notices about the program to public and 
private schools in hampden hampshire and franklin counties the 
event falls during spring break for most junior highs 
bruno said the college geared the program to junior high girls 
because they were at a crucial age in their education before 
junior high all students test out the same in levels of 
performance enthusiasm aptitude she said in junior high 
differences appear between boys and girls 
one factor in the difference she said could be that girls are 
subtly discouraged from studying math and science a pattern the 
program is intended to break

massachusetts official witch has begun a 
letterwriting campaign to protest what she and other witches 
believe are violations of their civil rights 
letters of complaint stemming from news reports linking a 
witch to a cult of drug smugglers connected with the 
ritualistic deaths of 15 people found near the texasmexico border 
have been sent to major newspapers and television networks from 
laurie cabots salembased group witches league for selfawareness 
we are not satanists we do not do black magic or any evil 
magic said cabot who formed the 900member group in 1986 
shortly after the filming of the witches of eastwick a movie 
witches said made them appear stupid 
in group literature the league is described as a national and 
international antidefamation organization which is working to 
protect the civil rights dignity and public portrayal of over six 
million witches pagans and pantheists 
the witches complained they have been portrayed in an 
inaccurate offensive and libelous manner which is in violation of 
our constitutionally guaranteed civil right to practice religious 
freedom as well as freedom from harassment discrimination 
persecution or the incitement of the public to form adverse 
opinions of members of a religious community 
cabot dubbed the official witch by gov michael s dukakis 
in 1975 said tuesday that she and other witches are part of a 
legally recognized religion that is peaceful and devoid of the 
evil doings associated with witchcraft stereotypes 
the recent complaints sent to news organizations such as the new 
york times and nbc news stemmed from news reports about the 
murderous cult of drug smugglers in texas 
mexican police have termed sara aldrete the missing 24yearold 
college student believed to be one of the cult leaders a witch 
she has been linked to the 15 victims of the cult some of which 
were unearthed at a ranch south of the us border last week 
its very loose terminology said cabot these were drug 
runners what they were doing had nothing to do with witchcraft 
witchcraft has no evil gods 
cabot described witchcraft as a nature religion that uses a 
mixture of astronomy astrology and psychic powers to heal and make 
things better she said they use potions and cast spells to promote 
wellbeing and general good 
we have families we have children i belong to kiwanis and 
the chamber of commerce you know said cabot who once owned a 
witchcraft store in salem and is now writing books 
she said the group hopes to reeducate people through the 
complaints but added that they could someday take court action if 
they believe their rights have been seriously violated

a 3yearold girl with chronic asthma is 
living in a foster home because a judge ruled her parents werent 
doing enough to keep her away from cigarette smoke 
caroline county social workers removed the girl from her 
parents home last month and she remains in a foster home the 
girls name was not released 
its a critical situation circuit judge j owen wise said 
during a juvenile court hearing march 17 wise placed the child 
under the authority of the social services department 
it is not something that the social services or the medical 
people are doing on a whim or caprice theyre afraid shes going 
to die prematurely and unnecessarily if something isnt done 
wise said 
wise said the parents could regain custody of their daughter if 
they make changes in their lives he granted them full visitation 
rights 
the child was admitted to a hospital near her home on marylands 
eastern shore across the chesapeake bay from baltimore at least 
half a dozen times over the past year or so and on two occasions 
was transferred to johns hopkins university hospital in baltimore 
once she was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of 
serious respiratory problems associated with asthma 
the child lived with her greatgrandmother her legal custodian 
from march 1987 to march 1988 delaware authorities had granted 
custody to the relative while the family was living in that state 
because the girls parents could not afford to properly care for 
her 
but in march 1988 caroline county authorities returned the 
child to her parents who had moved to denton 
in january the childs father lost his job and the family moved 
in with the greatgrandmother until recently the girls parents 
and greatgrandmother smoked 
andrea allen a physician with caroline county health services 
testified that on at least two occasions the girl was in severe 
respiratory distress when brought to the hospital 
ms allen said that tobacco which can bring on an asthma 
attack may have been a critical factor 
my particular concerns about this child include that the 
family continued to smoke despite many warnings that this was not 
appropriate ms allen said i do know that they tried to smoke 
outside the home or at least they were reporting that to us but 
because the smoke is carried on clothing and other articles and in 
the car this simply is not measure enough

the countrys leading opposition 
politician lim kit siang was released from prison today after 
being held without charge for 18 months 
with the release of lim and his son lim guan eng from kamunting 
detention camp 120 miles north of this capital the 
malaydominated government has freed all 106 people it arrested 
during an october 1987 crackdown 
the government that year angered many ethnic chinese who 
generally maintain their separate culture and language by 
assigning nonchinese speaking teachers to chinese primary schools 
prime minister mahathir mohamad himself a malay has said the 
1987 arrests of opposition politicians environmentalists trade 
unionists church workers educators and others was necessary to 
prevent malaychinese rioting 
but kit siang described the last 18 months as a nightmare for 
democratic rights in malaysia 
his primary concern now he said is to do all i can to 
restore public confidence in democracy and restore malaysias image 
abroad 
both kit siang who is secretarygeneral of the opposition 
democratic action party and his son are members of parliament and 
ethnic chinese 
fellow parliament members vethamuthu david and karpal singh were 
released a few months ago but were told they could not speak to the 
press that they have to report to police if they leave their 
hometown are prohibited from addressing public gatherings and must 
report to the authorities every month 
mahathir has said that through their actions and speeches those 
arrested in 1987 had increased racial tension in malaysia where 
government policy promotes malays economic standing in a country 
long dominated by chinese businessmen 
every business in the country must be partially owned by malays 
who also are given tax breaks for starting their own companies 
universities teach in malay which has been named the national 
language and islam has been named the state religion 
the countrys 17 million population is 55 percent malay and 37 
percent chinese with most of the remainder indian 
the races in this former british colony have argued periodically 
over language cultural and other differences but there has been 
no major unrest since 500 people died in malaychinese rioting in 
1969 
when mahathir became prime minister in july 1981 550 people 
were being held under the internal security act which allows 
imprisonment without trial mahathir called for a review and 
released most of them 
deputy home affairs minister megat junid megat ayub says 70 
people are still held without trial under the act 
lee lam thye also an ethnic chinese and a member of parliament 
who has been the acting leader of the opposition and secretary 
general in kit siangs absence called on the government to 
release all the other internal security act detainees or charge 
them in an open court of law

while the effort to clean oildrenched 
beaches sputters to life volunteers armed with dish soap are 
wearily trying to save birds marked for death by sticky goo from 
the exxon valdez 
outside a makeshift rehabilitation center in a college 
dormitory already cleaned cormorants gingerly spread their wings 
to dry in the sun ducks bob in plywoodsided tanks the smell of 
fish used as food permeates the air 
the ones that make it this far into those tanks usually make 
it said mike masson a volunteer from cullowhee nc if 
theyre in there theyll probably be ok 
many do not survive after reaching the center run by the 
international bird rescue research center a californiabased 
nonprofit corporation 
the centers executive director alice berkner said 349 
oilcoated birds have been brought in since the tanker rammed bligh 
reef on march 24 spilling more than 10 million gallons of north 
slope crude into prince william sound 
of the 349 136 died from the oils toxic effects exposure 
dehydration or loss of bouyancy twentytwo have been returned to 
the wild many are being held at the center because they might 
return to the oilcontaminated areas 
by tuesday the coast guard had logged 1850 birds found dead in 
the sound since the spill but the true number of dead birds and 
animals will never be known because of the sounds vast distances 
and remote shorelines 
ms berkner said as the oil has spread the effort to save birds 
has widened she said the organization has opened a cleaning center 
in seward and she was going to kodiak to open another 
luckily there were few ducks and shorebirds in the sound when 
the tanker hit the rocks it was before the spring arrival of 
waterfowl 
ms berkner was unsure how birds migrating into the sound now 
might be affected 
i think right now lets wait and see she said were 
hoping the slick will break up were preparing for the worst 
and hoping for the best 
for ms berkner this spill is not the first 
her first was in 1971 after two chevron tankers collided in san 
francisco bay 
i just went down and helped for two weeks that two weeks 
turned into 18 years she said 
in prince william sound the birds are picked up in the sound by 
43 boats under contract to exxon the vessels also pick up dead 
birds for disposal 
once aboard the vessels the birds are kept warm and given 
liquids each night the days haul is transferred to the cleanup 
center 
in valdez the birds are checked for injuries banded and held 
for washing 
the workers use a popular dishwashing liquid 
inside the center activity seems constant as seven paid staff 
members and the 20 or so volunteers rush to clean birds 
carpeted floors are covered with plastic notes are taped to 
walls 
in the dirty bird room candidates for cleaning wait in 
plywood enclosures with coarse wire floors the boxes are covered 
with sheets to give the birds privacy 
it takes two to 12 tubs of water to clean the birds said 
mary scott coordinator for the volunteers just rinsing the birds 
can take 45 minutes she said 
in the clean bird room the birds are held in covered 
enclosures warmed by commercial pet dryers 
then they are observed in the tanks outside to ensure they can 
float and will not succumb to hypothermia 
the tanks are an attraction for visitors and workers 
this is what makes it worthwhile coming out here and 
watching the silly birds eating and splashing around ms scott 
said

mostly head injuries from rubber and plastic bullets arab hospital 
officials said 
todays violence occurred as soldiers and police beefed up 
security in the occupied lands and inside israel to prevent riots 
or attacks on jews during the sevenday jewish passover holiday 
which begins tonight 
a public opinion survey published by a newspaper indicated 65 
percent of israelis supported a peace plan by prime minister 
yitzhak shamir that calls for arabs in the west bank and gaza strip 
to elect representatives for peace talks 
however the al hamishmar newspaper said that jewish settlers in 
the occupied lands have formed a committee seeking to stop the 
election plan which they claim would bring about a palestinian 
state 
in the gaza strip soldiers clashed with stonethrowing youths 
today in the khan yunis and nusseirat refugee camps the village of 
beit hanoun and a neighborhood in gaza city 
arab hospital officials said the wounded included six chidren 
age 14 or younger who were hit with rubber bullets in the head and 
face five other youths were struck with plastic or rubber bullets 
in other parts of the body 
the officials said six people ages 17 to 30 also were injured 
with plastic bullets 
in arab east jerusalem police detained 27 palestinians accused 
of involvement in stonethrowing riots after midnight in which 
three policemen and two arabs were injured said the jerusalem 
police spokesman uzi sandori 
in the 16month uprising 439 palestinians have been killed 
most shot by soldiers quelling stonethrowing protests eighteen 
israelis also have died 
the yediot ahronot newspaper said it conducted the public 
opinion survey on shamirs plan april 1216 in facetoface 
interviews with a random sample of 656 israelis sixtyfive percent 
said they supported the elections plan and 31 percent were opposed 
while 4 percent said they had no view the newspaper said no 
margin of error was given for the poll 
a western relief official in gaza city said that about 40 
percent of the wounded in the palestinian revolt are now 15 and 
younger 
in the beginning of the uprising the average age of those 
getting shot was much higher said the official speaking on

a christian science couple was found 
guilty of murder for allowing their 7yearold diabetic daughter to 
die without medical attention because of their religious beliefs 
william hermanson 42 and his wife christine 38 could be 
sentenced to three to seven years in prison under state sentencing 
guidelines they were allowed to remain free until sentencing no 
sentencing date has been set 
a jury found the hermansons guilty tuesday of thirddegree 
murder and child abuse in the 1986 death of their daughter amy 
they had rejected a plea bargain agreement for 15 years probation 
in exchange for a plea of guilty or no contest 
we will be filing motions for a new trial said defense 
attorney charles arnold he said he was disappointed and 
surprised at the verdict 
the hermansons were the first christian scientists in 20 years 
prosecuted in the united states for denying a child medical care 
for religious reasons church representatives said five other 
religious exemption cases are pending three in california one 
each in arizona and massachusetts 
the defense said the case was about religious freedom and cited 
a 1975 florida law that protects parents who withhold medical 
treatment from their sick children if they are legitimately 
practicing their religious beliefs 
prosecutors contended it was murder saying the girl died after 
her parents ignored pleas to take her to a doctor and relied 
instead on prayer to heal her untreated diabetes 
christian scientists rely on prayer instead of medicine to care 
for the ill and may call on churchaccredited practitioners 
with expertise in spiritual healing however members may seek 
medical assistance without fear of sanctions 
nathan talbot church spokesman from boston said the conviction 
would tend to unify christian scientists 
the church must do a fuller job of helping society understand 
that it has a wonderful gift in spiritual healing and it would be a 
loss for all of us to prosecute out of existence spiritual 
healing he said 
but rita swan a former christian scientist from iowa who began 
a campaign to fight religious exemption laws after losing a son to 
meningitis 12 years ago called the verdict significant 
it signals to the nation that society does not approve of this 
behavior and christian scientists had better wake up and listen 
she said these jurors could not accept the notion that a child 
should be allowed to die of diabetes for which everybody knows 
there is a standard very effective treatment 
last week with the jury out of the room a witness testified 
that both parents had sought medical treatment for themselves but 
not for their daughter the jury never heard that testimony because 
the judge ruled that prosecutors had improperly withheld the 
information from defense attorneys

israel placed its security forces on high alert 
today to prevent guerrilla attacks during the passover holiday and 
thousands of israelis traveled to beach resorts or headed home to 
be with relatives 
the weeklong jewish holiday commemorates the exodus of the 
ancient israelites from egypt and begins at sundown wednesday with 
a traditional meal known in hebrew as a seder 
thousands of police and border patrol reinforcements were 
deployed across the country and police maintained a large presence 
in jerusalems walled old city to prevent disruptions of religious 
services a police spokesman said 
the 16month palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip has increased the concern in israel about attempts by 
palestinian guerrillas to carry out attacks during the holidays 
police appealed to the public in a statement published in all 
newspapers to report suspicious people or packages 
the army increased its forces to prevent guerrilla infiltrations 
across israels borders especially the northern frontier with 
lebanon so far this year 31 guerrillas have been killed in a 
dozen attacks on the northern border 
an army spokesman would not give out details of troop 
deployments 
the army organized passover meals in military bases but 
soldiers serving in the occupied lands will celebrate the meal in 
shifts and will be given grape juice instead of the traditional 
four cups of wine an army spokesman said 
budget restrictions forced the army to cancel the headquarters 
passover feast which is traditionally held at a different base 
each year and is attended by the chief of staff and dignitaries 
the army took austerity measures after asking the government for 
an additional 138 million to covere increased costs of quelling 
the uprising 
in tel aviv us ambassador william a brown participated in a 
symbolic passover seder organized by soviet jewish activists to 
thank the united states for its efforts on behalf of soviet jews 
being refused permission to emigrate 
organizers set up a table on the sidewalk across the street from 
the embassy serving wine and traditional passover dishes 
israelis headed home to their families today while others 
planned to spend the holiday weekend in resort areas such as the 
sea of galilee and the red sea port of eilat 
passover is israels equivalent of the christmas shopping 
season and israelis crowded shopping centers and supermarkets to 
do their lastminute shopping before stores closed this afternoon 
during the holiday many jews abstain from eating bread or 
consuming other leavened products such as beer to identify with the 
ancient israelites who fled egypt so quickly they had no time to 
leaven yeast for bread 
many israelis have carried out traditional spring cleaning 
removing all bread and leaven from their homes this morning 
religious jews performed the tradition of burning the last 
remaining bread crumbs outside their homes 
in jerusalems ultraorthodox mea shearim neighborhood children 
built a bonfire on the main street and dozens of young boys most 
in shorts with their sidecurls flying were seen tossing bags of 
bread onto the fire 
in tel avivs bnai brak neighborhood ultraorthodox jews 
carried plastic bags of bread to barrels or open fields and set 
them alight others dunked pots and pans in barrels of boiling 
water to purify them of any bread

attackers ambushed the first un convoy 
bringing relief supplies to rebelheld southern sudan destroying 
the lead vehicle and reportedly killing eight rebel escorts un 
officials said today 
diane weathers a un world food program spokeswoman said a 
driver and two assistants also were wounded in the tuesday 
afternoon attack 14 miles west of the sudan peoples liberation 
army base at kapoeta 
the 14truck convoy was carrying 100 tons of food and relief 
supplies to the town of torit 100 miles west of kapoeta 
it was the first relief convoy to torit under operation 
lifelinesudan the unorganized effort to stock more than 
100000 tons of food and supplies in southern sudan before rain in 
may makes transportation virtually impossible 
the effort is intended to avert another tragedy like that in 
1988 when relief officials say about 500000 people died from 
drought 
the operation began april 1 after the government and the rebels 
agreed to allow aid to move unhampered through rebelheld and 
governmentcontrolled land 
un officials in nairobi did not say who they believed was 
responsible for tuesdays ambush but they said it was unlikely 
sudan peoples liberation army rebels would attack their own 
members 
the sudan peoples liberation army took up arms against the 
moslemdominated government in 1983 demanding greater autonomy and 
economic development for the predominantly christian and animist 
south 
a french monitor for the world food program was riding with the 
convoy when it was attacked and reported the incident tuesday night 
to un officials said ms weathers 
eight rebel escorts members of the peoples liberation armys 
sudan relief and rehabilitation association were killed by 
automatic weapon fire and the lead vehicle was destroyed by some 
sort of missile said paul mitchell a un spokesman mitchell 
did not know whether the rebel escorts were armed 
he said that because of the attack operation lifelines 
overland route to torit from kapoeta would be suspended he said an 
airlift from the ugandan city of entebbe would begin friday to 
torit which was captured by rebels in march 
ms weathers said in the last three weeks torits population 
has soared from 3000 to 25000 as displaced sudanese seeking 
shelter and food pour in she said the un expected the population 
to grow to as many as 50000 
ms weathers said that while tuesdays attack interrupted the 
overland relief operation to torit the remainder of the aid 
operation would continue 
the united nations planned to move 25000 tons of food and 
supplies before rains begin in midmay but to date un convoys 
have moved only 120 tons of food to kapoeta from kenya said ms 
weathers 
the norwegian peoples aid in conjunction with the 
californiabased world vision relief agency and the us agency for 
international development has trucked several thousand tons of 
relief supplies to kapoeta since october in another relief 
operation 
from uganda a joint world food programcatholic relief services 
airlift has carried 3000 tons of relief supplies to the city of 
juba home to an estimated 300000 war refugees and residents

the state of mississippi and two 
foundations have linked up to fight one of the countrys highest 
illiteracy rates by putting teaching computers into every public 
elementary school within four years 
gov ray mabus said tuesday that the riordan foundation of los 
angeles and the rord foundation of new york will make an initial 
investment of 15 million to begin installing computers this fall 
he said the foundations would raise an additional 55 million 
over the next three years he said the state would provide about 
15 million a year in matching funds 
the computer learning system would be made available to 
kindergarteners and firstgraders in the states approximately 500 
schools 
we have a goal in mississippi for everybody to read and write 
i think today we are taking a big step in that direction mabus 
said 
mabus said he hoped to get the computer labs which include the 
computer work stations listening library station and other working 
areas in place in about onethird of the states 150 school 
districts by this fall 
mabus and his wife julie have promised to fight illiteracy in 
the state based on 1980 census data state officials estimate that 
as many as 400000 adults in mississippi have fewer than nine years 
of formal education and most of them are functionally illiterate 
the states population is 23 million 
mississippi will be the first state in the country to our 
knowledge to have such an extensive computer literacy system for 
its children mabus said every child in mississippi should 
when this program in place leave the first grade knowing how to 
read and write 
dick riordon said his foundation has provided for similar 
computer learning systems in several california cities and in 
kansas city mo chicago and new york but he said this was the 
foundations first statewide effort 
the project is to use ibms writing to read systems the 
computers allow children to write anything they can say and read 
what they write it also lets students learn at their own pace 
if they are slow it doesnt criticize them riordan said

thousands of students demanding the 
overthrow of president roh taewoo battled riot police today with 
firebombs and rocks in at least 10 cities and protesters attacked 
a us military base in seoul 
police firing tear gas battled students in campus and street 
clashes marking the anniversary of the april 19 1960 student 
revolt that toppled the syngman rhee government violent protests 
were reported in seoul kwangju chonju chungju pusan taejon 
wonju kangnung chunchon and iri 
execute roh taewoo and yankee go home students 
screamed as they beat drums and brass gongs 
yonhap the south korean news agency said about 37000 students 
took part in protests at 112 colleges nationwide but it did not 
say how many were violent police said they had no overall figures 
on the protests 
several police officers and students were injured but police 
officials in seoul said they had no details on injuries or arrests 
the protests appeared to be the most serious in recent months 
a band of protesters hurled about 20 firebombs into the us 
armys camp isabell in seoul during the night but caused only minor 
damage police and us military officials said the protesters 
fled before they could be caught 
radical students claim the united states helps keep the roh 
government in power and are demanding withdrawal of the 43000 us 
troops based in the nation students have staged a series of 
attacks on us facilities in recent months 
more than 1000 students at hankook university in seoul staged a 
furious battle pelting police with hundreds of firebombs and 
rocks police in fatigues and visored helmets fired scores of tear 
gas canisters and made several charges to force the protesters back 
similar clashes occurred at at least 12 other seoul colleges 
after police blocked students from marching into the streets 
but a student call for evening protests in the center of seoul 
was mostly ignored with just a few protesters yelling slogans on 
sidewalks before being quickly swept away by thousands of riot 
police 
student leaders urged students to imitate the example of the 
1960 revolt 
we must strike down the roh dictatorship and establish true 
democracy in korea a leader at hankook said as students cheered 
the government put riot police on top alert nationwide to block 
protests at least 20000 riot police were deployed in seoul riot 
units guarded key government buildings and some major intersections 
police officials also said security was increased near 
government buildings and embassies 
the radicals frequently stage violent demonstrations and attack 
government offices they lack popular support because of their 
extreme views and they are not seen as a serious threat to the roh 
government 
the radical students who represent a small but powerful 
minority on college campuses are trying to form an antigovernment 
alliance with militant trade union groups campaigning for major 
wage increases and other concessions 
about 1000 striking electronic workers clashed today with riot 
police in the southeastern city of changwon after a protest march 
a major crackdown was launched on labor strikes after roh warned 
last week that strikes threatened to hamstring the economy roh 
said strikes had cost 24 billion in lost production and reduced 
exports by 600 million this year 
roh a former general won presidential elections in december 
1987 and has helped introduce broad democratic reforms but many 
koreans still identify his government with his authoritarian 
predecessor chun doohwan

defense secretary dick cheney and other 
nato defense ministers today began talks likely to center on the 
politically sensitive issue of upgrading shortrange nuclear 
missiles in europe 
cheney attending his first gathering of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization was expected to press the allies for 
a new and stronger commitment to us plans to modernize the 
weapons 
i think it is important that we go forward to modernize that 
force he told reporters aboard his air force jet en route 
brussels he reiterated american opposition to eastwest 
negotiations on reducing shortrange weapons in europe 
now is the time i believe to move forward on conventional 
nonnuclear forces he said 
germany belgium and some other european nations want nato to 
indicate its willingness to open talks on shortrange nuclear 
weapons with the sovietled warsaw pact 
officials said it was unlikely the defense ministers would 
discuss the matter in any depth at this twoday meeting there 
appears to be a desire on the part of the allies officials said 
to show cohesion in advance of a may summit between president bush 
and other nato leaders 
the ministers also were not scheduled to make any key decisions 
on modernization which is strongly opposed in some european 
countries but they will be asked to reaffirm their backing to 
plans to upgrade the current lance surfacetosurface missile 
the united states contends it needs a strong signal from the 
allies to lobby congress for money to continue a 
researchanddevelopment program for the weapon 
bush and other nato leaders will meet at the end of may and 
discuss the modernization plans as part of a blueprint designed to 
guide the alliance in arms control and force planning in the coming 
years 
the modernization issue has become increasingly sensitive in 
recent months 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany has said he wants to 
delay a decision on deployment of the new missile until 1991 or 
1992 after elections in his country 
belgium recently added to the uncertainty by saying it too 
wanted decisions put off until the early 1990s 
a us diplomat said decisions on producing and deploying the 
missile were not expected for several more years 
the lance missile introduced in 1972 will become obsolete in 
1995 
the missile has a range of 60 miles and its replacement would be 
extended to more than 250 miles just under the limits of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty the accord eliminates 
us and soviet landbased missiles with ranges of about 300 to 
3400 miles 
there are currently 88 lance launchers most of them in west 
germany 
us gen john galvin commander of natos european forces 
argued for modernizing the shortrange missile force in an article 
tuesday in the international herald tribune 
he said the sovietled warsaw pact has undertaken an extensive 
modernization program for shortrange nuclear forces during the 
1980s 
galvin has drawn up a report that says replacing the missile 
will allow the western alliance to make substantial reductions in 
nuclear artillery the study was to be discussed by the defense 
ministers 
nato contends it needs a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent to 
offset the enormous superiority the east has built up in 
conventional or nonnuclear weapons 
the nato members are canada the united states belgium 
britain denmark germany greece france iceland italy 
luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal spain and turkey 
france which is not part of natos integrated military 
structure does not attend the nuclear discussions iceland takes 
part as an observer

paramount pictures and a movie theater cant be 
held responsible for the death of a teenager stabbed by a young 
man who had just seen a 1979 film about city gangs the 
massachusetts supreme court has ruled 
the victims family sued paramount and saxon theater corp 
seeking damages on the grounds of wrongful death it charged that 
paramount and the theater knew the warriors was inciting 
violence around the country 
three days before the boston slaying according to court 
records two other youths were killed near theaters showing the 
film in palm springs and oxnard calif that same week paramount 
officers advised theaters showing the film to hire security guards 
and offered to pay for them 
the massachusetts high court upheld the dismissal of the 
familys lawsuit by a lower court on the ground that the 
moviemaker and theater company had no special relationship to 
the dead youth and therefore had no duty to protect him from his 
attacker in addition the court rejected the familys contention 
that the warriors was an incitement to violence 
although the film is rife with violent scenes it does not at 
any point exhort urge entreat solicit or overtly advocate or 
encourage unlawful or violent activity on the part of viewers 
justice francis oconnor wrote it does not create the likelihood 
of inciting or producing imminent lawless action that would strip 
the film of first amendment protection 
william yakubowicz filed the lawsuit in 1981 on behalf of his 
dead son martin 16 the youth was stabbed feb 15 1979 at a 
subway station several miles from the theater by michael barrett 
who was returning from seeing the warriors at the saxon theater 
barrett who sat through two showings of the movie taunted 
yakubowicz on the subway imitating a line from the movie i 
want you im going to get you

kevin bower was near his 5yearold daughter 
when a pipe bomb hidden in a toothpaste container blew up and hes 
thankful her injuries were not more severe 
were very lucky he said we have a daughter many people 
have gone through much worse than this 
two men seen leaving the k mart store after the explosion were 
being sought for questioning police also interviewed employees and 
former employees of the store to try to find out why someone 
planted the bomb in the store 
authorities also were on the lookout for a second bomb 
the potential for it happening again is always there either 
through a copycat situation or the same individual again said 
detective sgt mike kouns of the marion county sheriffs department 
erin bower lost her left hand and may recover only partial sight 
in her left eye as a result of the mondays explosion doctors at 
methodist hospital said 
she was listed in fair condition today and more than likely 
will move out of pediatric intensive care to a regular ward 
hospital spokesman david richards said her mood was quiet he said 
there may be some vision left in the left eye the right eye 
appears to be all right but the left eye has been cut open by the 
force of the blast and by flying debris said dr william nunery 
a specialist in ophthalmology plastic and reconstructive surgery 
those injuries can heal with time and they can sometimes be 
repaired 
erins left hand could not be saved but the muscles and nerves 
in the forearm are intact said dr michael levine a plastic 
surgeon 
i dont think its beyond the realm of possibility or 
probability that she will ultimately have a prosthesis and be 
fairly successful with it levine said 
the girls mother maurine 31 was slightly wounded by flying 
bomb fragments but no others were hurt in monday night explosion 
at the store on indianapolis northeast side 
the bomb hidden in a pumptype toothpaste dispenser was 
concealed among packages of trash bags in the hardware section 
toward the rear of the store the men wanted for questioning both 
believed to be about 20 years old drew police attention with their 
nonchalant response to the explosion 
usually people want to rush to see whats going on these two 
gentlemen apparently left while everybody else was going in the 
opposite direction kouns said 
police released sketches of the men compiled from employees 
descriptions 
the bomb which was made of a pipe threequarters of an inch 
thick and apparently filled with black powder may have been 
powered by a battery and detonated when it was picked up from a 
store shelf said charles a petersen resident agent in charge of 
the indianapolis office of the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms 
k mart has offered a reward of up to 5000 for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the 
bombing

an apparent attempt to cover up a drug trafficking 
probe involving a former metrodade police officer is suspected of 
setting off everglades brushfires that shrouded miami in smoke last 
week officials said 
charred documents found by firefighters at the source of the 
12000acre blaze that started april 8 have been linked to alex 
marrero 34 according to joe subic an investigator with the 
florida department of agriculture 
nine years ago the acquittal of marrero and three other 
metrodade officers charged with beating a black man to death in 
miami launched three days of riots that left 18 dead and an 
estimated 80 million of property damage in miamis black 
neighborhoods 
the documents soaked in gasoline belonged to eastern security 
and investigations inc a miamibased company owned and operated 
by marrero police suspect the documents were burned in connection 
with marreros arrest in a sting operation earlier the same day 
the fire broke out only hours after marreros arrest along with 
drug enforcement administration agent jorge villar on cocaine 
distribution and bribery charges they could face up to life in 
prison if convicted 
subic acknowledged that marreros arrest made it impossible for 
the former metrodade police officer to have started the fire but 
the investigator speculated that marrero could have passed an order 
to an associate to burn the company records 
according to subic arson charges will be brought against 
whoever started the fire 
state and federal firefighters worked for more than three days 
to control the blaze which shrouded miami and much of south 
florida in a dense cloud of smoke it caused 100000 in damage

the bush administration faced sharp criticism 
today for not acting decisively enough in taking control of the 
alaska oil spill as senators called for new laws that would 
require the president to direct such cleanup efforts 
there has never been a time when this situation was under 
control declared sen max baucus dmont chairman of the 
senate environmental protection subcommittee which convened a 
hearing on the oil spill recovery effort 
senate majority leader george mitchell said that president bush 
was slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster and 
valuable hours were lost after the march 24 spill in alaskas 
prince william sound when the spill might still have been 
controlled 
mitchell of maine said federal environmental laws need to be 
changed to require the president to either take over oil spill 
cleanup efforts or specifically to declare that the cleanup is 
being conducted properly through private efforts 
transportation secretary samuel skinner the presidents point 
man on the oil spill recovery who was scheduled to testify before 
the senate panel later has said that bush rejected a 
federalization of the alaska cleanup because of concern that such a 
move might affect exxons financial liabilities 
the president has said the us coast guard is coordinating 
cleanup efforts 
but in a round of opening statements one senator after another 
criticized everyone involved in the cleanup especially recovery 
efforts in the first days after the exxon valdez tanker ran 
aground spilling 10 million gallons of oil into the pristine 
waters 
from all accounts the cleanup crews initially acted more 
like the keystone cops declared sen john chafee rri 
chafee said the recovery effort demonstrated fundamental 
shortcomings in state and federal government agencies as well as 
exxon but he said he understood brushs reluctance to take a more 
aggressive role saying he had been told it stemmed from disputable 
legal advice and not from white house disinterest 
but baucus said the bush administration as well as the industry 
have been unbelievably slow to appreciate the magnitude of the 
response needed to deal with the spill the worst in us history 
which now affects thousands of square miles 
sen ted stevens ralaska although not critical of bush 
directly has repeatedly called for greater federal involvement 
immediately after the accident occurred im disappointed the 
president didnt see it that way said stevens 
but sen frank lautenberg dnj said that bush appeared to 
have made a decision early on to leave the cleanup effort to exxon 
the magnitude of this disaster didnt strike washington until it 
was way too late he added 
stevens said the effects of the spill will last many years and 
that the total price tag coud exceed 1 billion in cleanup and 
recovery in an attempt to demonstrate the magnitude of the spill 
stevens said the area threated with oil contamination is the size 
of three great lakes systems and if it had occurred in portland 
maine the oil today would be almost down to washington dc 
in addition to skinner the subcommittee also was scheduled to 
hear from william k reilly head of the environmental protection 
agency alaska gov steve cowper who has been critical of exxons 
handling of the spill and lawrence rawl chairman of the giant oil

meanwhile interior secretary manuel lujan jr was scheduled 
later today to fly to alaska for a fourday tour his first visit 
to the area contaminated by the march 24 spill lujans department 
is charged with planning longterm recovery efforts for the 
regions wildlife and public lands 
on tuesday lujan announced a joint 6 million threeyear 
research program with the petroleum industry to develop better 
recovery and cleanup equipment and methods for large oil spills 
the interior secretary has characterized the recovery equipment 
in alaska as little more than tinker toys and totally 
inadequate for dealing with a spill of the magnitude that occurred 
in prince william sound when the exxon valdez tanker ran aground 
he said the inadequacies of the recovery equipment were 
demonstrated when containment booms broke repeatedly from the force 
of the waves and syphoning equipment was so slow it hardly made a 
dent in the amount of oil in the water 
lujan said the department and the american petroleum institute 
would evenly divide the cost of the threeyear research effort 
which is aimed at developing and testing new oil burning 
techniques new highspeed steerable booms and more advanced 
skimmer technology for clearing oil from iceladen waters 
various chemicals some of which are supposed to disperse oil 
and some to keep it together also will be tested under the 
program department officials said 
meanwhile the interior department said it was planning to step 
up inspections at offshore oil drilling platforms to check whether 
the industry is prepared to respond to an oil spill emergency 
a report on the inspections is to be presented to lujan late next 
month

maan jordan ap police and soldiers fanned out across south 
jordan today to restore order after rioters battled police looted 
buildings and erected stone barricades on a main highway 
residents blamed the outbreak on price increases mandated by the 
international monetary fund king hussein in washington for a 
meeting with president bush told reporters everything is under 
control 
he said the disturbances were the result of the austerity 
measures 
at least 18 people were reported injured in the rioting that 
broke out tuesday in maan a city of 25000 about 120 miles south 
of amman and spread to other towns along the highways linking the 
capital with the red sea port of aqaba the violence continued 
tuesday night but police and soldiers moved into the region today 
and restored order with a curfew in maan 
on tuesday thousands of rioters in the city attacked banks 
burned tires smashed cars and battled police minor demonstrations 
were reported today in the city of kerak and at the university of 
jordan in amman 
in the capital crown prince hassan told foreign reporters at 
the palace that six civilians and 12 policemen were wounded tuesday 
in maan 
the crown prince king husseins brother is acting head of 
state while hussein is visiting washington 
yousef alazem who represented maan in jordans nowsuspended 
parliament said from amman that about 25 people were wounded 
the crown prince indicated there had been some arrests but gave 
no number 
tanks armored vehicles and police cars were parked every few 
miles along the important northsouth desert highway leading to 
maan at several checkpoints police stopped all vehicles to 
question drivers 
on tuesday protesters blocked the highway north of maan at 
several spots with piles of rocks 
civilians here have called it jordans intefadeh of prices 
said a security officer in maan using the arab term for the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
however the crown prince suggested the riots were a product of 
extremist exploitation he identified the instigators as some 
of the bearded gentlemen an apparent reference to moslem 
fundamentalists who are very influential over the groups in the 
street 
demonstrators said the protests were triggered by a government 
announcement sunday that prices of gasoline vehicle fees 
telephone calls and other items would rise by 10 percent to 50 
percent immediately 
the increases are part of an economic accord with the imf to 
restructure the countrys 6 billion foreign debt 
last month similar imfmandated price increases in venezuela 
led to rioting in caracas and its slums that left at least 300 
people dead 
the main reason for this rioting is because of the price 
increases said a hotel worker in maan the government had 
better believe that we are starving the people of the south are 
starving 
the price increases followed months of deteriorating economic 
conditions caused by a foreign exchange crisis that last year 
forced the government of prime minister zaid rifai to devalue the 
currency 
the price increases are part of a government effort to trim 
spending 
gasoline prices rose by 25 percent to 165 a gallon and the 
cost of cigarettes jumped more than 40 percent to 157 a pack 
cooking gas alcoholic beverages and telephone service also rose 
some workers make as little as 93 a month although wages of 
185 to 370 are more common many jordanian families have six to 
10 children

bureaucracy slow donor support bad 
planning and the civil war have forced organizers to scale down a 
un relief effort to save millions of people in the south from 
starvation or malnutrition 
attackers on tuesday ambushed the first convoy bringing supplies 
to rebelheld southern sudan destroying the lead vehicle and 
killing eight rebel escorts un officials in nairobi kenya 
reported today 
even before the ambush organizers said operation lifelinesudan 
now expects to provide less than half the 100000 tons of relief 
goods believed to be necessary if a second consecutive summer 
disaster is to be avoided 
when the relief effort began april 1 the united nations planned 
to stockpile supplies at strategic points in southern and 
southwestern sudan for people escaping famine caused by the 
6yearlong civil war in the region 
relief goods must be in place before the summer rains turn much 
of the rural south into lakes and isolate areas where the refugees 
gather 
almost three weeks after the starting date no deliveries have 
been made by trains or nile river barge convoys the projects bulk 
carriers airlifts have been delayed because planes promised by the 
united states and other western donors have not arrived 
diane weathers a un world food program spokeswoman said the 
14truck convoy to the town of torit was attacked tuesday afternoon 
14 miles west of a rebel base at kapoeta 
un officials in nairobi did not say who they believe was 
responsible for the ambush but they said it was unlikely rebels 
were responsible because of the rebel escort 
the officials said that overland route would be suspended but 
other relief operations would move forward 
un organizers have given up their original goal of completing 
the 132 million operation by the end of april and say it will 
continue as long as allowed by the rains which normally begin in 
may 
food has been stored in some areas of the three southern 
regions but supplies in other towns are precariously low and the 
possibility of replenishing them appears slim 
project director bryan wannop local head of the un 
development program insisted there are signs of momentum 
gathering and expressed hope that half the 100000 tons of food 
and medicine would be within reach of 23 million southerners by 
the end of april 
only about 26000 tons are in the stockpiles now he said 
un officials say 100000 face starvation without emergency 
supplies relief agencies estimated 250000500000 southerners 
died in 1988 from the war and the famine it created 
to attract international attention the un childrens fund 
flew in actress audrey hepburn its goodwill ambassador and some 
of the bad planning became evident 
in khartoum she was driven around aimlessly for an hour by 
escorts who had not been told her schedule 
operation lifelinesudan sometimes appears to face an endless 
list of problems 
after promising two military c130 transport for the airlift 
the united states backed out because american officers thought the 
planes might be exposed to hostile fire 
the khartoum office of the us agency for international 
development said it would charter two of the cargo jets but there 
is no indication when that will be done 
shortages of fuel have grounded available planes and disabled 
trucks 
bureaucracy contributes to the bottlenecks with such policies as 
requiring relief workers to obtain travel permits 
customs problems continue despite prime minister sadek mahdis 
promises at the march conference to eliminate them 
sudans cumbersome bureaucratic pace was slowed even more by the 
advent april 7 of ramadan the holy month when moslems abstain from 
food and drink in daylight hours 
khartoum and the rest of northern sudan are arab and 
predominantly moslem the civil war grew out of demands by black 
southerners most of whom are christians or animists for autonomy 
and a better economic deal 
richard reid regional director of unicef for the middle east 
and north africa said there have been lots of disappointments 
that the donor community has been slow in responding that the 
military actions have not diminished disappointments with the 
logistical and mechanical obstacles

a councilman in liverpool said today that police 
who have largely blamed the weekends soccer disaster on 
hooliganism and drunkeness are trying to cover up their own 
incompetence 
the charge came while police and government officials launched 
inquiries to determine how a surging crowd was allowed to crush and 
suffocate people at the soccer match leaving 95 dead 
the times of london today quoted police officials as saying they 
were disgusted by reports portraying saturdays disaster at 
hillsborough stadium in sheffield as a consequence of their failure 
to control the crowd 
paul middup chairman of the south yorkshire police federation 
the local police union chapter claimed drunkenness contributed to 
the uncontrolled crush of liverpool fans outside the stadium just 
as the match between liverpool and nottingham forest was beginning 
south yorkshire police said today that some fans were arrested 
before the game for public order offenses but refused to give any 
details 
to relieve the dangerous crush outside the stadium police 
ordered that a locked gate be opened the fans poured into a 
standingroom terrace area already crowded with other liverpool 
fans and victims were trampled or crushed to death against a 
10foothigh steelmesh fence 
we are quite convinced that a lot of the fans many many 
hundreds of them outside that gate had been drinking very 
heavily he said on british broadcasting corp television 
given the behavior police faced outside the stadium middup 
said i dont know what we are supposed to do and why it should 
all be our fault 
he also said officers saw people picking up victims belongings 
the times said other police officers reported seeing liverpool fans 
picking the pockets of the dead 
liverpool city council leader keva coombe called the police 
allegations baseless malicious and wicked and said they are 
contradicted by the observations of thousands of people who were 
present from all sections of society 
none of these allegations were made at the time and any lawyer 
will know that they have the hallmarks of an attempt to create a 
cover story to cover for their incompetence he said 
in another development today soviet soccer star oleg blokhin 
who plays for an austrian team condemned the deplorable 
conditions of the sheffield stadium the official soviet news 
agency tass reported from moscow 
i believe it is an outright crime to pack spectators into 
standing sectors like sardines in a can blokhin was quoted as 
saying 
the disaster has focused attention on englands antiquated 
soccer stadiums and the riot fences located in standingroomonly 
areas near the soccer goals news reports have centered on 
speculation the deaths may have been caused by the decision of 
south yorkshire police supt roger marshall to order the gate 
unlocked 
nine survivors of saturdays disaster are suing south yorkshire 
police and the owners of the stadium alleging negligence 
police officials quoted by the times expressed disgust at the 
behavior of liverpool fans as officers attended to the victims 
the paper quoted one unnamed senior police officer as saying 
as we struggled in appalling conditions to save lives fans 
standing further up were openly urinating on us and the bodies 
of the dead 
as policemen on the pitch tried to save the injured they were 
hampered by other liverpool fans running up kicking and punching 
them the officer said 
on tuesday a senior judge sir peter taylor began a 
governmentordered inquiry into the disaster by touring the stadium 
taylor said it was too early to pinpoint major issues of the 
inquiry but said he would look at the effect of liquor on the fans 
behavior 
the death toll rose tuesday to 95 with the death of a 
hospitalized 14yearold boy nineteen injured fans remained 
hospitalized today nine in intensive care hospital officials said 
british soccer fans have a reputation for violence rioting 
liverpool fans are blamed for belgiums 1985 heysel stadium 
disaster when 39 mostly italian fans died as a result rival fans 
have been segregated and fenced in at hillsborough and other 
british grounds to keep them from fighting and running onto the 
field

a nationwide shortage of math and 
science instructors probably will continue into the next century 
but alternative teacher training programs help offset the 
shortfall a study has found 
the united states will need about 20000 new math and science 
teachers each year for the next decade says linda darlinghammond 
lead author of a rand corp study on teacher education which was 
released tuesday 
the study found that postgraduate training programs for career 
switchers retirees and other nontraditional teacher recruits 
produce about 2000 science and math instructors a year or 10 
percent of the shortfall 
less than half of the demand will be met by graduates of 
traditional education programs by 1992 the study adds 
ms darlinghammond noted that the national science teachers 
association estimates that about 30 percent of the people teaching 
math or science are not fully prepared 
quite often a physical education teacher will be asked to 
teach biology because some administrators view the curriculum 
requirements as similar she said 
this produces recurring problems with poor student achievement 
in the sciences and math she said 
our very best math students the top 5 percent of our 
students score below the average for students in japan and 
china ms darlinghammond said 
if we dont improve our ability to produce large numbers of 
welltrained people in scientific and technical fields we will not 
be able to compete economically in the international marketplace 
ms darlinghammond said 
the biggest obstacles reported in recruiting and retaining good 
science and math teachers are similar to those for teachers in 
general relatively low pay student disciplinary problems poor 
student motivation excessive paperwork and assignment to 
nonteaching chores 
the rand study redesigning teacher education opening the 
door for new recruits to science and mathematics training 
generally found that there are two ways to increase the supply of 
entrants to an occupation 
increase the benefits or attractions to the field or reduce 
the costs of entry efforts to improve teacher salaries and working 
conditions are intended to address the first of these and 
nontraditional programs attend to the second of these strategies 
they aim to lower the financial and opportunity costs of preparing 
to teach 
nontraditional programs focus on training people who did not 
consider math or science teaching while they were in college 
but a rand survey of 64 such programs comprising most of the 
programs nationwide found significant differences in some cases 
programs have been closed for lack of funding since the survey was 
done two years ago 
the extent of study required varied from as few as 16 weeks to 
two years or more requiring completion of as few as nine course 
credits to as many as 45 some provide student teaching experience 
but not all

arrived today to oversee a new round of peace talks between iran 
and iraq but negotiators for both sides said they are not prepared 
to compromise 
at an airport press conference perez de cuellar acknowledged 
that the adversaries are are still rather far apart but said it 
is important to keep the eightmonth process going

of war that killed or injured at least 1 million people 
perez de cuellar declined to predict the outcome of the new 
negotiations however he said the mere fact that the foreign 
ministers of iran and iraq agreed to come to geneva showed their 
interest in reaching an agreement 
before leaving tehran early today iranian foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati said iran would not yield in its demand that iraq 
first withdraw its troops from iranian territory 
iran claims that iraqi forces still hold 1065 square miles of 
iranian territory by un estimates however only about 260 
square miles remain under iraqi control 
on tuesday foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq accused iran of 
sabotaging the talks by procrastination maneuvering and 
insincerity and warned that the negotiations could eventually 
collapse he was due in geneva today 
the talks are scheduled to start thursday afternoon at the 
palais des nations the un office in geneva after separate 
meetings between perez de cuellar and each of the two ministers 
the un chief said the duration of the talks depended on the two 
sides

the long island lighting co expects to write 
off about 28 billion in losses if shareholders approve a deal to 
scrap the controversial shoreham nuclear power plant 
the utility announced tuesday that it had received permission 
from the internal revenue service to deduct such losses the irs 
had earlier permitted such a deduction under a deal that collapsed 
last year 
the irs ruling came one day after the nuclear regulatory 
commission staff reported that the 55 billion plant meets all 
federal safety requirements and is operationally ready nrc 
chairman lando zech tentatively set a vote on the fullpower 
license for thursday and all indications are the license will be 
granted 
however the action may be largely symbolic under the latest 
shutdown plan lilco has agreed not to put the license to use until 
its shareholders vote on the negotiated settlement with the new 
york state public service commission the new york and long island 
power authorities and lilcos board of directors 
under the new agreement shoreham would be sold to the state for 
1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of up to 5 
percent to ensure financial stability for the company 
the shareholders must vote on or before june 15 and lilco 
chairman william j catacosinos told the nrc monday that the 
utilitys board will recommend that shareholders approve the deal 
lilco and the state would then seek to have shorehams license 
transferred to the long island power authority the new york power 
authority would oversee decommissioning and dismantling of the 
plant 
the plant was begun more than 20 years ago and finally completed 
in 1985 opponents have battled it with both new york and suffolk 
county officials refusing to participate in emergency planning 
the state and county officials contended that no emergency plan 
would have been workable on long island where the plant is 
situated because of the geography highway system and population 
concentration

by failing that test wright has broken the bond of trust and 
confidence he needs to continue as an effective officer of the 
house 
wright should resign his speakership now 
these are not idle charges if they were 12 members of the 
ethis committee six democrats and six republicans would not 
have voted unanimously to issue its report finding reason to 
believe wright violated the rules 
most important to him wright said is to defend his personal 
reputation and personal honor but only by resigning the 
speakership can he conduct that battle without paralyzing the work 
of congress for weeks and months to come

st louis postdispatch on president bushs education proposals 
for someone who wants to be known as the education president 
george bush has pretty feeble proposals in his first education 
budget 
both in his inaugural address and again last week the president 
declared that the nation has more will than wallet but when it 
comes to making progress in education washington will have to open 
its wallet wider than bush proposes 
the administrations education package has worthwhile goals 
unfortunately to pay for these aims the president proposes 441 
million not much by washington standards and certainly not enough 
to make a dent in any of his targeted areas much less in all of 
them 
instead of throwing pennies at such problems bush would be 
better advised to restore some of the cuts made by the reagan 
administration 
but if bush wants to make his mark on education he will 
have to rethink how much the nation can spend on improving its 
schools and whether it can afford not to

aberdeen sd american news on the minimum wage 
when we first considered the minimum wage issue we thought it 
was obvious that the wage should be raised after reading articles 
from several sources however we discovered there is no easy 
answer 
an american economics association survey found that 90 percent 
of its members agree that a minimum wage increase results in more 
unemployment among young and unskilled workers 
these jobs will be lost because employers will decide to have 
fewer employees since their wages will be higher 
the worst part of this situation is that those the higher wage 
is intended to help those with the fewest job skills will be 
the first to be unemployed 
it is impossible to tell those earning minimum wage that they 
are making enough money but the decision may easily turn into a 
choice between a lowpaying job or no job either way no one wins

the newsreview roseburg ore on housing policies 
there is ample evidence that secretary jack kemps department of 
housing and urban development is fostering a new and important 
spirit of cooperation with congress 
for instance kemp has expressed great interest in a 
comprehensive housing bill introduced in the senate earlier this 
month with broad bipartisan support 
huds new policies emphasize the importance of helping 
lowincome families to work actively toward solving their own 
housing problems rather than being the passive recipients of 
federal largesse 
part of kemps master plan is the creation of federal 
enterprise zones to attract businesses to povertystricken inner 
cities and rural areas 
another important part of the overall housing plan is the 
concept of urban homesteading which enables people living in 
public housing to buy their own homes 
hud is now working on a plan to provide temporary accommodation 
for the homeless in unused federal buildings throughout the nation 
 
these commonsense policies bring selfrespect dignity and 
above all hope to a section of the population which too often 
finds itself trapped in a cycle of despair and poverty

bridgeton nj evening news on the oliver north trial 
its a bit ironic that while he blustered with great macho 
before congress oliver north now plays the part of a meek 
little thing who knew what he did was wrong but didnt know it 
was illegal his crocodile tears now are a bit hard to 
believe 
there is no doubt however that oliver north macho or crybaby 
is the fall guy in the contra case 
while its true that others are still to be tried the top of 
the administration such as former president ronald reagan has 
wiggled out of it the same might be said for president bush 
who while not a major villain in the case apparently had some 
involvement 
north probably didnt know that his blind loyalty would leave 
him holding the bag but the choice was his and none of his 
powerful friends will step forward to serve his time or pay his 
fines if he is convicted

the news and courier charleston sc on mexicos drug war 
its been nearly four years since the mutilated body of us 
drug enforcement agent enrique camarena was found in a shallow 
grave on a remote ranch 60 miles southeast of guadalajara mexico 
overwhelming evidence suggests that camarenas kidnapping 
torture and murder were masterminded by one rafael caro quintero 
reputed to be the boss of one of mexicos five largest drug 
families after many delays the wheels of justice are about to 
catch up with this notorious drug kingpin 
although the mexican federal police considered him a prime 
suspect in camarenas death caro quintero was permitted to 
flee to costa rico four years ago after bribing the regional police 
commander who headed the investigation 
even after he was captured and imprisoned he was treated more 
like a visiting dignitary than a dangerous felon his prison cell 
resembled a hotel suite complete with room service and a telephone 
with which to conduct his business it was a travesty 
the mexican government which has repeatedly vowed to crack down 
on murderous drug dealers can do just that by making an example of 
caro quintero provided he is convicted 
camarenas grieving family which has been patiently waiting for 
his killers to be punished deserves at least that much

the arizona daily star tucson ariz on mexicos corruption 
toppling one reputed mexican drug kingpin will only be valuable 
if it signals a longterm commitment by the mexican government to 
fight corruption and drugs otherwise the names will simply change 
as the status quo continues 
it would clearly be in us interests for mexico to wage a 
continued assault a recent report by secretary of state james a 
baker iii cited mexico as the united states top source for heroin 
and its no 2 source for marijuana 
but it is in mexicos interests as well not just to win 
favorable treatment over international debts and such but because 
of the tremendous social and political costs of corruption all 
nations in which drugs have become big business must fear the sort 
of stranglehold that drug traffickers achieved over the colombian 
government 
elements in the recent arrest of miguel angel felix gallardo 
offer the kinds of encouraging signs the united states has been 
looking for from mexico 
in the past mexican government officials frequently have 
responded testily to us charges of official corruption in 
connection with drug trafficking but last week several 
officials were arrested and mexican attorney general enrique 
alvarez del castillo discussed the corruption aspect 
mexicos president carlos salinas de gortari has frequently 
spoken out against drug trafficking 
but one of mexicos frequent responses to criticism has been 
that it is the united states consumer demand for drugs especially 
the popularity of cocaine that drives the trafficking 
in mexico it will take a great deal of political will and 
skill for president salinas anticorruption efforts to succeed 
in the face of longtime practice if they do work however they 
will benefit both countries institutions and citizens alike

the evening sun baltimore on needleexchange programs 
baltimore mayor kurt schmoke was probably braced for a 
pummeling when he told a washington audience that he favored 
experimental needleexchange programs for drug addicts as a way of 
slowing the spread of aids 
predictably national drug director william j bennett 
obliged by jumping on schmokes remarks with both feet 
it very clearly muddies the message bennett said because 
it sends an ambiguous and ambivalent message about drug use 
while that concern undoubtedly is widely shared bennett is 
hardly the one to complain about officials sending mixed 
messages 
as of last week he had not only snubbed dc mayor marion barry 
by not including him in the announcement of new federal antidrug 
efforts in the nations capital but also planned to exclude 
schmoke from a meeting of local officials called to discuss 
overall policy in the baltimorewashington region 
how bennett expected to run an effective regional campaign 
without the mayors of its two largest cities is anybodys guess 
ultimately even he was forced to recognize the inconsistency of his 
position and open the gathering to both barry and schmoke

honolulu advertiser on the british soccer tragedy 
the weekend tragedy in sheffield england which left an 
incredible 94 dead and more injured is another black mark for the 
good game of soccer 
the ugliness of fan hysteria in britain and other countries 
where soccer excites mindless rivalry contrasts sharply with the 
wholesome youth soccer being developed in america 
here participants are many but spectators few and the big noise 
on the sidelines is parents urging youngsters to greater toughness 
wrong decisions by police were the immediate cause of the 
sheffield disaster but poor stadium design and bad spectator 
habits were the larger culprits

the milwaukee journal on the british soccer tragedy 
a soccer match a time for recreation and merriment instead 
turned into a maelstrom as nearly 100 persons were killed in the 
crush of spectators at a match saturday in sheffield england 
the episode teaches important lessons about both the importance 
and danger of sports and it demonstrates the need for measures to 
prevent a recurrence 
it occurred as fans surged forward in overcrowded stands the 
victims were crushed and suffocated in a terrace or 
standingroomonly pen at the end of the stadium thousands of 
eager excited fans had gathered at the stadium hoping to watch the 
game 
for too many britons sports is also something to fight about 
english soccer clubs were banned from european tournaments in 1985 
after 39 people were killed in belgium when backers of a british 
team rioted during a match with an italian team 
if us sports has been marred by drugs and now possibly 
gambling british soccer has been marred by violence 
while hooliganism in the stands has been an occasional problem 
during football baseball and other games in this country crowd 
control is taken seriously by most bigtime sports executives here 
as it should be it obviously needs to be taken more seriously in

the morning news tribune tacoma wash on pentagon procurement 
the conviction of two teledyne electronics executives for 
their roles in the pentagon procurement scandal sends a clear 
strong signal to other corporation officials they will be held 
accountable when they know about wrongdoing and allow it to 
continue 
the executives found guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud face 
long prison sentences up to 40 years and large fines 
prosecutors argued that the two were aware a consultant was paying 
a navy procurement official for inside information that led to 
teledyne landing a 24 million contract 
the significance of the conviction according to assistant us 
attorney joseph aronica is that it tells executives they cannot 
put things into motion and feign ignorance and attempt to wash 
their hands of guilt 
although the company itself already has agreed to pay 43 
million in penalties this kind of corruption can best be addressed 
by holding the top people personally accountable shareholders end 
up footing the bill for fines prison time however is a real 
attentiongetter

hattiesburg miss american on school drinking water 
a report on the safety of school drinking water released last 
week by the environmental protection agency gives every one of us 
reason for concern federal studies suggest that water from at 
least 10 percent of faucets in each school contains high lead 
levels 20 parts per billion poses a health risk 
whats more the epa said at least 1 million leadcontaminated 
drinking fountains may be operating in us schools some with up 
to 400 times the amount of lead considered safe by the epa 
the culprits are old and new plumbing and drinking fountains 
that are leadlined or have lead solder the danger is particularly 
great in fountains or faucets that are used intermittenly and thus 
allow the water to stand in the pipes as in the case in schools 
the epa is recommending that at least some of the fountains in 
every school in the nation be tested 
this is a potentially serious problem but it is a problem that 
can be dealt with the answer lies in testing those fountains now 
and taking quick action to remove any that reveal dangerous levels 
of lead

companies 
smokers who die from lung cancer and their survivors may sue 
tobacco companies the minnesota supreme court has ruled 
that is not to say these suits have particular merit however 
or that the plaintiffs should be awarded any damages 
john forster 46 died of lung cancer in 1985 but not before 
suing rj reynolds tobacco co for causing his cancer 
the truth of the matter is that john forster had 25 years of 
warnings before he finally died of cancer 
rj reynolds took certain actions that may have led to his 
death its true but so did john forster there is an element of 
personal responsibility here 
perhaps it was not his fault that he became addicted to be 
sure it is not his widows fault we would not deny him or his 
family human compassion 
but we cannot use lawsuits to vent our frustrations or anger at 
the hand we are dealt in life or the hand we draw 
we make mistakes and we live with them and sometimes sadly

members of a private commission that 
recommended federal pay increases said wednesday they are glad 
president bush has proposed a raise for judges but disappointed he 
did not also call for more money for members of congress and top 
government officials 
we were disappointed by what he decided to do right now 
political scientist norman ornstein told the house committee on 
post office and civil service at a hearing on recommendations of 
the national commission on the public service 
it is quite clear the president doesnt want to grapple with 
the situation in the aftermath of what happened in january and 
february ornstein said he is trying to find ways simply not 
to look at the mess right now 
before leaving office in january former president reagan 
approved a government commissions recommendation calling for a 50 
percent increases for judges members of congress and high federal 
officials the proposal aroused a storm of public criticism and was 
rejected by congress in february 
the private commission also recommended raises for all three 
branches of government in a report submitted to bush on march 29 
the president however proposed a 25 percent hike for judges only 
in an ethics proposal he unveiled april 12 he put off the question 
of other increases 
former federal reserve chairman paul volcker now chairman of 
the private commission said we welcome the presidents 
initiative in respect to raising the pay of federal judges we 
believe however that increases are essential for the other 
branches as well 
pay for the public servants of government must rank 
substantially higher in the range of governments budget 
priorities volcker told the committee 
ornstein said that on the basis of the commissions meeting with 
bush when they submitted their report he believed that before 
long he will want to work out something that will cut across all 
branches 
rep william ford dmich chairman of the house committee 
said while much debate has focused on the role which 
compensation plays in the governments ability to recruit and 
retain the recommendations of the commission are much broader in 
scope than a single plug for a pay raise for executives judges or 
anyone else 
volcker told the committee that it would be a misreading of 
our intention and conclusions to place undue emphasis on one area 
such as pay to the exclusion of others 
one of the most important things he said is a recommendation 
that cabinet officers and agency heads be given greater 
flexibility to administer their organizations in short we 
urge greater delegation of personnel authority and easier 
procedures for hiring and firing 
the commission also called for a partial but decisive 
reversal of the trend extending over many years for an increased 
number of political appointees now standing at over 3000 in 
the executive branch

large doses of fish oil can relieve mild high 
blood pressure and may work as well as some commonly used 
prescription drugs a study concludes 
many claims have been made about the seeming benefits of fish 
oil on the heart and circulatory system but convincing data to 
back up these beliefs have been scarce and many experts remain 
dubious 
the latest study conducted on 32 white males provides some of 
the strongest evidence yet to support at least one of fish oils 
reputed merits 
fish oil seemed to work about as well as two mainstays of blood 
pressure therapy diuretics and the betablocker drug propranolol 
however the amounts taken were much higher than the doses 
usually suggested by manufacturers of widely advertised brands of 
fish oil capsules in fact when taken at the recommended doses 
the oil did not change the subjects blood pressure 
other studies have suggested that fish oil can prevent heart 
disease by repairing damaged arteries lowering dangerously high 
cholesterol levels and slowing the bloods tendency to clot 
drs howard r knapp and garrett a fitzgerald the researchers 
who conducted the latest study at vanderbilt university have been 
among fish oil skeptics 
both said they were surprised to find that it seemed to work 
but they cautioned that people should not exchange their blood 
pressure pills for fish oil until doctors know more about its 
effectiveness and safety 
for the time being we are taking a cautious approach and not 
recommending it as a therapy for high blood pressure knapp said 
in an interview certainly i wouldnt throw away my propranolol 
and start taking fish oil instead 
at bostons beth israel hospital dr richard pasternak said 
doctors should wait for the results of several large studies now 
under way before making up their minds about fish oil 
however he added this research is consistent with other 
experimental evidence and this is an important break in that 
regard 
fish oil is not not the drug of choice for treating 
hypertension but the study shows that that dietary change can 
markedly reduce our risk of high blood pressure said dr mark 
milner of washington hospital center 
according to the latest report published in thursdays new 
england journal of medicine a month of fish oil lowered the mens 
average blood pressure from the starting point of 139 over 94 to 
132 over 90 
however to achieve this they had to take three tablespoons of 
herring oil daily the oil which caused belching and a lingering 
fishy aftertaste is not widely available because it spoils quickly 
the amount taken is the equivalent of 50 fish oil gel capsules 
like those sold in supermarkets and drug stores knapp said taking 
this many capsules is not practical because big doses of them often 
cause stomach upset 
the doctors also caution that people should not substitute cod 
liver oil which contains too much vitamin a and d and not enough 
omega3 fatty acids oily ocean fish such as herring and mackerel 
are rich in omega3 fatty acids the particular variety of fish oil 
that appears to be good for the heart 
the herring oil used in the study was about 30 percent omega3 
the doctors noted that more concentrated kinds of fish oil are 
becoming available that may allow people to get fish oils benefits 
while taking less 
the latest research opens the possibility that this type of 
therapy may ultimately find a place in the treatment of high blood 
pressure said fitzgerald its an important first step in that 
direction 
the researchers cautioned that more study will also be needed to 
see if fish oil lowers blood pressure for blacks and women as well 
as for white men

west german media have stumbled 
through an awkward observance of adolf hitlers birth 100 years 
ago reflecting a hesitance among many to come to grips with the 
oncerevered fuehrer 
the unsavory anniversary has been noted in a disjointed series 
of newspaper portraits historical analyses and opinion polls that 
explain only pieces of the phenomenon that brought death for 
millions during world war ii and the holocaust and the enduring 
division of europe 
one radio network in hesse state planned a discussion of 
residual rightwing extremist tendencies for thursdays anniversary 
of hitlers birth in the austrian village of braunau on west 
germanys southern border 
but other media seemed more poised to react to expected 
demonstrations by the neonazi fringe than to put the occasion into 
perspective for a nation still branded by crimes committed before 
many people were born 
the zdf television network announced two months ago it would not 
have any documentaries on the anniversary which it said was not 
the right day to remember a criminal 
newspapers and magazines across the entire political spectrum 
have made virtually no mention of plans by neonazi leaders like 
michael kuehnen to celebrate hitlers centennial 
federal officials in the capital have been careful to avoid 
discussion of the infamous occasion 
interior ministry spokesman michaelandreas butz was asked what 
steps federal forces have taken to ensure the safety of potential 
targets of neonazi actions we have taken adequate precautions 
where needed he replied declining to elaborate 
among the press reviews of hitlers role in german history the 
most comprehensive and critical analysis has been offered by der 
spiegel magazine 
the glossy weekly devoted its april 10 cover and 20 pages to try 
to explain the terrorist of the century and how he has affected 
todays germany 
spiegel published in detail the results of a nationwide opinion 
poll conducted in march by the respected emnid institute of 
bielefeld 
responses by the 2200 west germans polled indicated widespread 
uncertainty about how to assess hitler as well as some worrisome 
indications of latent antisemitism and positive views toward the 
dictator 
an astounding 38 percent of those polled replied yes to the 
question if not for the war and the holocaust would hitler have 
been a great german statesman 
the poll also revealed that 46 percent of the respondents said 
by the emnid institute to represent accurately west german voters 
consider the third reich to have had some positive influences 
asked to evaluate their attitude toward jews in west germany 18 
percent described their views as negative and 33 percent chose zero 
on the scale that ranged from minus 5 for very negative attitudes 
to plus 5 for very positive 
the complex bundle of nationalist feelings carried by many west 
germans was illustrated by reaction to the statement i am proud 
to be a german to which only 27 percent of the respondents fully 
agreed 
the poll also suggested that most west germans believe the 
division of germany is permanent and that more than two thirds of 
the respondents would like to be done with the past 
quick a weekly picture magazine also carried a photo essay on 
hitler and his legacy with similar poll results indicating strong 
pockets of rightwing extremism in west germany and substantial 
numbers of citizens 18 percent who believe their nation was 
better off under the third reich 
frankfurter rundschau newspaper reported a few days earlier that 
two west german journalists have written the first book since the 
fall of the nazi dictatorship to examine how the german press aided 
hitlers rise to power and his march through europe 
other prominent newspapers carried recent articles by historians 
and jurists recounting hitlers dictatorship and contrasting it 
with a recent rise in ultrarightist politics 
the leftleaning magazine tempo reported wednesday it had 
learned of plans by extremists to break windows at jewishowned 
businesses send aloft a helium balloon emblazoned with the 
forbidden swastika and to lay a wreath at the moenchengladbach 
birthplace of nazi propaganda minister josef goebbels 
tempo spokesman carleduard meyer told the associated press the 
magazine decided to report the details to alert possible victims 
not to inform wouldbe agitators 
austrian police prepared to seal off access to hitlers 
birthplace in the village of braunau to prevent incidents 
but butz the west german interior ministry spokesman said 
police reported only throngs of journalists at the scene as of 
midday wednesday

calling for fresh thinking on resolving 
the middle east conflict president bush said today that he and 
jordans king hussein agreed to work toward the structuring of a 
serious negotiating process to achieve an arabisraeli 
settlement 
bush issued the statement after a meeting of more than an hour 
with hussein 
the two then traveled by helicopter to mount vernon va for a 
tour of the home of george washington and a boat ride on the 
potomac river 
with hussein standing at his side bush said his majesty 
committed jordan to this task and i commit the united states to 
this task 
the time has come to encourage fresh thinking to avoid 
sterile debate and to focus on the difficult but critical work of 
structuring a serious negotiating process he added 
bush said that during the meeting he reaffirmed his view that 
properly designed and mutually acceptable elections in the west 
bank and gaza strip could as an initial step help lead to 
negotiations on the final status of the territories 
he added that the united states remains committed to bringing 
about a comprehensive settlement through negotiations based on un 
resolutions which establish the principle of peace for israel in 
return for israeli withdrawal from occupied territories 
hussein in turn praised the united states for opening a 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization and said that 
this coupled with the plos renunciation of terrorism last 
december had improved prospects for peace 
he expressed hope for more flexibility on israels part 
peace can neither be negotiated nor achieved without plo 
participation hussein said 
both leaders expressed support for the concept of a united 
nationssponsored conference on middle east with bush emphasizing 
the longstanding us view that any such conference should 
facilitate direct negotiations between the parties 
earlier while the two posed for photographers in the oval 
office hussein was asked whether the time is ripe for a 
breakthrough in the peace process 
i believe it is he said its never been as ripe as now 
before the talks bush was hopeful that hussein would show 
interest in an israeli proposal for ending the negotiating impasse 
through elections in the west bank and gaza strip 
asked whether his optimistic statements meant he was supporting 
the israeli plan hussein said not necessarily 
later a senior administration official said hussein certainly 
did not rject the idea of palestinian elections in the occupied 
territories 
the official who declined to be identified said hussein 
expressed some concerns about the israeli proposal but felt 
however reassured and encouraged about the directions after bush 
and secretary of state james a baker iii explained the us 
approach 
jordans role in the middle east peace process has diminished 
considerably since last summer when hussein severed administrative 
and legal ties with palestinians living in the west bank 
but a senior us official who briefed reporters on tuesday said 
jordans proximity to the west bank makes a jordanian role in 
resolving the palestinian issue inevitable 
there is no way in the world that one can conceive of a peace 
process moving forward without the active involvement of king 
hussein said the official insisting on anonymity 
after a morning meeting with bush and a luncheon with vice 
president dan quayle hussein was to be guest of honor at a white 
house dinner tonight meetings with congressional leaders also were 
on his schedule 
two weeks ago israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir proposed 
during a visit here that palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
strip elect representatives to negotiate with israel on limited 
selfgovernment 
the bush administration has endorsed the proposal on the 
condition that the elections lead to negotiations on the final 
status of the two territories 
the senior us official said the proposal represents an attempt 
to end the impasse in the arabisraeli conflict 
were talking about trying to get things off dead center 
which is where we find the situation in the middle east at the 
present time the official said and we see in the elections 
proposal depending on how it is developed and fleshed out the 
possibility of turning a situation from a conflict situation to one 
of greater political dialogue 
the palestine liberation organization has expressed support for 
elections only if they are preceded by the withdrawal of israeli 
troops 
the senior official described hussein as a valued friend of 
the united states and noted that the administration has proposed an 
increase in military sales to jordan from 10 million to 48 
million next year economic assistance would rise from 15 million 
to 35 million 
jordan administered the west bank until 1967 when israel seized 
the territory during the middle east war but until last summer 
jordan continued to play a dominant role in the area paying the 
salaries of thousands of municipal employees there and funding a 
sizeable aid program 
husseins decision to dismantle jordans ties with the west bank 
was widely interpreted as a challenge to the plo which has long 
demanded total control of the territory

the government said today that a third 
bomb has been found in the investigation of two alleged palestinian 
terrorists and that the case may be linked to the bombing of pan am 
flight 103 
the federal parliaments news service said in a brief report 
that the latest bomb discovered in the probe was hidden in a 
television set in an apartment in the duesseldorf suburb of neuss 
there is a possible connection between the bomb found 
thursday and the crash of the jet over the scottish city of 
lockerbie on dec 21 the news report said without elaborating 
no one answered the telephone at the parliament information office 
tonight when the ap called for more details 
the bomb was found by police in a followup search of the 
apartment thursday said alexander prechtel spokesman for the 
federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe but he said suggestions 
linking the palestinian case and the pan am bombing that killed 270 
people are nothing but speculation 
the bomb discovered in the television set was seized from the 
same apartment where two other explosive devices disguised to look 
like electronics equipment were found last week prechtel said 
one of those bombs hidden in a radio blew up monday at the 
wiesbaden headquarters of the federal police force while two 
disposal experts were trying to disarm it officer hansjuergen 
sonntag 35 died of his injuries from the blast and a 29yearold 
colleague who has not yet been publicly identified remained in 
critical condition at a frankfurt hospital today 
an employee of the federal police force the bundeskriminalamt 
said there was no one available tonight to answer questions about 
the case 
the palestinians alleged members of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command were arrested in october 
in what police called the biggest weapons bust in the nations 
history 
british investigators probing the pan am bombing over lockerbie 
scotland have said the plane was blown up in the sky by plastic 
explosives hidden in a radiocassette player 
a radiobomb containing the same czechoslovakmade plastic 
explosives was among the weapons seized during the october raid 
and authorities confirmed that the bomb that blew up monday also 
appeared to have been hidden in a radio 
the pan am investigation has been handled by west german 
officials with extreme caution because of persistent british and 
us media reports saying that the bomb was planted on the aircraft 
in frankfurt 
asked about the parliament news service report prechtel 
disputed its suggestion that the probe of the two suspected agents 
of the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command has turned up indications those suspects were involved with 
the lockerbie disaster 
i know about that being said but that is nothing but 
speculation he said they cant say its not connected so 
they speculate that it is but we have no evidence that it is 
connected to lockerbie only the theoretic possibility exists 
police arrested 14 suspects in the october raids but only two 
hafez kassem dalkamoni and abdul fattah ghandanfar remain in 
custody 
prechtel said authorities expected to file charges against the 
two within a few months they are suspected of forming terrorist 
cells in west germany illegal possession of weapons and bomb 
attacks on us military trains in august 1987 and april 1988 
prechtel said

some victims of a clash between georgian 
protesters and soviet troops were poisoned by an unknown chemical 
substance the official government daily izvestia reported today 
izvestia quoted a commission investigating the april 9 clash 
which left at least 20 proindependence demonstrators dead in the 
georgian capital of tbilisi 
the report followed widespread allegations that poison gas was 
used to crush the demonstration 
the georgian health minister irakliy menagarishvili told 
izvestia the countrys leading toxicologists believed the substance 
used on protesters had an irritating and atropinelike effect 
atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid that in large doses 
can induce nerve paralysis and delirium it can cause death through 
combined cardiac and respiratory failure 
but a foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh asked at a 
briefing today whether nerve gas was used said that was impossible 
because it is a combat weapon 
izvestia did not specify how many of 138 patients still 
hospitalized tuesday had symptoms of poisoning nor did it say if 
any of the deaths were caused by chemicals 
georgian activists claim several people have died from the 
effects of poison gas they also allege military authorities 
refused to identify the substance or tell doctors how to treat 
affected patients 
the communist party daily pravda quoted an interior ministry 
official today as saying soldiers used tear gas in the clashes it 
said the official who was not identified made the acknowledgement 
on georgian state television 
unfortunately this crucial admission came several days late 
and was made only after the level of passions had reached the 
highest degree pravda said 
but pravda also quoted a military spokesman as saying troops 
could not have used tear gas because it is not part of their 
standard equipment 
six newly elected deputies to the congress of peoples deputies 
called today for the soviet union to develop better laws to control 
troops and public officials to prevent a repeat of the tragedy 
the six whose joint letter was published in the weekly moscow 
news had just returned from a trip to georgia 
under the headline what has happened once should not be 
repeated the letter called for material gathered by a commission 
investigating the incident to be released to the new congress of 
peoples deputies which meets for the first time may 25 
the commissions findings could become the basis for laws that 
truly genuinely will be defending perestroika it said 
referring to president mikhail s gorbachevs reform drives 
the deputies also criticized the strict censorship that was 
imposed on journalists in tbilisi 
why and by whom is the decision always taken that at moments 
of sharp confrontations its appropriate to turn off glasnost 
just like you turn off the electricity when theres an emergency 
the letter asked 
foreign reporters have been barred from georgia since the clash 
the deputies accused officials of covering up soldiers use of 
gas they also said local leaders failed to adequately warn 
protesters that troops were about to move in and failed to brief 
soldiers on how to behave 
the deputies all elected from the union of cinema workers are 
mikhail belikov boris vasiliev alexander gelman dmitry lunkov

the bush administration should create a 
special agency to steer highpriority energy projects such as 
power plant or pipeline construction around legal and regulatory 
obstacles an energy organization said wednesday 
in a broad assessment of american energy prospects the united 
states energy association said the special agency could enhance the 
nations energy security by eliminating what it called 
unnecessarily long lead times for major projects 
it said the agency could be fashioned along the lines of the 
energy mobilization board proposed by thenpresident carter as part 
of a 1979 energy program the board was never created 
jack bowen first vice chairman of the energy association said 
in presenting the proposal to the groups annual meeting that a 
mobilization board would enable project developers to sidestep 
unnecessary legal and regulatory obstacles 
what it means is that no one can kill you with regulatory 
delays he said it goes up or down on its merits the lawyers 
may not like it but its something weve got to do 
bowens group is comprised of about 100 private and public 
energyrelated organizations whose members represent virtually 
every segment of the energy industry 
among the groups other recommendations 
develop an integrated national energy strategy 
increase energy conservation encourage greater energy 
efficiency and expand the use of renewable energy sources 
increase domestic oil and natural gas production and increase 
the use of natural gas and coal as a means of reducing the nations 
reliance on foreign oil 
encourage the construction of nuclear power plants 
henson moore the energy departments deputy secretary said in 
a speech to the association that the department was moving to 
fashion a comprehensive energy strategy but that it might not be 
ready by the target date of april 1990

ladies nights which offer women 
reduced prices to attract business violate laws against sex 
discrimination the iowa supreme court said wednesday 
although the ruling was based on a promotion at a greyhound 
racing track legal experts said the ruling could have major 
implications for restaurants theaters and other businesses that 
offer discounts to members of one sex 
the high court ordered the reinstatement of a lawsuit against 
bluffs run a council bluffs dog racing track 
by giving women free admission and discounted prices on 
concessions bluffs run discriminated against men in the furnishing 
of its facilities and services the court said in its unanimous 
opinion 
the iowa west racing association operator of bluffs run 
offered a ladies day promotion every wednesday from june to 
september 1987 women received free admission into the grandstand 
and got discounted prices on food drinks and souvenirs 
a track customer charles ladd sued the track after he was 
refused the same discounts he sought an injunction forcing the 
track to halt ladies night promotions but it resisted 
track officials argued that the promotions were simply to 
attract business they said ladd wasnt denied services but simply 
required to pay the normal price 
the high court dismissed that reasoning saying lawmakers were 
clearly trying to ban unfair discrimination and courts should 
interpret that broadly it conceded that the intent of the 
promotions wasnt to discriminate 
we can conceive of no way to differentiate between an 
accidentally discriminatory promotional scheme and a prohibited 
discriminatory practice without eviscerating the statute the 
court said 
the iowa high court said other states have addressed the issue 
such promotions have been banned in california and allowed in 
illinois it noted 
a spokeswoman at the council bluffs track said wednesday no one 
was available to comment on the decision 
womens rights activists praised the decision 
if we want to be equal weve got to pay our way said state 
rep minnette doderer diowa city 
lawrence pope a drake university law professor said the ruling 
could be applied to theaters restaurants all kinds of places

folk singer pete seeger helped lead the festive noon march by at 
least 250 people holding white dove placards and singing down by 
the riverside the march spanned four blocks from the hoffmans 
childhood home to the service at temple emanuel which the activist 
attended as a child 
on arrival at the synagogue the marchers were met by nearly 
1000 people who filled the building with the overflow listening 
outside via loudspeakers 
seeger opened the service with a reprise of down by the 
riverside changing the first line to abbies spirit is living 
still 
jack hoffman 49 wore what he called his brothers most prized 
possession a green boston celtics jacket and among the marchers 
was hoffmans close friend basketball star bill walton 
a coroner said wednesday that hoffman 52 died from a 
combination of drugs and alcohol he was found dead at his home 
near new hope pa on april 12 
i just think he took a little too many pills and he took a 
good slug of booze jack hoffman said after hearing the coroners 
ruling my brother had a very strong love and affection for me 
and he wouldnt have left me alone like this 
friends began gathering on the front porch of the hoffman home 
this morning including eron kay a yippie who made a name for 
himself by throwing pies in faces of public officials and jay 
severan a republican political consultant who had come from new 
york city 
abbie was my hero said severan in a gray suit and 
overcoat he was the first and best media consultant i ever 
knew 
a balding jerry rubin also wearing a gray suit said before the 
march i feel very sad of course but abbies spirit lives on 
abbie was an unbelievable person 
i think abbies beliefs will prevail said rubin who like 
hoffman was one of the chicago seven defendants what abbie 
believed in the 80s was empowerment too bad he wont be around to 
see it 
abbie was a man who had guts said kay attired in tiedyed 
tshirt with a yippie pin stuck in his hat knit of 
rainbowcolored wool he was a true patriot 
kay also said he found it hard to accept a coroners ruling that 
hoffman died of an overdose of barbituates mixed with alcohol 
its the same line they gave for jimi hendrix and janis 
joplin he said 
coroner thomas rosko said the autopsy uncovered the residue of 
about 150 pills several times the lethal dose even without the 
presence of alcohol in addition rosko said hoffmans blood 
alcohol level was 20 twice the legal limit in pennsylvania 
i think it is likely that he literally fell asleep and died in 
his sleep other than that what occurred in his last hours is 
strictly speculation the coroner said 
phenobarbital is a longacting sedative and an anticonvulsant 
but jack hoffman denied his brother was suicidal despite having 
earlier admitted that founder of the yippie movement had been 
showing signs of disenchantment in recent months 
hoffman was a manicdepressive who often washed down medication 
with whiskey his brother said 
abbie as many of you know was somewhat careless with pills 
and we always warned him about this kind of thing he said 
hoffman said the family has received hundreds of letters 
telegrams and condolence calls from friends entertainers and even 
foreign embassies but declined to identify individuals 
abbie hoffman rose to prominence with the chicago seven a group 
of radicals tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the 1968 
democratic national convention in chicago 
he went underground in 1974 to avoid trial on cocaine possession 
charges and emerged nearly seven years later saying he had lived 
in upstate new york and undergone plastic surgery

world chess champion garri kasparov won 
his adjourned 16th round game wednesday in the chess world cup and 
closed to a halfpoint of the leader ljubomir ljubojevic of 
yugoslavia with one round left 
in the endgame kasparov playing black outmaneuvered spanish 
grandmaster miguel illescas facing an unstoppable checkmate 
illescas resigned 
with the 17th and final round scheduled for thursday ljubojevic 
has 10 points out of a possible 15 and may become the first player 
in 7 years to score more points than kasparov in a competition 
kasparov 26 is in second place with 10 points another soviet 
grandmaster valery salov is third with 9 points 
before the tournament the big question was whether kasparov 
would put in a wonderful performance and push his rating above 
bobby fischer to become the highest ranked player in history 
said leontxo garcia a spanish chess commentator now the 
question is whether kasparov will be able to catch ljubojevic 
in the final round ljubojevic 38 will play with the 
disadvantageous black pieces against british grandmaster nigel 
short the thirdranked player in the world while kasparov will 
face off with white against former world champion boris spassky of 
france 
but kasparov is likely to face difficulties in facing spassky 
who has the reputation of one of the hardest players to defeat a 
win scores one point and a draw a half point 
the world cup a series of six tournaments held over two years 
featuring a prize fund of 12 million is regarded as the second 
most important event in chess after the individual world 
championship 
each of 25 eligible grandmasters plays in four of the six 
competitions the barcelona event is fourth in the cycle 
kasparov won the second and thrid events in belfort france and 
iceland and is leading the competition former world champion 
anatoly karpov who won the first tournament in brussels belgium 
is in second place 
if kasparov defeats spassky and ljubojevic only draws with 
short they will tie for first place in the tournament 
but a draw in his game thursday will be enough to give 
ljubojevic a victory in the separate world cup points table 
because illescas is only competing in barcelona as a representative 
of the host country and is not eligible for the world cup 
when the world cup calculations are made all results against 
illescas will be taken out ljubojevic who drew illescas in the 
eighth round will have a halfpoint deducted from his final score 
and kasparov will lose a whole point 
kasparov has trailed in barcelona from the start he scored only 
two draws in his first three games going down in the third round 
to soviet grandmaster artur yusupov 
in the other game completed wednesday alexander belyavsky of 
the soviet union defeated us grandmaster yasser seirawan 
the final round will feature a battle between salov 24 and 
viktor korchnoi a 58yearold soviet defector who plays for 
switzerland korchnoi is fourth with nine points a halfpoint 
behind salov

president bush and jordans king hussein 
agreed wednesday to strive for a serious negotiating process 
for middle east peace and the united states said the monarch did 
not reject an israeli proposal for palestinian elections in the 
west bank and gaza 
after the two leaders talked for more than an hour at the white 
house the administration expressed satisfaction over husseins 
statment to bush that i fully support you and all your efforts 
husseins visit marked the end of the first round of middle east 
diplomacy for bush following talks earlier this month with egypts 
president hosni mubarak and israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
as he had done with the two others bush played tour guide for 
the king 
he took hussein by helicopter to mount vernon va to visit the 
home of george washington overlooking the potomac river they 
returned to the capital on a yacht confiscated from drug merchants 
and now owned by the navy 
standing alongside hussein in a rose garden ceremony bush said 
the time has come to encourage fresh thinking to avoid sterile 
debate and to focus on the difficult but critical work of 
structuring a serious negotiating process 
his majesty committed jordan to this task and i commit the 
united states to this task bush said 
the administration said the next step was to develop shamirs 
proposal for the 17 million palestinians in the occupied 
territories to elect representatives to negotiate with israel on 
limited selfgovernment 
the united states has endorsed the proposal on the condition 
that the elections lead to negotiations on the final status of the 
territories 
deputy assistant secretary of state ned walker told congress 
that the united states wants a timetable from israel by july for 
the elections 
but he said that serious difficulties remain over what kind 
of elections would be held and which palestinians would agree to 
take part 
walker said it should not matter to israel whether candidates 
are cardcarrying members of the palestine liberation organization 
shamir has ruled out negotiating with the plo which he holds 
responsibile for the violence that has wracked the occupied 
territories 
it shouldnt matter what the labels are walker told the 
house foreign operations subcommittee as long as the participants 
are willing to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict with israel 
in his public remarks bush said that properly designed and 
mutually acceptable elections could as an initial step contribute 
to a political process leading to negotiations on the final status 
of the west bank and gaza 
bush also reiterated his guarded support for an international 
peace conference as a step toward direct negotiations 
hussein did not publicly mention the israeli election proposal 
but a senior administration official said he certainly did not 
reject the idea 
the official who declined to be named said hussein expressed 
some concerns about the elections 
the official said however that the king felt reassured and 
encouraged about the directions after having heard the president 
and secretary of state james a baker iii explain our approach 
the official said hussein said he would try to work with 
others in order to ensure that ideas which could advance the 
prospects for peace in the middle east were not dismissed 
prematurely the plo said any elections must be preceded by the 
withdrawal of israeli forces from the territories 
in his remarks hussein praised the united states for beginning 
a dialogue with the plo late last year 
i hope this will prompt israel to respond similarly to the 
requirements of peace and recognize the legitimate representative 
of the palestinian people 
peace can neither be negotiated nor achieved without plo 
participation hussein said 
the kings involvement in the peace process has diminished 
considerably since last summer when he severed administrative and 
legal ties with palestinians in the west bank 
on capitol hill walker said hussein would have to be an 
integral part of future peace talks because of his countrys 
geographic historic and demographic links with the west bank 
the united states continues to believe that the most 
realistic solution for the future of the west bank which jordan 
and israel have each governed at different times over the last 40 
years is some sort of association with jordan 
the united states which opposes israeli sovereignty over the 
land but also rejects establishment of a palestinian state there 
proposed in 1982 that the west bank become a jordanianpalestinian 
confederation

police is a branch of the attorney generals office 
we have no information for the time being he said 
ciudad obregon is 120 miles north of salcidos hometown of los 
mochis 
the arrest came a day after california authorities reported 
numerous possible sightings of salcido 
services were being held in glen ellen calif today for some 
of the six members of salcidos family who were killed about 300 
people attended a memorial service tuesday for another of the 
victims tracy toovey twenty sheriffs deputies attended to keep

public broadcasting is a highly costeffective 
way of helping solve national problems corporation for public 
broadcasting officials said wednesday in defending a request for 
increased program funds and money to replace an aging satellite 
corporation president donald ledwig told a house appropriations 
subcommittee that every dollar of federal funding to the 
organization now attracts nearly 6 in donations in corporate and 
audience donations 
ledwig also cited educational programs on public radio and 
television and the 13000 hours a year in programming for the 
classroom that now reach 101 million tv viewers and more than 10 
million radio listeners each week 
now is not the time to retreat he said when the public 
looks increasingly to public broadcasting to meet its needs for 
quality programming 
he said that each federal dollar spent on an aids awareness 
program for example might save this committee thousands of 
dollars treating that patient 
the corporation for public broadcasting is a private nonprofit 
organization created by congress to support public broadcasting it 
passes on about 71 percent of its operating budget to public radio 
and television stations it gets its federal money two years in 
advance and is seeking 265 million for fiscal 1992 
the bush administration wants to freeze the corporations 
appropriation at the 1991 level of 242 million and not provide any 
new money to replace a 10yearold satellite that is expected to 
die in 1991 
congress has authorized 200 million for the satellite but has 
appropriated just 568 million of that amount in 1991 
ledwig said failure to replace the satellite would have a severe 
impact on programming funds that would have to be diverted to 
satellite construction 
he also said congressional support for the full 265 million 
request is critical if cpb is to continue to increase the high 
standards of public broadcasting and to tap deeper into the 
potential that it holds for addressing many of this nations most 
pressing problems 
if the budget is frozen which means a cut when inflation is 
counted the corporation loses the 6 in donations for each dollar 
cut ledwig said 
federal funds are the key dollars that bring in the others 
he said 
outlining something of a domino effect ledwig said that if the 
corporations budget is cut we start losing quality of the 
programming we start losing audience and we start losing 
contributions 
the three subcommittee members in attendance each praised public 
broadcasting but said it would be very difficult to increase 
spending given the current federal budget pinch 
subcommittee chairman william natcher dky asked how ledwig 
could justify a request for a 95 percent spending hike 
ledwig said the corporation was acutely aware of the 
competing demands on congress for federal dollars 
i believe however that federal support for public 
broadcasting is one of the most costeffective means to address a 
number of critical problems facing the nation today 
he said the corporations 43 percent for administrative costs 
was the lowest of any agency in the government 
rep neal smith diowa said he thought public broadcasters may 
be trying to mimic commercial television by paying high salaries to 
onair personalities and 15000 appearance fees to guests 
smith was particularly concerned that louis rukeyser host of 
the popular wall street week program was being paid in six 
figures 
can you justify giving sombody three times as much salary 
than we pay a supreme court justice smith asked 
ledwig said the show does not receive any funds from the 
corporation

pope john paul ii prayed for poland on wednesday as 
lech walesa his solidarity union made legal again by the communist 
government arrived to seek economic aid for his country and thank 
the pontiff for his help 
at his public audience john paul said in a prayer for success 
of his homelands new political course 
i pray to you lady of jasna gora the country will have 
new possibilities and that transformations will take place in the 
social political economic and moral life of the entire society 
his reference was to polands holiest shrine 
solidarity which walesa founded in 1980 as the soviet blocs 
first independent trade union regained official status monday 
walesa had a symbolic reconciliation tuesday with the polish 
leader gen wojciech jaruzelski who declared martial law in 
december 1981 to crush solidarity 
at leonardo da vinci airport he told reporters there is a 
great accord between society and the government it is a political 
victory for all of us in polish society but for this victory to be 
complete we now have to take care of real issues and to get down to 
work together 
the polish government agreed in two months of negotiations with 
an opposition delegation led by solidarity to legalize the union 
and create a freely elected senate as a second house of the sejm 
or parliament 
poland hopes the result will be financial help from the west and 
solidaritys cooperation in confronting the national economic 
crisis 
walesa met with bishop fiorenzo angelini chief of the vatican 
medical mission and thanked him for aid the office gave solidarity 
medical programs angelini pledged another 30000 
later walesa attended a crowded mass celebrated by four polish 
bishops at st marian in trastevere church as the faithful 
received communion two people unfurled a redandwhite solidarity 
banner 
the solidarity leader has said he wants to encourage western aid 
for poland during his threeday visit to italy which includes 
meetings with politicians and labor leaders 
in john pauls first public comment on the legalization of 
solidarity the pontiff prayed wednesday that all involved in 
polands new political course would continue to demonstrate the 
courage wisdom and calm indispensable to serving the public good 
addressing the madonna of jasna gora he said today i want to 
thank you oh mother for all the good that has grown from the 
experiences of that period when solidarity was suppressed and 
outlawed 
i give to your maternal care solidarity which today after 
the new legalization of april 17 can return to activity 
walesa said he would ask john paul on thursday to give his 
blessing to this difficult task of reform and said the pope has 
always been with us 
john paul warmly endorsed solidarity when he met walesa in 
january 1981 at the vatican the pontiff and the shipyard 
electrician met again during papal trips to poland in 1983 the 
year walesa won the nobel peace prize and 1987 
the church is a major force in poland a devoutly roman catholic 
country despite its communist government and church 
representatives participated in the negotiations 
in a clear illustration of solidaritys change in status the 
polish ambassador to italy met walesa at the airport

the christian army commander gen michel 
aoun said wednesday the united states was involved in a 
conspiracy of silence by failing to halt syrian attacks on 
lebanons christian heartland 
aoun addressed about 1200 christians who braved intermittent 
rocket and artillery barrages and marched to the presidential 
palace in suburban baabda to support aouns war of liberation 
against syrias 40000 troops in lebanon 
christian parliamentarians have called for a ceasefire in the 
fighting with the syrians and their druse moslem militia allies 
but the demonstrators rejected the suggestion highlighting a 
split in the christian camp the demonstrators burned an effigy of 
syrian president hafez assad and chanted death to assad 
police say 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded since the 
latest round of fighting flared march 8 most victims have been 
civilians 
several rounds of rocket and mortar fire struck christian east 
beirut and moslem west beirut on wednesday but there were no 
reports of casualties 
only a handful of people ventured outside and radio stations 
said the relative calm was no more than a warriors rest 
americas secretary of state says the united states is 
incapable of doing anything to help lebanon this is the plot 
america is not incapable but america is taking part in a 
conspiracy of silence regarding the destruction of lebanon by 
syria aoun said 
he was commenting on secretary of state james a baker iiis 
remarks tuesday before the senate foreign relations committee 
baker said we make a lot of statements and sometimes it is 
frustrating to think that is really about all we can do 
i dont know what else frankly we can do we have scant 
influence with the syrians baker said 
aoun said sarcastically maybe syria has become so powerful 
that america is scared of it 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the united states would support any efforts by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to help negotiate a 
ceasefire 
france which has close ties to the lebanese and ruled the 
country until 1943 suggested perez de cuellar travel to syria or 
tunisia to work out a ceasefire the un chief said he was not 
considering any such initiative as long as efforts by the 22member 
arab league continue 
the latest hostilities broke out after aoun ordered a blockade 
of militiarun ports that deprive the treasury of 100 million a 
year in tax revenue 
druse warlord walid jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 
310squaremile christian enclave the syrians later joined the 
shelling 
beirut and its surroundings have been without electricity since 
sunday when power plants ran out of fuel oil the stations also 
have been severely damaged in the bombardments 
water supplies also have stopped bread and other vital 
commodities have become scarce the shortages and shelling have 
forced thousands of people to flee to south and east lebanon or 
leave the country altogether 
the french navy ship rance carried 78 severely wounded lebanese 
to larnaca cyprus on wednesday fiftythree of the casualties 
were flown to paris aboard a special french hospital plane the 
others needed another day of quiet before they could be moved 
doctors said

the chairman of a house foreign operations 
panel on wednesday questioned us aid to israel in light of 
incidents in which israeli soldiers have shot fleeing palestinian 
demonstrators in the back 
when is that stupid practice going to end asked david obey 
dwis who heads the house subcommittee on foreign operations 
which appropriates foreign aid money 
i dont want to take responsibility for giving one dime to a 
country whose military forces are firing at people in retreat 
obey said angrily at a hearing on the bush administrations 1990 
aid request for israel and other middle eastern countries 
it is rare for a congressman to make such bluntly critical 
comments in public about israel 
the administration is asking to maintain the same level of aid 
to israel 3 billion the most of any foreign nation 
obey said he had raised his concerns with the bush 
administration and with israel and all he had received were 
words 
a state department official who handles us ties with the 
middle east deputy assistant secretary of state ned walker said 
the administration continues to urge israel to stop the practice 
were not satisfied he said 
but walker also expressed sympathy for the israeli soldiers 
saying he had been in the israelioccupied gaza strip and seen them 
having to deal with violent palestinian demonstrators its 
difficult for them he said of the soldiers 
more than 400 palestinians have been killed in a violent 
uprising launched 17 months ago to protest israels 21year rule of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
walker praised some recent israeli measures such as the release 
of more than 450 palestinian inmates the unsealing of some houses 
blocked by israeli forces as punitive measures and the restoration 
of loudspeakers to arab mosques but he said israels record is 
still mixed as shown by last weeks shooting by security forces 
of at least five palestinians in the west bank village of nahalin 
israeli military regulations allow soldiers to shoot plastic 
bullets at demonstrators fleeing the scene of a violent 
demonstration israeli spokesmen say plastic bullets are less 
lethal than other ammunition but dozens of palestinians have been 
killed some shot in the back because soldiers fired from closer 
than the required distance

more than 60 national organizations announced 
plans wednesday for a huge march on washington oct 7 to demand 
more federal housing assistance for the nations homeless 
this isnt a march so much as it is a calling forth of the 
human spirit declared a tearful valerie harper the actress and 
longtime homeless activist its an expression of who we are as 
human beings 
she addressed a marathon news conference at which dozens of 
prominent civil rights labor church and antipoverty leaders 
announced the creation of a housing now umbrella organization 
and plans for the march in october 
at least 63 nationwide organizations are participating they 
include the aflcio the us conference of mayors the ywca of the 
united states the southern christian leadership conference the 
national urban league the national organization for women the 
national senior citizens council and the national rainbow 
coalition headed by the rev jesse jackson 
barry zigas a principal organizer of the march and president of 
the national lowincome housing coalition predicted that 
hundreds of thousands of people would participate 
famed homeless activist mitch snyder noted that i was 6 years 
old when congress passed legislation calling for safe and 
affordable housing for all americans well im 45 now and its 
time to remind one another that the wealthiest nation on earth has 
the resources but simply lacks the will to get the job done 
alexandria va mayor james p moran jr speaking for the us 
conference of mayors blamed the homeless problem on the 
abandonment of the federal housing assistance policies of the 1960s 
and 1970s if we had continued those policies he said about 
18 million more households would be receiving housing assistance 
or enough to accommodate 4 million people its no coincidence that 
there are 3 million homeless in this country he declared 
since 1981 budget authority for all federal housing assistance 
programs has been cut by more than 75 percent from 32 billion to 
less than 8 billion a year according to the new coalition it 
said only about 1 out of every 4 eligible poor renters actually 
receives a federal housing subsidy 
moran noted also that the department of housing and urban 
development estimates than more than 24 million people spend more 
than half of their income on housing thats a disgrace he 
said 
the joint call to action issued by the coalition complained 
that congress hides behind the budget deficit when it comes to 
housing our people we call on congress to recognize housing as the 
immediate national priority it must become 
we cannot deny said actor jon voight that wherever we 
step we step over a human being lying helplessly in our streets 
unless we act now our streets will be littered with them 
we are sitting on our hands and more and more people are 
suffering said louisa stark president of the national coalition 
for the homeless she cited a recent mit study which indicated that 
by the year 2000 there will be an estimated 19 million homeless 
americans barring a change in policy

a new prescription drug benefit program being 
readied for 32 million medicare beneficiaries offers a golden 
opportunity to include safeguards against adverse reactions that 
hospitalize at least 200000 elderly people a year witnesses told 
a house panel wednesday 
richard kusserow inspector general for the department of health 
and human services told the committee that it would be stupid 
for congress to be so insistent on enforcing an arbitrary deadline 
for setting up a computerbased billing system that it closes off 
the possibility of building in the safeguards 
the idea he said is to program the medicare computer system 
that will link the nations pharmacies so that the pharmacist 
filling a doctors prescription will be able to tell on the spot 
whether the patient is taking another drug that could react with 
the new one 
some private pharmacy chains already use such programs often 
citing them in advertising as a reason to shop at a particular 
pharmacy 
kusserow was called before the subcommittee of the select 
committee on aging to elaborate on a study that has found the 
medicare program paid at least 500 million in 1987 for hospital 
admissions that were related to an adverse prescription drug 
reaction or an overdose 
he told the panel that is a conservative figure because 
hospitals do not always flag drug reaction cases in the records 
they submit for medicare reimbursements 
preliminary results from the report released previously found 
that the elderly account for 200000 or 39 percent of all 
hospitalizations from drug reactions and half of deaths from such 
reactions 
kusserow who has referred to the situation as americas other 
drug problem said he is concerned that the health care financing 
administration is feeling so much congressional pressure to meet 
have a prescription drug billing system up and running well before 
the 1991 startup of the program that it will design a system that 
precludes adding computerized crosschecks of various medications a 
medicare beneficiary may already be taking 
i think that would be stupid and i would hate to see that 
happen he said 
beginning in 1991 medicare will pay 50 percent of drug costs 
after a 600 annual deductible the government payment rises to 60 
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 also after a 
600 deduction 
suggesting that congress was not entirely clear in the 
instructions it gave hcfa on how to set up a national system to 
keep track of medicare drug claims kusserow said my concern is 
that we will rush ahead to create a data base driven solely by 
financial recordkeeping concerns and neglect the quality of care 
issue 
heading off drug reactions before they occur would save money in 
the long run by cutting down hospitalization costs for treating the 
victims of such episodes he said 
almost all adverse prescription drug reactions stem from 
patients not properly following directions for taking the medicine 
or taking different medicines that can react with each other 
either drugs they are prescribed by different physicians or by a 
single physician who doesnt know any better 
food and drug administrator frank young supported kusserow in 
calling for a hcfa computer system that provides a way to 
crosscheck prescriptions 
we think this is a golden opportunity said young we fear 
it may be implemented without including a way to do this

city officials appointed a citizens 
board with the authority to close buildings or businesses where 
drug activity has become entrenched 
city general counsel james l harrison described the power of 
the drug nuisance board as pretty drastic but also called it 
one of the most significant steps taken by the city to fight 
drug dealing 
the fivemember board can order landowners to make changes in 
their buildings or the activities that go on there to prevent 
drugs from being sold 
it also has the power to close businesses entirely in cases 
where members think the owners are unable or unwilling to do 
anything to stop drug dealing 
the board which met for the first time tuesday will hear 
evidence presented by the general counsels office about buildings 
where drug deals are known to have taken place at least three times 
the city council authorized the board last july but it was not 
formed until recently because of questions of its constitutionality 
steve rohan an attorney with the general counsels office said 
police and private citizens can recommend that buildings be 
targeted for the boards review 
sheriffs lt david sembach said police have been mailing 
notices to property owners for several weeks advising them drug 
deals are taking place on their land

us officials wednesday stepped up 
efforts to convince european allies that nato must improve its 
shortrange nuclear weapons by offering intelligence information on 
how the soviets are boosting their arsenal 
defense sources said however that it remained unclear how the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization would handle the 
politically sensitive issue 
defense secretary dick cheney attending his first nato meeting 
presented what was described as an unexpectedly extensive 
intelligence briefing behind closed doors stressing the soviet 
unions efforts in the past five years to modernize its own arsenal 
of shortrange nuclear missiles and artillery shells 
our evidence is overwhelming that this has been an ongoing 
process and will continue to be an ongoing process said one 
senior us official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the decision to offer the briefing was prompted by a growing 
split within the western alliance in which west germany belgium 
and some other european countries have expressed doubt about moving 
now to replace the lance nuclear missiles deployed with nato 
forces those missiles are expected to become obsolete by the 
mid1990s and american officials say nato has no choice but to 
replace them and maintain some nuclear weapons in europe 
belgium west germany and a few other nato members also have 
questioned the wisdom of proceeding now with modernization when it 
might be possible to open new arms control talks with the soviets 
on the issue 
the united states counters that negotiations should be completed 
on reducing longrange nuclear missiles and conventional forces 
before nato worries about shortrange battlefield missiles 
at the conclusion of the first day of nato consultations the 
american defense source said the united states was convinced the 
modernization issue had been spawned by internal politics within 
individual countries and not by any real split between the united 
states and its allies 
while final decisions on production and deployment schedules are 
not necessary right now the source continued the us government 
does need some broad language of support for nuclear modernization 
in order to win funding from congress to start missile development 
work 
no specific decisions on specific weapons in specific numbers 
in specific locations are required now said the us source 
but it is clear that congress will not support programs that 
they believe that the alliance is not prepared to see become a part 
of our deterrent and thats a problem so there is no doubt that 
congress will be looking to see if there is a proper expression of 
support 
the nato allies agreed wednesday that nuclear weapons cannot be 
withdrawn from europe given the current arms balance with russia 
and the warsaw pact and thus cheney hopes to win the expression of 
support he wants the source concluded 
nato is 40 years old this year it has gone through many 
crises and we will also overcome this one said dutch defense 
minister frits bolkestein 
the first day of discussions ran longer than expected officials 
described the talks as businesslike with no voices raised in the 
closeddoor meetings 
officials said the allies appeared in agreement that the defense 
ministers should not do anything that would be seen as upsetting in 
the next few weeks before a summit of president bush and other nato 
leaders that gathering will be held at the end of may in brussels 
the officials were continuing to discuss the wording of a public 
statement that will be released at the end of talks on thursday 
belgiums defense minister guy coeme said there is still 
ennormous work to be done 
at issue is how clear the statement expresses support for the 
modernization program 
you dont design a missile to european standards based on the 
recommendations of the europeans with the understanding that 
theyre not going to deploy it the us source said 
however officials of other european delegations have said it 
was unlikely that the language would go beyond that of previous 
statements when the allies have said their forces will be kept 
uptodate where necessary 
belgium has said it wanted to hold off decisions on modernizing 
shortrange nuclear weapons until the early 1990s and agree to open 
eastwest arms talks on the arms as soon as possible the 
government also expressed concern about extending the range of the 
new generation lance 
coeme said the process is still ongoing but i can say on the 
range issue and on the wish to open negotiations belgium is 
certainly not alone 
german defense minister rupert scholz reiterated his countrys 
view that no decisions on production or deployment of new weapons 
were required immediately 
the if how and when of production and deployment are not 
necessary to decide now here scholz said 
the nato members are canada the united states belgium 
britain denmark germany greece france iceland italy 
luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal spain and turkey 
france which is not part of natos integrated military structure 
does not attend the nuclear discussions iceland takes part as an 
observer

a prosecutor asked jurors wednesday to 
reject defense claims of temporary insanity and recommend the death 
penalty for a man convicted of killing six people in a shopping 
center shooting spree 
william cruse left a killing field behind him in the two 
palm bay shopping centers where he also tried to kill 24 others in 
1987 state attorney norm wolfinger told jurors 
may god have mercy on the defendants soul for his cruel and 
atrocious and uncaring acts wolfinger said in his final 
argument evidence has shown that this defendant has forfeited 
his right to live on earth 
he is a cold calculating killer he deserves to die 
cruse demonstrated that he was in total control of his mental 
faculties when he methodically tracked down and shot at his victims 
repeatedly some of them while they lay wounded and moaning 
wolfinger said 
there was premeditation because his plan was to kill kill 
kill he meant to do it and he did it he said 
public defenders representing the 61yearold former librarian 
were to present their final arguments later 
the jurors who convicted cruse on april 5 of 32 counts of 
murder attempted murder and kidnapping now have to recommend his 
punishment death or life in prison without possibility of parole 
for 25 years the verdict can be by simple majority rather than 
unanimously 
circuit judge john antoon said he would give great weight to 
the panels recommendation but he does not have to accept it in 
passing either sentence 
the state attorney held up a shotgun used in the wounding of a 
teenager across the street from cruses house wolfinger pumped 
the weapon several times in front of the jury he then held up the 
semiautomatic assault rifle used in the shopping center rampage 
popping in a 30round clip several times 
anticipating defense arguments that cruse was insane at the time 
of the april 23 1987 shootout the prosecutor said there has 
never been any disagreement over mental illness the only 
disagreement is its effect and how much of a role it played in 
the crimes 
the defense tried to present every conceivable socalled 
bizarre incident in cruses life wolfinger said and it wanted 
the jury to feel that he should be relieved of all responsibility 
for that crime 
as to arguments about the defendants delusions over 
homosexuality wolfinger said what we have here is a man who 
cant accept the doubts of his own masculinity and blamed it on 
everyone else

independent counsel lawrence walsh said 
wednesday he thinks central charges dropped from the irancontra 
case of oliver north are salvageable against former national 
security adviser john poindexter 
in a court session before us district judge aubrey robinson 
walsh said us intelligence agencies are showing greater 
flexibility than they did previously in regard to what classified 
material may be declassified for trial 
walsh also said some classified documents which caused the 
intelligence community concern in the north case arent relevant in 
the poindexter case he said he was willing to make the documents 
available so that the defense can see for itself the lack of 
relevance 
i think they are salvageable walsh said of conspiracy 
theft and wire fraud counts there has been a softening in the 
position of the intelligence agencies 
due to national security concerns conspiracy and theft counts 
against north were dismissed jan 13 earlier a charge of wire 
fraud against him also was dismissed 
north who worked under poindexter at the white house has faced 
trial on 12 remaining felony charges over the past 12 weeks his 
case is expected to go to the jury thursday 
north poindexter and businessmen richard secord and albert 
hakim were indicted march 16 1988in the irancontra affair all 
were charged with conspiracy theft of government property and wire 
fraud as well as other crimes 
the conspiracy and theft counts accused them of illegally 
diverting more than 14 million in iran armssale proceeds to the 
nicaraguan rebels the wire fraud count accused them of carrying 
out the diversion through telephone calls and other communications 
in court robinson said poindexters attorney richard beckler 
should submit a discovery request by may 15 for material he wants 
to use 
christian mixter an attorney in walshs office asked that the 
date be moved up a request which made poindexter sitting at the 
defense table shake his head in displeasure robinson agreed to 
give the defense until may 15 
the conspiracy and theft counts in the north case foundered 
after us district judge gerhard a gesell ruled dec 12 that 
significant amounts of classified information could not be deleted 
from 300 documents walsh wanted to use against north at trial 
among the items the judge said would have to be disclosed in 
order to ensure a fair trial were verbatim texts of intelligence 
reports and names of central american countries 
the judge also insisted on including references to foreign 
officials by their general importance and function and also 
references to cia officials and sources 
faced with the refusal of intelligence agencies to declassify so 
much information for use at norths trial walsh went into court 
and asked gesell to dismiss the charges

oliver norths lawyer pleaded for acquittal 
today telling jurors the former white house aide doesnt want to 
be a hero he just wants to go home 
in an emotional closing argument brendan sullivan said north 
became a sacrificial lamb in the reagan white house and was 
fired to spare the former president political harm 
now he cries out sullivan said as the 12week irancontra 
trial wound toward its conclusion a few blocks from the white house 
where north once worked in a sense he has been a hostage i ask 
you on the evidence to set him free 
in his hourlong rebuttal prosecutor john keker put down 
sullivans closing argument with the shakespearian line it was 
all sound and fury signifying nothing 
you have heard a lot about courage at this trial said 
keker theres another kind of courage courage to admit when you 
are wrong courage to admit personal responsibility courage to 
admit guilt where appropriate he north has not admitted any of 
those things its time for you to do it for him 
north a former marine is charged with 12 criminal counts of 
lying to congress and the attorney general illegally converting 
travelers checks to his own use and conspiracy to defraud the 
treasury through a tax scam to support the contra rebels fighting 
the leftist nicaraguan government 
if convicted he could receive prison terms totaling 60 years 
and fines of 3 million 
prosecutor john keker was permitted time to address the jury a 
final time after sullivan concluded judge gerhard gesell is 
expected to give the case to the jury on thursday 
sullivan who has norths defense lawyer through tumultuous 
congressional hearings and tedious courtoom maneuvering seemed to 
grow emotional as he summed up the defense for the last time 
greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down his 
life for another the lawyer read from a bible in his hand 
thats the kind of man ollie north is said sullivan now 
he cries out in a sense he has been a hostage i ask you on the 
evidence to set him free 
ollie north doesnt want to be a hero the attorney 
declared he just wants to go home 
sullivan described the reagan administration and the irancontra 
affair this way 
its like a big octopus the president mcfarlane poindexter 
casey they are all reaching out to get ollie north to run 
something they are all reaching out to get him 
robert mcfarlane and john poindexter were national security 
advisers to president reagan and the late william casey was cia 
director 
earlier sullivan said it was natural instinct for north to 
destroy documents because he was engaged in some of the 
governments most secret operations 
its a reasonable thing to do sullivan said of norths 
decision to destroy records as he prepared to leave the national 
security council staff in november 1986 the act of destroying 
documents would be the natural instinct of anybody running a 
covert operation 
colonel north had charge of running some of the most secret 
operations in the government sullivan said as norths 
irancontra trial approached its end 
the former nsc aide is accused of altering destroying 
concealing and removing documents as the irancontra affair emerged 
publicly in november 1986 
north testified that among the documents he destroyed were memos 
reflecting the diversion of funds from the sale of weapons to iran 
to the contra rebels in nicaragua one memo reflecting a planned 
diversion that north neglected to shred was found in his files on 
nov 22 1986 by an aide to thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
elsewhere in his closing arguments sullivan said highly 
sensitive information distributed to cia director casey and 
national security adviser poindexter in november 1985 showed that 
hawk missiles were aboard a flight to iran 
sullivan referred to the foreign intelligence data to bolster 
his defense against charges that north prepared a false chronology 
of events that prompted casey and poindexter to mislead congress in 
november 1986 
north is accused of preparing documents stating that no one in 
the us government knew until january 1986 that hawks were aboard 
an aircraft to iran on the november 1985 flight assisted by the 
cia a cia proprietary airline carried the shipment 
sullivan held up a notebook stuffed with 417 pages of 168 
topsecret intercepted messages that pertained to the hawk shipment 
the intelligence data was distributed immediately to casey and 
poindexter hours after it was gathered he said 
any accusation based on the charge that ollie north was the 
repository of special information is wrong false inaccurate 
misleading and unfair sullivan argued 
referring to casey as the master spy he said is anybody 
to believe he didnt know what was in the intercept book 
sullivan said the material is so sensitive that the jurors wont 
be permitted to see it he held up a brief summary of the 
information culled from the intercepts 
when casey testified to congress on nov 21 1986 he gave no 
indication that the cia and national security council staff knew 
the november 1985 shipment contained arms poindexter testified 
that the us government didnt learn until january 1986 that 
israel had transferred 18 hawk missiles to iran 
the november 1985 hawk shipment was of questionable legality it 
was been retroactively legalized by a finding that president 
reagan signed in december 1985

the tearing down of a sign declaring 
woody guthrie was no hero in the folk singers hometown has 
refueled longstanding debate over how locals should remember 
okemahs most famous native son 
david cox a reporter for the weekly okemah news leader faces a 
54 fine for tearing down the sign last week on the american legion 
building across the street from the newspaper office 
the sign was put up by funeral director bart webb a former city 
councilman and a member of the legion webb filed the municipal 
complaint against cox alleging destruction of private property 
cox 26 said he plans to represent himself at a may 8 hearing 
the incident is the latest in a dispute that has raged for years 
in the town of 3500 with guthries detractors saying he was a 
communist and his admirers saying the man who penned this land is 
your land ought to be honored 
tensions are expected to heighten with the scheduled appearance 
of guthries son arlo in an april 29 concert at okemahs crystal 
theater arlo guthrie has never performed in his fathers hometown 
webbs 2footby3foot sign reprints a recent editorial from 
the oklahoma constitution a conservative oklahoma city tabloid 
the newspaper under the headline woody was no hero calls 
guthrie a militant atheist 
the sign was replaced after it was torn down but it was gone 
again wednesday cox said he doesnt know who removed it this time 
patricia cheatham wife of american legion commander max 
cheatham said the legion post will meet thursday to discuss 
whether the sign should be displayed at the legion hall the sign 
also was posted elsewhere around town she said but cox said he 
hadnt seen it anywhere else 
webb would not consent to a telephone interview a spokeswoman 
at his funeral home said wednesday 
mrs cheatham described webb as very patriotic he was 
defeated in his bid for a second city council term earlier this 
month 
mrs cheatham said until recent years most townspeople ignored 
guthrie who died in 1967 a movie about his life bound for 
glory rekindled some interest she said 
guthries house was demolished years ago and remains a pile of 
debris on an overgrown lot a few blocks from downtown but a town 
water tower visible from interstate 40 proclaims okemah as the home 
of woody guthrie 
arlo guthries appearance coincides with the release of an album 
taped in december by local musicians and school children as a 
tribute to the dust bowl balladeer

of the united central workers diego olivares and four other 
leaders nicanor araya sergio aguirre manuel jimeenez and moises 
labrana 
the labor federation called the general strike it failed to 
attract major support from workers but prompted daylong 
demonstrations in downtown santiago and widespread violence in its 
slums

suspected guerrilla not two were killed tuesday night in a 
clash with security agents police said the second man is at a

a web of overhead cables covered some open areas of 
a federal prison wednesday as the warden sought to tighten security 
in the wake of a failed escape attempt by helicopter 
warden john clark ordered the cables strung over the 
highsecurity exercise courtyard at the metropolitan correctional 
center where drug smuggler benjamin barry kramer hopped on a 
hovering helicopter monday the aircraft snagged a 14foot security 
fence around the courtyard and crashed 
kramer was in satisfactory condition wednesday at jackson 
memorial hospital and the pilot charles clayton stevens was in 
good condition both suffered broken legs they have been charged 
with escaperelated counts 
in the next few months the entire 48acre complex which holds 
about 1000 prisoners southwest of miami will have cables strung 
between the roofs of buildings and utility poles 
if a helicopter tries to land it will be tangled in the 
cable clark said 
money to secure the prison against aerial escapes had been 
requested from the department of justice before kramers attempted 
breakout clark said 
its an expensive proposition but after this i think well 
get the money for it clark said 
clark said the crash that foiled the escape was caused by the 
novice pilots miscalculation in trying to fly out of the 50foot 
by 200foot exercise yard 
two inmates jumped over the fence to help pull stevens from the 
rubble clark said 
at first we thought they may have been involved in the escape 
attempt and they were placed in lockup he said 
stevens and kramer would not have gotten far if the 37yearold 
helicopter had not crashed because us customs and police planes 
would have been sent after them immediately clark said 
the us marshals office was trying to determine how kramer of 
hallandale a champion offshore powerboat racer convicted of drug 
smuggling got in touch with stevens a diver in gold beach ore 
stevens was just learning to fly a helicopter and had less than 40 
hours flying experience on an airplane

oliver norths lawyer in an emotional final 
argument wednesday portrayed the former white house aide as a 
sacrificial lamb a scapegoat and a hostage and implored jurors in 
his trial to set him free 
oliver north never wanted to be a hero said brendan 
sullivan he just wants to go home 
but prosecutor john keker having the last word asked the jury 
to return a verdict of guilty in each and every one of the 12 
charges 
with that the nine women and three men who will decide norths 
fate were sent home they will return thursday to begin their 
deliberations after instructions from us district judge gerhard 
a gesell during deliberation the jury will be sequestered for 
the first time since the irancontra trial began 
in his hourlong rebuttal keker said it had been an unhappy 
unpleasant miserable criminal trial and dismissed sullivans 
closing argument with a shakesperian touch it was all sound and 
fury signifying nothing 
you have heard a lot about courage at this trial keker 
said theres another kind of courage courage to admit when you 
are wrong corage to admit personal responsibility courage to 
admit guilt where appropriate he north has not admitted any of 
those things its time for you to do it for him 
it was the end of two tough days for north a former marine 
lieutenant colonel whose power while he was at the national 
security council was substantial his face paled and he busied 
himself with writing while keker denounced him he looked at the 
jury while sullivan pleaded for him 
the government has not shown criminal behavior sullivan 
said the man who held the lives of others in his hands now puts 
his life into yours the reference was to norths protecting 
names of people he dealt with by shredding or altering documents 
which sullivan saw as a reasonable thing to do 
keker had another explanation he was destroying documents 
deliberately so they wouldnt find what he didnt want them to 
find 
after the arguments norths mood brightened and he joined his 
wife who was speaking with a minister in the front row of 
spectators 
sullivan choked with emotion throughout much of his threehour 
closing argument mentioned president reagans telephone call on 
the day north was fired a call in which the president called north 
a national hero and also a postcard north got from thenvice 
president bush thanking him for his work 
all these people who went to ollie north for help where are 
they now sullivan asked 
summing up norths defense in the trials 12th week sullivan 
said he had done his job well as a white house aide following 
superiors orders to help the nicaraguan rebels then was thrown 
overboard as reagan sought to escape political heat over the affair 
sullivan told the jury that north who had worked to free 
american hostages in lebanon has been in a sense a hostage 
himself 
i ask you on the evidence to set him free said sullivan 
in the spectator section behind north at the defense table 
were his wife and three of his four children betsy north had been 
at the trial before but it was a first for the children during a 
recess north took their youngest daughter by the hand and walked 
with her down the courtroom corridor 
north is charged with 12 criminal counts including lying to 
congress and the attorney general illegally converting travelers 
checks to his own use and conspiring to defraud the treasury 
through a tax scam to support the rebels fighting the nicaraguan 
government if convicted he could receive prison terms totaling 60 
years and fines of 3 million 
sullivan sought to persuade the jurors that the government had 
presented only weak evidence to back up the charges against north 
whom he described as caught between a rock and a hard place in 
trying to keep state secrets while he was asked by congress to tell 
all 
he was fired from the white house offered as a sacrificial 
lamb so to speak to the raging congress sullivan said referring 
to the day north was fired in november 1986 
leaning forward and almost whispering to the jury sullivan 
asked what do you think was happening i draw the conclusion the 
president was using ollie north as a scapegoat and threw him 
overboard to escape some political heat 
sullivan said north was innocent of the charges that he lied 
about raising funds for the contras saying there was no evidence 
that north ever raised the subject with a contributor or that money 
was given in his presence 
he said reagan had met with contributors including one who soon 
after donated 1 million worth of stock 
what is the difference between what the president did and 
oliver north did sullivan asked the president is happily 
retired in california and ollie north has been in washington 2 
years fighting for his reputation 
sullivan noted that keker had used a biblical quotation in his 
final argument tuesday and said he had one of his own 
greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down his 
life for another sullivan said 
thats the kind of man ollie north is he said now he 
cries out in a sense hes been a hostage i ask you on the 
evidence to set him free 
the irancontra affair was like a big octopus said 
sullivan the president mcfarlane poindexter casey they 
are all reaching out to get ollie north to run something they 
are all reaching out to get him 
he referred to former national security advisers robert 
mcfarlane and john poindexter and the late cia director william 
casey

the soviet union promised a 35nation eastwest 
conference on press freedom wednesday that it would review working 
conditions for moscowbased journalists and open its airways to 
foreign tv programs 
the chief us delegate accused four of the communist 
participants romania bulgaria east germany and czechoslovakia 
of ignoring the agreement on press and other freedoms that the 35 
countries signed in january at the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
the signatory countries varied from the united states where 
press freedom is enshrined in the constitution to romania where 
typewriters have to be licensed and police keep records of the 
typefaces 
the aim of this weeks meeting information forum is to monitor 
compliance with the agreement 
ambassador leonard h marks a former director of the us 
information agency and head of the american delegation said the 
soviet union had made substantial progress including stopping 
jamming foreign broadcasts but its media remained only 
semifree 
the concept that the east europeans and the soviets had that 
the government controls the press is now disappearing some 
nonofficial viewpoints are presented not all marks said in 
an interview with the associated press 
but were going to be behind them the objectives are to have 
a free press not a semifree press 
soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky questioned by 
reporters at a news conference on why foreign correspondents were 
banned from the soviet republic of georgia during nationalist 
unrest this month said we will take this criticism very 
seriously 
we will work very hard to provide international standards for 
the working of journalists said petrovsky 
he said foreign reporters were banned from georgia where 20 
people were killed in disturbances because it could be dangerous 
for the correpondents 
in an address to the conference wednesday petrovsky said 
foreign correspondents can now travel more freely in the soviet 
union and were allowed more contact with soviet citizens 
glasnost means that every citizen should have the right to 
receive complete and reliable information on any public issue 
said petrovsky there are no limits to improving reporters 
working conditions 
he added that extensive work is under way in the soviet union 
to create optimal conditions to ensure free access to information 
including arranging subscriptions to foreign periodicals and 
reception of foreign tv broadcasts 
he acknowledged difficulties remained about receiving foreign tv 
signals in the soviet union using copying equipment access to 
audio and video information and buying foreign periodicals 
the existing obstacles and restrictions in this area will be 
removed as the overall democratization process in the ussr 
further unfolds 
marks said the four east bloc states he singled out have 
recognized the obligations of januarys vienna agreement but 
they have not fulfilled them 
he said the us delegation will press specific cases during 
closed sessions which start next week after four days of opening 
speeches by delegation chiefs 
our objective is not to be confrontational said marks we 
want to try to solve problems we dont need any more 
agreements on principles we need action 
the vienna agreement was the outcome of eastwest talks on human 
rights and free speech that began in helsinki in the 1970s

liverpool officials and survivors of a stadium 
crush that killed 95 soccer fans denied police reports wednesday 
that hooliganism and drunkenness were factors in the disaster 
police in the northern city of sheffield said more than a dozen 
supporters of liverpools soccer team were arrested before 
saturdays game for public order offenses 
irvine patnick the governing conservative partys lawmaker in 
sheffield said police told him they were hampered harassed 
punched kicked and urinated on by liverpool fans as they 
struggled to help the injured and dying 
eric heffer an opposition labor party member from liverpool 
called patnicks charges absolutely degrading and disgusting 
mr patnick is suggesting that liverpool people did the most 
despicable things to their own people when the whole of the 
television coverage showed to the contrary heffer said in the 
house of commons his voice trembling patnick was not in the house 
police have come under attack in the aftermath of the disaster 
for unlocking a gate and allowing several thousand fans to pour 
into an already crowded standingroom section at hillsborough 
stadium in sheffield 
the victims were trampled or crushed to death against an 
antiriot fence nineteen remained hospitalized wednesday nine in 
intensive care most of the victims were fans of the liverpool 
team which was playing a team from nottingham forest 
paul middup chairman of the south yorkshire police federation 
the local police union chapter told bbctv we are quite 
convinced that a lot of the fans many many hundreds of them 
outside that gate had been drinking very heavily 
but dr john ashton of liverpool university medical faculty who 
was at the match and attended the dying said on tv channel 4 news 
i saw no evidence whatsoever of drunkenness nor of looting nor 
of people urinating on policemen 
the chief constable of south yorkshire police peter wright 
refused comment on the argument saying he had ordered his officers 
not to preempt an inquiry into police control of the crowd 
a small crowd of liverpudlians burned a stack of newspapers 
wednesday with the police claims on the front page 
the teams stadium was carpeted with flowers scarves and other 
soccer memorabilia as scores of people continued paid tribute to 
the dead 
liverpool city council leader kevas coombes accused police of 
spreading baseless malicious and wicked allegations 
none of these allegations were made at the time and any lawyer 
will know that they have the hallmarks of an attempt to create a 
cover story to cover for their incompetence he said 
home secretary douglas hurd whose department is in charge of 
the police and lawmaker david blunkett whose constituency 
includes sheffield stadium both appealed for an end to 
recriminations 
it is sad and wrong that there were 24 hours of great dignity 
and mourning and now as a country we seem to be plunging downhill 
into a mess of accusations and counteraccusations which changed 
that right atmosphere to the wrong said hurd

county compared to 341 assigned in miami and 301 in new york 
supervisor deane dana criticized drug czar william bennetts 
selection of washington as a test case for the bush 
administrations antidrug efforts 
they are doing it because congress is there hearing the 
gunshots but the gunshots are no less deadly here in los 
angeles said dana 
bennets spokesman larry cirignano responded it didnt make 
any sense to fly to los angeles to look at the drug problem when we

weeks of unpaid leave for parents of new babies 
the vote was 106 
the bill similar to a measure awaiting house floor action also 
would require employers to make 10 weeks available for workers to 
care for a seriously ill child or parent 
and it would require them to grant up to 13 weeks a year unpaid 
leave in the even of serious illness of the employee 
the bill sponsored by sen chris dodd dconn would apply to 
employers of 20 or more people 
similar dodd legislation cleared the committee last year but 
failed to overcome an informal filibuster mounted by republican 
opponents on the floor 
parental leave legislation is a main part of the overall 
democratic domestic agenda this year along the minimum wage 
federal child care and health care for the uninsured 
party leaders have agreed informally that the house will go 
first this year with its version of the parental leave bill 
parental leave legislation was not considered by the full house

the national institute of standards and 
technology burned 500 pounds of wood in an old capitol hill hotel 
wednesday in an experiment to help decide whether its worthwhile 
to try to control smoke in building fires 
the institutes system confined smoke from the fire to one floor 
of the sevenstory brick building which was studded throughout 
with more than 100 temperaturemeasuring devices and other 
instruments measuring air pressure and gas concentrations 
the institute known until recently as the national bureau of 
standards is part of the commerce department 
smoke control systems have come into increasing use in office 
buildings over the past decade but officials of the institute said 
such systems had not been challenged extensively by real fires 
what systems there are have been constructed according to 
theoretical calculations and rules of thumb drawn up by fire 
experts 
the cause of many fire fatalities is listed as smoke 
inhalation which frequently may be carbon monoxide from 
incomplete combustion or other toxic gases given off by a fire 
much of the 40 billion in annual property damage from fires 
also results from smoke and it doesnt take much to gum up your 
computer disks even if the flames never get close observed jack 
snell director of the institutes center for fire research 
the big question in the fire protection field is does smoke 
control work and under what circumstances does it make sense to 
add it to building requirements snell told reporters attending 
the demonstration burn at the old plaza hotel between the capitol 
and union station the building is to be demolished 
some experts question whether sprinklerprotected buildings need 
a smoke control system to work properly such systems must supply 
air to the fire which may make it grow and these are the 
tradeoffs said snell 
smoke control works by using a buildings existing airhandling 
system to pressurize the stairwells and the floors above and below 
the fire floor existing fire sensors can be used to trigger the 
proper arrangement of fans 
in washington the senate hart office building and the madison 
building of the library of congress have smoke control systems 
john klute director of wednesdays experiment said such systems 
should add a small fraction to the cost of ventilation systems 
in wednesdays test 2000 cubicfeetperminute fans pumped air 
into the first and third floors of the hotel while a fan of the 
same size withdraw air from the second floor where a pyre of 2 
inchby2 inch fir sticks burned in a fireproofed room about 10 
feet by 11 feet in front of an open windown about four feet square 
a fan of 9000 cubic feet per minute pressurized the single 
stairwell in the building 
the open window made it the most severe test so far said 
klute this meant the difference in air pressure between the fire 
floor and the adjacent floors would be about half the difference 
recommended for current smoke control schemes 
flames and black smoke denoting incomplete combustion poured out 
of the open window and licked the window above at one point the 
temperature sensor closest to the fire indicated 2696 degrees 
fahrenheit and the carbon monoxide content of the hallway was 
shown as almost 05 percent half what it had been in previous 
tests of fires in the hallway with all windows closed 
but television monitors on every floor and every landing of the 
stairwell showed no smoke throughout the test even though the 
secondfloor hallway was full of opaque smoke above a few inches 
off the floor at 6 minutes 43 seconds after ignition and 
completely full shortly after that

one week before the supreme court hears 
arguments in a key abortionrights case an abortion rights group 
wednesday took to the airwaves with a 2 million ad campaign while 
an antiabortion group said it plans to run newspaper ads next week 
to stir americas grass roots 
the national abortion rights action league wednesday began 
running television radio and newspaper ads to present their side 
and build on the energy displayed at an abortionrights march that 
drew at least 300000 to the nations capitol earlier this month 
meantime the american civil liberties union plans on thursday 
to deliver more than 200000 letters to the justice department on 
thursday asking the department to drop its attempt to persuade the 
supreme court to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
the naral ads are designed to awaken americas prochoice 
majority the sleeping giant that is just now hearing the alarm 
said kate michelman executive director of naral 
the ads were being run in four state capital cities 
sacramento calif des moines iowa raleigh nc and austin 
texas on sunday the ads will begin in washington dc and 
nationally on cable news network she said 
narals ads warn that without safe legal abortions women will 
be forced to turn to back alley abortions and say the choice 
of whether to have an abortion should be made by women and their 
families not the government 
michelman said the ad campaign is a first of its kind for the 
group warranted by the imminent danger to abortion rights posed by 
a missouri case that will be heard by the high court 
though many doubt the court in this case will reverse its 
landmark roe vs wade ruling that legalized firsttrimester 
abortions many say the court could allow states to impose more 
restrictions on abortions 
oral arguments are scheduled for april 26 
the national right to life committee said it is planning to run 
a fourpage insert in usa today on april 25 and to run the ad in 
other papers around the country after that said dan donehey a 
spokesman for the group 
donehey who estimated the cost of the campaign at 150000 
said the ads will include information on the types of abortion 
procedures performed the developmental characteristics of a fetus 
the effect of abortion on women and profiles of women who carried 
babies to term instead of aborting them 
michelman said her groups ad campaign is not intended to lobby 
the supreme court but she said the court is not immune to the 
social values and political environment of the country 
leonard dinegar a national right to life committee spokesman 
said his group isnt trying to sway the high court but wants to 
take advantage of the attention it has focused on the abortion 
issue 
this is the best time to educate people on the issue because 
its so hot right now he said ettersxxx

actor ed asner actress polly bergen rep pat schroeder 
dcolo and aclu executive director ira glasser will present the 
letters to the justice department on thursday colleen oconnor of 
the american civil liberties union said wednesday 
the extraordinary outpouring of 200000 letters represents 
a public uprising against the notion of an established right being 
taken away glasser said in an interview from his new york office 
when you have as many people as this willing to put themselves 
on the line to resist the taking away of their rights it is a 
political uprising that they ought to pay attention to and be 
sensitive to glasser said we hope that theyll let this case 
be decided on the merits and not make what we believe is a narrow 
and partisanbased political decision

andrei sakharovs campaign speech before fellow 
soviet scientists was upstaged wednesday when one of his colleagues 
publicly apologized for denouncing the nuclear physicist nine years 
ago 
sakharov is running for one of the seats in the new soviet 
parliament reserved for the academy of sciences he and other 
reformist candidates at wednesdays election meeting criticized a 
new decree on dissent and authorities for the deaths of 20 
protesters in a clash in soviet georgia 
the scientist who followed the human rights activist to the 
podium at moscow state university however was the one who 
electrified the hall 
the elderly man who identified himself only as vonsovsky said 
he was ashamed to admit that he signed a letter to the soviet 
presidium denouncing sakharov after the physicist criticized the 
soviet intervention in afghanistan in 1979 
i committed a very bad act vonsovsky said in front of 
hundreds of top soviet scientists i am offering a profound 
apology 
i would like to say that sakharov is our honor our pride and 
our conscience vonsovsky said 
the presidium cited such letters when it stripped sakharov of 
his numerous awards and accused him of subversion in early 1980 he 
was exiled from moscow to the provincial city of gorky in 1986 he 
was freed when president mikhail s gorbachev came to power and 
began releasing dissidents 
the academy is scheduled to vote thursday to fill the 12 of its 
20 seats in the congress of peoples deputies that were left empty 
after its first round of voting last month 
in his speech sakharov said an april 8 decree barring insults 
and discrediting of the government should be rescinded he also 
criticized laws that allow authorities to use special troops to 
clear demonstrations 
critics charge that by banning statements that discredit soviet 
officials the new decree threatens citizens with prison or fines 
for speaking the truth about officials who do their jobs poorly 
sakharov also blamed the april 9 tragedy in tbilisi the capital 
of soviet georgia on such laws and on forces opposing perestroika 
gorbachevs drive to restructure soviet society 
hundreds of academy members voted to support a resolution of its 
branch in georgia that termed the april 9 clash an unprecedented 
massive beating of innocent people 
at least 20 people died when soldiers moved into a crowd of 
demonstrators on tbilisis main street a commission is 
investigating charges that soldiers used poison gas shovels and 
clubs 
the academy holds 20 seats in the congress of peoples deputies 
that will meet for the first time on may 25 
of the congress 2250 seats 750 will be held by members 
elected from the communist party and its affiliates trade unions 
social and professional organizations like the academy of sciences 
elections in 1500 geographical districts were held march 26 
sakharovs supporters organized a campaign against the 23 
candidates chosen by the academys election commission for the 20 
seats and in voting last month succeeded in preventing 15 of them 
from getting 50 percent of the vote 
the academy was required to organize a second election and last 
week sakharov was chosen to be among the 28 nominees

the governments weeklong ceasefire 
ended wednesday with sinhalese radicals demanding a pullout of 
indian troops and new elections before any peace talks 
it is pointless carrying a gun in one hand and calling for 
peace talks with the other said a statement issued by the 
peoples liberation front the main militant group of the majority 
sinhalese 
the government extended the ceasefire to both ethnic tamil 
rebels fighting for a homeland and militant sinhalese who want 
tougher measures against the tamils despite escalated violence 
that left 100 people dead over the past week tamil militants said 
saturday they were ready for talks on ending their sixyearlong 
insurgency 
president ranasinghe premadasa ordered suspension of military 
operations against the extremists to give them a chance to 
surrender and join the political mainstream 
militant sinhalese said talks should wait until new 
parliamentary and presidential elections are held and indian troops 
leave the country they also demanded disbanding of vigilante 
groups blamed for killing suspected militants in the 
sinhalesedominated south 
the government reacted by calling on the militants to hold 
preliminary negotiations anyway 
it is appropriate that an informal discussion is held on 
preliminary issues that would create a basis of trust as a 
prerequisite for a dialogue said foreign minister ranjan 
wijeratna he made no comment on the militant demands 
the tamil militants have appointed anton balasingham a sri 
lankanborn tamil who is a british citizen to start the peace 
talks balasingham the recently named head of the rebels 
political section is expected to arrive soon from london 
according to presidential spokesman evans cooray no date has been 
announced for the talks 
military officials said 233 sinhalese radicals surrendered 
during the ceasefire no tamil militants surrendered they said 
sinhalese extremists launched their antigovernment campaign in 
1987 after former president junius r jayewardene signed an 
indiasponsored peace accord with tamil rebels the sinhalese 
radicals said the pact which called for greater tamil autonomy 
made too many concessions to the tamils 
the rebels later renounced the accord and began fighting indian 
peacekeeping troops sent to sri lanka to promote the plan india 
became involved in the ethnic tensions of this island off its 
southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million 
tamils for the rebels 
tamils who are mostly hindu comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people they complain of discrimination in jobs and 
education and demand a northeastern homeland 
sri lankas government and military has been dominated by the 
sinhalese since the island formerly called ceylon became 
independent from britain in 1948 sinhalese who are predominantly 
buddhists make up 75 percent of the population 
about 12600 people have died in the ethnic violence over the 
past six years

the head of the us pacific command said 
wednesday he is cautiously optimistic that the philippines will 
agree to a new pact on us bases there but acknowledged that 
political sentiment against the facilities is growing 
adm huntington hardisty commanderinchief of the us pacific 
command said he believes the two countries can agree on an 
extension to the pact when the lease expires on the six bases 
expires in 1991 
everyone has an interest in the united states remaining in the 
philippines hardisty told the senate armed services committee 
were good friends were good allies and i hope that 
relationship will continue 
the admiral said he was cautiously optimistic that in 1991 we 
can reach a favorable renegotiation of the military base 
agreement 
but under questioning from sen john mccain rariz hardisty 
said he concurred with philippine vice president salvador laurels 
statement that political opposition to the bases is increasing 
i dont disagree with that assessment but i think reason will 
prevail in 1991 he said i think weve seen a lot of rhetoric 
and a lot of posturing against the aquino government 
hardisty added that laurel has a political agenda as well 
laurel resigned as foreign secretary in september 1987 citing 
differences with president corazon aquino over the 20year battle 
against a communist insurgency and other issues including economic 
development in the poor nation 
laurel who was in washington this week said that although the 
public favors the us presence a strong antiamerican sentiment 
is growing in the philippine senate according to law twothirds 
of the 23member senate must ratify a usphilippine treaty on 
military bases 
presently the united states maintains clark air base and subic 
bay naval base two of its largest facilities overseas and four 
smaller installations more than 60000 filipinos are employed at 
the bases where about 40000 us troops and their dependents are 
stationed

an amoco corp jet carrying the companys 
president and five other people landed safely wednesday after 
circling for nearly five hours because of a problem with its nose

the gulfstream iii twinengine jet took off about 530 am from 
midway airport with three company executives including president 
h laurance fuller and three crew members en route to asia by way 
of anchorage alaska said amoco spokesman mike thompson 
it landed without incident at 1032 am at ohare 
international airport said federal aviation administration 
spokesman mort edelstein 
the nose gear never retracted edelstein said they 
requested a flyby from the control tower and they looked with 
binoculars and said no it has not retracted 
the 19 million jet circled midway for about 4 hours in 40mile 
circles to burn off fuel before heading to ohare for the landing 
edelstein said 
its a standard thing to do he said in the case of a 
crash theres a better chance for survival if the fuel tanks are 
empty 
he said pilots prefer the additional emergency equipment and 
longer runways that make ohare safer for emergency landings 
edelstein said the nosegear failure could have been caused by a 
mechanic forgetting to take out a pin

usual despite reports that police were looking for two arab men 
planning a terrorist attack the reports were linked to anonymous

the press of atlantic city 
state police on wednesday monitored the three main roads into 
atlantic city plainclothes state police detectives increased their 
surveillance of casinos according to the two newspapers 
the assault was scheduled sometime from april 14 to april 20 
the newspapers said authorities said the attack was to be in 
retaliation for the us bombing on april 15 1986 of libyan 
leader moammar gadhafis headquarters according to the newspapers 
two weeks ago a british newspaper reported that libya planned 
attacks on us airlines and other american targets to mark the 
anniversary of the bombing 
libyas news agency jana has denied the reports which were tied 
to a senior us intelligence official

pasquale declined to comment on the case state police 
superintendent col clinton pagano refused to comment on whether 
his force was on alert 
us attorney samuel a alito declined comment wednesday but

salvador laurel the philippine vice president 
at odds with president corazon aquino described himself on 
wednesday as being in a state of suspended animation as he 
prepares a bid for his nations top office 
laurel who spoke with reporters at the national press club is 
visiting washington to meet with congressional leaders and 
highlight his views in advance of next months national convention 
of the opposition nacionalista party 
he has said he expects to be one of several candidates who are 
going to throw their hat in the ring for the 1992 presidential 
elections although mrs aquino has said she will not seek 
reelection it is possible that she may be drafted to run again 
relations are so poor between mrs aquino and her vice president 
that they do not speak 
although laurel said his visit was not geared around criticism 
at mrs aquino the majority of his statements found fault with her 
governments battle against the nations 20yearold communist 
insurgency as well as the approach to economic and political 
development 
in contrast to the us system of government the philippine 
vice president has no duties under the constitution unless 
appointed to a position by the president after a political falling 
out in 1987 laurel resigned his post as foreign minister and 
lately has been organizing an opposition party 
im in a state of suspended animation he said 
still he quipped as a jobless vice president im able to 
travel more than others and visit with citizens 
as for the insurgency laurel said rebel numbers have ballooned 
from 14000 to 33000 in the past three years 
if we dont put up a responsible democratic opposition the 
alternative we face is a violent opposition he said 
a state department official familiar with the situation in the 
philippines said however that the insurgency was not that large 
and that it hasnt made any particular progress over the past 
several years the official commented on condition he not be named 
the vice president also said he differed with mrs aquino on the 
issue of the negotiation of the future of us bases in the 
philippines and he criticized a lack of movement on the issue 
he argued that the philippine government should enter into 
negotiations with the united states as soon as possible since the 
pact expires in 1991 
laruel did say mrs aquino deserved credit for helping the 
nation through a rocky three years since former dictator ferdinand 
marcos left the country a civilianmilitary uprising in february 
1986 ended marcos rule and swept mrs aquino and laurel into power 
but laurel argued that the transition from dictatorship to 
democracy wont be complete without the formation of a 
responsible legitimate organized opposition which he said 
his party intends to be

overloaded container trucks carrying european 
beer paper products and ceramic tiles are violating us highway 
regulations and endangering trucking safety a truckers group told 
congress wednesday 
thomas j donohue head of the american trucking associations 
said the heavy containers packed in europe increase stopping 
distances decrease vehicle control and put additional stress on 
american trucks 
donohue said beer imports from holland top the list of 
potentially overweight containers followed by paper products and 
ceramic tile imported from various countries 
by allowing imports such as beer to move at higher weights 
than those allowed domestic products the us is in effect 
providing an economic subsidy to foreign competitors donohue 
told the senate commerce science and transportation committee 
he said the federal highway administration lacks authority to 
regulate the containers because they are only illegal when they are 
carried on the highways where enforcement agents fine truckers for 
the overweight cargoes 
donohue said a recent study by the highway administration 
indicates that a third of all import and export containers moving 
through us ports are in possible violation of federal highway 
weight limits the top violator among shipments for export is waste

soldiers fired on protesters who defied a 
military curfew wednesday night and demanded the resignation of 
jordans prime minister witnesses said three people were killed 
officials said at least 18 people have been injured in two days 
of rioting in the city of maan 120 miles south of amman the 
rioting prompted by price increases and an economic austerity 
agreement with the international monetary fund spread to at least 
three other towns 
the violence appeared to be the worst in jordan since the army 
crushed palestinian guerrillas in 197071 and drove them from the 
country 
a police source said a 21yearold army soldier on leave was 
fatally wounded in maan the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity identified the man as ahmed matlab saudi 
saudi was on the roof of his house watching protesters stoning 
government buildings and destroying police cars when he was hit by 
a stray bullet the source said 
the source could not confirm the two other deaths 
but residents in maan also speaking privately said the two 
were among the protesters who took to the streets despite the 
curfew to call for the resignation of prime minister zaid rifai 
they would not give details 
king hussein and rifai were in washington to discuss 
arabisraeli peace efforts with president bush asked about the 
disturbances the monarch told reporters everything is under 
control 
earlier wednesday the government deployed a massive force of 
police and soldiers some in armored cars and wearing riot gear 
along major highways 
but the unrest spread to tafilah 80 miles south of amman and 
husnyeih 95 miles from the capital these two cities and maan 
remained under curfew but residents reached by telephone said 
gunfire could be heard all afternoon 
witnesses said hundreds of rioters on wednesday attacked at 
least seven banks in kerak 50 miles south of amman the streets of 
the city were filled with army officers lined with charred 
buildings and littered with metallic debris 
windows of several government offices were smashed and at least 
three burned cars lay at the entrance of the city 
crown prince hassan acting as head of state in the kings 
absence told reporters that 12 policemen and six civilians were

jordan has experienced little turmoil for 15 years in large 
measure because of a rapid increase in living standards and 
education financed by aid from arab oil states that aid has 
declined recently and the country has a 6 billion debt 
officials said trouble began when taxi drivers roused students 
to riot on tuesday because the drivers were angered by a 25 percent 
increase in the price of gasoline to the equivalent of 165 a 
gallon and a doubling of the annual license fee to 370 
tires smoldered in maans streets and young men changed demands 
for the resignation of rifai whose government announced price

a plan to integrate louisianas public 
universities has the potential to halt generations of racial 
disparity state officials said wednesday 
a special master appointed by a panel of federal judges 
recommended tuesday that the state set up a single governing board 
for higher education raise admission standards for some schools 
and make louisiana state university the primary research school 
the proposal also called for establishing a community college 
system and providing a specific percentage of each years higher 
education budget for predominantly black colleges 
the plan generally was well received by state officials i 
think the students won said gov buddy roemer 
im for it if it will improve the education of our students in 
louisiana if lsu will be enhanced as the flagship university and 
if we can provide a good education for our young people at a 
reduced cost said jack andonie chairman of the lsu board of 
supervisors 
louisiana currently has four boards of higher education 
overseeing 17 institutions under the plan proposed by special 
master paul verkuil president of william and mary college in 
virginia those boards would merge into one unified governing body 
with 17 voting members and a student member 
verkuil was appointed after black leaders educators and 
politicians were unable to reach an agreement to end a 15yearold 
lawsuit brought against the state by the us justice department 
since december 1987 the state of louisiana the justice 
department southern university and the grambling alumni 
association have been trying to come up with a desegregation 
proposal after an earlier settlement expired 
black leaders had feared a single higher education board would 
be insensitive to the needs of louisianas two major predominantly 
black universities grambling state university in north louisiana 
and the southern university system based in baton rouge 
grambling is governed by the board of regents and board of 
trustees which oversees most of the predominantly white 
institutions southern has its own governing board 
a threejudge federal panel that appointed verkuil will have the 
final say on the proposal 
the plan rejected the notion of closing or merging state 
universities for the time being perhaps the most dreaded aspect of 
the desegregation talks 
the governor got much of what the state wanted from the 
negotiations including the superboard which he was unable to push 
through the legislature last year 
we asked that the schools not be closed but that the boards 
be merged and the master has done this roemer said he gave 
us some guidelines now well have to work with the legislature to 
see how much and how far he has gone 
it may do for louisiana what we could not do because of the 
politics of the circumstances namely the competition among the 
college systems said state sen armand brinkhaus chairman of the 
senate education committee 
brinkhaus compared the situation to the public school 
desegregation fights of the 1960s when federal court orders 
overrode state law 
we need to integrate our colleges all of our citizens need to 
have the same opportunities andonie said but i dont know if 
the plan is going to work 
a representative of the board of trustees for state colleges and 
universities said verkuil has given the state an opportunity to 
properly integrate its higher education institutions 
he has done it very wisely said david mccormick vice 
president for academic and research affairs he did what the 
governor asked he said let me get my one board in place and give 
that board the responsibility for doing these things 
sally clausen commissioner of higher education said my 
initial reaction is this is probably the least disruptive set of 
recommendations that holds promise for desegregation and increased 
accessibility

everybody gets a date to the prom at tiny 
aquin central catholic high school but the ordeal of picking your 
partner is replaced by the luck of the draw 
aquins 63yearold prom draw gives every girl a shot at going 
to the prom with the football captain and every boy a chance to 
date the head cheerleader boys names each in a sealed envelope 
are drawn from a plastic milk crate then matched with girls names 
drawn from another crate 
the parochial schools version of the dating game started 
late last week with 32 junior and senior boys bunched anxiously on 
wooden bleachers at the gym 
for some of you this will be the most agonizing 45 minutes 
youll go through in a while enjoy it said bill pospischil 
athletic director at the 113student school 
after the drawing he said each boy should go to the cafeteria 
where 32 aquin girls waited and ask for a date from the girl they 
draw 
what if they say no asked junior jeff franz a bunch of 
flowers by his sneakerclad feet 
they will not say no replied pospischil as he reached into 
a crate to draw the first name 
the system sounds like one that teenagers might hate but every 
time students get a chance to vote on it they overwhelmingly 
approve it said school officials in this northwestern illinois 
city 
the good thing about it is its exciting and everyone gets a 
chance to go said amy schopf a junior besides i got a good

stanford university students gave a 
bminus wednesday to the first computerized election in 
california but state officials graded it incomplete for a 
general election 
a few hardware problems laser printers that sometimes forgot 
all their fonts and couldnt record coded versions of the ballots 
caused some long lines when some polling places shut down briefly 
but no hackers appeared to break into the system as student 
election officials feared 
we were anticipating a lot of cracker jacks trying to get into 
it but we havent noticed anything said student elections 
commissioner steve krauss 
the estimated turnout of more than 6000 voters over two days 
easily surpassed the 3159 voters at a similar election last week 
at boston university the stanford vote thus became the nations 
largest test yet of whether computer terminals can replace paper 
ballots 
it was very simple to use and much easier than pressing the 
pins in the little holes on punchcard ballots said sophomore 
tammy svoboda a member of stanfords womens basketball team 
i think it would be good for general elections especially for 
the younger generation she said it might be a little bit 
scary for the older generation who havent used computers but once 
someone showed them theyd be all right 
most students rated the system which used macintosh computers 
made by apple computer inc and software developed by sophomore 
sandy aronson as very user friendly 
votes for the nearly 100 candidates for student senate and 
council of presidents were expected to be tallied within two hours 
of the closing of the polls wednesday night last year it took 
five days to get official results 
in addition this years election cost about 3000 less than 
the 1300 price tag a year ago 
state officials observing the vote as a possible forerunner of 
general elections in the 21st century came away impressed but not 
yet convinced that the voting public is ready to pick its leaders 
by computer mouse 
general elections would require a direct record of a persons 
vote not data on a hard disk that could possibly be altered or a 
coded printout that might not reflect the voters choice said john 
mottsmith coordinator of voter outreach programs for the 
california secretary of states office 
despite the problems krauss said he would give the computerized 
system a bminus theres plenty of room for improvement were 
not making any pretense about its ability to handle a general 
election 
paper ballots didnt vanish completely they were still used for 
voting by students at stanfords three overseas campuses for 
absentee ballots and for those who simply refuse to use the 
computers

some new hampshire residents will have a 
long weekend thanks to a state holiday born in 1681 out of fear 
that its first governor was going to die monday is fast day 
until four years ago the fourth monday in april was observed 
widely as a spring thanksgiving with all state offices closed but 
the states contract with its workers now has made fast day a 
floating holiday an optional day off that allows state offices 
to stay open 
although state offices will be open some city and town offices 
will close schools and banks will close federal offices will be 
open and stores will have sales 
fast day began with john cutt about whom little is known other 
than he was president of the royal province of new hampshire by 
grace of charles ii and that he sometimes spelled his name cutts 
cutt was the richest merchant in portsmouth the colonial 
capital on may 6 1680 when he was 60 he had a foreboding of his 
death and wrote his will by next year the welsh immigrant was so 
ill that the colonial general assembly declared a day of fasting 
humiliation and prayer for his recovery 
it was a peculiarly new england custom to declare days of 
fasting and prayer whenever the colonists felt threatened by 
catastrophe 
the first known fast day was observed by massachusetts after the 
drought of 1622 in 1894 massachusetts substituted fast day with 
patriots day to observe the start of the revolutionary war 
massachusetts and maine observe patriots day on the third monday in 
april 
new hampshires theological cure for cutt failed he died on 
april 1 1681 
new hampshire used to observe as many as three fast days a year 
by 1899 the legislature decided on one and in 1949 with a view 
toward a threeday weekend the legislature settled on the fourth 
monday in april 
the nature of the observance has changed church attendance used 
to be mandatory 
the 10shilling fine against those taking part in labour 
business or work of their ordinary calling was lifted long ago 
recreation no longer is forbidden 
now the holiday comes as new hampshires long winter gives way 
to spring when snow tires and storm windows are packed away in 
garages when schools begin a week of vacation and when golf 
courses become snowfree

something on the roof the driver said he immediately tried to 
accelerate but the bomb exploded 
cristiani who was having breakfast with foreign correspondents 
when the attack occurred condemned what he termed the brutal 
assassination by marxist guerrillas

sympathizers could use to isolate his government

noted such personnel frequently double as combatants the embassy 
based its conclusions on armed forces information he said

israelis gathered for festive meals wednesday 
to begin passover the holiday commemorating the liberation of the 
ancient israelites from slavery security forces were on high alert 
in case of guerrilla attacks 
thousands of people went to resorts on the red sea 
mediterranean and sea of galilee in tel aviv secular israelis 
jammed beaches and outdoor restaurants 
army and police alerts were ordered because the 16monthold 
palestinian uprising in the occupied territories increased fear of 
guerrilla attacks during the holiday 
the army stepped up its forces to prevent infiltrations across 
israels borders since january 31 guerrillas have been killed in 
a dozen attacks along the border with lebanon 
police were out in force in jerusalems walled old city to 
prevent disruptions of religious services a national police 
spokesman said 
in downtown jerusalem police discovered a small explosive 
device in a paint bucket left on the sidewalk near a cafe but 
experts defused it police spokesman uzi sandori reported 
passover which commemorates the flight of the israelites from 
egypt began at sundown wednesday with a traditional meal known as 
the seder it includes such symbolic foods as bitter herbs to 
remind jews of the harshness of their enslavement and an 
unleavened bread called matzoh 
during the weeklong holiday many jews abstain from bread beer 
and other products made with yeast to remember the israelites who 
left egypt so quickly they had no time to leaven their bread 
the holiday derives its name from the book of exodus which 
recounts that god passed over the homes of israelites when 
meting out the worst of 10 plagues and killed the firstborn of 
every egyptian the plagues forced the pharaoh to let the jews 
leave egypt 
in tel aviv us ambassador william a brown participated in a 
symbolic outdoor seder organized by soviet jewish activists to 
thank the united states for supporting soviet jews who have been 
refused permission to emigrate 
organizers set up a table on the sidewalk across the street from 
the embassy serving wine and traditional passover dishes

serving in the occupied west bank and gaza strip were given grape 
juice instead of the traditional four cups of red wine an army 
spokesman said 
in a goodwill gesture for the holiday more than 700 prisoners 
serving time for criminal offenses were given forloughs of two to 
four days said shuli meiri a prison services spokeswoman

requiring them to supply information for collection orders promptly 
in the past some states have not given sufficient attention 
to such efforts said health and human srvices secretary louis

support obligations and receiving and distributing support 
payments the regulations also provide criteria for states to use 
in determining whether to close a child support case 
states would be required to comply with those time limits by 
oct 1 1990 
the regulations were published in wednesdays federal register 
the department of health and human services set a 60day comment

attackers ambushed and shot up the first 
truck convoy of a un famine relief effort intended to save 
100000 lives in the southern sudan war zone killing seven armed 
escorts un officials said wednesday 
they said a civilian driver and two assistants were wounded and 
radio reports from the scene identified the slain escorts as 
members of the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
un officials in nairobi did not affix blame for the attack on 
the 14truck convoy but speculation centered on nomadic tribal 
warriors army soldiers or governmentsponsored militias operating 
against the rebels 
the attack occurred tuesday about 20 miles west of kapoeta a 
rebel base in southeastern sudan 50 miles north of the kenya 
border it was another setback for operation lifelinesudan the 
132 million un relief program plagued by delays caused by 
bureaucracy bad weather and equipment shortages 
relief officials said the trucks were carrying 100 tons of food 
medicine and other supplies to torit 100 miles west of kapoeta 
when they were halted by rocket and automatic weapons fire 
it was the first convoy to torit under the unsponsored effort 
to stockpile more than 100000 tons of supplies in southern sudan 
before heavy rains beginning next month make transport virtually 
impossible 
even before the attack un officials had conceded they 
probably could not meet their goals before the rainy season which 
lasts until november 
we think it is an isolated incident we dont think it 
represents a breach of agreement on the part of either party 
said diane weathers a un world food program spokeswoman in 
nairobi 
a statement issued in new york by james p grant personal 
representative of secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar for the 
project said the united nations would like to draw the worlds 
attention to the dangerous consequences that repetition of such 
action could have on the future of operation lifelinesudan 
operation lifeline began april 1 after agreement in march by the 
sudanese government and rebels to allow relief supplies through 
their lines for a month western relief organizations say up to 
half a million people died in southern sudan last year of 
starvation caused by the 6yearold civil war drought and floods 
rebels led by former army col john garang demand greater 
autonomy and more economic help for the blacks of the south most 
of whom are christians or animists from the arabs in the moslem 
north who control the government 
a french monitor for the world food program was riding with the 
convoy and reported the attack tuesday night to officials 
coordinating the relief operation from nairobi 
paul mitchell a un spokesman said the lead vehicle was 
destroyed by some sort of missile and the rebel escorts came 
under fire from automatic weapons 
he said the escorts were believed to be members of the sudan 
relief and rehabilitation association an agency of the rebel army 
ms weathers said they were armed 
mitchell said use of operation lifelines overland route to 
torit from kapoeta would be suspended indefinitely but an airlift

transportation secretary samuel skinner told 
the senate wednesday that industry plans for responding to 
catastrophes such as last months alaskan oil spill were zero 
and said federal and state officials should have required 
improvements 
skinner also said he was disappointed in exxons response to 
the 10million gallon oil spill that occurred when a tanker 
collided with a wellmarked reef in prince william sound on march 
24 
testifying before the same senate subcommittee a top exxon 
official acknowleged that industry plans for so massive a spill 
were inadequate but william stevens president of exxon company 
usa disputed any claim that his companys response had been slow 
yet one republican senator john chafee of rhode island 
ridiculed exxons early efforts to deal with the environmental 
damage 
from all accounts the cleanup crews initially responding to 
this spill acted more like the keystone kops than the welltrained 
oil spill response team described in the industrys contingency 
plan he said 
most witnesses before the senates environmental protection 
subcommittee from federal officials to alaskas governor and 
industry executives said that plans for dealing with a spill of 
oil from the alaskan pipeline had not imagined an accident on the 
magnitude of the spill that followed the grounding of the exxon 
valdez 
skinner asked to evaluate the plan developed by a consortium of 
oil companies that ship oil from alaskas north slope through the 
pipeline and valdez harbor said the document should not have been 
approved by the state and should have brought warnings from the 
federal government that the plan was inadequate 
on the scale of one to 10 it was a zero skinner said of 
the standby procedures 
the secretary told the panel that before the tanker ran 
aground everyone had assumed that this would never happen 
i dont think anybody was ready to deal with a spill of this 
magnitude said skinner whose department oversees the coast 
guard 
the subcommittees chairman sen max baucus dmont 
complained that there has never been a time when this situation 
was under control 
he said the response to the spill has demonstrated a complete 
breakdown of the procedures that were supposed to have been in 
effect since the federal government approved the alaskan pipeline 
16 years ago 
alaska gov steve cowper blamed complacency at all levels for 
the poor preparedness but also said that there had not been 
adequate equipment on hand that channels of authority were unclear 
and that a lack of leadership and direction in the critical hours 
after the spill further delayed cleanup efforts 
he suggested that alaskans had trusted the oil industry which 
accounts for 85 percent of the state governments revenue to take 
precautions we feel like weve been assaulted he told the 
senators 
skinner said the bush administrations decision to leave the 
primary responsibility for the cleanup in exxons hands stemmed 
from a belief that the company had committed itself to the cleanup 
and had the technical expertise to deal with the problem he 
said he has been disappointed that the giant oil company has 
not been able to assemble resources more effectively to better 
protect the alaska coastline 
exxon president stevens said that before the march 24 accident 
such a severe accident was viewed as so highly unlikely that the 
consequences of it were viewed as acceptable 
sen ted stevens ralaska said that the effects of the spill 
will last many years and that the price tag could exceed 1 
billion suggesting that many americans still cannot comprehend the 
extent of damage he said the area touched by contamination is the 
size of three of the great lakes and that if the spill had occurred 
in portland maine the oil today would be almost down to 
washington dc 
some members of the committee complained about president bushs 
reaction with majority leader george mitchell of maine saying bush 
had been slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster 
although the coast guard has been involved in the cleanup since 
the start bush did not provide for stepped up federal 
participation until april 7 two weeks after the spill when he put 
adm paul yost the coast guard commandant in charge and committed 
military assistance to the effort 
stevens the alaska senator said he too had been disappointed 
that the president did not act more quickly telling the committee 
if a sea fence had been deployed within a matter of hours this 
would have been a containable spill 
bush himself has said he may have acted too slowly telling the 
american society of newspaper editors last week that as for the 
commitment of federal assistance maybe i should accept some 
criticism on whether i should have done this a week before we did 
if theres a lesson here that one agency or another might have 
moved faster i will be the first to learn from that

the soviet government newspaper izvestia said 
wednesday that some victims of a clash between soldiers and 
protesters in soviet georgia are suffering from a poison resembling 
a nerve toxin 
izvestias interview with georgias health minister irakliy 
menagarishvili appeared to bolster charges by activists in the 
southern republic that soldiers used a toxic substance to break up 
a nationalist demonstration april 9 on tbilisis main street 
the clash killed 20 people 
izvestia did not say how many of the 140 people still 
hospitalized after the confrontation were suffering from symptoms 
of poisoning 
the new georgian communist party chief givi g gumbaridze said 
in an interview on soviet television wednesday that the situation 
remained tense in georgia despite lifting a curfew and withdrawing 
soldiers 
a wall of alienation remains he said it is necessary 
that the people discover the truth 
gumbaridze the former kgb chief of georgia last week replaced 
dzhumber i patiashvili who accepted responsibility for the 
bloodshed and resigned 
menagarishvili told izvestia leading toxicologists believed the 
substance used on protesters had an irritating and atropinelike 
effect 
he said scientists in tbilisi moscow and leningrad were 
involved in diagnosing the cases 
atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid in large doses it 
can induce nerve paralysis and delirium it can cause death through 
combined cardiac and respiratory failure 
georgian activists claim that people died after being gassed 
but officials have not confirmed this 
the communist party newspaper pravda on wednesday said interior 
ministry officials acknowledged tear gas was used in two places to 
break up protesters but pravda quoted the unidentified spokeman as 
saying regular army soldiers could not have used gas because it is 
not standard issue 
unfortunately this crucial admission came several days late 
and was made only after the level of passions had reached the 
highest degree pravda said 
the tass news agency said failure to promptly acknowledge what 
was done led to fantastic rumors and allegations which made 
people mistrust official reports 
when asked at a briefing wednesday whether nerve gas was used in 
georgia foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh replied that 
was impossible because it is a combat weapon 
six newly elected deputies to a national parliament asked 
wednesday that better laws be developed to control troops and 
public officials so demonstrations do not repeatedly end in tragedy 
the six returned from a visit to georgia and included their 
findings in a letter to the weekly moscow news 
they demanded that material gathered by investigators be turned 
over to the new congress of peoples deputies parliament when it 
meets for the first time next month 
the absence of precise legal norms in the event of extreme 
situations creates unlimited possibilities for the taking of 
arbitrary uncontrollable decisions which can have unpredictable 
consequences their letter warned 
they scolded officials for refusing journalists access to 
tbilisi and accused them of covering up the soldiers use of 
shovels as weapons and of gas 
foreign reporters have been barred from georgia since the clash 
almost 5000 civilian volunteers now patrol the streets of 
tbilisi and maintain order in place of departing troops media 
reports said 
reports from the georgian capital said no serious incidents 
followed lifting of the curfew there tuesday morning 
tass said streets were patrolled by members of a public order 
squad wearing red arm bands and more police than usual were on the 
streets

the state will pay for premier andreas 
papandreous libel suit against time magazine for publishing 
accusations by a greek fugitive banker that papandreou received 
millions of dollars in payoffs a government spokesman said 
wednesday 
spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said at his daily news briefing 
that papandreou sued the american newsmagazine as premier of 
greece so all expenses incurred by this suit will be paid by 
the greek state which will be reimbursed from the damages received 
from the positive outcome of the trial 
kostopoulos confirmed that new york attorney leonard boudin 
already has been paid 100000 through the greek embassy in 
washington to handle the suit he did not disclose how much money 
papandreou seeks in damages 
boudin said in new york monday that the suit was brought against 
time in london because in britain he need show only that the story 
written about papandreou was libelous and damaged his reputation 
without regard to whether he is a public figure 
time ran an interview with george koskotas former chairman of 
the bank of crete in its march 13 issue koskotas alleged that 
papandreou and senior members of his governing party the 
panhellenic socialist movement or pasok received millions of 
dollars in payoffs in return for political favors 
time officials said attempts were made to obtain papandreous 
and the governments side of the story before it was published but 
they were rebuffed 
koskotas arrived in america days after he fled greece in 
november he was arrested and jailed in salem mass where he has 
granted interviews to the media he awaits hearing on a greek 
petition for his extradition 
the 200 million embezzlement scandal at the bank of crete has 
been front page news in greece since it broke last october 
eight ministers resigned and eight pasokappointed officials 
from state enterprises were accused of accepting stolen money 
from the bank of crete and were imprisoned 
koskotas bodyguards told investigators they personally 
delivered cartons stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars to a 
close friend of the premiers 
at an earlier news briefing this month spokesman kostopoulos 
branded koskotas a swindler who had connections with 
highranking american officials and alleged that they were behind 
the scandal 
he echoed papandreous repeated charges that foreign 
decisionmaking centers initiated the campaign to undermine greece 
and smear the premiers name

president bush told a group of congressional 
leaders wednesday that he hasnt decision on future development of 
the mx nuclear missile the legislators said 
hes indicated hes working on the mx issue and hes anxious 
to receive the input from a wide variety of individuals on capitol 
hill said sen john warner rva he did not in any way strike 
a note of finality 
warner and other legislators said they didnt know whether bush 
would support building a mobile version of the mx would back the 
smaller midgetman missile or some combination of the two 
bush discussed the issue with house and senate members of both 
parties he convened the group along with his top foreign policy 
advisers in what he intends to use as an occasional chance to 
consult with them on general foreign policy his staff said 
the missile question is part of an effort to build new weapons 
for the landbased leg of the us nuclear arsenal bushs options 
are to base new 10warhead mx missiles on rail cars a system 
favored by air force generals or develop a new singlewarhead 
missile known as the midgetman to be housed on trucks 
the midgetman is far more costly with a price tag of nearly 24 
billion for 500 singlewarhead missiles compared to 54 billion 
for the same capability on the multiwarhead mx according to air 
force estimates 
the united states currently has 50 mx missiles based in silos in 
wyoming and nebraska in addition to the multiwarhead minuteman 
missiles 
the soviets have deployed two mobile systems the ss25 with one 
warhead and the ss24 with 10 warheads 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said those of us who think its important to have a 
midgetman in the package got to make our case if the presidents 
made his mind up he didnt reveal it 
aspin said he argued that the issue is critically important 
for achieving a strategic arms reduction treaty with the soviets 
the bush administration is engaged in an overall review of 
national security and foreign policy 
members of congress who met with bush didnt fault the white 
house for that long process 
this is a new administration its a new congress i dont know 
who came up with the idea that president bush could just simply 
move in and everything would be right on track and there would be 
no review no slowdown said rep dante fascell dfla chairman 
of the house foreign affairs committee theyre not taking 
anything at face value or past value i find that very comforting

housing secretary jack kemp on wednesday eased 
away from a commitment by the bush administration to replace 
expiring housing subsidy certificates with vouchers 
while not announcing a policy reversal kemp told a house 
subcommittee that the department of housing and urban development 
was looking for some way to take the best characteristics of the 
section 8 certificate and the voucher and marry them 
i dont want to be the secretary of vouchers i really 
strongly believe we need housing and economic development and 
vouchers are a tool to give people a choice said kemp 
kemps comments came in an apppearance before the house 
appropriations subcommittee on hud and independent agencies where 
he presented the agencys 1990 budget request a day after the full 
committee voted to add 153 million under the mckinney homeless 
assistance act to the agencys 1989 budget departments 1990 
budget request 
replacement of certificates with vouchers originated with former 
president reagans 1990 budget proposal and was retained in the 
revisions bush submitted to congress in february 
about 1 million lowincome households receive rental assistance 
subsidies through the two programs 
subsidies in the hud section 8 certificate are based on the 
difference between 30 percent of a familys adjusted monthly income 
and actual rent which cannot exceed the fair market rent for the 
area in which the family lives 
beginning in 1989 subsidies for 780000 certificates will 
expire over a 12year period 
a recent study by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress concluded that with huds 1989 
budget request about 9500 or 6 percent fewer families can be 
assisted with vouchers than with certificates 
the report also said it would cost an additional 208 million to 
assist the same number of families with vouchers 
they are more expensive than the certificate but the 
purpose was not to compete against the certificate the purpose was 
to give choice give people a chance to upgrade kemp told 
the panel 
but he said he was open to looking at a mix of both as a part of 
huds housing subsidy program 
id also like to have somebody think of how we can take a 
voucher or a certificate and have an element in there that would 
give people some equity some chance of maybe using it as a 
potential for making a down payment someday kemp added 
i commend secretary kemp for taking a fresh look at this 
issue the recent gao report showed that the housing voucher 
program hasnt lived up to expectations i stand ready to work with 
secretary kemp to develop a program that will provide 
moderateincome pepole with the housing they need and at a price we 
can afford said sen barbara mikulski dmd chairman of 
senates hud appropriations subcommittee that had requested the gao 
study

the senate on wednesday approved a record 157 
billion bailout and reform bill for the savings and loan industry 
after toughening provisions that would require sampl owners to put 
more of their own money at risk to stay in business 
the 564page bill was approved on a 918 vote two months after 
president bush called for emergency legislation to stop the 
hemorrhaging of the federal sampl insurance fund from the failure of 
500 thrifts more than 200 of them in 1988 and another 350 at or 
near insolvency 
the legislation reprsents the biggest government financial 
rescue in history dwarfing five times over the combined costs of 
the new york city penn central chrysler and lockheed bailouts of 
the 1970s and early 1980s 
the administration praised the senates action particularly 
after it rejected an alternative financing scheme to put the 
immediate 50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout on this years 
budget and create the potential for the biggest federal deficit in 
the nations history 
the senate deserves a great deal of credit for acting 
swiftly said treasury secretary nicholas brady in fending off 
amendments to the financing mechanism the senate has upheld the 
integrity of the grammrudman deficit reduction process we also 
applaud the senates efforts to maintain strong capital 
requirements 
the bush plan avoids swelling the budget deficit by creating a 
new quasigovernment corporation to issue 50 billion in 30year 
bonds the savings and loan industry will pay off the principle on 
the bonds but tax dollars will be used to pay virtually all of the 
4 billion to 6 billion annual interest costs 
democrats had contended those interest costs could be reduced 
150 million a year or by a total of 45 billion over the 30year 
life of the bonds through direct borrowing by the treasury 
similar sampl legislation is moving through the house but at a 
slower pace final congressional action is expected before july 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio had threatened to delay passage 
and force the senate to cut short its 11day recess for passover if 
it did not adopt a tougher capital standard and mandate that banks 
and sampls provide a series of free and lowcost consumer services 
after lengthy negotiations members of the senate banking 
committee agreed to make sampls have at least 15 percent socalled 
tangible capital in relation to their total loans that could be 
seized in the future before federal insurance funds are tapped to 
pay off depositors in failed thrifts 
bushs proposal would have required sampls to double their 
capitalloan ratio from the currently required 3 percent to 6 
percent by 1991 but it would have allowed thrifts to meet the new 
requirements entirely through the use of an accounting technique 
that allows nonmoney good will as capital 
the new 15 percent requirement for tangible capital cash 
stocks and property that could easily be converted to cash also 
was adopted by the house banking committees financial institutions 
subcommittee last week 
but the house panel weakened other capital requirements in 
bushs proposal according to consumer group critics 
the senate banking committees chairman sen donald riegle 
dmich promised metzenbaum speedy hearings and efforts to write 
bills to address changes in banking laws sought largely by consumer 
groups 
among them are measures that would require banks and sampls to 
cash all government checks provide lowincome people with lowcost 
checking and publish data on their lending for improving lowincome 
neigborhoods and loans to minorities 
it isnt all that i would like in the bill but weve come to 
an understanding metzenbaum said just before the vote 
the bill tracks the proposal presented in february by bush 
pledging 157 billion over the next 10 years twothirds of it 
from taxpayers to cover depositors against losses and calling for 
widescale reforms 
chief among them was that sampl owners be required to effectively 
double their own investment to remain in business because many 
operators of failed sampls had little of their own money at risk 
they had little incentive to refrain from making risky loans using 
federally insured deposits according to bush 
the package includes money to pay for some 38 billion committed 
last year to close or subsidize the mergers of more than 200 sampls 
50 billion to be spent over the next three years for rescuing 350 
more institutions and 33 billion to handle new insolvencies 
expected to arise before the year 2000 
to fulfill bushs promise of never again the legislation 
also effectively replaces the agency that oversees federally 
insured thrift institutions the federal home loan bank board 
which has been widely criticized as being too close to the 
industry with a new regulatory authority to be established under 
the treasury department 
the sampl deposit insurance program would be transferred to the 
federal deposit insurance corp which now guarantees bank 
deposits both programs guarantee depositors against losses up to 
100000 each 
and the legislation establishes a new agency the resolution 
trust corp to dispose of some 400 billion in real estate and 
other property that is falling into the governments hands through 
defaults on bad loans made by failed sampls 
the package also increases from 10000 a day to 1 million a 
day the possible fines for sampl operators convicted of fraud which 
has been cited by government auditors as the single biggest 
contributor to the crisis and provides 50 million to the justice 
department to pursue criminal charges 
earlier wednesday the senate rejected on a 6138 vote an effort 
aimed at the bank boards chairman m danny wall who has been 
widely criticized as minimizing the escalation of sampl problems last 
year 
sen bob graham dfla complained that walls reassuring 
comments as late as one month before the presidential election in 
november amounted to an intravenous shot of morphine that would 
have numbed anyone to the crisis 
wall was an aide to sen jake garn of utah the banking 
committees ranking republican and former chairman for 17 years 
before assuming the top sampl regulatory post in july 1987 
the administration and garn want to guarantee wall the right to 
serve out his term through june 1991 graham would have required 
bush to reappoint him forcing a likely confirmation fight with the 
senate 
on passage of the bill by the senate all the no votes were cast 
by democrats sens max baucus of montana bill bradley of new 
jersey kent conrad of north dakota james exon of nebraska ernest 
f hollings of south carolina robert kerrey of nebraska

under the bright lights of a tent often 
used for basketball games in this seaside town about 1700 jewish 
emigres celebrated their first passover outside the soviet union 
for many who could not learn the rudiments of their faith in 
their officially atheist homeland the ceremony wednesday was the 
first real experience the holiday commemorating the release of the 
ancient israelites from bondage in egypt 
the emigres who await visas for the united states or other 
countries were guided through the service by rabbi hirsch rabiski 
who emigrated from the soviet union 15 years ago and now ministers 
to the estimated 4000 jews in ladispoli 
he carefully explained in russian the significance of the 
passover meal the seder and introduced the rituals the refugees 
at small tables with their families listened politely and some 
whispered questions to neighbors 
this is all so difficult to take in said a doctor from baky 
in azerbaijan province who identified herself only as yana she 
said she felt overwhelmed by so much knowledge about a faith she 
had always identified with but had not learned well 
the seder was paid for and organized by the american jewish 
joint distribution committee which cares for the emigres from 
arrival in austria through the transfer to italy the main us 
visa processing point to their departure weeks or months later 
it gives them money provides information about life in the west 
and teaches the customs and history of the jews 
many of the emigres living in holiday accommodations at 
ladispoli a seaside resort 25 miles from rome 
rabiski said wednesday night the passover at ladispoli was 
particularly poignant because those who attended were in flight 
like the israelites from egypt 
gail cohen a representative of the joint distribution 
committee said many of the emigres had attended lectures about the 
ceremony and helped set up tables in the tent which often is used 
for basketball games

a retired librarian convicted of shooting 
six people to death and trying to kill 24 others in a 1987 shopping 
center rampage deserves the death penalty a jury recommended 
wednesday 
william cruse 61 sat hunched over the defense table and showed 
no emotion as the recommendation was read to circuit judge john 
antoon after 1 hours of deliberations 
antoon who is not bound by the recommendation but said he would 
give it great weight set sentencing for july 28 
the jury which could have recommended a life prison sentence 
instead of death convicted cruse on april 5 of 32 counts of 
murder attempted murder and kidnapping 
the rampage occurred on april 23 1987 at two shopping centers 
in palm bay 30 miles south of cape canaveral on floridas east 
coast the dead included two policemen 
cruse declared war on the community of palm bay state 
attorney norm wolfinger said after wednesdays decision the jury 
verdicts were very appropriate 
jury foreman wayne hogan said a videotape of cruses police 
interrogation strongly influenced the 12member panels decision 
juror edward cook said we all felt the same he knew what he was 
doing 
defense attorneys refused to comment they had contended cruse 
was insane at the time of the slayings 
in closing arguments earlier wednesday state attorney norm 
wolfinger ridiculed the insanity defense 
evidence has shown that this defendant has forfeited his right 
to live on earth the prosecutor said he is a cold 
calculating killer he deserves to die 
wolfinger held up a shotgun and a semiautomatic assault rifle 
used in the rampage he pumped the shotgun several times and popped 
an ammunition clip into the rifle repeatedly 
he was going to kill as many people as he could he said 
despite evidence of mental illness cruse showed he was in total 
control of his faculties when he methodially tracked down his 
victims and shot at them repeatedly some as they lay wounded and 
moaning on the ground wolfinger said 
assistant public defender paul arlt argued that the rampage 
would never have happened if cruse had not been suffering from 
mental or emotional disturbance 
mr cruse that day was a bubbling cauldron that finally 
exploded arlt said in his closing argument

she was moved from the pediatric intensive care unit to a 
childrens room hospital spokesman david richards said

7up and apple juice and her mood is quiet

the questions about the explosion havent come yet

stuffed animals and hundreds of calls expressing sympathy for erin 
and her parents who have another daughter 
the first thing they say is this was so horrible i just 
wanted to let the parents know im praying for them said mrs 
young the bombing makes people feel so vulnerable like this

arrest and conviction of those responsible but sheriffs 
department spokesman scott minier said store officials would be 
urged to raise the reward to at least 10000 because of the

memoirs of a former call girl who later worked as a government 
researcher printed a picture of her with us house speaker jim 
wright in thursdays editions 
early editions of the daily mail said the picture of pamella 
bordes and the texas democrat now under investigation for alleged 
unethical conduct was taken during a 1983 meeting in wrights 
office on capitol hill 
the london tabloid which bought the rights to ms bordes 
story said at that time she was working for the indian mystic and 
businessman chandra swami the meeting was arranged by the swami 
who had business connections in washington the paper reported 
among the things discussed according to those close to the 
swami was the possibility of obtaining a green card permit for 
pamella officially to become an american resident the newspaper 
said 
unknown to jim wright this was at a time when she was in her 
own words working as sex bait for the swamis international 
business deals at the meeting the swami presented mr wright with 
some ceremonial gifts and pleaded with him to help pamella 
his wrights staff sent a copy of this picture to pamella 
signed with his best wishes 
the newspaper said a spokesman for wright said the office 
remembered the meeting with swamis group but did not recall 
doing anything to help her obtain a green card 
wright has denied charges by the house ethics committee that he 
violated house rules in 69 instances involving an unusual book 
publishing deal and his benefits from a business partnership 
the first installment of ms bordes memoirs printed in 
wednesdays daily mail contained lurid tales of sex with financier 
adnan khashoggi with a saudi prince and with a top aide to libyas

miss bordes 26 who was miss india in 1982 was quoted as 
saying she got money from al diam and stayed in touch with him 
until shortly before she got a job last year as a researcher in the 
british parliament

background and raised questions about whether national security was 
compromised by allowing free movement in the house of commons to a 
woman with highlevel libyan connections 
miss bordes fled to the island of bali was tracked down by 
british reporters and offered her story to the highest bidder

a huge gun turret packed with gunpowder 
exploded in flames on the battleship uss iowa near puerto rico on 
wednesday killing at least 47 sailors in one of the worst naval 
disasters since the vietnam war 
the death toll from the accident during a gunnery exercise 
could go higher but we dont know at this point said lt 
cmdr steve burnett a spokesman for the atlantic fleet based in 
norfolk the death count was taken from a list of sailors assigned 
to the position rather than a body count 
the number of crewmen injured had not been determined he said 
two ships participating in the same exercise collided wednesday 
afternoon about 500 miles east of jacksonville fla causing one 
minor injury said archie galloway a civilian public affairs 
officer at norfolk 
neither the uss platt a fleet oiler nor the frigate uss tripp 
was in danger of sinking galloway said the ships were not in the 
same area as the iowa 
the explosion occurred in one of the iowas three heavily 
armored turrets each of which supports three of the ships nine 
16inch guns the turret was full of gunpowder said lt cmdr 
chris baumann another fleet spokesman 
iowa crewmen put out the fire in 80 minutes flooded several 
magazine compartments holding explosives as a precaution and 
declared the ship out of danger baumann said 
the iowa rendezvoused at midafternoon with the nearby aircraft 
carrier uss coral sea which carries three doctors and has full 
medical facilities baumann said helicopters from the coral sea 
brought medical equipment to the iowa and transferred some injured 
crewmen to the carrier 
the ship has not sent a list of the wounded they have other 
things more pressing to worry about said lt russ grier an 
atlantic fleet spokesman 
the iowa will arrive thursday at roosevelt roads a navy base in 
puerto rico said cmdr robert franzmann of the atlantic fleet the 
46yearold ship one of the four largest in the fleet is based at 
norfolk 
burn victims from the iowa were being evacuated to brooke army 
medical center specialized burn unit in san antonio texas 
according to medical official in puerto rico 
navy officials were notifying relatives personally of the 
deaths baumann said several family members gathered at a 
gymnasium in norfolk to await word 
the longer we hear nothing the better it is said sandy 
tate of charleston wva a relative of crewman jonathan tate 
the explosion occurred during a gunnery exercise about 330 miles 
northeast of puerto rico burnett said the ships 16inch guns can 
fire 2700pound shells a distance of 23 miles 
the fire was in the second of the two forward turrets at the 
loading position of the middle gun said bruce nason a navy 
spokesman at the pentagon there also is a turret at the back of 
the iowa each turret is protected by armor that is 17 inches 
thick 
there was no sign of the accident visible during a flyover of 
the ship 
a gun turret is normally occupied by 27 people but can hold 60 
or 70 people baumann said but we dont know how many people 
were in there at the time 
mark newton a former marine who spent a week as a guest on the 
iowa in 1987 and now is curator of the permanently docked uss 
massachusetts in fall river mass explained how a shell is loaded 
after the shell is placed in the gun a door is opened to the 
gun room from the powder hoist room he said cylindrical powder 
bags containing about 110 pounds of powder are then rammed in 
behind the shell and what is called a breech plug is sealed to 
prevent the leakage of powder gases 
newton said there were at least five stages in the firing 
process when the explosion could have occurred but would not 
speculate further 
the training exercise to improve fleet readiness began april 13 
and involved 19000 people aboard 29 us ships three allied ships 
and shorebased aircraft baumann said 
there were 1600 people aboard the iowa including vice adm 
jeremiah johnson commander of us 2nd fleet 
it was believed to be the worst loss of life involving a navy 
ship since june 2 1969 when the destroyer uss frank e evans 
collided with the australian aircraft carrier melbourne in the 
south china sea killing 74 people an iraqi missile attack on the 
uss stark in may 1987 killed 37 crewmen and wounded 21 
a similar explosion occurred in the center gun turret aboard the 
heavy cruiser uss newport news during the vietnam war in october 
1972 killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36 
it is a great tragedy and a matter of terrible sadness 
president bush said in washington i will take this opportunity 
to express my regrets especially to the families of the kids that 
were killed 
in addition to its massive 16inch guns the 887foot iowa is 
equipped with 12 fiveinch guns and tomahawk and harpoon missiles 
it was the model for three other iowaclass battleships and is 
among the most heavily armored of us warships 
the iowa and its sister ships the new jersey the missouri and 
the wisconsin are the largest battleships ever built except for 
two japanese ships of the world war ii era the yamato and the 
musashi 
the navy in accordance with policy would not confirm or deny 
whether the ship carried nuclear weapons 
the iowa was built during world war ii mothballed until the 
korean war and mothballed again it was modernized and reactivated 
in 1984 at a cost of 409 million and returned home last year 
after service escorting kuwaiti tankers in the persian gulf 
the navy provided the following hot line numbers for people to 
call for information about relatives on the ship inside virginia 
8005722126 outside virginia 8003683202 or 8005232975

seven students were arrested wednesday 
after refusing to budge from a university of massachusetts 
laboratory where they were protesting against defense 
departmentfunded research 
campus director of public safety arthur hilson said the three 
women and four men were removed and in some cases dragged from 
the marcus hall laboratory when they remained in the building 
after closing hours he did not release their names but said they 
were being booked on trespassing charges 
the occupation which started at 1 pm stemmed from a campus 
rally earlier in the day against such projects as the universitys 
quest for an anthrax vaccine 
the university maintains the research focuses on a nonvirulent 
strain and is for peaceful purposes but students and members of 
the local chapter of the american friends service committee want 
the research moved off campus 
its kind of a leap to say basic research on the university 
campus is somehow directly supporting a war in el salvador said 
university spokeswoman jeanne hopkins our research here is all 
basic its all nonclassified 
hilson said the students were repeatedly warned that they were 
violating the student code of conduct by staying in the building 
after hours he said he consulted with school chancellor joseph 
duffey before ordering the arrests

the government has told airlines and 
travel agencies that beginning friday all us citizens must have 
visas approved by the government to visit panama 
the panamanian institute of tourism said in a statement that 
each visa must be stamped by a panamanian consul that recognizes 
the government of acting president manuel solis palma 
the majority of panamanian consulates do not recognize the solis 
palma government continuing to recognize the government of 
president eric arturo delvalle who was ousted in february 1988 
previously us citizens traveling to panama needed a tourist 
card available at any panamanian consulate 
the institute in a statement distributed to the tourist 
industry said us citizens wishing to visit panama on business 
dealing with panama canal accords between the panamanian and us 
governments must still have official permission from the panamanian 
government to enter and leave the country 
the official permission must be sought by us officials and 
will remain valid as long as a us citizen works with the panaama 
canal commission the statement said 
the us and panamanian governments have been at odds for more 
than a year ever since panamas de facto leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega orchestrated the ouster of thenpresident delvalle 
delvalle was ousted after he tried to fire noriega the defense 
forces chief following noriegas indictment by a federal grand 
jury in florida on drug trafficking charges solis palma was later 
appointed acting president 
the united states has imposed economic sanctions on panama in an 
attempt to force noriega out and continues to recognize delvalle 
and reject solis palma as the countrys legal president

families of crew members aboard the uss iowa 
gathered wednesday at a norfolk naval station gym to await word 
about loved ones who were on the ship when a gun turret packed with 
gunpowder exploded in flames 
the major problem is lack of information said navy chaplain 
barry brimhall who was with the families they are very very 
frustrated for those who had husbands or sons in the area of the 
explosion they are wondering was it my husband my son 
the longer we hear nothing the better it is said sandy 
tate of charleston wva a relative of crewman jonathan tate 
navy policy requires that families of dead or injured sailors be 
notified before any list of victims is released to the news media 
and not all families had been notified by midevening wednesday 
officials said 
brimhall was one of many navy chaplains social workers and red 
cross personnel called in to deal with the families grief 
the first thing we did was establish a place for them to 
gather said master chief billy kinder an atlantic fleet 
spokesman we provide a place for them to be the chaplains 
social workers red cross and others are there to help them in any 
way possible 
our primary purpose brimhall said is to help them air 
their feelings talk about their fears to reassure them but be 
honest some are going to loose a loved one it is a ministry of 
presence 
the families were helping each other brimhall said 
there is a lot of support within the group i saw 
relationships develop right before my eyes as women put their arms 
around those who were having touble he said 
he described the mood in the gym as varied 
there are those who are really struggling and those who are 
really stoic he said 
ann quagliotti of brownton wva said she and her husband 
hadnt been able to reach navy officials to find out about her son 
mark quagliotti a dentist on the iowa 
i have no idea where our son could be ms quagliotti said 
anything is possible 
the navys contingency plan for such tragedies was worked out 
long before the accident kinder said 
we take this very seriously family response crisis is a very 
major issue with us he said 
kinder said the families are given updates at least every half 
hour and more often as developments warrant 
right now for some of these families they would rather have 
bad news than no news at all brimhall said

about 2000 americans are hospitalized 
annually with a split wall in the bodys major artery an ailment 
that sent lucille ball into emergency heart surgery a heart 
specialist said wednesday 
its one of the most severely painful diseases a human has to 
suffer although not everyone who gets an aortic dissection 
experiences extreme pain said dr thomas robertson chief of 
cardiac diseases at the national heart lung and blood institute in 
bethesda md 
the condition also called a dissecting aortic aneurysm 
involves a tear that splits the wall of the aorta the main artery 
connecting the heart to smaller arteries that carry blood 
throughout the body 
although 2000 americans reach hospitals and are diagnosed with 
a split aorta each year an unknown number of others suffer the 
ailment and have it misdiagnosed as a heart attack or die before 
they arrive at an emergency room robertson said during a telephone 
interview 
he estimated aortic dissection kills about half of those it 
afflicts often when the split aorta wall ruptures to cause 
internal hemorrhaging 
of those who reach hospitals and undergo surgery about 
threefourths survive hospitalization death is most likely during 
the operation itself he added 
the aorta emerges from the left ventricle the hearts main 
pumping chamber passes upward and arches over the top of the 
heart then passes down behind the heart and into the abdomen 
during aortic dissection a tear suddenly develops in the tissue 
that makes up the wall of the aorta the layers of tissue separate 
allowing blood to flow into the gap which then painfully expands 
like a balloon the pressure can make the tear spread up or down a 
greater length of the artery 
an aortic dissection is different than the much more common and 
conventional aortic aneurysm in which the artery wall is weakened 
and balloons outward but layers of the artery wall dont split 
in miss balls condition the beginning portion of her aorta 
near the heart began to tear apart and that tearing progressed 
all the way down into her abdomen her surgeon dr robert kass 
said tuesday night 
the split wall involved essentially her whole aorta he 
added 
during the sixhour operation at cedarssinai medical center 
kass said he removed the 77yearold miss balls ascending aorta 
the short stretch of aorta that emerges from the ventricle and 
the aortic valve he replaced them with those taken from the 
cadaver of a 27yearold 
the aortic valve controls the flow of blood from the ventricle 
into the aorta kass said the expansion in miss balls split artery 
wall unroofed the aortic valve to make it leak a leaky valve 
can cause heart failure because blood cant be pumped out of the 
heart efficiently 
during a news conference kass didnt explain why the rest of 
the aorta wasnt replaced 
but robertson said many arteries branch off the aorta so its 
safest to replace only the part where the tear started 
a surgeon can tack together the place where the split wall 
continues preventing ballooning by blocking blood from flowing 
into the gap he said 
kass also said he detached the ends of miss balls coronary 
arteries where they connected to her ascending aorta then 
reattached them to the newly implanted aorta restoring blood flow 
that nourishes the heart 
sometimes an aorta with a split wall isnt replaced but is 
repaired with synthetic materials such as by inserting a knitted 
dacron tube inside the defective section of aorta 
doctors dont know why aortic walls sometimes split hardening 
of the arteries and congenital artery weakness have been suspected 
but the risk is increased by high blood pressure which kass said 
miss ball has suffered for several years

northeast of la paz near the town of san ramon said us dea 
agents involved in the seizure authorities said one person was 
apprehended during the raid which was first disclosed wednesday 
this is far and away the largest single amount ever caught in 
bolivia gelbard said in an interview he said the amount more 
than double the cocaine seized in bolivia all last year indicated 
a capacity of producing refined cocaine much greater than 
previously estimated by us authorities 
bolivian police authorities believe the cocaine belonged to 
carmelo rodriguez considered to be one of bolivias biggest 
cocaine traffickers 
a relative of rodriguez owned the ranch officials said the dea 
said a cocaine processing lab was found and destroyed at the same 
ranch in august they said it apparently was awaiting shipment to 
colombia 
the cocaine was seized during an operation involving 20 bolivia 
narcotics police and dea agents who flew to the jungle ranch on 
four huey helicopters donated by the us government 
authorities said a ranch employee was being held for questioning 
at a police base in trinidad about 250 miles northeast of la paz 
they said the cocaine was being held by authorities under the 
supervision of the attorney generals office which is seeking a 
court order to burn it 
during all of 1988 authorities seized 546 pounds of refined 
cocaine in bolivia us officials said

a soviet ship that can skim oil on the 
high seas joined the war against the nations worst oil spill 
wednesday docking in a town named for the man who bought alaska 
from russia for 72 million 
the 11400ton vaidogubsky 425 feet long steamed 30 miles up 
fjordlike resurrection bay under a cloudy sky flying the soviet 
hammer and sickle from its stern and an american flag from its 
towering white superstructure 
it tied up at a railroad dock its decks strewn with heavy 
equipment smoke spewing from its stacks 
about 100 yards away crews unloaded oilsoaked booms and 
absorbent material from the cleanup at nuka bay one of the most 
polluted sites on the southern coast of the kenai peninsula 
its pretty impressive for a skimmer said coast guard petty 
officer ken safford who snapped photos as the ship arrived a 
little before 8 am its huge 
by midmorning a stream of tourists were driving up to the dock 
to take pictures and wave to the crew 
the ship came to seward for refueling and probably would be in 
port all day said coast guard capt rene roussel 
the oil spilled march 24 by an exxon tanker is becoming very 
thick and difficult to deal with as it weathers roussel said 
we dont know how it the vaidogubsky is going to work in the 
kind of oil were skimming he said our goal is to get in the 
oil well probably use it in resurrection bay for awhile 
the vaidogubsky works with two motorboats that drag a boom to 
corral the oil then two pipes working like 100foot straws dip 
into the oil and suck it onto the larger ship said a soviet 
crewman who spoke in halting english 
the vessel is capable of gulping 200000 gallons per hour and 
has a storage capacity of 2 million gallons 
if theres not enough oil there to justify its continued use 
the coast guard will move it to where the oil is nuka bay is our 
most likely plan he said 
the vaidogubsky probably will be available for 30 days roussel 
said its unclear who will pay its fuel and operating costs he 
said 
exxon has promised to pay the costs of the total cleanup effort 
the soviets have had an interest in alaskas fisheries for more 
than a decade with us fishing boats delivering cod and flounder 
to soviet processing ships 
though the joint venture is expected to phase out over the next 
few years because of americanization of the bottomfish catch 
the soviets received 176000 tons last year and are expected to 
take less than 110000 tons this year said bert larkins general 
manager of marine resources co in seattle the soviets us 
partner in the joint venture 
in washington transportation secretary samuel skinner told the 
senate on wednesday that industry plans for dealing with an alaskan 
oil spill had been a zero on a scale of one to 10 and one 
senator said the initial response to the march 24 disaster reminded 
him of the keystone kops 
sen max baucus dmont chairman of the environmental 
protection subcommittee said the response to the spill has 
demonstrated a complete breakdown of the procedures that were 
supposed to have been in effect since the federal government 
approved the alaskan pipeline 16 years ago 
william d stevens president of exxon co usa denied that his 
company has been slow in responding to the crisis but acknowledged 
that the industrys preparedness was inadequate this type of 
accident was so highly unlikely that the consequences of it 
were viewed as acceptable he told the subcommittee 
seward this week became the first town outside prince william 
sound to have oil wash up on a beach 
if they the soviets can capture oil out there and pick it up 
before it blows on shore thats much to our advantage seward 
deputy city manager darryl schaefermeyer said 
our goal is to get the oil picked up and not wait until it 
gets on beaches and then have to clean beaches 
the oil that washed ashore near seward was a taffylike goop 
mixed with seaweed and was cleaned up tuesday but more oil was in 
resurrection bay and still more reported on nearby islands and 
headlands of the kenai peninsula including at kenai fjords 
national park 
the oil has been streaming into the gulf of alaska from prince 
william sound where the tanker exxon valdez hit a reef and spilled 
101 million gallons of north slope crude oil 
skimming in the often stormy gulf has been hampered by high seas 
because small boats in operation can handle seas only to about 5 
feet seas recently have run as high as 12 feet 
cleanup contingency planners didnt expect oil to get outside 
prince william sound which is largely protected from rough waves 
by a series of islands 
exxon has about 20 skimmers working in the sound and the gulf 
two operate out of seward and of course we have several booming 
operations involving a whole armada of fishing vessels said 
coast guard lt john kwietniak 
it was the second time in less than a year that a huge soviet 
ship aided rescue efforts in alaska last october the soviet 
icebreaker vladimir arseniev smashed its way through the frozen 
waters off point barrow to help free two california gray whales 
trapped in the ice 
seward is named for former secretary of state william seward 
the man who bought yetunexplored alaska from russia for 72 
million in 1867 doubters dubbed it sewards folly

us diplomats apparently heeded an official 
warning and canceled seats on pan am flights in the weeks before 
the bombing of flight 103 last dec 21 according to airline 
documents quoted in a congressional memorandum 
the house government operations transportation subcommittee 
staff memo says pan am documents indicate that christmas holiday 
traffic for us embassy personnel had been heavily rebooked 
before the bombing over lockerbie scotland which killed 270 
people 
relatives of those who died in the bombing have been angry that 
a us federal aviation administration warning of a possible 
bombing of a pan am flight from frankfurt west germany to the 
united states was not made public they say diplomats would have 
acted on the warnings and canceled pan am flights 
the subcommittee memo made available to the associated press 
notes that pan am has denied that there were any threats aimed 
specifically at flight 103 in the two weeks before the bombing 
according to the memo one of the pan am documents barely 
legible says of course we are telling pax passengers of pa 
security measures fra frankfurt 
another document involves a request for public information 
guidelines in view that about 80 percent of holiday traffic of 
embassy is rebooking 
but there is no further explanation of that statement nor is 
there any indication that the rebookings specifically involved 
flight 103 the statement does not say which us embassy is meant 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said there was 
no basis at all for the allegation that the us department of 
state officials systematically canceled reservations on flight 103 
based on the faa aviation security bulletin 
there is no evidence whatsoever of any systematic pattern of 
canceled reservations for this flight by anyone or any group ms 
tutwiler said 
but when asked if she had any information on whether 
cancellations had occurred involving other flights ms tutwiler 
said she could not immediately answer that question 
in new york jeff kriendler vice president of corporate 
communications for pan am when asked if there had been large 
numbers of diplomats canceling flights on pan am said there is 
no indication that that was the case 
in albany ny paul hudson chairman of victims of flight 103 
said we knew that diplomats had information regarding the 
threats to pan am flight 103 we are outraged at the coverup and 
apparent lies of the state department 
we have felt from the beginning that government officials were 
informed of the terrorists threats and were able to change their 
travel plans said hudson 
the subcommittee has asked pan am for all internal documents 
relating to security measures to threats about flight 103 and 
information about who in pan am knew about any such threats 
contents of the march 13 subcommittee memo were first reported 
by a london newspaper the independent the memo says pan am should 
be asked to provide details of lost revenue since pan am was 
obviously keeping track of threatrelated cancellations 
the federal aviation administration warning was prepared after 
an anonymous caller to the us embassy in helsinki finland said a 
bomb attack would be made in the two weeks after dec 5 the faa 
bulletin was sent to embassies so they could inform foreign 
governments 
since the bombing of the new yorkbound boeing 747 over 
lockerbie the united states and the finnish police have maintained 
that the telephoned warning was a hoax 
relatives of those who died on flight 103 have maintained it was 
inevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin warning 
friends and relatives and canceling pan am reservations 
on april 7 clayton mcmanaway the us ambassadoratlarge for 
counterterrorism told the senate that is not true 
mcmanaway pointed out then that 31 us government personnel 
died in the bombing he said the decision of the us embassy in 
moscow to post copies of the warning was not in accordance with 
us government policy

sen dennis deconcinis longtime campaign 
treasurer has admitted taking some 500000 from reelection bank 
accounts the senators spokesman said wednesday 
us attorney stephen m mcnamee wouldnt say whether charges 
would be filed against accountant thomas karlsen of mesa who 
joined the arizona democrats campaign staff in 1974 
mcnamee took depositions wednesday from other workers in the 
arizona democrats office here wednesday we just had a meeting 
where they presented their evidence mcnamee said 
in a telephone interview from washington bob maynes 
deconcinis press secretary said karlsen promised to pay back the 
money which he admitted to taking 
but i think that to repay implies an ability that i do not 
know is there maynes said he said he would do everything he 
could to make restitution and he does have some financial 
resources 
he said deconcini was saddened by what he viewed as betrayal by 
an insider 
karlsen has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached 
for comment maynes said the tempe resident was still in the 
phoenix area but had left town april 10 leaving behind a note 
that he didnt plan to return 
he changed his mind and came back to the phoenix area sunday 
and he called monday and admitted that he had done this maynes 
said 
he said it wasnt known how much money was missing were in 
the process of trying to reconstruct the events maynes said 
the funds apparently were withdrawn from certificateofdeposit 
accounts after they had been recorded maynes said 
the first thefts took place about 1981 he said since then 
karlsen has been divorced twice and had a series of business 
reversals through his karlsen amp karlsen firm maynes added 
karlsen has been treasurer for several other democrats 
including richard kimball who ran unsuccessfully for a us senate 
seat and gov rose mofford 
mofford campaign finance committee chairwoman lorraine frank 
said karlsen resigned last week she said no money was missing from 
the governors coffers 
state board of accountancy records show karlsen was certified as 
a public accountant in 1972 two years later he met deconcini and 
became treasurer in time to help in deconcinis successful 1976 
campaign 
a survey by the common cause organization showed deconcini had a 
502000 campaign surplus as of dec 31 the survey also said 
deconcini whose 1988 campaign raised 33 million had the 
sixthlargest surplus among incumbent senate candidates

two jurors and an alternate juror in the 
irancontra trial of oliver north did not tell the truth when they 
said they had never been involved in court proceedings abctv news 
reported wednesday 
the three could be disqualified the network reported on world 
news tonight on the eve of jury deliberations in the trial of the 
former white house aide 
the jury is expected to begin deliberating thursday after a 
rebuttal argument by prosecutor john keker and final instructions 
from us district judge gerhard a gesell 
abc said the jurors apparently did not give full answers in a 
questionnaire in which they were asked whether they or any member 
of their families had ever been involved in civil or criminal court 
proceedings 
one juror answered no even though he was sued for 100000 
in 1981 as a result of an auto accident and another juror said 
no even though she was sued in 1982 for 50000 following a car 
crash abc said 
both lawsuits were settled but constitute court proceedings 
anyway according to abc 
if gesell decided to disqualify either or both jurors the first 
alternate would be named to take their place 
that juror also answered no to the question but abc said a 
computer check at superior court showed that the alternate was 
arrested twice on drug charges and was put on probation for a year 
gesell was told of the findings but declined to comment the 
network said 
north a former marine lieutenant colonel was a major figure in 
the irancontra scandal he is charged with 12 criminal counts the 
charges include lying to congress and the attorney general 
illegally converting travelers checks to his own use and 
conspiring to defraud the treasury through a tax scam to support 
the contra rebels fighting the nicaraguan government

a federal judge sentenced a potomac man to 15 
days in jail and fined him 20000 tuesday for cutting down 138 
trees on a national park near his home to get a view of the potomac 
river 
it is true that the area can be restored but only with great 
expense of time and resources so a message must be sent to 
others us district judge j joseph howard said while 
sentencing isaac fogel that message gentlemen is that one may 
forfeit his or her liberty 
fogel 45 had the trees removed then advertised his home has 
having a river view the government said in its indictment 
i was willing to settle this thing when i first talked to the 
parks department if they hadnt insisted on branding me a 
criminal fogel said before sentencing 
he was convicted earlier this year of destruction of government 
timber a misdemeanor and disposing of government property a 
felony 
he faced a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison and 350000 
in fines prosecutors recommended a 64000 fine and a 60day 
sentence 
i think the court gave the sentence we recommended serious 
consideration and we are pleased with the sentence assistant 
us attorney david king said 
the 138 trees in the chesapeake and ohio canal national 
historical park were valued at more than 30000 king asked the 
judge to fine fogel twice the replacement value of the trees as 
punishment 
fogel president of a water bed manufacturing company in jessup 
and his wife jo bought the house in 1982 the indictment said 
in march 1985 despite discussions with national park service 
officials about what timber could be cut fogel hired a tree 
service company to cut down the trees the goverment contended 
fogel and his wife later listed the house and four acres for 
sale advertising it as having a river view the indictment said 
the house which has not been sold was assessed for tax purposes 
in 1986 at 381510 
howard sentenced fogel to concurrent threeyear and sixmonth 
sentences suspending all but 15 days of the threeyear sentence 
and the entire sixmonth sentence fogel was also ordered to serve 
two years probation upon his release and perform 300 hours of 
community service

since republican and democratic leaders agree 
it seems unanimous there ought to be a law reforming campaign 
finances to curb soaring costs and to create a fair level playing 
field for house and senate candidates 
the only trouble is that they cannot agree on whats fair and 
whats level 
neither side can afford to be against reform of a system almost 
everyone believes is too expensive too distracting and too subject 
to abuses 
but the dominant democrats arent interested in legislating away 
the advantages of incumbents and the minority republicans want 
changes that could strengthen challengers 
so they argue about what is and isnt reform 
the most drastic of current proposals for campaign reform came 
from president bush in what was almost an aside as he called for a 
new ethics code for all federal officeholders 
i believe we should eliminate contributions to candidates by 
political action committees and ill be consulting with the 
congress about that and i also oppose federal funding of 
congressional campaigns bush said 
political action committees pacs are fundraising groups 
organized among officers and other people associated with 
corporations unions interest groups and the like the pacs raise 
money from their members and dole it out to candidates mostly to 
incumbent senators and representatives 
pacs sprang up and multiplied in number and in dollars because 
of the stringent campaign contribution limits imposed in the reform 
wave that followed watergate 
thats the trouble with reforms as soon as they are devised 
somebody invents a way around them and sometimes the new reformed 
system is worse than the original problem 
during the last campaign political action committees reported 
contributions of more than 150 million to house and senate 
candidates less than 19 million of that went to candidates 
running against incumbent members of congress 
because there are more democratic incumbents nearly twothirds 
of the pac money went to democrats republicans were particularly 
incensed that in the past few elections their ideological allies 
from business pacs poured money into democratic incumbents 
campaigns and generally stiffed gop challengers 
political action committees can give a candidate up to 5000 
for each election primary or general they also can spend money 
independently in support of a candidate individuals are limited to 
1000 contributions to a candidate for each election 
republicans do better at party fund raising from individual 
donors neither party has a monopoly on fat cats but the gop has 
done a better job of cultivating the wealthy encouraging them to 
go to the maximum for the national party its campaign committees 
and for individual candidates 
those numbers point to the politics behind bushs proposal for a 
flat ban on pac contributions 
modern democratic government works best when organized by 
strong political parties and yet we have allowed our parties to 
become weakened and overshadowed by special interests and we can 
best restore the role of the parties by limiting political action 
committees he said pacs weaken the parties restrain 
competition and deaden the political debate 
the presidents proposal would limit the pacs right out of 
business since they exist to make campaign contributions other 
republican proposals would limit the size of pac contributions as 
well as raise the limits on individual donations 
either formula would work to the advantage of candidates 
challenging incumbents which usually means republicans in house 
elections where the democrats have an 86seat margin in the last 
elections more than 98 percent of incumbent congressional 
candidates won new terms 
democratic leaders want legislation that would set voluntary 
ceilings for congressional campaign spending with a cap on pac 
contributions as part of the formula their reform plan includes 
the public financing bush rejects 
he ran for president on public financing said senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine if its good for 
presidential campaigns why is it so bad for senate campaigns 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said what the 
democrats want boils down to an incumbency protection plan 
with ceilings that would keep a challenger from spending what it 
takes to offset the incumbents advantages 
mitchell says the republican goal is a setup that will preserve 
their advantage in raising money from wellheeled individual 
contributors 
theyre right

vh1 once a poorly defined cable network 
that believed what people over 30 wanted was julio iglesias music 
videos has finally found itself as members of its baby boom 
audience might say 
vh1s parent mtv networks which also has the bigtime mtv and 
nickelodeon cable channels has in recent months boosted vh1s 
staff and budget and given vh1 chief jeff rowe his own pipeline to 
network president and chief executive officer tom freston 
the developments at vh1 are what network television has most to 
fear about cable an entire broadcast agenda microprogrammed to one 
very lucrative audience 
while the networks take snatches of the age 25 to 49 audience 
with shows like thirtysomething china beach the wonder 
years and la law they also have to reach viewers who were 
unconscious from 1960 to 1980 just watch nightingales 
vh1 its parent mtvn hopes is for everyone who stayed awake 
during those years 
we feel this is a great chance to target the audience that 
grew up on television and contemporary music rowe said in a 
recent interview 
the new vh1 programming includes interview segments clips of 
classic and contemporary rock and pop infotainment reporting 
on show business and special attention to weekends when vh1 
watchers are more apt to set aside their graph charts and tune in 
the theme weekends have included interviews clips and concert 
films devoted to elton john paul simon tina turner and others 
rowe also acknowledged the challenge of reaching an audience 
that includes vietnam veterans former peace marchers sociologists 
who became investment bankers and business majors who operate 
halfway houses 
a network that is targeted to fit this generation has to know 
how it lives he said we want to create an environment that 
keeps people up on contemporary music but also reflects their 
past has comedy about current events but also is nostalgic 
to keep both ends of the candle burning vh1 is sponsoring a 
million dollar baby contest for the offspring of baby boomers 
and offers a series of earth alerts celebrityhosted 
informational spots keyed to the activities of the greenpeace 
organization 
the million dollar baby sponsored by gerber products co 
and downy fabric softener harkens back to the corporatesponsored 
contests of the 1950s entrants send in a photo of their offspring 
from ages four months to 2 years with an april 24 deadline 
looming the winner will be announced may 8 
the prize is a zero coupon municipal bond worth 1 million at 
maturity 
the earth alerts are tied in with a celebrity fundraiser album 
rainbow warrior due this month on geffen records 
environmental issues are still the issues of this generation 
said vh1 spokeswoman dana kornbluth 
at the farthest end there is not much we can do to shock this 
audience said rowe this audience did a lot of crazy things 
back in the 1960s and 1970s we cant take ourselves too

a modern parallel is unfolding of the ancient 
passover story of liberation the rising exodus of jews permitted 
by the soviet union 
the resemblances were cited as the weeklong passover observance 
started wednesday evening marking the jewish flight from bondage 
in egupt 
however jews today dont have to rely on rituals of the past 
says theodore ellenoff president of the american jewish committee 
before our very eyes the gates of the soviet union have been 
thrown open and jews are using the opportunity to stream out 
during the first three months of this year 9461 jews have been 
allowed to emigrate from the soviet triple the number in the same 
period last year with projections the 1989 total may reach 40000 
that would be the third year of a steadily rising surge of 
departures under the more open policies of soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
shoshana cardin chairman of the national conference on soviet 
jewry applauds the increased emigrations and improvements in 
religious and cultural rights of soviet jews but adds our 
priority this passover remains our often voiced demand let our 
people go 
we will not be silent until every jew who wishes to emigrate 
is free to do so until every jew who wishes to remain in the 
soviet union is allowed full cultural and religious rights 
the demand let my people go originally was flung by the 
ancient jewish leader moses at the egyptian pharaoh in the worlds 
earliest struggle for religious freedom nearly 4000 years ago 
those words still are relevant says gerald strober 
information officer of the ncsj pharaoh has begun to loosen up 
and we welcome it but we must remain ever vigilant 
moderating conditions for soviet jews however were seen as 
similar to the jewish deliverance from oppression in egypt the 
passover event which has become a universal symbol of human 
liberation 
as in the case of the ancient israelites the troubles werent 
over for soviet jews after being let out of the country 
about 7000 of them are stranded at a center near rome most of 
them wanting to come to the united states but exceeding us 
quotas or refused us refugee status as fleeing persecution 
israel accepts all wishing to go there but the logjam has 
persisted with efforts being made in this country to modify the 
restrictions 
in the light of the ancient liberation from egypt ellenoff 
said it is no surprise that the new mass emigration of soviet 
jewry has raised new perplexities 
our bible teaches that physical emancipation is just the 
beginning of a long painstaking redemptive process we read that 
the freed israelites complained bitterly to moses about the 
hardships of freedom 
when they had been slaves the masters had taken care of their 
basic needs in return for obedient subservience only now with 
emancipation did the israelites have to worry about food water 
and protection from armed attack 
while more jews are being allowed to leave the soviet union the 
situation for those still there has moderated added facilities are 
being provided and the ncsj says all 15 jewish prisoners of 
concience have been released 
manhattans park avenue synagogue for the second successive year 
airlifed passover supplies to soviet jewish congregations in moscow 
and odessa two tons of matzoth wine gefilte fish and other 
kosher foods for passover 
rabbi arthur schneier leader of the manhattan congregation and 
head of the appeal of conscience foundation recently negotiated 
the return to moscows choral synagogue of an adjoining building 
for a community center 
he said the center when refurbished through funding by the 
manhattan synagogue would provide a lecture hall meeting rooms 
and classrooms for jewish adult education courses in bible jewish 
history and hebrew and a kosher restaurant 
soviet jews are celebrating passover with a new haggadah 
recounting gods deliverances in russian and hebrew published by 
moscows choral synagogue with help of the us memorial foundation 
for jewish culture 
the soviets jewish population has been estimated at about 2 
million and how many want to leave is uncertain the ncsj says 
that several years ago it estimated the figure at more than 
300000 but it now may be less 
questions remain about various aspects of the situation 
ellenoff says and the answers may not come quickly after all 
he adds it took 40 years for the emancipated israelites to reach 
the promised land

two of the biggest names in the mutual fund 
industry have created new money market funds boasting yields that 
beat all their older competitors 
they are getting an enthusiastic response from savers and 
investors scrambling after the high returns available in shortterm 
money market investments 
but experts on mutual fund investing urge that you look beyond 
the current yield figures these funds sport before you decide 
whether they suit your purposes 
in figures compiled early this month by donoghues moneyletter 
the dreyfus worldwide dollar money market fund and the fidelity 
spartan money market fund ran neck and neck for the no 1 spot with 
sevenday yields of 104 percent 
the average yield of 542 taxable money funds by contrast was 
908 percent 
how can dreyfus and fidelity do this well for one thing their 
timing was fortuitous since the new funds were organized in a 
period when interest rates were climbing they were able to stock 
their portfolios with the latest highyielding securities the 
marketplace had to offer 
older funds by contrast could accumulate new higheryielding 
securities only gradually as their assets increased and existing 
investments in their portfolios matured 
more to the point however is a marketing strategem that has 
been used many times before when a new fund is introduced dreyfus 
and fidelity are temporarily paying the funds expenses and waiving 
their management fees 
its smart to take advantage of these situations but watch 
these funds closely says sheldon jacobs in his newsletter the 
noload fund investor 
they can stop waiving expenses without notice and their yield 
advantages will disappear 
the charges dreyfus isnt collecting effectively increase the 
worldwide dollar funds yield by 07 of a percentage point notes 
norman fosback editor of the newsletter income amp safety while the 
difference at fidelity spartan is 06 of a point 
frankly we are ambivalent regarding this promotional 
technique fosback says 
the upside is that such funds offer adroit investors an 
opportunity albeit brief to earn faraboveaverage returns the 
downside is that savers seeking these opportunities may end up with 
their money in a fund whose performance may prove to be below 
average in the long run 
of course there is nothing to prevent you from withdrawing 
from a fund once the fee waiver and expense assumption ends but 
the funds are counting on many investors being too poorly informed 
or lazy to move their money out 
even after they have stopped waiving fees and expenses its 
possible that the worldwide dollar and fidelity spartan funds will 
do well 
fosback says the worldwide dollar fund with a somewhat 
different investment policy can be expected to outperform by at 
least a small margin its huge sister fund dreyfus liquid assets 
fidelity meanwhile says the spartan fund will continue to 
carry lower fees and expenses than the longestablished fidelity 
cash reserves fund in part because spartan shareholders will pay 
separate charges for services offered free to investors in most 
other money funds 
for example spartan holders pay 2 apiece for checks to write 
against their accounts and the fund has a 5 redemption fee 
logically then fidelity spartan would seem to appeal to savers 
and investors who use a mutual fund as a longterm savings account 
rather than as a tool in a busy program of money management 
for people who take such a longterm perspective financial 
advisers agree the latest sevenday or 30day yield figure at a 
given money fund isnt of overriding importance what matters is 
how well the fund is managed in all types of economic environments 
as donoghues moneyletter advises make sure your fund is a 
consistent performer

back in the mid1970s when robert poole jr was 
developing the notion of private enterprise being able to do 
governments work better than government he could hardly have 
foreseen one of the twists that ensued 
the concept seemed to thrive in the united states organizations 
were formed to promote it it was embraced by president reagan new 
laws encouraged private initiative the white house named a 
director of privatization 
but while the concept thrived domestically action did not 
always follow surprisingly much of the privatization developed 
abroad in japan and britain and incredibly in the biggovernment 
communist world 
meanwhile poole has continued to develop his ideas mainly 
through the reason foundation an organization he founded in santa 
monica calif and which he still runs each year it publishes a 
progress report on privatization 
the latest just issued reports that governments around the 
world continue to shift functions and responsibilities to the 
private sector to the extent of 43 billion of sales in 1988 alone 
that amount brought the worldwide cumulative total to 160 
billion in just five years and in almost every instance the basic 
notion was the same that private initiative could result in more 
efficient management and services 
in 1988 britain relieved itself of an obligation and fattened 
its treasury by selling british steel to private investors japan 
sold off nippon telephone amp telegraph for the same reasons 
the third world struggling to survive in a more competitive 
world market recognized the possibilities nigeria issued a decree 
that will result in the sale of 67 companies including 12 banks 
chile plans to sell the government pension fund and has already 
sold 1 billion in state firms since 1985 
asset sales tell only part of the story increasingly popular 
are buildoperatetransfer agreements whereby a private company 
agrees to build and operate a public facility for the government 
for a set time period 
bots are being used to build a major power plant and rail 
transit system in turkey a new harbor tunnel in sydney australia 
and power plants in the philippines and in of all places a 
181mile tollway in china 
surprising not really privatization is being widely embraced 
by nations that once felt it was the function of government to 
operate all enterprises 
the soviet union has joined china in allowing farmers to lease 
land from the state and buy their own trucks tractors and 
equipment both have begun programs allowing individuals to buy 
houses and apartments from the state 
several communist countries are permitting private buusinesses 
to start up hundreds of coops were begun in the soviet union in 
1988 poland has gone further with 23000 coops authorized each 
allowed to hire 50 workers per shift hungary now permits private 
companies employing up to 500 workers 
the soviet union is in the process of breaking up of many 
collective farms and the leasing farm land to individuals families 
and small groups the report states that onefifth of the countrys 
50000 farms have been leasing land and equipment to individuals 
and families over the past two years 
in contrast to these efforts all of which promote the belief 
that private initiative results in more efficient production and 
delivery of goods and services is the united states which the 
report states is virtually alone in having no serious national 
commitment to privatization 
during the entire eight years of the reagan administration it 
states the only large federal enterprise to be sold off was 
conrail 
there was additional action but hardly enough to support the 
rhetoric during 1988 the government reached an agreement to sell 
the great plains coal gasification plant for 600 million over 21 
years and 46 billion was realized from the sale of federal loan 
assets in 1987 and 1988 
a presidential commission has recommended using various form of 
privatization including contracting jobs rather than doing them 
inhouse the direct sales of assets and other means to alleviate 
budget pressures 
and a reason foundation task force recommends the privatization 
of amtrak the tennessee valley authority and other power 
facilities the us postal service and the nations airports and 
air traffic control centers 
will it happen the lack of momentum suggests it wont occur for 
a long while while president bush has said repeatedly he supports 
the concept privatization advocates fear the white house effort is 
being downgraded 
what an oddity say those who support privatization the united 
states which symbolizes private initiative and taught it to much 
of the world is now showing less initiative than some third world 
and communist nations

smile indulgently about it if so inclined 
thats ok with the rev barry h downing but he firmly maintains 
that ufos are real and that they have key religious significance 
he says recognizing the existence and operations of these 
unidentified flying objects could do much to strengthen faith and 
renew confidence in biblical accounts 
it would establish scientific plausiblity for the whole 
biblical field he says it would reinforce faith and make it 
possible in a scientific context 
downing a presbyterian pastor with a scientific bent says 
government equivocation has caused skepticism about ufos and so he 
expects some scoffing at his views 
you have to have a good humor about it he said in an 
interview i cant prove im right but theres lots of evidence 
for it and until it wins out some people are just going to have 
to laugh 
he theorizes that activities of ufoborne higher beings or 
angels likely from another dimension rather than other 
planets are indicated in biblical events ranging from guiding the 
israelites from egypt to christs ascension 
he said postulating such activities in forming biblical faith 
would open a middle ground between fundamentalist literalism and 
liberal theologys demythologizing of supernatural events as 
only symbolic 
it would cut down the distance between liberals and 
fundamentalists and serve as a mediating force between the two 
extremes he said 
the mythological concepts would have to be reexamined which 
would be important for the liberal wing the conservative wing 
which stresses certainty and wants everything locked up tight also 
would be impacted 
this would mean unlocking things 
downing 50 an endwell ny pastor has a ba in physics 
and after completing princeton theological seminary got a 
doctorate at the university of edinburgh in scotland on relations 
of science and religion 
he details his ideas about ufos and about eternity as a 
coexisting universe based on einsteins relativity theory in a 
new paperback edition of his book the bible and flying 
saucers issued by berkely books 
what is clear through the biblical material is that gods will 
for the jews and eventually for all mankind was revealed by 
beings from another world he writes 
usually these beings looked very much like ordinary human 
beings they almost never have wings once the package of 
biblical religion had been delivered man became responsible for 
the distribution of the contents 
downing said a hovering ufolike cloud by day and glowing 
pillar of fire by night guided the israelites out of egypt 
projecting some propulsive force that parted the red sea leading 
them for years across the desert 
other events he sees as carried out by ufos include 
the firelike phenomenon on mount sinai in which moses received 
the ten commandments the prophet elijah taken to heaven in a fiery 
chariot the star of bethlehem the engulfing light of jesus 
transfiguration his being lifted up at his ascension and the 
blinding visitation of paul en route to damascus 
all these were ufo types of reports downing said 
downing pastor for 22 years of endwells northminster 
presbyterian church also is theological consultant to the mutual 
ufo network based in seguin texas and fund for ufo research 
based in washington 
recalling a 1969 government commission finding that air force 
observations offered insufficience evidence to substantiate 
ufos browning said the government was covering up and the full 
report never was released 
he displayed a 1975 letter from thensen barry goldwater 
rariz saying the material was being withheld as above top 
secret 
if the government werent lying in denying ufos exist wed 
have had a religious revolution starting 40 years ago browning 
said it would not mean undermining biblical faith but 
reinterpreting it in light of ufo phenomena 
in the pulpit downing said he rarely brings his ufo ideas into 
sermons recognizing the controversial aspects although members 
are aware of his interest in the subject he added 
three or four have said theyve had ufo experiences

the xinghua clothing factory has abandoned plans 
to buy new machines from japan because it doesnt have the 
electricity to run them 
without the right connections it would take years to get 
approval for the extra power said man ying energy manager at 
the 250employee factory in beijing 
the factory also cant buy air conditioners for the sweltering 
summers and this past winter went days without heat because of a 
lack of coal 
we send out special teams to look for coal she said adding 
that they sometimes must pay free market sellers and profiteers up 
to 130 yuan 35 a ton for it three times the stateset rate 
xinghua is forced to shut down once a sixday week every 
friday in the midst of the worst energy crisis in communist 
chinas 40year history 
but it is more fortunate than factories in the key industrial 
cities of shanghai and shenyang which operate only three or four 
days of their usual sixday week in parts of jiangsu province 
another industrial center near shanghai up to a third of the 
factories were closed and 40 percent of the power plants had 
stopped working at the end of the year because of coal shortages 
in beijing 500 factories employing 100000 now operate only on 
night shifts because they have no power during the day 
not only factories are affected 
in beijing a city of 10 million people elevators in highrise 
buildings dont work new color televisions sit idle and people 
stock up on candles 
the official guangming daily noted that even the headquarters of 
the energy resources ministry has been ordered to shut off all 
electrical appliances every thursday 
china has been losing an average 200 billion yuan 54 billion 
a year during the 1980s due to power cuts last year the losses 
were believed to be double that as up to onethird of production 
capacity was unused 
the crisis reflects the inability of energy production to match 
the nations explosive industrial growth industrial output 
increased by more than 20 percent in 1988 but production of coal 
used for 70 percent of chinas energy was up only 4 percent 
energy supplies have also failed to cope with chinas newfound 
prosperity which has resulted in a surge of demand for televisions 
refrigerators microwaves and other electrical appliances in 
beijing last year energy consumption by households jumped 29 
percent while power supply was up by only 3 percent 
the guangming daily noted that one large luxury hotel in beijing 
today consumes as much energy as all of beijing did in the early 
1950s 
another problem is that china although the worlds largest 
producer of coal with 970 million tons last year cant get the 
power to the places it is needed 
most of the nations coal is mined in the north but industry is 
centered mainly along the southern coast half the countrys badly 
overtaxed railway system and a third of river transport is devoted 
to carrying coal but that still wasnt enough last year about 8 
million tons or 35 percent of the state coal supply quota was 
not delivered 
according to a report in the weekly publication outlook 
liaowang one large coal mine in shanxi province in the heart of 
coal country had to stop operations temporarily because it lacked 
fuel to run its bulldozers 
low investment in energy industries inefficient small mines and 
artificially low stateset prices for energy have widened the gap 
between supply and demand profiteering by officials with access to 
coal supplies even in the army is pandemic 
coal should sell for the stateprice equivalent of 8 to 11 a 
ton but it goes for 54 to 80 after passing through the hands of 
various middlemen on its way to shanghai or canton 
the government is considering various possible solutions 
including more investment in energy production higher taxes for 
energy use and higher energy prices to achieve what appears to be 
an impossible goal of producing 15 billion tons of coal by the 
year 2000 
china now has no nuclear power but is building two plants along 
the southern coast and has plans for others 
as a stopgap measure the government is hoping that its harsh 
austerity campaign begun last fall will slow the economy down 
enough to relieve the energy crisis 
if we consider energy to be the lifeblood of modern society 
the guangming daily said todays china can be compared to a 
patient suffering from anemia

how different george bushs first 100 days are 
from ronald reagans 
no battering of washingtons ways by a charismatic californian 
no outsiders hand on the helm setting the government on its 
sharpest course change since the new deal 
these 100 days have brought only modest course corrections by a 
captain long used to walking the deck of the ship of state 
reagan came in as an ideologue he came up in politics that 
way as a crusader said james l sundquist senior fellow 
emeritus in governmental studies at the brookings institution 
bush has no crusade to carry out it hasnt been a very 
dramatic hundred days 
no it hasnt 
by april 29 1981 the 100th day of his presidency reagan was 
on his way to full recovery after the attempt on his life and was 
making it ever more clear that his energies were devoted not to the 
question of whether there would be budget and tax cuts but to how 
deeply he could slash 
kenneth duberstein who handled relations with the house during 
reagans first months in office says the assassination attempt and 
reagans devotion to the themes of his campaign shaking up the 
ways government raises and spends money steering the economy out 
of its doldrums and strengthening the nations defenses 
determined the tenor of that first 100 days 
of the assassination attempt duberstein says 
the way he handled it with humor and dignity and class and 
with good grace struck a very responsive chord in the american 
public i think it continued the honeymoon and helped the process 
of making ronald reagan larger than life 
of reagans priorities duberstein who later became reagans 
chief of staff pointed to the significance of the decision that 
it is much better to communicate two or three major priorities 
rather than setting up 40 or 50 priorities 
there was a lot of arguing back and forth but we had a game 
plan and a strategy and we stuck to it 
bush on the other hand has divided his energies among a number 
of initiatives 
he gave capitol hill a plan to bail out and reform the savings 
and loan industry congressional committees have made significant 
changes 
he and congress agreed to a nearly 28 billion 
deficitreduction plan that leaves the hard choices about cutting 
federal red ink for the future 
he secured congressional agreement to continue nonmilitary aid 
to the contras but agreed to halt the aid in november unless four 
committees allow it to continue 
he submitted a 441 million education package it has been met 
with little enthusiasm 
for much of bushs first 100 days however the overriding issue 
in his dealings with the democraticcontrolled congress was his 
nomination of john tower as defense secretary 
after a bruising confirmation battle the senate rejected the 
former texas senator 5347 on march 9 it was the first time in 30 
years that a presidents nomination to his cabinet had been turned 
down 
opinions differ on whether the tower defeat will impair bushs 
dealings with congress or whether he repaired the damage with his 
swift and popular second choice of dick cheney one of congress 
own 
the whole town seems to have put the tower thing behind us 
and i didnt think we would ever do that said tom korologos 
veteran washington lobbyist who handled congressional relations for 
the reagan transition team 
i think it was a minor blip when we look back at it said 
martin anderson a senior fellow at the conservative hoover 
institution in palo alto calif who was reagans first domestic 
policy adviser 
on the other hand bayard l catron a professor of public 
administration at george washinton university and an expert on 
government ethics said it really did hurt the administration 
it detracted from everything else they were doing at the time 
and a republican strategist who spoke on condition he not be 
identified said i think it demonstrated a vulnerability which 
people will tuck away for later on 
korologos contrasting reagans entry into office with bushs 
said it was a lot different because we had to show everything 
that former president carter wasnt 
as for the bush administration he said they were just 
chipping away at the edges and trying to make course corrections a 
little bit so it was a whole lot different operation 
anderson from a slightly different perspective said the 
worse the situation is when you take over as a new president the 
easier it is to look good bush has a much more difficult problem 
given the different situation bush inherited and what he is working 
with the politics of it he is doing as well on an equivalent 
basis 
sundquist on the other hand said that bush had no particular 
program that he outlined in his campaign and he hasnt announced 
one since bush is simply carrying on playing around the 
edges 
not only have reagan and bush faced different situations they 
are different types of people 
donald t regan another reagan chief of staff described his 
boss role in shaping the economic recovery package this way in his 
book for the record 
the president himself had very little to do with the invention 
and the implementation of the policies and mechanismshe was 
content to exercise the symbolic powers of his office and his 
astonishing skill in doing so was of course the very thing that 
made success possible 
bush on the other hand is a veteran of the nuts and bolts of 
government hes got a managerial interest which reagan never 
had said catron the professor of public administration 
another difference was highlighted by the gop strategist who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity reagan always tried to make 
a headline every day or get on the network news and bush seems not 
to be particularly concerned about it 
administration officials have told reporters they dont think 
the 100day yardstick first applied in the administration of 
franklin d roosevelt is applicable to bush 
korologos agreed saying that fdr taking office in the depths 
of the depression had to do it in 100 days 
bush doesnt have to do it in 100 days hes got four years to 
do it 
sundquist however cautioned that anything the president 
wants to get done in his term usually has to be done within the 
first year which means it has to be under way within the first few 
months 
whether it is 100 days or 180 days is a minor point but very 
little happens in the second third and fourth years of any 
presidents term so the honeymoon period has to be used for 
important initiatives and it has not been in this case

the shuttle atlantis is set to soar 
into space friday to rekindle an american planetary exploration 
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and 
the challenger accident 
the cargo is the magellan spacecraft which has a radar system 
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of venus 
and map its surface the mission costs 550 million and the radar 
images could reveal much about the history of venus and the 
evolution of our own earth 
liftoff is scheduled for 224 pm friday and six hours later 
atlantis five astronauts are to release magellan on the start of a 
466day outward journey to the mysterious planet 
no american planetary spacecraft has been launched since the 
pioneervenus probe in 1978 and magellan will be the first 
planetbound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle 
when the 7000pound payload reaches venus in august 1990 it is 
to fire into orbit and start its 243day mapping assignment 
the goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of 
the planet said stephen saunders magellan project scientist at 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
he said the images could help scientists understand how venus 
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of 
how earth and venus evolved so differently even though at the 
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical at the 
venusian surface the temperature is 900 degrees fahrenheit and the 
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on earth 
saunders said the magellan pictures might answer questions about 
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether 
venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal 
plates similar to those on earth 
the radar is designed to produce images showing features as 
small as 150 yards across in comparison the 1978 pioneervenus 
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across 
magellan is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for 
launching from atlantis this year the galileo probe to jupiter is 
to set forth in october 
the two spacecraft have been in development for more than a 
decade they initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a 
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the apollo 
mantothemoon program 
they finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff 
in 1986 but those flights were derailed after challenger exploded 
in january 1986 grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years 
its been a long time coming saunders said 
the first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was 
russias venera 1 which scouted venus in 1961 in the years that 
followed a parade of these vehicles each more sophisticated than 
the last pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of 
our planetary neighbors 
the united states has successfully sent five probes to venus 
six to mars four to jupiter three to saturn and one each to 
mercury and uranus and in august the longtraveling voyager 2 is 
to take the first closeup look at neptune 
the soviet union has sent 19 successful spacecraft to venus and 
nine to mars its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed 
phobos 1 last september while en route to mars and phobos 2 as it 
was starting its exploration from martian orbit last month 
soviet engineers have not perfected the longterm 
nuclearpowered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets 
the soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power 
from the sun but at distant saturn jupiter neptune and uranus 
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective 
at their destinations some of these robot marvels skim close 
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring 
on to another planet or into interstellar space some orbit their 
targets to examine them at length and some descend to the surface 
what they collect is flashed as binary bits to earthbound 
computers which translate the unknown into recognizable places 
filled with surprises and secrets vague speculations of the past 
have been replaced by solid scientific findings 
humans have caught their first views and hints of the great 
storm systems and rings of jupiter the active volcanoes on its 
saltcovered moon io the parched and cratered wasteland of 
mercury ancient river bottoms raging winds and an inactive 
volcanoe almost 80000 feet high on mars sulfuric acid clouds 
lightning and the hellish temperatures on venus the thousand rings 
and tantalizing moons of saturn a scalding 6000mile deep ocean 
beneath the cloudtops of uranus 
from these flights nasa is assembling a vast mosaic about the 
solar system and its intricate workings a basic goal is to learn 
more about planet earth fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is 
the origin the evolution and the structure of the universe 
some astronomers believe for example that mars may today 
represent an earlier evolutionary state of earth when its 
atmosphere was being formed and that venus may represent what 
might happen to earth if its surface temperature were to rise 
significantly

the latest discoveries come from a faroff realm uranus 
relayed by voyager 2 a marvelous machine launched along with 
voyager 1 in 1977 to probe jupiter and saturn voyager 2 was 
working so well after exploring saturn that nasa reprogrammed it to 
sail past uranus in 1986 and neptune next august 
uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because 
unlike the other planets it lies tipped on its side with its north 
and south poles alternately facing the sun voyager 2 found that 
uranus magnetic field does not follow the usual northsouth axis 
and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center 
astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an 
ancient collision with another celestial object 
voyager 2 found that winds on uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow 
from the west instead of the east as previously suspected about 
5000 miles below the planets cloudtops the spacecraft detected 
evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 
6000 miles deep beneath this ocean it is believed there is an 
earthsize molten core of heavier materials 
the spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting uranus ranging 
from 24 to 102 miles in diameter much smaller than the planets 
previously recorded five satellites uranus was thought to have 
nine rings voyager found 11 in contrast to saturns rings which 
are composed of bright grainsized particles uranus rings are 
made up of dark bouldersized chunks 
the voyagers also discovered a ring around jupiter the largest 
planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory 
because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons 
during the flyby encounters the voyagers and the earlier 
pioneers 10 and 11 found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid 
hydrogen topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly 
hydrogen and helium they learned the great red spot observed for 
centuries through earthbased telescopes is a tremendous 
atmospheric storm similar to earths hurricanes 
the space probes detected lightning in jupiters upper 
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like earths northern 
lights in the jovian polar regions jupiter spins at a dizzying 
pace once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds but it takes 
the massive planet almost 12 earth years to complete a journey 
around the sun 
before pioneer 11 and the voyagers passed by saturn astronomers 
knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six 
rings the startling images relayed back quickly identified several 
thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet 
at various speeds 
the spacecraft discovered five new saturnian moons raising the 
total to 17 titan the largest received the most attention 
because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an 
atmosphere although it is inconceivable that life could exist in 
the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to 
form titans surface scientists are intrigued by the possibility 
that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic 
molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval earth between three and 
four billion years ago 
the voyagers also found saturns atmosphere of hydrogen and 
helium alive with monster storms with winds of 1100 mph 
venus our sister planet and closest neighbor more nearly 
resembles earth in size physical composition and density than any 
of the other planets however mariner and pioneer probes found 
that venus is a blistering hot world where the 900degree heat is 
trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide 
radar peering through venus thick cloud cover found evidence of 
two major active volcano areas the concentration of lightning over 
these areas suggests frequent eruptions a valley may have been 
created by tension in the planets crust pulling the surface apart 
like similar processes on earth 
photographs taken of mercury by mariner 10 in 1974 and 1975 
revealed an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resembling 
our own moon the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing 
the planet 
instruments aboard mariner 10 found that mercury has a weak 
magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere a trillionth the 
density of the earths and composed chiefly of argon neon and 
helium the spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950 
degrees fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero 
on the shadowed side 
of all the planets mars has long been considered the solar 
systems prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life but 
the results obtained by the viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976 and 1977 
were teasingly inconclusive small samples of martian soil were 
scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments 
designed to detect biological processes while some of the tests 
indicated biological processes were occuring the same results 
could be explained by the planets chemistry there was no evidence 
of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the vikings 
the vikings and earlier mariners found that dust covers the 
martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to 
stir up fierce summer storms massive active volcanoes dot the 
landscape and dry sinuous channels perhaps carved long ago by 
flowing water stretch for hundreds of miles many scientists 
believe water still lies below the surface giving rise to 
speculation that some form of life might yet be found there

wendy kilbourne says she believes her 
character in midnight caller the wealthy owner of the radio

i think she and jack are friends kilbourne said i like 
the relationship because its not burdened with sexual tensions 
there is a mutual attraction i think the writers are trying to 
have these peoples vision widened by the others point of view 
theres a real friendship developing between the characters i like 
that 
the onehour series filmed on location in san francisco has 
been doing well in the ratings and consistently wins its time slot 
i got the role by auditioning for it which is a very painful 
process kilbourne said on a visit to los angeles i was 
interviewing for another job and forgot about the appointment with 
the producers of midnight caller my agent called and said id be 
late 
i raced over preoccupied with the other show and read

my mother was looking for stability shes an artist and 
while she appreciates the creative aspects of the business she 
wanted to provide a stable environment for her children she had 
grown up in boarding schools in england 
despite her mothers aversion to hollywood kilbourne began 
studying drama when her mother married an actor involved with the 
shakespeare festival she began studying with the south coast 
repertory theater then enrolled at orange coast college 
during that time i rediscovered my love of acting she said 
it had been a bit of a conflict because my family was 
academically oriented and i was studying political science it was 
a time when i could have gone either way i dropped out of college 
and pursued acting fulltime 
once she turned professional things moved swiftly 
i dont remember having a time when i could say i can rest 
now she said i dont think its in my personality to sit 
back im very critical and demanding of myself every time i see 
my work i say im better than i was a year ago but ive got a long 
way to go 
her first professional film role was two lines in an episode of 
the paper chase 
she was constance flynn hazzard in the abc miniseries north 
and south 
i was the irish girl whose father was the doctor in the 
mexican war she said robert mitchum played my father thats 
when i meet george hazzard and we marry i worked very hard on the 
irish accent everyone around me was speaking with a south carolina

citicorp shareholders have overwhelmingly 
rejected requests from church groups led by the rev jesse jackson 
and representatives of south african archbishop desmond tutu to 
sever all remaining ties with racially segregated south africa 
citicorp the nations largest banking company stopped doing 
business in that country two years ago when it sold its citibank 
na ltd subsidiary to first national bank of southern africa 
ltd south africas largest bank for about 65 million 
but citicorp like some other us banks still has about 666 
million in private outstanding loans to south african borrowers it 
recently agreed to extend by 10 years payments on the bulk of that 
debt and accept partial principal payment as part of an agreement 
with other international banks 
south africa had placed a temporary moratorium on principal 
payments of bank debt in september 1985 
the church groups had asked that citicorp which remains the 
largest us commercial bank creditor of that country to refuse to 
reschedule south african debt and make any new loans as long as the 
present political system remains intact 
by extending this debt were expressing a tolerance of south 
africa jackson said tuesday at citicorps annual shareholders 
meeting we must make a moral judgment 
citicorp chairman john reed said that while his company opposes 
south africas apartheid system debt forgiveness is a word youll 
never hear from this bank 
our objective is simple and straightforward we would like to 
be paid back its not a question of morals its a question of 
business judgment he explained 
citicorp shareholders also agreed with 916 percent of them 
voting against a proposal to abandon debt rescheduling agreements 
with south africa vs 84 percent approving it the remaining 
abstained 
the shareholders also rejected a request by the church groups 
for citicorp to end corresponent banking with south africa in 
which it performs services for firms not having access to direct 
facilities the vote was 892 percent opposed 108 percent in

ross kapstein has been teaching long enough to 
know that kids arent exactly wild about learning economics so he 
came up with a novel way of presenting the oftendry curriculum 
through the lyrics of rap music 
kapstein who has dabbled in the music business as a performer 
and manager during his 18 years as a public school teacher wrote 
and recorded run gnp a rappin tribute to the joys of 
economics 
he also had some of his students at martin luther king jr 
middle school participate in making a video version of the song 
kapstein uses both as motivational tools to make economics seem 
less imposing to the 6th 7th and 8thgrade students in his 
social studies and history classes 
rather than the academic words of a textbook kapstein believes 
teachers could better introduce young students to economic concepts 
with such lines as 
try to maximize profits 
minimize costs 
thats what im tryin to do 
increase productivity 
improve the quality 
so i can bring the best product to you 
or how about this explanation of supply and demand 
now when resources get scarce 
or demand increases 
the price of goods rise 
it rarely decreases 
peoples tastes change 
and so do i 
if i want to stay in business 
id better comply 
and you can dance to it 
i thought it was a good idea in this day and age when kids 
can rap and memorize pages and pages of entertainment 
information why not do something educational to go along with 
it kapstein said in a recent interview 
economics is sometimes boring and difficult he said i 
saw this would be a really nice idea hell i write music songs 
i said let me put something together 
kapstein 40 recorded the song whose title was inspired by rap 
stars run dmc with a small group of professional musicians he 
hopes to release it as a single for use by other teachers 
the video set in a city park has the ragged feel of a home 
movie but kapstein said hed like to make a more polished version 
if he can obtain money to cover production costs 
economics is just a small part of the middle school curriculum 
but kapstein believes that if his musical efforts are successful 
students will be more inclined toward the subject when they reach 
high school 
kids in high school really put it off its something that 
really has a low priority kapstein said we try to dispel the 
myths so its not a terrible monster 
it can ba a lot of fun economics can be made easy he 
added when they get into economics is high school theyre gonna 
say yeah 
kapstein said the seeds of his idea were planted a couple of 
years ago when he enrolled in a program at georgia state 
universitys center for business amp economic education that stressed 
creative and unusual approaches to teaching 
mixing music and economics was a natural for him kapstein said 
ive always been into motivating the kids through music 
said kapstein who in the 1970s managed the career of the late 
blues singer willie guy rainey 
i used to bring in willie guy during black history month and 
he was the most effective he said 
kapstein said he has other ideas but for now hes waiting to 
see if run gnp catches on 
if things take off ill be turning out songs like crazy he 
said

the biggestever order for commercial jetliners 
extends the comfort margin in an alreadyhot industry that has 
outstripped predictions of success say analysts and officials for 
boeing co which received the biggest share of the blockbuster 
order 
were in the midst of the biggest boom in aviation 
history said paul nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
multibilliondollar orders have been rolling in over the past 
few years and even the industry midgets such as fokker bv of the 
netherlands and british aerospace plc have years of work booked 
each succeeding major order is extending by a few weeks the 
time during which the companies or the industry will be at peak 
production over the next several years nisbet said 
on tuesday gpa group ltd announced a 17 billion order for 308 
airliners 121 firm orders and options on an additional 187 jets 
from boeing mcdonnell douglas corp and europes airbus industrie 
the order from the shannon ireland aircraftleasing concern is 
the largest civilian aircraft order ever topping delta air lines 
105 billion order for up to 225 boeing and mcdonnell douglas 
aircraft last september 
gpas order reflects the growing importance of aircraft leasing 
companies which account for about onefifth of all aircraft 
orders it also underscores the airlines concern about replacing 
their aging fleets 
boeings 94 billion share of the order is for 92 737 models 
50 757s and 40 767s with deliveries over the next seven years 
at boeings rate of production the orders represent about a 
halfyears work the order fills production slots into the 
mid1990s said boeing spokesman t craig martin and while it 
provides security for the work force it wont require new 
employees 
even before the order he said boeing had a backlog of more 
than 1100 aircraft and the industry giant is predicting all 
builders will deliver 8400 new airplanes by 2005 to keep up with 
demand 
so while an order like this looks huge its really not that 
big a percentage of total deliveries martin said 
last year was a record one for boeing which received 636 orders 
totaling 29 billion so far this year 301 orders with a value of 
191 billion are on the books of the seattle company 
despite the flood of orders industry analyst paul turk of 
avmark inc in arlington va said that while the industry is in 
the clouds it could be brought back to earth in a rush if the world 
economy sputters 
he said avmark believes boeings projections for 8400 new 
airplanes in the next 16 years which would more than replace the 
existing fleet of some 7800 planes is overly optimistic 
but he added the market is very good and it should be 
very good for a while to come 
nisbet said he couldnt argue with boeings figures the 
aircarrier industry from passengers booking flights to 
manufacturers and subcontractors has been flourishing like no one 
had predicted he said 
the airplanebuilding business has been growing at an 
accelerated rate for several years nisbet said and hit 8 percent 
last year 
if you consider 4 percent growth a year as normal your 
demand for new aircraft should be around 300 to 350 a year he 
said 
last year he said there were 512 new deliveries across the 
industry with boeing providing 289 of those by 1991 he 
estimated 750 could be delivered 
even with an expected leveling off of air travel in the early 
1990s he said demand for airplanes should remain strong because 
replacement aircraft are needed 
for the first time in industry history we are in the midst 
of a replacement cycle as well as a growth cycle that is very 
strong he said 
besides boeings share of the gpa order mcdonnell douglas corp 
received a 31 billion order for 64 md80 twinjets and 8 md11 
threejet models while airbus industrie won a 43 billion order 
for 30 a320s 10 a330s and two a340s in addition gpa took 
options on an additional 10 a330s and two a340s

at 17 billion tuesdays aircraft order by 
irelands gpa group ltd for 308 new planes from three 
manufacturers became by far the biggest order in aviation history 
for commercial jetliners 
here is a look at the gpa order and other major orders placed in 
the industry by size 
17 billion by gpa boeing co received 94 billion in firm 
orders for 92 boeing 737 models 50 757s and 40 767s all have two 
engines mcdonnell douglas corp got firm orders of 31 billion 
for 64 md80 twinjets and 8 md11 threejet models europes 
airbus industrie received firm orders of 43 billion for 30 a320s 
10 a330s and two a340s also options for an additional 10 a330s 
and two a340s 
107 billion order in september 1988 to boeing and mcdonnell 
douglas by delta air lines the airline ordered nine md11 jumbo 
jets and nine boeing 767s and took options on another 31 md11s 
16 767s 100 md88s and 50 boeing 757s value estimated by analysts 
since delta did not divulge dollar amounts 
6 billion order in february 1989 to mcdonnell douglas by 
american airlines for 50 md11 widebody jetliners at 4 billion 
and 100 md80s at 2 billion only eight orders for md11s are 
firm value estimated by industry analyst since neither the

younger than the average for the jetliner fleet says an aviation 
consulting firm 
the average age of turboprop aircraft used by airlines in the

years turboprops in asia and australia average 135 years in 
latin america 13 years in africa 124 years and in europe 121 
years according to the report 
the average age of the commuterregional turboprop fleet is 
expected to experience a decline as the operators continue to 
expand their operations through acquisition of a substantial number 
of new aircraft in the next decade the report says 
it says 681 percent of the turboprops in north america were 
built within the last nine years while 76 percent were built 20 
or more years ago the oldest turboprops are those that carry 40 to 
50 passengers while the youngest are in the 2039 passenger 
category 
the youngest fleets according to avmark belong to the midway 
express system 34 years and piedmont commuter 38 years while

the number of new singleengine aircraft sold 
by us manufacturers increased 285 percent in the first quarter 
but sales of all other types of smaller aircraft decreased from the 
same period last year an industry group reported 
in 1988 the smallaircraft industry reported its first increase 
in a decade of both the number and value of planes delivered the 
figures cover sales of civilian planes that carry fewer than 20 
passengers and generally are not used by scheduled airlines 
the firstquarter report released tuesday by the general 
aviation manufacturers association based on delivery of aircraft 
showed 212 singleengine planes sold compared with 165 in the 
yearago quarter 
sales of jet planes dropped from 34 to 23 while turboprop sales 
were down from 52 to 51 and twinengine aircraft from 23 to 18 
sales reached 30297 million for the first quarter compared 
with 37746 for the first quarter of 1988 and the value of 
aircraft sold abroad dropped to 975 million from last years 
15852 million for the quarter the association reported 
the increase in total aircraft deliveries is an encouraging 
sign said edward m stimpson the associations president but 
he said the industry has been devastated by unfair product 
liability laws the association supports bills introduced in 
congress that would limit the liability of manufacturers 
stimpson said increased funding to modernize airports is also 
needed for the industry to grow 
the association represents 36 manufacturers of aircraft engines 
and related equipment

a government report that said consumer prices rose the most in 
two years during the first quarter of 1989 triggered purchases of 
stocks and bonds by investors who had feared the inflation news 
would be even worse 
the dow jones 30stock industrial average gained 4161 points 
monday to close at 237940 a postcrash high 
in the credit market which is especially sensitive to 
inflation purchases of the treasurys benchmark 30year bond drove 
its yield down to 893 percent from 904 percent late monday bond 
yields move in the opposite direction of the price 
higher food and energy costs boosted consumer prices 05 percent 
in march resulting in a 61 percent annual inflation rate for the 
first three months of 1989 the labor department said tuesday 
last months gain in the labor departments consumer price index 
was fresh evidence that inflation continues to run above the 44 
percent rate registered in both 1987 and 1988 
inflation was uncomfortably high widespread and entrenched in 
march said allen sinai chief economist for the boston co we 
havent seen the last of these high numbers because there will 
still be a rippling through of rising business costs for both 
materials and wages and rising energy costs in the next few 
months 
still expectations that the economy is cooling off were 
bolstered by a report from the commerce department on tuesday that 
showed housing starts fell 54 percent in march with construction 
of singlefamily homes at the slowest pace in more than four years 
the only good news on inflation was the bad news on housing 
underscoring a weak firstquarter economy and raising hope that 
later on inflation can recede sinai said 
economist john hagens of the wefa group a forecasting firm in 
bala cynwyd pa said the nation appears destined for a round of 
stagflation in which the economy slows while prices continue 
to rise forcing the federal reserve to choose between further 
restraining growth to curb inflation and boosting the economy to 
stimulate employment 
food costs in march rose 08 percent twice as fast as in 
february 
taken together prices for meat fish and eggs rose 24 percent 
energy costs meanwhile registered their sharpest increase 
since august 1987 advancing 11 percent practically double the 
preceding months 06 percent

whittle communications lp wants to put short 
hardcover books by respected authors in the briefcases of americas 
corporate and civic leaders and is selling advertising space in 
the books to pay the bill 
the proposal disclosed tuesday stirred curiosity in the 
publishing community which has generally limited advertising in 
hardcover books to pitches for either the authors or the 
publishers other works 
whether it is a ridiculous idea that will fall on its face or 
be the wave of the future i cant tell yet said joni evans the 
publisher of random house 
nansey neiman publisher of warner books said she hasnt 
decided whether advertising in books would be good for business 
but she added as a reader im not sure i want to read a book 
and find an ad for baby powder or worse 
the knoxville tennbased whittle said tuesday it has signed 
david halberstam john kenneth galbraith and seven other wellknown 
authors for the first of what it says will be several sponsored 
book series 
it would be the first book publishing venture by the 
fastgrowing media concern which has specialized in creating 
magazines posters and television programs that sponsors may use to 
reach tightlydefined audiences such as new mothers pet owners or 
teens at school 
whittle which is 50 percentowned by the media giant time inc 
said it plans to publish the first book in what is tentatively 
called the larger agenda series later this year it plans five 
books a year 
the other authors signed by whittle are george gilder edward j 
epstein james atlas robert waterman richard holbrooke daniel 
seligman and william greider they are reportedly being paid an 
average of 60000 each 
among the topics epstein will write about michael milken the 
indicted junk bond pioneer holbrooke will explain why business 
people should care about foreign policy and greider will write 
about the financial system 
the books will run about 100 pages with 20 pages of advertising 
scattered among 80 pages of editorial text and will be sent for 
free to about 150000 people whittle considers opinion leaders 
christopher whittle chairman of whittle communications said 
the project resulted from research that showed many readers failed 
to read or finish books because the books were too long and they 
had too little time 
he said writers meanwhile wanted an outlet longer than 
magazines provide but shorter than fulllength books 
advertising support provided the financial bridge needed to 
support the shorter books he said 
greider reached in washington dc said liked getting a 
chance to reach what should be a pretty bluechip audience and 
had no problem with the type of advertising he expects would be 
included in the series 
if the book was studded with truss ads and hairrestoring ads 
and breast implant ads i could see how you might have some 
problems with it he said 
whittle plans to sell copies at bookstores nationwide six months 
after the free distribution and will sell them more cheaply than 
books without ads 
whittle officials declined to identify advertisers but a source 
familiar with the plans speaking on condition of anonymity said 
federal express co of memphis tenn will be the sole advertiser 
in the first series 
federal express spokesman jim coleman said that for competitive 
reasons the company does not comment on its advertising plans 
carolyn reidy president and publisher of avon books said 
paperbacks once routinely carried ads two decades ago but the 
practice was phased out because of postal regulations and protests 
from authors i dont think there will be a rush to do it 
again she said 
whittle said he hoped to be publishing up to 40 books a year 
generating 50 million in annual revenue for his company in five 
years the company had 150 million in revenue last year

even if the strike against eastern airlines is 
never resolved moreton rolleston jr figures his pilot son and 
flight attendant daughterinlaw eventually will find work but 
hes worried about the effect on competition at atlantas airport 
the 71yearold atlanta lawyer said tuesday he intervened in 
easterns bankruptcy case because he wants to make sure the idled 
airline returns to operation 
this is real important to atlanta rolleston said in an 
interview eastern had been running 100000 people to atlanta 
every day 290 flights a day forty percent of the traffic in 
atlanta was eastern 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland in new york scheduled a 
hearing for next week on rollestons motion to have the court to 
appoint a trustee to run eastern until parent texas air corp can 
sell it 
rolleston was allowed to intervene in the case because he is a 
member of easterns frequent flier program which is run jointly 
with sister carrier continental airlines since he has mileage 
credits in the program which rewards frequent fliers with free 
trips the court considered him an eastern creditor 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said texas airs current 
position is that eastern is no longer for sale and instead will be 
trimmed to a smaller size and remain in operation as part of its 
bankruptcy reorganization 
she said rolleston is the father of a striking eastern pilot 
and the fatherinlaw of a striking eastern flight attendant so 
his interests are more than those of a frequent traveler 
im not a stockholder i have no financial connection with 
eastern i have not sought out anybody to buy it i have no strings 
attached although i do have a personal interest he said 
my son is a captain with eastern hes been with eastern for 
22 years and my daughterinlaw is a flight attendant rolleston 
said im not going to give you his name because my family is not 
part of this what i did i did as a lawyer and i did it before any 
of them knew about it 
since eastern went on strike he said you cant get out of 
atlanta unless youre on delta air lines which is based in 
atlanta 
and deltas flights are so crowded since the eastern strike 
its cramping his traveling style used to having a choice of 
flight times rolleston complained that to go to a bankruptcy 
court hearing on eastern on monday i could only get one flight 
out to new york sunday 
eastern workers have been on strike since march 4 contending 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo has damaged the airline and 
plotted to destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to 
continental 
lorenzo put eastern into bankruptcy court refuge march 9 and has 
been seeking a buyer exbaseball commissioner peter ueberroth 
nearly completed a 464 million deal to buy eastern but the sale 
fell through over a dispute between the unions and lorenzo over who 
would run the airlines until ueberroths investor group could 
assume control 
regardless of whether you agree with them or not and im not 
going to take a position on that the employees are not going to 
go back to work as long as lorenzo controls eastern rolleston 
said if you had a trustee the employees would go back to work 
rolleston said his son isnt angry that his father jumped into 
the fray 
he went to new york with me for a hearing earlier this week 
but hes not in the lawsuit and he doesnt want to get involved in 
the legal end of it rolleston said 
rolleston said his familys involvement in the company isnt the 
reason hes trying to get eastern back into operation anyway 
this is real important to this city he said the fact 
that itll help my son and daughterinlaw is fine but theyll be 
back flying one of these days anyway i want eastern airlines 
flying here in atlanta

analysts say billionaire oilman marvin davis 
has obtained financing that will support a bid of more than 100 a 
share for nwa inc a belief reflected by the sharp climb in the 
stock price of the parent of northwest airlines 
nwas stock closed tuesday at 9738 up 713 it was the most 
active issue on the new york stock exchange with 35 million 
shares trading hands 
this should flush out any competing bids and probably a higher 
bid from davis said louis marckesano an analyst for janney 
montgomery scott inc of philadelphia 
davis has said he would consider increasing his bid of 27 
billion or 90 a share but did not offer a higher price tuesday 
nwas board has rejected his current bid as inadequate and on 
monday directed management to explore a wide range of possible 
deals to maximize shareholder value 
marckesano said the boards announcement may have played the 
biggest role in making the stock jump but part of the momentum 
came from the realization that davis 33 billion financial 
package could support a bid of up to 110 a share said kurt rivard 
of minneapolisbased dain bosworth inc 
its a very strong financing package said sandy schuele 
who operates a small hedge fund in plainfield nh if there is 
anyone else in the wings they would have to surface now if they 
dont surface there is no one else in the wings 
the package would include 300 million of davis own money a 
600 million bond offering and a 500 million loan from citibank 
the balance would be a loan arranged by citicorp north america inc 
from a syndicate of major banks davis said 
in addition citibank would provide a 250 million backup 
revolving line of credit to be available to supplement nwas 
working capital davis said 
citibank wouldnt undertake this unless they felt their client 
had a serious purpose schuele said 
in state government circles where officials have expressed fear 
that davis would break up the eaganbased airline to pay takeover 
debt there was some criticism of the financial package 
minnesota commerce commissioner michael hatch said the package 
would require annual debt payments of up to 450 million depending 
on the interest rates 
the company had a profit last year of 135 million hatch 
said where does he get the other 300 million what he presented 
today doesnt give that answer and very frankly thats the 
question 
hatch has supported efforts in the minnesota legislature to pass 
laws that would discourage a takeover of northwest which employs 
more than 15000 people in the state gov rudy perpich said 
actions are still being pursued on the state and federal levels to 
thwart a takeover even though he believes davis is determined to 
buy northwest 
davis repeated tuesday that he would not have to sell 
strategic assets or cut employment to finance the takeover 
mark daugherty an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc of new 
york said davis would have second thoughts about not selling 
strategic assets if a recession develops he said the debt load of 
davis plan would be burdensome on the airline 
nwa has said it will provide nonpublic information to davis and 
other qualified third parties interested in buying the company 
management has received approval to negotiate with davis but 
neither the company nor a davis spokesman in new york would say 
whether the two sides had made contact 
nwas board also said it would explore restructuring moves 
including the acquisition of another company a partial or complete 
liquidation of the airline a repurchase of shares a special 
dividend to shareholders or a sale of equity to third parties 
william genoese who heads the airline division of the 
international brotherhood of teamsters on friday said northwest 
might be considering buying financially troubled pan american world 
airways the company would not comment on the rumor

a federal judge has refused to lift an injunction 
against mai basic four incs 970 million hostile bid for prime 
computer inc 
us district court judge a david mazzone said tuesday he would 
not remove the injunction until mai a tustin calif computer 
firm provides prime stockholders with audited yearend financial 
statements from mais investment bank drexel burnham lambert inc 
the ruling will further delay mais 20pershare tender offer 
for prime a natickbased computer maker with revenue of 159 
billion last year the tender offer has been enjoined since dec 9 
when mazzone ruled that drexels involvement in the takeover battle 
was so extensive that the bank should be considered a cobidder and 
had to disclose financial information 
we are very gratified that judge mazzone has ordered mai and 
drexel to make the disclosures we have been seeking for five 
months said prime spokesman joseph gavaghan 
mai also is waging a proxy battle for control of primes board 
of directors at the companys june 14 annual meeting prime 
chairman david j dunn said the current board is committed to 
selling the company but considers mais offer too low 
mai filed financial disclosure documents with the securities and 
exchange commission april 6 in an effort to satisfy mazzone and 
remove the injunction 
in his ruling tuesday the judge said most of those documents 
including a list of drexels trades in prime stock were adequate 
but he said drexels statement of financial condition which was 
for the first nine months of 1988 was not current enough 
mazzone said he would not lift the injunction until 10 days 
after mai certifies that it has mailed drexels yearend statement 
to prime stockholders 
at the same time the judge denied a motion from prime to place 
another injunction on the offer because of alleged violations of 
federal reserve margin requirements

the eec commission plans to clear the 
3 billion takeover bid for britains defenseelectronics company 
plessey by siemens of west germany and general electric co of 
britain it was announced wednesday 
if the provisional decision by the european economic community 
is confirmed it could clear the way for the creation of a new 
electronics giant in europe 
in a statement the eecs competition commissioner sir leon 
brittan said the commission had come to the conclusion that the 
proposed arrangements do not raise objections under the eecs 
competition rules 
brittan stressed however that all parties concerned and the 
public would be invited to comment before a final decision was made 
he said that plessey would have six weeks to respond to the 
commission then according to what the company says in its 
response the commission would either confirm its decision or look 
at the case again 
the eecs opinion was issued prior to the publication in britain 
of a review of the bid by the british monopolies and mergers 
commission 
brittan said his proposed clearance of the bid excluded 
plesseys defense interests because eec rules allow member states 
to take unilateral measures necessary to protect these interests 
he said that general electric co gec and siemens had pledged 
to maintain plesseys semiconductor activities as a distinct 
company under plessey management and to support related research 
and development 
the commission said that gec and siemens agreed not to make any 
substantial modifications in those activities without obtaining 
the approval of the eec 
eec antitrust officials launched the probe into the bid for 
plessey after the company asked the commission last december to 
block the bid under the eecs competition rules these rules outlaw 
any industrial agreement likely to distort free competition 
gec and plessey are britains two largest defenseelectronics 
contractors siemens with nv philips of the netherlands is one of 
europes two top electronics groups

massive securities fraud probes and slumping business since the 
1987 stock market crash drexel burnham lambert inc is shedding 
its 2300employee retail brokerage unit as part of a major 
restructuring 
the nations fifthlargest investment firm said tuesday it will 
try to sell the brokerage unit which accounts for about 10 percent 
of drexels business to another brokerage house 
drexel said it also is abandoning its business in municipal 
securities overthecounter stocks and research and transactions

the move comes five days after drexel agreed to tight federal 
oversight for three years in settling civil fraud charges with the 
securities and exchange commission 
drexel chief executive frederick h joseph announced the 
restructuring over the firms public address system calling the 
verdict by its board of directors last weekend the only 
economically viable solution

current realities at the firm implying the governments nearly 
threeyear investigation of alleged securities abuses many 
involving the milkens dealings with jailed inside trader ivan 
boesky 
the decision was made in view of the anticipated inability to 
grow the retail business to an economically viable size in light of 
ongoing adverse publicity drexel said in a statement 
the sec pact clears the way for settlement of criminal fraud 
charges with the manhattan us attorneys office drexel has 
agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record 650 
million to avoid a massive racketeering indictment 
a rash of civil lawsuits over drexels activities possibly 
numbering in the thousands now are expected to be filed in 
individual states in addition congressional officials have 
indicated they plan further investigations into drexel 
the continued investigations along with the possible 
highvisibility trial of former drexel junkbond financier michael 
milken means the firm will remain in a negative spotlight for some 
time 
its a kind of situation thats very sensitive as far as 
retail clients are concerned said painewebber inc analyst 
brenda davis mccoy 
in its statement drexel cited the depressed state of the 
securities industry the anticipated lack of participation by 
individual investors and increased competition from commercial 
banks in retail brokerage 
drexel which does not release earnings or other detailed 
financial data said it has total capital of about 2 billion and 
net equity capital of about half that 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to give details on the 
extent of the retail business decline but said it was just 
getting difficult indeed the numbers were going in the other 
direction 
after a board meeting tuesday drexel said it notified about 10 
other wall street firms about peddling the division it said it 
hopes to have bids by saturday and a sale completed by early next 
week 
drexels statement said the firm would concentrate on highyield 
junk bonds government securities corporate finance institutional 
fixed income activities mortgagebacked securities arbitrage and 
commodities 
business on wall street has been sluggish because of high 
interest rates continued investor distrust following the october 
1987 market crash and a severe decline in mergers and 
acquisitions several firms announced weak firstquarter profits in 
the last week 
drexel itself has shrunk from a high of about 10000 employees 
worldwide to 9100 today the 10 percent payroll decline is about 
average for wall street firms most of which laid off hundreds of 
employees after the crash 
the retail brokerage unit has lost about 200 brokers from a high 
of 1300 it now has about 1100 brokers and another 1200 
employees drexel declined to say how many people would be laid off 
in the restructuring 
individuals prefer money market instruments savings accounts 
to speculation or even investments said james hanbury of 
wertheim schroder inc its cyclical were in a down cycle 
joseph named merrill lynch amp co prudentialbache securities 
inc shearson lehman hutton inc dean witter reynolds inc and

members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries would try to cap oil prices by raising their production 
if the cartels oil basket price went beyond 19 a barrel opec 
sources said wednesday 
they said that such an understanding was reached at the groups 
last full ministerial meeting in november 
representatives from opecs 13 member countries agreed at that 
gathering to limit output to 185 million barrels a day to achieve 
a target price of 18 a barrel their current production is 
estimated at 196 million barrels a day 
the sources said that if the 19price trigger was pulled the 
market would see increased oil output from member countries many 
of whom are operating at well below their potential production 
capacity 
the opec oil basket price was at 1849 a barrel at midday 
wednesday compared with 1825 a barrel a week ago 
the basket is calculated as a running sevenday average of the 
spot or noncontact prices of seven crude oils 
the sources were responding to questions about what opecs 
response would be to the shutdown of the entire north sea brent 
production and delivery system following an accident late tuesday 
the gas leak and explosion on shell uk exploration and 
productions cormorant alpha platform reduced north sea oil output 
by 472000 barrels a day or by onequarter of the british sectors 
total output there were no injuries 
the accident pushed up oil prices sharply the spot price of 
brent blend the most widely traded international crude oil was 
trading at 2150 a barrel in london late wednesday morning up 
from 2005 late tuesday

oil futures prices surged in early trading today 
as concern spread that a north sea oil explosion could disrupt 
petroleum deliveries 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil had jumped 
121 a barrel to 2272 at about 11 am edt the contract closed 
at 2151 on tuesday 
details are still vague but theres a possibility that some 
companies arent able to deliver on cargos due a week from today 
said ed ryan energy broker with dean witter reynolds inc this 
is impacting the market in a very big way 
the explosion and fire on the small oil cormorant alpha platform 
owned by shell uk exploration and production on tuesday shut down 
the north sea brent oil field interrupting production of nearly 
500000 barrels a day of oil officials said today 
the cormorant is a gathering station the brent crude must 
flow through this one smaller station said bob baker oil 
analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
shell officials were expected to examine the damage today and 
decide how long the pipelines would remain closed analysts said 
energy brokers said the timing of the event following the 
alaskan oil spill could drive prices significantly higher 
the spill off the alaskan coast on march 24 closed down oil 
shipping lanes and disrupted the flow of oil to refineries in the 
united states for several days since then prices of both crude 
and refined products have risen by more than 10 cents 
crude prices have risen nearly 80 percent since last october 
when the organization of petroleum exporting countries decided to 
reduce oil production 
in addition problems with other north sea oil facilities and 
lower production by the united states have helped push prices 
higher

senate backers of a plan to rescue the savings 
and loan industry today defeated an attempt to force the nations 
top sampl regulator to face reconfirmation but they struggled to 
overcome a dispute that could delay adoption of the bailout package 
the senate voted 6138 to block an amendment offered by sen bob 
graham dfla that would require president bush to renominate m 
danny wall as chairman of the federal home loan bank board and the 
senate to vote on the appointment 
the administration wants to guarantee wall the right to serve 
out his term through june 1991 
however graham complained that walls reassuring comments about 
the health of sampls as late as a month before last novembers 
presidential election amounted to an intravenous shot of 
morphine that would have numbed anyone to the crisis 
sen jake garn rutah offered a warm personal defense of wall 
who worked for him for 17 years dating back to garns days as 
mayor of salt lake city 
he praised walls honesty and integrity adding lets do an 
fbi report on this man itll be so dull so boring that nobody 
would want to read it 
meanwhile sen howard m metzenbaum dohio an opponent of the 
package threatened to prolong debate unless the senate adopts a 
halfdozen amendments including several proconsumer measures 
if youre going to cost the consumers of this country the 
least you can do is make them feel good about it and give them a 
little something he said 
the chairman of the senate banking committee sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich and garn the panels senior republican have 
so far defeated attempts to amend the bill in the full senate all 
21 members of the committee have endorsed the bill 
the legislation basically tracks the proposal presented in 
february by bush pledging 157 billion to the problem over the 
next 10 years and providing a host of reforms chief among them a 
requirement that sampl owners back their lending with more of their 
own capital 
on a 5048 vote 12 short of the 60vote majority required 
the senate on tuesday rejected an effort by graham to add 50 
billion of the plans cost to the fiscal 1989 budget that move 
could have stuck bush with the biggest federal deficit in history 
earlier senators voted 6632 to beat an amendment that would 
have weakened the administrations control over disposal of an 
estimated 400 billion in real estate owned by failed sampls 
objections by metzenbaum threatened to spoil senate leaders 
plans to pass the bill today and leave for an 11day recess 
metzenbaum has not specified what he wants however he said 
possibilities include requiring banks and sampls to offer cheap 
checking accounts for poor people and free cashing of government 
checks 
he also wants financial institutions to disclose their 
performance in serving minorities and he wants the government to 
reopen last years sampl rescues 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he would 
recess the senate on thursday to observe the first day of passover 
then if metzenbaum desired return on friday and keep senators 
working into the weekend 
however sen alan dixon dill said supporters of the bill 
would file a motion today seeking to force a vote on final passage 
by friday 
the house version of sampl legislation passed a banking 
subcommittee this week it is scheduled for consideration by the 
full committee next week and by the full house by the end of may 
following a housesenate conference that could put the bill on 
bushs desk in june four months after he announced his plan 
on the funding mechanism six democratic senators joined 44 
republicans in support of the administration plan which was 
opposed by 47 democrats and one republican 
graham had argued that financing the sampl bailout through regular 
treasury borrowings would be 45 billion cheaper than the 
administrations plan to borrow the money through a quasipublic 
agency and keep 50 billion out of the budget deficit 
however grahams plan could have ballooned the 1989 budget 
deficit within range of the alltime high of 221 billion set in 
1986 
an amendment by sen bob kerrey dneb would have loosened 
administration control of the sampl bailout agency bush wanted the 
treasury secretary chairman of the federal reserve board and the 
attorney general to run the agency the senate bill adds two 
outside members to the board but kerrey would have added four 
outside members enough to outvote the government officials 
democrats opposing graham on the funding plan were sens joseph 
biden of delaware alan cranston of california alan dixon of 
illinois joe lieberman of connecticut jay rockefeller of west 
virginia and jim sasser of tennessee only one republican larry 
pressler of south dakota supported graham sens bill bradley 
dnj and albert gore dtenn did not vote

shearson lehman hutton inc said wednesday it 
lost 15 million in the first quarter attributing the 90 million 
decline from last year to sluggish wall street business activity 
and higher interest rates 
shearson is the fifth investment firm to report a loss or lower 
earnings in the last week in addition drexel burnham lambert inc 
said wednesday it is selling its retail brokerage unit in part 
because of a business decline 
shearson said the loss for the quarter compared with a 75 
million profit or 75 cents a share in the same 1988 period 
the firm said the decline reflects a 352 million pretax 
writedown of mcorp securities held by the firm lower investment 
banking revenue and lower net interest income 
the decline came despite an increase in revenue to 3 billion 
from 25 billion a year ago 
the disappointing results for the quarter reflect the 
continuing low level of investor participation in the financial 
markets and the impact of higher interest rates shearson 
chairman peter a coehn said in a statement 
shearson said it is continuing cost control efforts 
including an agreement to sell a shareholder services group and 
negotiations to sell an asset management subsidiary 
shearson said investment banking revenue for the quarter totaled 
243 million a 319 perent drop from 357 million a year ago the 
firm said the decline reflects the industrywide slowdown in 
underwriting merger and acquisition activity 
commission revenues increased 95 percent to 436 million from 
398 million a year ago revenues from marketmaking and principal 
transactions fell 96 percent to 319 million from 353 million in 
the 1988 quarter 
the firm also showed a 712 percent drop in net interest income 
to 19 million from 66 million a year ago blaming a rise in 
shortterm rates that have often outpaced longterm ones

the market opened lower today after a surge in bond prices on 
tuesday following two economic reports that provided further 
evidence that the economy is slowing the reports on consumer 
prices and housing starts suggested that the federal reserves 
policy of pushing interest rates higher has moderated economic 
growth and helped ease inflationary pressures

in march or about what the market expected while housing starts 
fell 54 percent last month 
analysts said the market pulled back slightly this morning 
partly on profittaking and amid surging crude oil prices stemming

texas eastern corp a natural gas and petroleum 
products pipeline company that has been pursued by two companies 
said today earnings for the first quarter of 1989 improved by 97 
percent partly because of an 116 million settlement in a pipeline 
project 
for the first three months of this year the houstonbased 
company posted earnings of 575 million or 102 per share on 
operating revenue of 1 billion compared to 292 million or 55 
cents per share on revenue of 898 million for the same period in 
1988 
included in the profits were 116 million in nonrecurring 
gains primarily due to settlement of antitrust litigation 
associated with the etsi coal slurry pipeline project in which 
texas eastern was a partner 
excluding 292 milion in nonrecurring net charges relating to 
events which led to the pending merger of texas eastern and 
houstonbased panhandle eastern corp the company had net earnings 
of 867 million for the three month period ending march 31 
we are pleased with the companys first period performance it 
reflects the results of the extensive restructuring program 
undertaken during the past two years the company has posted four 
consecutive quartertoquarter improvements in net earnings said 
dennis r hendrix president of texas eastern 
the asset disposition program and efficiencies achieved 
through decentralization and staff reductions have returned the 
companys earnings to levels attained during the early 1980s when 
the company benefitted from much higher crude oil prices he said 
the battle for texas eastern between panhandle eastern and 
houstonbased coastal corp began jan 16 when coastal announced 
its surprise 26 billion takeover bid but the texas eastern board 
rejected the offer as too low signing the merger agreement with 
panhandle eastern on feb 21 
panhandle easterns 32 billion offer includes provisions to 
buy up to 80 percent of texas easterns 608 million outstanding 
shares and a stock exchange at the same 53ashare value for the 
remaining shares 
the combination of the two companies would create a 27000mile 
system and result in one of the nations largest pipeline companies 
in terms of miles 
earlier this week coastal extended its tender offer until march 
31 while panhandle eastern extended their offer to april 26

a chicago mercantile exchange panel today 
recommended restrictions on most forms of dual trading the 
doubling of its surveillance staff and improved auditing in 
response to a federal fraud investigation 
some of these proposals were under study prior to the fbi 
investigation but the failure to respond quickly would have shown 
a lack of leadership said john geldermann chairman of the 
mercs special committee to review trading practices 
geldermann also is chairman of the mercs board of governors to 
whom the recommendations are submitted for a decision expected 
within 60 days 
dual trading enables a trader on the exchange to deal for his 
own account as well as customers accounts while the practice is 
legal many consider it a problem because it allows traders to 
allocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dump losing 
trades on customers 
proponents argue that dual trading increases liquidity because 
traders can continue doing business when they dont have outside 
orders 
but the merc committee recognizing the public perception that 
the practice trading invites abuse recommended dual trading be 
banned from futures contracts in cases where market volume is great 
enough to ensure liquidity 
the panel also recommended the mercs fulltime floor 
surveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members and 
said the exchanges disciplinary committees should include a person 
who is not a merc member 
its hardly cynical to say that theyre hoping to act in 
advance of the government daniel siegel a professor at 
northwestern universitys kellogg graduate school of business said 
in an interview a day before the recommendations were formally 
released 
frankly i suspect the leadership at the merc is upset by some 
of the revelations coming out of the probe remember also that the 
futures industry has prospered with selfregulation and they would 
like to keep control siegel added 
the ninemember committee was appointed in late january 
following disclosure the federal government was investigating 
allegations that as many as 100 brokers at the merc and the chicago 
board of trade systematically cheated investors out of millions of 
dollars through illegal trading practices 
although as many as 200 subpeonas reportedly have been issued to 
traders and firms at the worlds two largest futures exchanges no 
indictments have been issued thus far 
among the members of the merc committee are leo melamed 
chairman of the executive committee of the merc and special counsel 
to the exchanges board of governors and susan phillips who 
formerly headed the commodity futures trading commission the 
federal agency that regulates the industry 
shortly after it was assembled the committee asked robert 
wilmouth president of the national futures association to assist 
in its review of trading practices the nfa is the industrys chief 
watchdog organization 
the exchanges have successfully fought off repeated attempts for 
increased regulation in the past most recently after the 1987 
stock market crash at the time some critics blamed the futures 
exchanges for market volatility that may have worsened the crash 
but the exchanges in a successful effort to forestall more 
government intervention argued that futures selling actually 
provided an outlet that prevented the crash from getting worse

the dollar

reserve would be more likely than the central banks in west germany 
and japan to encourage higher interest rates in response to 
inflationary pressures 
however one dealer in frankfurt said he didnt expect to see 
the dollar much stronger because recent government reports have 
indicated weakness in the us economy a development that would 
discourage credittightening by the fed

bristolmyers co maker of many widely known brands including 
bufferin and excedrin pain relievers and clairol hair care 
products wednesday reported its firstquarter profit rose 126 
percent to a record level 
two other companies in the pharmaceutical business squibb 
corp and scheringplough corp also posted healthy earnings for 
the quarter 
bristolmyers said aftertax earnings amounted to 237 million 
or 82 cents a share in the three months ended march 31 up from 
2106 million or 73 cents a share in 1988s first quarter 
sales for the quarter were the highest in the companys history 
rising just over 5 percent to 160 billion from 152 billion 
international sales gained 11 percent while domestic sales were up 
3 percent 
bristolmyers based in new york has operations in 
nonprescription and prescription drugs toiletries and household 
products such as windex and drano it did not provide any specific 
information about the financial performance of its individual 
operations 
industry analysts have said bristolmyers has been a leader in 
manufacturing anticancer drugs and has benefited from the 
popularity of its antianxiety agent buspar 
squibb said its firstquarter earnings rose 172 percent to 
1065 million or 109 a share from 909 million or 89 cents a 
share a year earlier sales increased 11 percent to 6627 million 
from 5969 million 
the princeton njbased companys chairman and chief executive 
officer richard m furland said the balance sheet improvements 
reflected excellent performances by squibbs leading products 
better gross margins and a slight leverage on operating expenses

rise in research and development costs and flat sales growth in 
traditional products

first quarter to 1257 million or 112 a share from 1015 
million or 91 cents a share the year before

sun protection products and dr scholls foot care line rose more 
modestly 
among the products pacing the increase in pharmaceutical sales 
were items to treat asthma cardiovascular problems and

corn and soybean futures prices closed with steep 
losses wednesday on the chicago board of trade following midday 
forecasts for an increased chance of rain in the western corn belt 
later this week 
but wheat futures advanced on persistent talk of hot dry 
weather in kansas and on news that egypt is seeking to buy 300000 
metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
welcome to the weather market said ted mao a grain 
specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york referring 
to the recent volatility in the grain markets 
some private meteorologists who had been predicting dry weather 
for the rest of this week in iowa and northwestern illinois 
forecast rain in their noon forecasts on wednesday prompting heavy 
selling of corn and soybean contracts 
the markets are unusually sensitive to weather forecasts because 
last years drought lowered us grain stockpiles another drought 
year could drain stocks down to critical levels 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 411 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 4 cents lower with may at 273 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 
3 cents lower with may at 197 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents 
to 11 cents lower with may at 745 a bushel

michael dell 24yearold collegedropout 
whiz kid multimillionaire who made his fortune cloning computers 
has a problem he says wall street doesnt understand his 
5yearold company 
financial analysts arent sure michael dell understands business 
dell computer corp wowed wall street by taking a company from 
startup to 2578 million in annual sales and 144 million in 
profit by selling copies of the popular international business 
machines personal computers 
dell carted three computers off to the university of texas in 
1984 promptly sold them at a profit and began making clones in his 
condominium near the campus soon he was earning up to 80000 a 
month and figured computers not classrooms were where he should 
direct his attention 
not bad for a premed major who began tinkering with computers 
in high school and used to hang out at the local radio shack store 
in houston begging his orthodontist father for a pc 
success in the muddled ibm clone market brought dell much 
favorable publicity in financial and trade publications he was 
labeled an innovation upstart computer industrys latest 
whiz kid and entrepreneur in short pants 
but dells gimmick was marketing not technology he bypassed 
retailers going directly to consumers through advertisements in 
user magazines and selling his wares over the phone from austin 
then last year dell ran into a 104 million inventory buildup 
and the bitter departure of a senior vice president 
the buildup knocked revenue and sales predictions askew even 
goldman sachs amp co one of the investment firms that helped with 
last years initial public offering now is telling customers to 
buy another computer stock instead 
after an initial price of 850 per share the stock climbed to 
13 but fell to 6 after the problems became apparent it 
currently is hanging around 7 
the problems shifted the headlines in dells own words from 
whiz kid to fizz kid one publication called him the enfant 
terrible of personal computers 
we think the perception of the company is quite different than 
whats going on here dell said describing his company as a 
new unique and different kind of entitywe have merged a design 
and manufacturing operation for computers together into an entity 
but even dell admits there were problems although he attributes 
them to successcaused malfunctions that have been fixed 
i think the stock market is going to wait until it sees 
tangible proof that dell is turning around said daniel c 
benton who follows dell for goldman sachs 
the balance sheet has eroded margins have eroded benton 
said dell has phenomenal longterm prospects he said but the 
market focuses on immediate gratification 
to explain his problems dell draws diagrams on a note pad to 
demonstrate how a backlog of orders in the second quarter of the 
year inflated third quarter sales which in turn caused forecasters 
to expect unrealistic fourth quarter production 
at the same time dell was anticipating huge fourth quarter 
sales based on a barrage of favorable reviews in computer 
magazines the sales didnt reach expectations saddling the 
company with a large and in some cases highpriced inventory 
i think hes right that the backlog issue created too high 
expectations benton admitted but added if overlooking that 
made us have high expectations he did it too 
much like a chastised teenager promising he has changed dell 
says his company has learned from the past with a new structure 
and some new managers 
the best thing i could do for the company is to find the best 
people and give them the responsibility to do the job he said 
during an interview in his penthouse office in austins exclusive 
arboretum business park 
dell describes his workers who average about 27 years old as 
1200 totally fired up foaming at the mouth employees 
he often points to glenn henry vice president of research and 
development henry 47 came from ibms nearby laboratory in 
austin where he helped the giant develop its unix program for pcs 
henry is trying to turn the company to more technological 
innovation and dell holds two of its own patents with more pending 
henry replaced graham beachum hired on at dell from tandy corp 
beachum left last year following a bitter dispute with dell over 
most areas of the business 
dell said the blowup hurt the entire company hurt me hurt 
graham hurt the employees here but beachum had to go because 
clearly we had a guy here who was not the right guy 
for his part beachum told business week magazine that dell was 
unwilling to spend money building a sales force and that dells 
plan for a personal system2 clone was egodriven 
henry since has scrapped those plans and dell says he learned 
he shouldnt announce products before theyre ready to be shipped 
in the reorganization dell established separate subsidiaries 
for domestic and overseas clients within dell usa are divisions 
for small customers principally individuals and small businesses 
larger businesses potential customers in government and education 
and resellers 
in the meantime dell enjoys his riches he owns 107 million 
shares of the company even after selling 300000 shares at about 
11 per share or 33 million 
though dell says his job is not what i would consider work 
he does not consider himself the stereotypical yuppie obsessed with 
the quest for riches and is planning to marry in a few months 
i work a fairly normal set of hours for a busy person like 
myself he says i take a good number of vacations to make sure 
that im wellprepared to do my job

to that of the previous quarter and the third quarter of fiscal 
1988 wangs sales totalled 7679 million a year ago and 7607 
million in 1989s second quarter

product sales lower maintentance revenue in the united states and 
a shift to lowermargin sales of personal computers the firms 
main business is minicomputers

american takeover specialist t boone pickens said 
wednesday that corporate buyouts helped invigorate the us economy 
in the 1980s and similar tactics will find their way into japanese 
business in the 1990s 
pickens visited japan for talks with management of koito 
manufacturing co after buying 202 percent of its shares a move 
he said was not a prelude to a takeover attempt or greenmail 
we want to work with koito managment we arent doing anything 
hostile he said adding that he was investing for the long 
term 
meanwhile koito which expressed surprise and concern at the 
time of pickens purchase announced wednesday evening that it was 
transferring the shares to pickens ownership dropping a request 
to the ministry of finance to investigate whether there were any 
technical irregularities that might block the purchase 
pickens is scheduled to meet thursday with the president of the 
company said a company spokesman 
at a luncheon wednesday with the american chamber of commerce in 
japan pickens argued that corporate buyouts helped put the us 
economy back on its feet in the 1980s by ousting ineffective 
management and making its companies more competitive 
what happened in the us in the 1980s will find its way to 
the japanese business community in the 1990s he said 
analysts in tokyo say pickens visit is a challenge to basic 
thinking in japans business community that a company belongs to 
its employees not its shareholders 
pickens gained fame and fortune in the united states by buying 
and reorganizing companies and often purging company executives 
arguing that bad managers dont give shareholders the returns they 
deserve 
he said in tokyo wednesday that his shareholders rights 
movement would soon spread to japan 
shareholders rights will become a worldwide issue he added 
but many japanese businessmen and some foreign critics believe 
that the american emphasis on return to shareholders has caused 
us companies to lose competitiveness to japanese companies 
japanese companies dont generally have to answer to 
shareholders with shortterm profits they can focus on longerterm 
growth just look at these two economies to see which approach has 
been more successful said keith donaldson an analyst at james 
capel pacific ltd 
koito makes headlights and other parts for toyota motor co 
which owns 191 percent of the company pickens shares are worth 
about 1 billion at current market prices 
despite pickens denial many people think it is greenmail 
shigeju kita general manager in charge of mergers and acquisitions 
at yamaichi securities said of pickens stock purchase 
greenmail is a premium paid by a company to buy back stock from 
an unwanted suitor 
pickens says he is challenging barriers to foreign investment in 
japan and many americans are cheering him on 
i am concerned that american investors dont have the same 
access in japan as japanese have in the us pickens told 
reporters 
pickens said he could not judge how open or closed the japanese 
market was until he saw the results of his present enterprise 
but he added that people in washington are watching this 
carefully japanbashers will come to the surface pretty 
quick if they think that an american company is being unfairly 
treated in japan he said 
pickens told the american chamber audience he was considering 
running for governor of texas 
later he told reporters that the koito deal was not done with 
political motives in mind but ive had people suggest it might be 
an advantage in a political race

stock prices pushed ahead today getting a 
little more mileage out of the rally that has carried the market to 
its highest levels since the crash of 1987 
analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from 
spreading hopes that inflationary pressures might be easing and 
interest rates were turning downward 
inflation figures for march unlike those for the two previous 
months contained no unpleasant surprises that seemed likely to 
prompt the federal reserve to tighten credit further 
signs of a slowing economy also raise some new worries for 
investors for one thing some observers suggest they could lead 
to heightened concern about the possibility of a recession 
however brokers said any such fears were countered today by 
strong earnings reports from several prominent companies

general dynamics corp said wednesday that 
it had a 12 percent decrease in firstquarter net earnings due in 
part to declining earnings in its military aircraft operation 
net earnings for the first quarter of 1989 were 754 million 
or 181 a share on revenue of 236 billion compared with net 
earnings of 857 million or 204 a share on revenue of 242 
billion during the same period last year 
the decline in operating earnings in the military aircraft 
segment resulted from lower volume and a reduction of the earnings 
rate in the f16 program said stanley c pace chairman and chief 
executive those trends reflected lower margins on recent contract 
awards as well as cost increases resulting from simultaneous 
production of more than 20 versions of the aircraft he said 
pace said that improved manufacturing techniques and cost 
containments continued to raise the peformance level of the 
companys land systems business he also cited increasing demand 
for business jets as contributing to a favorable performance in the 
general aviation business 
among the contracts the st louisbased company won during the 
first quarter was for the lead ship construction for the seawolf 
class of attack submarines and for the upgrading of the m1a1 abrams 
tank 
the company also signed an agreement with st louisbased 
mcdonnell douglas valued at about 2 billion over the next six 
years for production of fuselages for the md11 aircraft

northrop corps profit plunged in 
the first quarter but the decline was attributed to a huge 
onetime tax benefit in the comparable quarter a year earlier 
northrop which has been rocked by a series of allegations of 
overbilling and a defense fraud indictment said wednesday its 
firstquarter profit fell to 97 million or 21 cents a share 
from 1396 million or 297 a share in the first quarter of 1988 
the difference was the result of a onetime gain of 1351 
million in the earlier quarter when the company took advantage of 
a law that allowed it to defer payment of taxes in earlier years 
until the new lower corporate tax rate took effect 
without the tax benefit earnings in 1988s first quarter would 
have been 45 million or less than half of this years 
firstquarter income 
northrops sales in the first quarter were 128 billion down 7 
percent from 137 billion a year earlier 
the company also took a charge against profits of 26 million 
for unplanned research and development expenses on an electronic 
defense system for the f15 fighter jet 
northrop made a similar provision in the fourth quarter of last 
year for development of the system called the alq135 but didnt 
reveal the amount of the writeoff for that quarter 
overall sales declined for several reasons less pentagon money 
for research and development of the b2 stealth bomber which is 
moving into production fewer mx missile sales and fewer 
deliveries of fuselages for the fa18 hornet fighter which is 
built by mcdonnell douglas corp for the navy 
the sales declines were partly offset by an increase in 
deliveries of 747 airliner fuselages to boeing corp 
northrop has been the target of several lawsuits by employee 
whistleblowers who allege the company overcharged the 
government on various projects 
the corporation and five present and former employees were 
charged this month with conspiracy and fraud in an alleged scheme 
to fake tests on a device used to guide cruise missiles 
northrop denies any wrongdoing

nippon telegraph and telephone corp became the 
biggest and most profitable japanese business after the government 
tranformed it from a public monopoly into a private company four 
years ago 
but now ntt faces restructuring and possible dismemberment 
partly because of links to one of the worst political scandals in 
japans postwar history 
critics and former officials blame ntts problems on confusion 
about whether it really has become private the government still 
owns threequarters of ntts stock and its employees are subject 
to the same restrictions as public servants 
the most serious mistake was the government tried to satisfy 
everyone including politicians government agencies and ntts 
labor union said yoichi sando an analyst at asahi research 
center a private thinktank 
that left ntt in an ambiguous status of halfpublic and 
halfprivate in the past four years he said ntt was 
consistently under pressure to fulfil these two contradictory 
roles 
ntt appeared to be successfully transforming itself into a 
competitive company after the government privatized it in april 
1985 following trends in the united states and britain to promote 
competition in telecommunications 
it has has undergone major changes since then reducing its work 
force by more than 10 percent and launching many new services 
we would never be able to make those drastic changes if we 
remained governmentowned haruo yamaguchi president and chief 
executive of ntt told the associated press in an interview the 
privatization was certainly a major turning point in our companys 
43year history 
the privatized ntt became the most profitable company in japan 
with record earnings of 4967 billion yen or about 38 billion in 
1987 it was also the most popular company among new university 
graduates seeking jobs in 1987 and 1988 because of what they saw as 
its stability and progressive image 
but big trouble surfaced when ntts link to a major bribery 
scandal surfaced last year it has led to the arrests of former 
chairman hisashi shinto and three other senior executives since 
february 
prosecutors are also investigating the companys lobbying 
practices with politicians and there is some expectation that ntt 
will somehow be restructured or broken up 
the price of the utilitys stock once the most popular issue on 
the tokyo stock exchange has been stuck around 15millionyen a 
share or 11360 less than half its peak of 318 million yen a 
share in april 1987 
critics say ntt has been victimized by conflicting interests of 
politicians and bureaucrats 
hajime nakayama a former official of the ministry of posts and 
telecommunications which supervises ntt said the ministry was 
under strong pressure to deregulate the communication market 
but when the ministry suggested breaking up ntt into regional 
competitors and reducing parliamentary oversight he said we met 
with opposition from politicians and government officials who have 
a large stake in ntt 
the company was left in the awkward position of having to 
compete with other companies while being required to aid the same 
rivals in the name of fair competition 
ntt president yamaguchi said the unclear status sometimes 
hindered his ability to run the company effectively 
i am aware we really have no other choice but to let the 
govenment decide what they will do with us he said but 
frankly i wish they would leave us alone and let us run the 
company on our own or dont privatize it at all 
critics say the firms alleged involvement in the bribery affair 
symbolizes its dilemma shinto and other executives were charged 
with receiving bribes from an informationbased conglomerate called 
recruit which leased equipment from ntt and bought two usmade 
supercomputers from it 
but legal experts say the alleged bribes would have been an 
ordinary business practice if the deal took place between two 
private companies 
the 1985 law that changed ntts status says its workers remain 
semipublic servants and prohibits them from receiving money 
and valuables 
after the arrests of the senior officials ntt employees 
expressed confusion about their status some were surprised that 
they were still subject to the same laws as politicians and public 
servants though they no longer enjoy the privileges of public 
servants 
the arrest of the chairman reminded many of us that we are not 
all that private as we thought we were said takao nakajima a 
head of the firms advertising section

one of the biggest futures markets proposed 
sweeping changes wednesday that would double surveillance and limit 
a controversial trading practice in response to a federal fraud 
probe that has tainted chicagos financial industry 
many of the recommendations contained in a report by the chicago 
mercantile exchanges special committee to review trading practices 
were under consideration earlier said leo melamed vice chairman 
of the committee 
but the time frame was compressed as a result of the 
investigation melamed told a news confererence where the 
proposals were unveiled 
john geldermann chairman of the special committee said the 
public perception of the exchange has suffered in the three months 
since disclosure of the undercover fbi probe he said it was 
important to release the recommendations to maintain investor 
confidence 
the failure to respond quickly would have shown a lack of 
leadership said geldermann who also is chairman of the mercs 
board of governors the recommendations will be submitted to that 
board for a decision expected within 60 days 
the most imporant restriction would be limits on dual trading a 
controversial practice enables a trader to trade his own account 
at the same time he handles customers accounts 
while the practice is allowed by many financial exchanges many 
consider it susceptible to abuse because it allows unscrupulous 
traders to allocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dump 
losing trades on customers 
the ninemember committee was appointed in late january 
following disclosures that the federal government was investigating 
allegations involving the merc and the chicago board of trade 
the federal probe concerns allegations that as many as 100 
brokers at the two sprawling exchanges systematically cheated 
investors out of millions of dollars through illegal trading 
practices 
no indictments have been announced yet but as many as 200 
subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the 
exchanges 
some market experts viewed the formation of the special 
committee as part of the futures industrys effort to hold the line 
against further government regulation which it historically has 
rejected as cumbersome and unneeded 
melamed said he made the rounds tuesday in washington and 
carried the committees reports to the commodity futures trading 
commission the federal agency charged with regulating the 
industry as well as key house and senate members with agriculture 
or industry oversight responsibilities 
it was received extremely favorably by everyone no one 
mentioned anything beyond what we were saying he added 
proponents argue that dual trading increases the amount of 
buyers and sellers because traders can continue doing business when 
they dont have outside orders 
but the merc committee with few exceptions recommended dual 
trading be banned from futures contracts in cases where market 
volume already is substantial 
the panel also recommended the mercs fulltime floor 
surveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members and 
adopt specific guidelines with penalties ranging from a 30day 
trading suspension to expulsion for rule violations involving 
financial injury to public customers 
among other recommendations 
more extensive screening of membership applicants 
members of a broker association should not be allowed to 
execute personal trades against orders by members of the broker 
group 
addition of one nonmerc member to all major disciplinary 
committees the criticism is that were too clubby said 
melamed this would enable the public to view the process and see 
we are openhanded 
daily computerized trade information for members covering all 
activity from the previous day 
asked whether he expected the recommendations to stave off 
further government intervention into industry business melamed 
replied selfregulation requires that you deserve 
selfregulation and in order to deserve it you must prove that 
youre responsible

prices for corn and soybeans to be harvested this fall fell 
sharply wednesday on the chicago board of trade on forecasts for 
rain later this week in the western corn belt a key growing area 
hit hard by last summers drought 
wheat futures prices rose due to persistent dryness in kansas 
where the winter wheat crop already has sustained severe damage 
on other markets oil futures posted steep gains livestock and 
meat futures prices tumbled and precious metals were slightly lower 
wheat settled unchanged to 4 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 411 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents 
lower with may at 273 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents 
lower with may at 197 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 11 
cents lower with may at 745 a bushel 
welcome to the weather market said ted mao a new 
yorkbased grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc 
referring to the recent volatility in the grain markets 
corn and soybean planting has barely begun but the grain markets 
are extremely sensitive to weather changes because last years 
drought lowered us grain stockpiles another drought year could 
drain stocks down to critical levels and cause prices to skyrocket 
some private meteorologists who had been predicting dry weather 
for the rest of this week in iowa and northwestern illinois put 
more rain into their noon forecasts on wednesday prompting heavy 
selling of corn and soybean contracts 
after the close the national weather service issued a new 
sixto10 day forecast calling for abovenormal rainfall in the 
western midwest and normal precipitation in the regions central 
and eastern portions which could prompt further selling of corn 
and soybean futures on thursday 
the irony is that most experts agree that beyond 72 hours the 
degree of accuracy in a forecast drops geometrically mao said 
and yet everybody pays attention to those forecasts because there 
isnt anything else to trade on 
unleaded gasoline prices surged on the new york mercantile 
exchange leading the crude oil and heating oil markets higher 
following tuesdays american petroleum institute report of 
substantial reductions in us supplies of crude and gasoline 
further buying was spurred by reports that the shell oil cos 
british subsidiary had advise clients of possible shipment delays 
for north sea crude oil following the shutdown late tuesday of a 
damaged oil platform 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 110 
higher with may at 2261 a barrel heating oil was 53 cent to 71 
cent higher with may at 5333 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
75 cent to 120 cents higher with may at 7462 cents a gallon 
the sharp losses in livestock and meat futures on the chicago 
mercantile exchange were due more to profittaking and technical 
factors than to wednesdays weaker cash markets analysts said 
trading activity has grown cautious ahead of fridays quarterly 
agriculture department cattleonfeed report which is expected to 
show firstquarter placements of cattle on feedlots to be 3 percent 
to 10 percent above the first quarter of 1988 
live cattle settled 10 cent to 102 cents lower with june at 
7050 cents a pound feeder cattle were 57 cent to 97 cent lower 
with may at 7555 cents a pound live hogs were 25 cent to 80 
cent lower with june at 4590 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 105 cents to 188 cents lower with may at 3157 cents a pound 
gold and silver futures prices inched lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange investment demand for the metals has fallen 
following government economic reports that indicate the economy is 
slowing and inflation is holding steady 
gold settled 10 cents to 60 cents lower with june at 38710 a 
troy ounce silver was 13 cents to 15 cents lower with may at

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo remained 
locked on a collision course with the federal judge overseeing 
eastern airlines bankruptcy case by insisting wednesday that the 
strikewracked carrier will be shrunk not sold 
there are a lot of people out there who want to buy eastern 
airlines for some beads jelly beans or whatever comes to mind 
lorenzo told a small group of reporters at texas airs new york 
office 
eastern has to be built back the oldfashioned way we 
dont think that any sale transaction makes sense 
that position puts lorenzo at loggerheads with us bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland who appears poised to put the entire 
airline up for sale including assets held by miamibased eastern 
before texas air acquired it three years ago for about 676 million 
lifland who generally refrains from speaking to reporters on 
pending cases was unavailable for comment 
furthermore the 15member committee representing easterns 
major creditors could be skeptical of lorenzos plan to reduce 
eastern to 60 percent of its prestrike size sources said the 
committee is scheduled to meet thursday but eastern attorney david 
boies said the plan wont be presented to creditors until next week 
lorenzos insistence on holding and shrinking eastern could be 
aimed at luring back the airlines rebellious pilots whose support 
for the machinists strike has been critical to its success a 
union official said 
his position is to threaten the pilots with this is the only 
airline were going to have youd better jump on the bandwagon 
said dan ashby a spokesman in new york for the air line pilots 
association the pilots are definitely holding this is a 
desperation ploy 
bruce simon an attorney for the pilots union likening the 
lorenzolifland showdown to a shootout at the ok corral said 
the notion that you can shrink your way to profitability is sheer 
lunacy 
there had been speculation that texas airs refusal to sell 
eastern expressed by its board of directors on monday was a 
negotiating ploy designed to elicit a higher price for the airline 
which has been mired in a strike and bankruptcy court proceedings 
for more than a month 
last week after the collapse of lorenzos 464 million deal to 
sell eastern to exbaseball commissioner peter v ueberroth 
eastern officials said the airline would be sharply reduced 
lorenzo who wore a yellow shirt and bright blue tie but no 
jacket during the informal meeting with reporters looked less 
weary than he had at the federal courthouse last week but still 
showed the toll of the protracted strike and bankruptcy case 
he insisted that eastern will be able to rebuild to a smaller 
level without the fractious pilots returning to work the airline 
will need an estimated 1500 pilots to run 60 percent of its 
previous operations of the 3600 or so eastern pilots only 200 
have crossed picket lines 
we can train pilots at a very substantial rate lorenzo 
said he disputed the pilots unions claim of a nationwide pilot 
shortage 
asked whether a sharply reduced eastern would be viable lorenzo 
said we believe it would be but there are no guarantees in 
this world 
the texas air chief also refuted earlier statements by attorneys 
for eastern and the pilots union that another potential buyer had 
emerged besides ueberroth hotelier jay pritzker and takeover 
strategist carl icahn 
there is no serious fourth bidder lorenzo said he insisted 
there are no talks currently between his company and potential 
suitors 
lorenzo said ueberroth had called him tuesday and made it very 
plain that hes out of the deal 
sources close to ueberroth however said wednesday the two men 
have continued negotiating by telephone 
simon the pilots attorney insisted wednesday that the fourth 
bidding group has met with david i shapiro the bankruptcy 
examiner for eastern 
they are putting together their bid simon said 
a source close to the situation who asked not to be identified 
called the fourth bidder a serious and substantial presence 
workers struck the nations seventhlargest carrier march 4 in a 
longstanding dispute with lorenzo accusing him of dismembering 
eastern and feeding its assets to sister texas air subsidiary 
continental airlines lorenzo put the company into federal 
bankruptcy court protection march 9

american telephone amp telegraph co announced a 
206 percent increase in firstquarter profit wednesday thrust 
ahead by an expensive restructuring last year that produced its 
first annual loss 
the phone giant achieved the improved results despite intense 
competition across its range of businesses robert e allen 
chairman and chief executive told shareholders at the companys 
104th annual meeting 
were seeing new vigor in our longdistance business and 
strong growth in international sales of products and services 
allen said 
the stock rose 37 cents a share to 3350 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading 
shareholders rejected a pair of shareholder proposals on 
affirmative action one to strengthen it and one to stop it also 
rejected were proposals to get more information on atampts lobbying 
and on its involvement in star wars defense contracts 
atampt said it earned 594 million or 55 cents a share in the 
first three months of 1989 up from 492 million or 46 cents a 
share a year earlier revenue rose 32 percent to 866 billion 
from 839 billion a year earlier 
earnings would have risen even more if the company had not 
adopted a more aggressive method of depreciating the value of its 
assets the change cut 88 million from firstquarter profits 
atampt lost 167 billion last year the result of a huge 
accounting charge that covered the cost of accelerating its 
transition to modern digital technology 
as part of the restructuring the company said last year it was 
scrapping outdated analog phone equipment and moving retiring or 
laying off 16000 employees 
although the charge produced a loss last year it is adding to 
profitability this year by lowering the companys payroll and 
depreciation expenses 
allen declined to predict profits for the rest of the year but 
said he would not be surprised if they kept up the same pace 
this is not an aberration at least based on our business plan 
atampt is no longer the worlds largest company since the 1984 
bell system breakup but it remains the most widely held stock in 
the country with 26 million shareowners 
allen told 2360 shareholders in radio city music hall that the 
company was getting closer to being able to raise its quarterly 
dividend which has been stuck at 30 cents a share since 
divestiture 
richard toole a merrill lynch amp co analyst predicted the 
dividend might be raised early next year 
allen was elected chairman the night before the 1988 annual 
meeting in denver following the death a day earlier of chairman 
james e olson olsons unexpected death cast a pall over that 
gathering 
aside from the emotional aspect i feel much more 
comfortable after a year on the job allen told a news 
conference i have a good sense of the business the people 
whats important where were going 
in longdistance allen said aggressive advertising and sales 
promotions an expanded sales force and increased regulatory 
flexibility were paying off 
product sales grew 45 percent mainly because of higher 
international sales of telecommunications network equipment and 
increases in microelectronic components sales to the federal 
government and some computer products also sales of the newly 
acquired paradyne corp were included in the results for the first 
time 
shareholders rejected a proposal by the national alliance a 
whitesupremacist organization to phase out aspects of atampts 
affirmative action program which are directed toward recruiting 
employing or promoting individuals from any particular racial or 
ethnic group 
however 81 percent of the shares were voted in favor 
entitling the group to resubmit it next year a proposal by an atampt 
employee alex tillman to strengthen and provide details on the 
affirmative action received support from 47 percent of the shares 
falling below the 6 percent cutoff for resubmission 
allen said atampt management opposed both proposals but reserved 
his main criticism for the national alliance one which he 
described as an insult to atampt employees

the head of the securities and exchange 
commission suggested wednesday the agency still might pursue action 
against the head of drexel burnham lambert inc and other top 
executives of the investment firm 
sec chairman david ruder testifying before a house 
subcommittee said he expects the agencys enforcement division to 
pursue the activities of all the drexel officials who were in 
responsiblity during the time when massive securities violations 
allegedly were committed 
it is not unlikely that our investigation will reveal other 
persons against whom action might be brought ruder told the 
energy and commerce subcommittee on finance and telecommunications 
drexel last week agreed to a settlement of sec civil charges 
under which the firm will be subject to close federal monitoring 
for three years and will restructure its operations and sever ties 
with its junk bond chief michael milken who was indicted on 
racketeering charges last month 
the company also has agreed to plead guilty to six felony 
charges and pay 650 million in fines and penalties in what has 
become the biggest securities fraud probe in history 
asked by the subcommittee chairman rep edward j markey 
dmass why frederick h joseph was allowed to remain as drexels 
president and chief operating officer under the sec settlement 
ruder stressed that the agreement requires drexel to cooperate in a 
continuing sec investigation of activities at the investment house 
he said that under standard sec procedure a logical followup 
to the settlement would be for the agencys enforcement division 
to pursue questions of actions by the individuals at drexel 
your statement that we have decided not to take action is 
simply not true ruder said 
markey also questioned whether the environment at drexel could 
change for the better if the firms chief operating officer stays 
on 
that is a question with which we have had some concern 
ruder acknowledged we have been looking for signs at drexel at 
the top level that there will be a change in culture and we 
continue to look for signs that there is a change in culture 
he added that the primary and most significant change is 
likely to come with the installment of former sec chairman john 
shad as chairman of drexels board 
ruder said the need for change at drexel was primarily in its 
highyield junk bond department in california which milken had 
commanded 
we believe that steps to rework that department will be 
effective to accomplish that cultural change ruder said

although eastern airlines has been on strike for 
nearly seven weeks some of its flight attendants still seem to be 
serving 
during the recent marathon negotiations in washington and new 
york between eastern union officials and exbaseball commissioner 
peter v ueberroths team flight attendant representatives seemed 
to always get stuck ordering food coffee and sodas for the group 
some participants in the talks said 
as soon as somebody says lunch a flight attendant grabs a 
pad and starts writing taking orders said one negotiator who 
asked not to be identified 
some union activists say the situation is typical of the 
treatment accorded the flight attendants who historically have 
complained of discrimination they are considered the easiest 
employees to replace in an airline strike and therefore the least 
powerful 
the airlines flight attendants had reason to cheer wednesday 
however when they were told that they would be represented on the 
eastern creditors committee their union the transport workers 
union had been excluded from the creditors panel at the start of 
easterns bankruptcy proceeding while their fellow pilots and 
machinists were represented 
mary jane barry president of the transport workers local at 
eastern will be the designated representative and will attend her 
first committee meeting on thursday union sources said 
the creditors committee also includes a representative of 
nonunion employees at eastern mary grace shore her presence 
irritated union officials who allege that her group positive 
employee action committee at eastern or peace is sponsored by 
the airlines management

a longrumored acquisition battle spilled over 
wednesday as japonica partners disclosed intentions to acquire cnw 
corp in a letter that asked shareholders to replace the management 
of the railroad holding company with a slate of its own 
i guess you could call this hostile cnw spokesman james 
foote said throughout this whole campaign they have not made an 
offer to us nor have they indicated they have financing for such a 
deal 
now they apparently want to become directors so that if they 
do make an offer they would be making it to themselves 
countered japonica spokesman frederic spar they had better 
understand that when a group of quality people make a statement as 
blunt as this it should be taken seriously 
in a letter to shareholders new yorkbased japonica said it is 
cnws largest shareholder owning 88 percent of the chicago 
companys approximately 164 million outstanding shares 
japonica said it intends to acquire cnw at a substantial 
premium over the 31pershare offer put together by cnw 
management and the investment group gibbons green van amerongen 
that proposal fell through last may 
the letter criticizes cnw management for refusing to give 
japonica the same consideration it gave its own bid last year 
spar declined to be more specific about whether japonicas plans 
for an acquisition would result from a merger or tender offer or 
some other arrangement or how much more than 31 per share would 
be offered 
as for financing he said japonica was evaluating several 
proposals 
cnw corp stock climbed 37 cents wednesday on the new york 
stock exchange to close at 40 
cnws principal subsidiary is the chicago and north western 
transportation co which operates a ninestate 6000mile freight 
railroad with 8500 employees cnw also has real estate holdings 
and operates chicagoarea commuter rail lines it earned 81 
million on revenues of 9954 million last year 
the japonica letter contends cnws board has approved excessive 
compensation levels and an inappropriate goldenparachute 
package for cnws senior management in case of a takeover 
japonica also said it would consider selling cnws real estate 
excess equipment and the commuter lines 
japonicas proposed slate includes c howard hardesty former 
president and chief executive officer of purolator courier corp 
as its chairmandesignate 
in a letter to shareholders last month cnw chairman robert 
schmiege urged support for the companys slate at the may 16 
stockholders meeting 
analysts attributed a recent runup in the stock to the 
escalating war of words between japonica and cnw management 
in a related development cnw corp announced wednesday that it 
had filed an appeal in the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in 
philadelphia seeking to force japonica partners to disclose its 
plans for cnw and the identity of its investors 
a us district court judge in delaware where cnw is 
incorporated recently denied cnws request for a preliminary 
injunction to force japonica to provide such information 
cnw also announced that its directors approved a dividend of 10 
cents a share payable july 14

rising interest rates have caught up with american homeowners 
and are pinching the pockets of the 12 million households with 
adjustablerate mortgages 
for many of them springtime 89 will mean a second annual hike 
in mortgage payments 20 percent over a year ago on average 
since thats when the bulk of us homes are usually sold and 
mortgages originated 
this season also marks the first real test of interestsensitive 
adjustablerate mortgages or arms as theyre called in an era of 
tightening credit a government report issued earlier this week 
showed a 54 percent drop in housing starts last month evidence 
that rising rates are already having a major impact on the economy 
loan delinquencies could follow 
we havent seen this before said robert van order chief 
economist for the federal home loan mortgage co or freddie mac 
arms became popular in the early 1980s at the national level 
after rates started to come down this is the first period of 
rising rates 
monthly payments on a typical 100000 arm taken out in april 
1988 are likely to rise at least 150 starting next month since 
most arms are tied to an index of oneyear treasury notes which 
have risen about 25 percentage points from a year ago 
interest rates particularly shortterm have gone up over the 
past two years in reaction to the federal reserves decision to 
keep a tighter rein on credit to prevent the economy from 
overheating and keep inflation in check 
economists say theyve already seen signs that that strategy is 
working and they predict that interest rates will ease by the end 
of the year the sharp jump in payments of widely used arms will 
also help to temper economic growth because it will limit many 
homeowners discretionary income they said 
people will find theres a lot of things they can do without 
but they will want to hold onto their most worthwhile possession 
their homes said john tuccillo chief economist for the national 
association of realtors 
twenty percent of all the 58 million owneroccupied homes in the 
united states are financed with arms or about 800 billion of the 
22 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt according to industry 
estimates 
so far in 1989 arms have made up an estimated 55 percent of all 
mortgages granted economists though expect that level to decline 
because shortterm rates have risen at a faster clip than 
longerterm rates making arms far less attractive 
the rate on a 30year fixedrate conventional mortage averaged 
1109 percent in april up from 1103 percent in march while the 
initial rate on an arm averaged 940 this month up from 909 
percent the previous month 
the typical arm holder is someone who is relatively young and 
expects to be moving up as well as on within a few years many 
people who take out these kind of loans also expect interest rates 
to be heading south 
the adjustablerate mortgage has kept the housing market 
going at reasonably healthy levels for quite some time said 
richard w peach deputy chief economist of the mortgage bankers 
association of america consumers have always been aware of the 
risks inherent with adjustablerate mortgages 
now the chickens have come home to roost and unfortunately we 
have seen a worst case scenario for a borrower with an arm 
homeowners who were drawn into the market by the artificially 
low teaser rates for the first year have seen the biggest jump 
in payments 
a homeowner who got a 100000 arm with a teaser rate of 65 
percent two years ago would have had initial monthly payments of 
81946 in 1988 the rate likely went up 2 percentage points to 85 
percent lifting the monthly mortgage payments to 98611 or 20 
percent from the first year 
this year the rate is likely to go up another 2 percentage 
points to 105 percent lifting the monthly mortgage payments to 
115278 up about 33333 or 41 percent from the first year 
mortgage payments have gone up a fair amount but i dont 
think were experiencing a crisis in the marketplace said 
stephen ashley president of sibley corp a rochester ny 
mortgage company i think we have seen a situation where the 
homebuying public is now much more aware of the risks associated 
with arms 
he and other lenders say that many consumers have been choosing 
fixedrate mortgages or adjustable loans that convert to a fixed 
rate mortgage during some period of the loan
