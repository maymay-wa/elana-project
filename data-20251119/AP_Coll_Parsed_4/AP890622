cardinal miguel obando y bravo said 
thursday he was unable to set up conciliation talks between 
nicaragua and the united states as requested by president daniel 
ortega 
also thursday foreign minister miguel descoto accused the us 
government of spreading systematic lies to discredit nicaragua 
and its preparations for free elections in 1990 
ortega publicly asked obando y bravo the roman catholic 
archbishop of managua on monday to act as a gobetween in setting 
up the talks with the bush administration resolve its differences 
with nicaraguas leftist sandinista regime 
the cardinal said he would think about it but state department 
spokesman rudi boone on tuesday rejected the offer he said an 
improvement in relations would depend on a number of factors 
including an end to nicaraguan support for leftist guerrillas in 
el salvador 
boone in washington also said nicaragua should hold free and 
fair elections under international supervision and enter into of a 
genuine dialogue with opposition groups before the us agrees to 
sit down and talk 
referring to boones statement obando y bravo wrote ortega 
saying that for the time being it is not possible to enter into a 
process of mediation because one of the parties has officially 
set conditions for the dialogue 
ortega read the obando y bravos letter at a news conference 
expressed thanks to the cardinal and said he will insist through 
other venues with the us government and president bush to accept a 
dialogue with nicaragua 
the united states cut off all aid to nicaragua in 1980 started 
supporting contra rebels the next year and slapped an economic 
embargo on this nation in 1985 to pressure the sandinistas to hold 
free and fair elections and sever military ties with soviet bloc 
nations 
us administrations have argued that soviet and cuban military 
aid to the sandinistas and nicaraguas help to the salvadoran 
guerrillas is threatening security in central america the 
sandinistas claim they have been providing only moral support to the 
salvadoran rebels 
an attempt by the united states and nicaragua to hold talks in 
mexico in 1984 ended in deadlock with the reagan administration 
accusing the sandinistas of failing to negotiate in good faith 
the 14party national opposition union on thursday asked obando y 
bravo to try and set up talks with the sandinista government to try 
and resolve these differences but the cardinal himself a sharp 
critic of the sandinistas did not respond immediately 
earlier thursday foreign minister miguel descoto accused the 
bush administration of spreading systematic lies to discredit 
nicaragua and denied allegations by vice president dan quayle that 
nicaragua is allying itself with cuba and panama to form a three way 
antius alliance 
speaking in caracas venezuela where he was attending a third 
world meeting descoto said i would take anything a us 
government official says with a ton of salt systematic lying is an 
instrument of their foreign policy the only thing he quayle needs 
for his opinions is his mouth 
descoto also denied recent allegations by bush about nicaraguas 
election procedures and said the sandinistas were strictly 
complying with the agenda for the elections in february 1990 
critics have said the government stacked a national election 
board which will supervise the balloting process in favor of the 
sandinistas also as of june 1 us citizens were required for the 
first time to get visas to enter nicaragua making it difficult for 
american observers to be there

federal investigators are looking into the 
apparent diversion of up to 90000 in housing funds intended for 
poor families living in federally subsidized apartments here it was 
reported thursday 
the money was supposed to cover rent and utility bills in 1986 to 
early 1988 for five families who lived in the housing complexes 
known as interregional apartments the austin americanstatesman 
said 
the 99 apartments were shut down by the city in september because 
of building code violations 
it may be a while before we can get to it but it is scheduled 
for investigation said johnny o lee the housing and urban 
development regional inspector general in fort worth 
right now its waiting in line with a lot of other cases 
lee said its a question of time and manpower 
lee refused to say who might have diverted the funds saying its 
their policy not to comment on ongoing investigations 
in another development hud officials in indianapolis said 
thursday that almost a third of the 257012 that federal auditors 
said might be missing from the agencys office here has been found 
payments have been received or documentation found for 8004695 
from the sale of five foreclosed homes during a 4year period said 
j nicholas shelley director of the indianapolis hud office 
in a june 13 report federal auditors identified 16 indiana 
transactions for which the agency hadnt received payment auditors 
said the proceeds plus 30486 in damages should be paid to the 
government 
authorities and indianapolis realty which handled closings on 
the sales are looking for documentation of the remaining 11 
transactions which brought 17696550 officials said 
if the transfer of the money cant be documented shelley said 
the government stands to get its money either from indianapolis 
realty or its bonding company 
last week a private escrow agent from maryland nicknamed robin 
hud told congress she diverted millions of dollars from government 
housing programs 
the agent marilyn harrell admitted to investigators that she 
did not forward at least 55 million to the federal housing agency 
saying she donated much of the money to charitable projects to 
provide housing for the poor 
in austin the principal owner of the interregional apartments is 
san antonio investor benard l lifshutz who said he was aware that 
some subsidies were taken but he was not involved 
another partner in the project listed in city records as chuck 
mcginnis of austin could not be located the newspaper said 
lifshutz said he and mcginnis are no longer business partners and he 
had not spoken to mcginnis in months 
according to a letter from the city to the hud inspector general 
the apparent diversion of federal utility subsidies took place 
between august 1986 and february 1988 
former acting city manager john ware told city council members in 
a memo last year that the exact amount of money taken was hard to 
determine because the owners records for those years are 
virtually nonexistent 
city staff at the department of housing and community services 
which administers the federally subsidized housing program said 
they believe the amount was 80000 to 90000 
the department staff first learned of the problem when 
interregional tenants complained that their electric gas and water 
services were being disconnected 
city records show that dozens of the apartments were overrun with 
rats and cockroaches contained exposed and damaged plumbing and 
wiring had holes in some of the floors and ceilings and could not 
meet minimal city building and safety codes 
police records also show that by 1986 the apartment complexes had 
become a center of criminal activity including prostitution and 
drug dealing 
at one point police records show one tenant at interregional 
offered driveup curb service making drug deals through an 
apartment window

military officials and former comrades of col 
gregory pappy boyington dedicated a lifesize bust thursday at 
the marine corps air station here to honor the late world war ii ace 
boyingtons widow josephine of fresno calif and son gregory 
jr attended the ceremonies at the base the home of vma214 the 
black sheep squadron the nickname for the group originated around 
the idea that members of the squadron formed in the solomon islands 
in 1942 were misfits 
boyington shot down 28 aircraft while fighting in the pacific 
theater and his squadron accounted for a total of 197 japanese 
planes 
shot down jan 3 1944 over tokyo boyington spent the rest of 
the war in a prisonerofwar camp in omori japan he was mistakenly 
presumed dead during the war and awarded the medal of honor the 
nations highest decoration for military valor posthumously 
boyington died jan 11 1988 the bust was the idea of his 
longtime friend raymond hap halloran who said attending 
boyingtons funeral at arlington national cemetery gave him the 
desire to do something special to commemorate his friend 
halloran an army air corps fighter pilot was shot down over the 
pacific in january 1945 and met boyington in a prisonerofwar camp 
to see him in real life was a comforting thing i know probably 
nothing would happen to us because boyington was there halloran

the operator of the rancho seco nuclear power 
plant has decided to accept bids for a private takeover of the 
facility despite a referendum that called for its shutdown 
the 32 vote by directors of the sacramento municipal utility 
district on tuesday angered many of the activists who have fought 
for years to shut down the plant which has nearly a continuous 
history of operating problems 
on march 2 the directors had voted unanimously to abide by the 
results of the june 6 referendum in which voters turned down an 
advisory measure endorsing the sacramento municipal utility 
districts plans to keep the plant running 
the plant was taken off line june 7 and so far about 400 contract 
workers have lost their jobs 
utility directors voting with the majority argued that voters 
merely had forbidden smud from operating the plant 
divestiture of rancho seco remains a viable option that 
could free this community from the staggering costs of 
decommissioning said joseph buonaiuto president of the utilitys 
board of directors 
the utility estimates it will cost about 200 million to close 
the plant 
sacramentans for safe energy an antirancho seco group has said 
it will sue to stop efforts to transfer rancho seco to private 
businesses that might continue to operate it 
we will wait and see what happens in the 10day period that 
the utility set to accept bids said michael remy an environmental 
attorney affiliated with the group our position still is that 
enough is enough

parasols have been placed over tropical orchids 
swamp crayfish have crawled out of a canal and race goers have 
collapsed with sunstroke at royal ascot 
britain is in the midst of a heat wave and britons notorious 
for never being accustomed to coping with an occasional hot summer 
or cold winter are doing the best they can 
the heat since midmay has pushed up demand for water in many 
areas by 50 percent in parts of wales and along the welsh border in 
england many homes are without water main supplies 
even if this dry spell breaks it is unlikely to help said 
spokesman stuart derwent of southern water 
he said water reserves were at nearcrisis levels before the heat 
wave because of a mild winter and the longest spring in memory 
as of today people who use sprinklers or hoses to water their 
gardens or wash their cars are threatened with a 620 fine by the 
lee valley water co which supplies parts of north london 
bans on such use were already in force in other parts of the 
country 
lee valley said wednesday it was sending out patrols and hiring 
extra staff to look for violators because demand by its customers 
has risen from 60 million gallons a day to 85 million gallons 
the tough measures followed weeks of television advertising by 
the publicly run water boards seeking to attract potential investors 
prior to privatization 
now that the heats on they are running out of water 
one town actually ran out 
tankers had to deliver water to nelson in lancashire where 
officials blamed the dryingup mostly on avid gardeners leaving 
hoses spouting all night 
quirks of the heat ranged from officers at londons heathrow 
airport firing pistols to drive off flocks of swifts attracted by 
swarms of insects and trout dying at a fish farm in north yorkshire 
when their pond dried up 
human casualties resulted too 
thirteen people drowned last weekend trying to cool off in lakes 
rivers canals and pools 
when the royal ascot race meeting opened tuesday ambulance 
workers said they treated more than 50 people for mild sunstroke or 
fainting reviving them with orange juice and ice cubes 
the weather was a degree or two cooler wednesday after 
temperatures in southern england hit 88 degrees on tuesday the 
hottest june day in 13 years 
it was already almost as hot in may when orchids at the chelsea 
flower show were shielded with umbrellas so they wouldnt wilt 
hundreds of creatures hitherto unknown to londoners crawled out 
of the grand union canal in the capitals kensal town district 
they were identified as central european swamp crayfish seven 
inches long all waving legs claws and whiskers 
no one knew how the mud bugs got there but london zoo said they 
must have bred in large numbers as a result of unusually high 
temperatures 
borough authorities in london appealed to householders to take a 
bucket of water a day to young trees in the streets facing water 
starvation 
the trees were planted after a hurricane in 1987 felled an 
estimated 15 million trees in southern england 
londons daily telegraph said tuesday that pests like aphids 
threatened to reach epidemic levels in gardens and on farms

almost every day hungarys staterun 
media carry a new report about privation in romania or a purported 
shooting on the heavily guarded border between the two countries 
hungary and romania are allies in the warsaw pact military 
alliance but not even a summit of their communist leaders last 
august could ease the tensions between them 
their relations illustrate the depth of many historically rooted 
quarrels now reappearing in the soviet bloc that includes east 
germany poland czechoslovakia hungary romania and bulgaria 
for centuries eastern europe has been a volatile region of 
shifting political allegiances and changing borders a violent 
history has made nationalism a powerful force and left many ethnic 
groups in the area with a long list of grudges against neighbors 
world war i broke up the once vast austrohungarian empire and 
world war ii left the kremlin dominant in eastern europe 
authoritarian communist governments took power after the red army 
swept in and ended nazi germanys reign 
the soviet union following the model laid down by stalin used 
to exert pressure on east european communist parties to maintain 
outwardly friendly relations with mikhail s gorbachev as kremlin 
leader those pressures eased 
until recently traditional conflicts among ethnic groups with 
different languages and cultures lay mostly dormant under slogans 
trumpeting the international solidarity of socialism 
now the soviets are preoccupied with their own economic and 
social woes and the ethnic tensions are bubbling across the 
borders the east european allies grappling with kremlinled calls 
for democratic reforms are reopening old wounds 
current quarrels vary from ideological differences over the pace 
of governmental reforms in poland and hungary and other countries to 
territorial disputes minority rights and even crossborder 
pollution 
east germany and poland have argued over their common border and 
fishing rights in the baltic sea romania has angered bulgaria by 
sending chemical waste wafting across the danube and customs wars 
have flared in a region strapped for consumer goods 
in november czechoslovakia annoyed the entire bloc by slapping 
restrictions at 48 hours notice on the export of just about every 
consumer product soviet bloc visitors might envy in pragues 
relatively wellstocked shops 
poles were especially outraged by measures that included 
confiscation of purchases intended as christmas gifts polish 
travelers felt that the czechs were deliberately reviving a 
historical enmity between the two populations 
the customs crackdown was designed to protect living standards 
that have helped pragues hardline leaders keep outward peace with 
a population disgruntled ever since the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
crushed alexander dubceks reformist government 
but the action immediately touched off retaliations throughout 
the east bloc each country including the soviet union slapped 
export bans on any consumer goods popular with tourists from 
elsewhere in the region 
that conflict has since died down 
the most serious dispute involves hungary and romania simmering 
throughout the 1970s it broke into the open in late 1986 over the 
seemingly innocuous issue of a hungarian history book on 
transylvania a mountainous region ruled by hungary for centuries 
but ceded to romania after world war i 
under president nicolae ceausescu romania is trying to eradicate 
the separate identity of ethnic minorities and it immediately 
accused hungary of publishing the history with the aim of reviving 
claims to transylvania 
at first hungary played calm on the diplomatic front while 
media and intellectuals whipped up emotions at home 
hungarians have given refuge to tens of thousands of romanians 
since january 1988 when budapest broke a hungarianromanian treaty 
obliging it to send back defectors some of whom braved border 
gunfire to escape 
besides playing to proudly nationalist hungarians budapests 
handling of the dispute served to underline hungarys reformist 
politics and to ally it with the west at international forums on 
human and minority rights 
other east bloc neighbors have since begun to take more heed of 
the sizeable hungarian minorities left in their territories 
the soviet union recently improved educational opportunities for 
its small hungarian minority and allowed more visits across the 
common frontier 
czechoslovakias 900000 ethnic hungarians have also received 
better treatment these improvements were overshadowed however by 
pragues quarrels with budapest over a hungarian television 
interview with dubcek and budapests suspension of work on a joint 
dam and power project 
police crackdowns on antigovernment protests in prague in 
january and the subsequent jailing of leading dissident author 
vaclav havel drew public protests from intellectuals in hungary the 
soviet union and poland where prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski 
pointedly attended two havel plays banned in prague 
a hungarian tv interview with dubcek virtually a nonperson in 
czechoslovakia since he was expelled from the communist party in 
1970 further rankled czechoslovakias leaders budapest ignored 
their protests and broadcast a second part of the interview anyway 
tension increased last month when budapest called a twomonth 
halt to its work on a joint danube dam project that has been a 
subject of an environmental controversy since its inception in 1977 
czechoslovakia again strongly protested the move this time 
however it seemed as if an east bloc row might lead to domestic 
protests 
when prime ministers miklos nemeth of hungary and ladislav adamec 
of czechoslovakia met to discuss the power project adamec took a 
conciliatory tone in an effort to defuse tensions

a policy reversal by gov michael s dukakis has 
led state and federal officials to agree on a plan to deport about 
1000 illegal aliens held in massachusetts prisons 
in 1985 dukakis issued an executive order forbidding state 
investigators from working on deportation cases unless ordered to do 
so by a court 
that order was portrayed as gesture of good will toward illegals 
at a time when the reagan administration was cracking down 
under the new policy agreed to tuesday the state will work with 
us immigration and naturalization service officials to identify 
and deport inmates of the crowded state and county prison system who 
are in the united states illegally 
when possible the state will work aggressively to get these 
people out on the next plane said human services secretary philip 
johnston who oversees massachusetts correction system 
regional ins director charles cobb who met tuesday with johnston 
to work out the plans details and has criticized dukakis order 
called the agreement a step in the right direction 
about 1300 or 10 percent of the approximately 13000 inmates 
in state prisons are illegal aliens according to johnston of the 
1300 about 1000 are eligible for immediate deportation 
most of the inmates involved have been involved in drug dealing 
and come from jamaica the dominican republic and colombia 
according to johnston 
some convicted of particularly violent crimes including four men 
serving sentences for the rape at big dans tavern in new bedford in 
1984 will remain in prison johnston said

while hiding from the nazis anne was transformed from a playful 
girl of 13 to an insightful compassionate even spiritual 
15yearold on jan 6 1944 she recalled a dream about a boy from 
school 
i awoke at this point while i could still feel his cheek 
against mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart so 
deep that here he read how much i loved him and how much i still 
love him tears sprang into my eyes once more and i was very sad 
that i had lost him again 
in another dream she saw her late grandmother and a friend from

over the years that the diary was fake a shameless exploitation 
in the late 1950s rightwing newspapers in austria and norway 
published attacks on the diary insisting the ideas expressed were 
far too sophisticated for a teenage girl in the mid70s a german 
publishing house began distributing pamphlets repeating charges that 
otto frank annes father had written the diary with the help of a 
new york playwright 
upon franks death in 1980 the original manuscripts were turned 
over to the netherlands war documentation institute work on the 
critical edition began the following year one of the books 
editors gerrold van der stroom insisted in a recent interview that 
the diary is indeed authentic 
we asked the dutch forensic laboratory of the ministry of 
justice which does the same work for police to check the paper and 
ink they found that all the paper and all the ink were very common 
for the first half of the 1940s he said 
they also compared the letters before the war postcards etc 
that she had written to her grandmother in switzerland with the 
handwriting in the diaries they found that the same person wrote 
everything 
the franks lived in frankfurt germany until 1933 when they 
emigrated to amsterdam after hitler took power the nazis occupied 
the netherlands in 1940 and began imposing ever harsher antijewish 
laws forcing jews to wear a yellow sixpointed star 
when the ss the nazi military police issued a callup notice to 
frank in july 1942 the family was forced into hiding for more than 
two years the franks and four others were holed up in a secret 
annexe located upstairs from franks warehouse in amsterdam 
they relied on friends notably miep and jan gies to bring them 
food and supplies and prayed that the allied troops would liberate 
their country before the nazis could find them 
police raided the annex on aug 4 1944 and the prisoners were 
sent off to westerbork a jewish transit camp anne and her sister 
margot were later shipped to the notorious death camp auschwitz 
and eventually to bergenbelsen where they contracted typhoid fever 
and perished within days of each other in the winter of 1945 their 
mother died at another camp 
after the arrest miep gies gathered up annes papers and kept 
them under lock and key when frank returned to amsterdam in june 
1945 he headed straight for the gies home and was presented with 
his daughters journals

i see the eight of us with our secret annexe as if we were a 
little piece of blue heaven surrounded by heavy black rain 
clouds anne frank wrote on nov 8 1943 
the round clearly defined spot where we stand is safe but the 
clouds gather more closely about us and the circle which separates 
us from the approaching danger closes more and more tightly

when gis came home after world war ii 
the nation looked to the great forests of the northwest for lumber 
to build their houses 
oregon and washington mills responded and still supply more than 
a third of the lumber and plywood used in the united states 
there was always that one more shining hill covered with trees 
to the west said us forest service budget officer ron johnson 
in portland now we find theres a pacific ocean and we fell into 
it 
from the western slope of the cascade range to the shore of the 
pacific this is the home of the douglas fir the towering king of 
the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber 
it is also home to the northern spotted owl a 14inch bird that 
could face extinction because with rare exceptions it wont nest 
or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most 
prized for timber 
while logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the 
national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl 
record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are 
being shipped for premium prices to japan china and korea without 
ever seeing the inside of an american mill 
if a log is of export quality and is available to be exported 
it will be exported said tom mayr owner of the mayr brothers 
mill in hoquiam wash mayr has been reduced to counting his supply 
in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being 
loaded onto ships in grays harbor wash 
we want to put out logs to the highest value market in recent 
years the highest value has been offshore said jack taylor 
operations manager for weyerhaeuser in coos bay where the regions 
leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce 
metricdimension lumber for the japanese homebuilding market 
companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than 
they can in the domestic market said forest service economist don 
flora in seattle 
boomandbust cycles were known to the timber industry before the 
spotted owl entered the spotlight but for the first time the pinch 
is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and 
dips in the housing market 
eighteen years ago brad wentworth stopped off in the coastal 
town of gold beach to see some friends on his way to college to 
study forest management now hes 37 a husband and father and one 
of the 300 workers at gold beach plywood who will be out of a job 
this summer when the mill shuts down 
i got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages 
wentworth said i kick myself in the butt now 
thirteen other wood products mills in oregon and washington have 
closed this year putting nearly 2000 people out of work as the 
industry enters a new era of highpriced timber in short supply a 
referendum tuesday in oregon calls for a ban on exporting 
stategrown logs and asks congress to make permanent an annually 
renewed ban on exporting logs grown on federal land 
the mill is old and inefficient said gold beach mill manager 
eric saunders it would take about 3 million to bring it up why 
should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a 
stable supply of timber 
the shortage of timber doesnt come as a surprise but its 
magnitude does 
in 1976 oregon state university forestry professor john beuter 
reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that 
the industry would have to depend on national forests home to most 
of the oldgrowth timber to make it to the next century when 
secondgrowth trees planted before world war ii would be ready for 
harvest 
jerry hamilton director of resource services for seattles 
simpson timber co had expected harvests in national forests to 
decline about 20 percent in oregon and washington this year as the 
forest service revised its longrange management plans he now fears 
it could drop 50 percent because oldgrowth forests have been ruled 
offlimits because of the spotted owl 
historically a lot of the impetus for the management of 
federal lands in the west was to settle the west and develop it 
said beuter now a consultant in portland we are sort of at the 
end of that era now we are at the point of recognizing that cutting 
more timber isnt going to create new cities and new economic 
opportunity in the west in fact we are coming around to where 
saving the forests may create new economic opportunity 
ed whitelaw a university of oregon economics professor has been 
a leading proponent of the idea that the northwest has more to gain 
from preserving its blue skies green forests and clear water than 
from exploiting its resources 
most oregonians receive two paychecks he said one is in 
dollars the other comes from the environment by accounting for all 
other amenities i estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth 
13 billion the paycheck from the timber industry is 15 
billion 
in 1988 oregon and washington national forests supplied 54 
billion board feet of timber a third of the regions total harvest 
from all lands where the forest service management plans used in 
the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 55 billion board feet the 
limit in the 1990s will be closer to 47 billion 
unlike owners of private forests the forest service by law may 
cut no more timber than it can grow back it also has to provide for 
the needs of fish wildlife campers hikers and water quality 
where it once had to answer only to the timber industry the 
service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder the 
governors of washington and oregon want to be sure there is enough 
timber to sustain the rural economy environmental groups demand 
preservation of oldgrowth forests academics have started offering 
new management techniques that follow the lead of nature and there 
is new unrest inside the forest service 
jeff debonis a willamette national forest timber sale planner 
has organized the association of forest service employees for 
environmental ethics with a mailing list of about 200 debonis 
wrote in february to forest service chief dale robertson claiming 
the agency is in bed with the industry 
the question we need to ask concerned citizens is why should 
the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy 
industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut he 
said 
robertsons staff is preparing a detailed response to debonis 
letter said spokeswoman rose narlock in washington dc maybe we 
need some of these things talked about it was a gutsy move on his 
part 
robertson has acknowledged that the forest service has taken a 
beating in the courts under the national environmental policy act 
evidence debonis cites for his argument that too many trees are 
being cut 
while loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more 
timber the grim truth is jobs are disappearing spotted owl or no 
spotted owl 
the biggest source of change in employment has been the 
modernization and automation of the forest products industry said 
wilderness society economist jeffrey t olson who produced a study 
concluding the decline in timber jobs in the northwest has little to 
do with cutting old growth in national forests 
flora the forest service economist said in the 1970s he figured 
each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber 
jobs thats now down to 15 jobs in the hightech mills and four to 
five jobs overall 
timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of 
portland and seattle but still vital in small cities and towns that 
grew up with it 
oregons 68700 woodproducts jobs almost all of them outside 
the portland area account for 52 percent of the states 
employment washingtons 41800 timber jobs account for 21 percent 
of its employment in 1986 the most recent figures available 
timber accounted for just 6 percent of oregons gross state product 
at 25 billion and 22 percent of washingtons at 16 billion 
but forest service economist con schallau in corvallis argues 
timber has a greater impact than that because it accounts for 38 
percent of oregons basic economy bringing in outside dollars 
and 18 percent of washingtons 
while economists may differ over timbers importance they agree 
the places that will be hurt worst are towns like gold beach 
population 1500 with a payroll of 6 million from gold beach 
plywood 
if you live in a big city youve got a lot of choices 
wentworth said but if you live here youve got to work in the 
brush or the mill

one tip that weyerhaeuser is taking bold 
steps with its newest sawmill is the bed of pansies in the log yard 
weyerhaeuser a leading exporter of logs to japan has gone a 
step further to produce precisionsawn metricdimension lumber for 
japanese home builders for whom the appearance of wood for 
traditional postandbeam construction counts more than the 
structural strength valued in the american market 
we want to put out logs to the highest value market in recent 
years the highest value has been offshore said operations manager 
jack taylor 
so the company scrapped an aging mill in north bend on the 
southern coast and converted a cedar plant here into ts mill of the 
90s called cbx 
were pulling out all the stops said superintendent sam 
dickey as he showed off the paved log yard laserguided saws 
flowers and a new management style that emphasizes teamwork were 
spending 1 million on the upgrade 
but hightech also means fewer jobs when weyerhaeuser announced 
the cbx project in january north bend employed about 200 and 
produced about 65 million board feet a year about 3 jobs per 
million board feet the cbx crew of 69 can produce 45 million board 
feet a year or 15 jobs per million feet 
the mills that survive the current shakeup in the industry must 
be extremely efficient and dickey expects his handpicked crew to 
lead the way were aiming to have this site be the model for the 
industry 
to emphasize that point weyerhaeuser has installed catwalks for 
visitors 
all the major japanese trading companies have been here once or 
twice said dickey who is learning japanese 
while weyerhaeuser took the obvious steps of upgrading the 
physical plant at cbx it also is going where no sawmill has gone 
before in its contract with the international woodworkers of america 
basically it lets people work as teams rather than in 
individual job situations said milo summerville field 
representative for iwa local 3261 sometimes you have to give 
something like this a trial period to see if it will work 
lumber grader al esch is enthusiastic about being able to rotate 
through three positions rather than sticking to one job its kind 
of like being an immigrant in a new country he said 
cheryl howell an 11year veteran of the company scored well on 
a handeye coordination test and was crosstrained to run 
barkstripping machinery and giant loaders in the yard before 
its done i expect to know how to run everything in here she 
said 
the first shift starts at 630 am with workers and managers 
joining in 10 minutes of exercises followed by as much as 45 
minutes of talk as the crew helps make management decisions to 
emphasize teamwork weyerhaeuser scrapped an old cleanup contract 
and made everyone including dickey responsible for keeping the 
mill clean 
dickey is happy to get away from the oldstyle management 
approach he calls big brainlittle brain 
generally you get dissatisfied employees because they are 
starved for information he said were giving them a big piece 
of the operation

in the rugged illahe country where gold 
miners still pan creeks running into the rogue river the siskiyou 
national forest is trying techniques from a movement known as the 
new forestry 
i see it as a major philosophical change rather than an 
incremental change said forest service scientist jerry franklin 
a leading spokesman for the movement in terms of forestry 
practice it is revolutionary 
the new forestry is gaining credibility in the midst of debate 
over how much national forest can be logged while preserving the old 
growth ecosystem pressure to log these forests has increased as 
private lands have been overcut 
we need to make this crisis the basis for not just resolving 
the issue of how much old growth to leave but perhaps more 
important how do we manage our commodity lands over the long 
term franklin said 
people are looking for ways to harvest the forest and provide 
jobs yet keep values that are important to the public said gold 
beach district ranger kathy johnson the public is interested in 
oldgrowth forest interested in the species that inhabit the old 
growth forest 
we think there is an opportunity for these new forestry 
techniques to provide that middle ground 
while most national forests in oregon and washington still are 
developing 10year management plans the siskiyou national forest 
has fit the new forestry into its plan with a goal of balancing 
production against a healthy forest 
the key to new forestry is to save more of the forests parts so 
what is left after logging has the best chance of surviving radical 
climate changes a growing number of scientists predict will come 
within the next 50 years 
on the siskiyou the new forestry is the basis for plans to start 
logging in the next couple years the 7100 acres known as the illahe 
project about 40 miles west of grants pass in southwestern oregon 
as we move out from that large block of oldgrowth forest into 
areas previously harvested we feather out the impacts said 
johnson well leave a certain amount of oldgrowth trees per 
acre that number increases as you get closer to the undisturbed 
block of old growth forest 
that differs radically from traditional practice of clearcuts of 
20 to 40 acres scattered throughout the forest in hopes of diluting 
the impact 
as scientists have learned more about how pieces of the forest 
interact they have found that scattered clearcuts fragmented the 
ecosystem breaking it into pieces too small to function they also 
have found it valuable to leave corridors linking the pieces of 
forest 
instead of clearcutting new foresters will leave dead trees and 
some live trees standing to give animals places to feed and live 
some logs will be left to rot and restore organic material to the 
soil planners say the new forestry will mean a 5 percent cut in 
timber production over the 130year harvest cycle 
no decision has been made on how to approach slash burning in 
which debris left by clearcutting is burned to return minerals to 
the soil reduce fire danger and make it easier to plant seedlings 
johnson said 
when it comes to replanting loggedover land the new forestry 
suggests restoring the mix of species that were cut to maintain a 
diverse genetic base more able to withstand future climatic change 
rather than filling the land with one commercially valuable species 
such as douglas fir 
oregon state university forestry professor david perry also part 
of the new forestry movement said the point is that whatever you 
do to take trees off it has got to be consistent with the 
adaptations of the forest that have evolved over millenia to cope 
with disurbance

in small towns in sicily where just looking at a man 
can get a woman labeled loose lara cardella is being called all 
kinds of names for telling how it is to grow up female and sicilian 
the 19yearold native of licata sicily population 45000 is 
also selling a lot of books 
her novel volevo i pantaloni i wanted pants has been 
italys bestselling paperback since early spring cardella wrote it 
at night longhand in a notebook in her parents house and 
submitted it in an italian contest for young unpublished writers 
she says she didnt expect to win let alone get published she 
did both 
arnoldo mondadori the italian publishing giant has already sold 
the film rights for the book which at 121 largetype pages is more 
a novella than a novel 
cardella also didnt expect insulting telephone calls and 
scornful looks from townspeople who felt ridiculed by the book 
when she came out of her house one day with a french tv crew 
paramilitary police had to protect her from a crowd shouting curses 
she recalls 
some of my friends stayed by me some of them left me she 
said in a recent telephone interview from her home my sister was 
forced to change schools few of my parents friends remain 
the small town in her scathing story could be licata or hundreds 
of other coastal towns or mountain villages in sicily or for that 
matter the rest of rural southern italy 
telling the story is 16yearold annetta she is not an 
autobiographical character cardella says but embraces the 
experiences of many of her girlfriends whose modest attempts at 
liberation like kissing a boy in public sometimes ended in 
beatings or being kept at home under even tighter supervision 
annetta wants to wear pants like men or at least be able wear 
her skirts short like her friend angelina who used to live in the 
more liberal north 
annetta asks her mother how she can get pants 
her reply innocent revolutionized my adolescent life 
annetta says she told me i pantaluna falli purtari e masculi e 
buttani the sicilian dialect translates men and whores wear 
pants 
annetta then sets out to learn how to put on lipstick sway her 
hips so boys will notice her and lie to her parents so theyll let 
her go to an afternoon party at angelinas house naturally 
where there are more boys than girls and no parents 
at the party she meets a boy named nicola the next day an uncle 
sees nicola kissing annetta she is beaten up by her father and 
renounced by her mother whos so busy weeping from shame she quits 
cooking dinner 
wanting to eat again her father arranges for annetta to stay 
with an uncle even though her parents know the uncle sexually 
molested her when she was 10 years old 
woman is wife woman is mother but she is not a person 
cardella writes 
most of licatas residents who protested the book didnt read it 
she says cardellas detractors became even more enraged when she 
went on a nationwide tv talk show and derided one of southern 
italys most sacred rituals the sunday afternoon passeggiata 
or stroll taken after the days big meal 
girls walk hand in hand around and around the main square boys 
cluster in groups and ogle the girls who have mastered the art of 
looking chaste and sexy at the same time older folks sit on the 
sidelines to make sure all the boys and girls exchange are looks 
after the television show cardella told another interviewer the 
mayor met her on the street and said you need to be straightened 
out 
cardella regrets blurting out on television that 99 percent 
of sicilians are backward 
i love sicily its so beautiful its stupendous but the idea 
that people wont denounce violence is wrong violence exists 
i think its wrong a woman cant go to a disco 
in general she says girls are more repressed in the poorer 
towns and neighborhoods 
cardella says her parents were very strict with her just like 
the others 
but i tried to educate them to make them see i wasnt doing 
anything wrong and now she says they support her in her battle 
against repression 
people say im impulsive that i want to change things too 
quickly but i dont want to wait 100 years i dont want to know my 
daughter will have the same problems i did 
enrolled in the literature department of the university of 
palermo she studies at home and says when she marries her 
boyfriend shell move to gela his town 25 miles from licata

many of the leaders of chinas nowquelled 
demonstrations for political reform have fled their homes changed 
their names and appearance and obtained false identification 
still the arrests mount dramatizing how difficult it is to hide 
from authority in this tightly controlled society despite chinas 
huge size and 12 billion population 
liu gang the sixth student on a wanted circular of 21 to be 
arrested fled to hebei province just south of beijing and 
introduced himself as zhang shun unemployed worker 
but he was discovered by sharpeyed civilians who thought his 
skin was too white to be the worker he claimed to be 
even in ordinary times a fugitive can be easy to spot in small 
villages an outsider clearly stands out in big cities 
neighborhood committees staffed by women with spare time keep a 
close watch on comings and goings and make sure people register 
overnight guests with the police 
housing is cramped and many people live in just one or two rooms 
around a common courtyard making it virtually impossible to hide a 
fugitive 
official identification is always required to travel in china 
but controls have been sharply increased since the june 34 military 
crackdown 
soldiers are checking identification and searching the bags of 
travelers at the beijing train station at night soldiers stop most 
cars at major intersections check the id of drivers and sometimes 
search the cars 
plainclothes police are out in strength sometimes betraying 
themselves by suspicious squawks from under their clothing or 
toocareful inspection of passersby two recently stopped a young 
beijing woman as she walked down the street because she resembles a 
wanted student leader they let her go after checking her 
identification 
many work units have appointed people to take charge of security 
any newcomer looking for temporary work is likely to be scrutinized 
far more carefully than usual 
customs officials have been ordered to be especially alert for 
fugitives seeking to leave the country this week officials at the 
beijing airport arrested four people with alleged ties to the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion according to wednesdays beijing 
daily 
two of them liu xiaoqiu 27 and lu zhuru 29 had tickets for 
paris the women were caught because an official noted their 
passports had false border entry stamps 
it turned out the passports belonged to two other women who had 
left china and mailed the passports back but the passports lacked 
entry stamps so miss liu and miss lu allegedly faked them 
the greatest threat to student activists and other protesters on 
the run is the intense nationwide government propaganda campaign 
that apparently has convinced many people the crackdown was 
justified 
when the government called on tv viewers to help find a man 
accused of rumormongering and flashed his picture on the screen 
two women quickly stepped forward to point him out 
when student activist zhou fengsuos name was placed on the 
wanted circular his sister and brotherinlaw turned him in 
newspapers and broadcasts repeatedly have called on the public to 
report rebels creating the temptation to report a neighbor and 
win the praise and possibly the favor of authorities that can be 
important to obtaining housing and other scarce goods 
even people who might be disposed to ignore that the nextdoor 
neighbors are harboring a stranger face the pressure of knowing that 
if they dont report it someone else probably will then they will 
come under suspicion for having been silent

japan has on that vital market 
the firms contributed seed money for the establishment of 
us memories inc a corporation that will make the memory chips 
known as drams that are crucial to the us electronic and defense 
industries 
it is clear that the time is right for a collective memory 
manufacturing venture in the united states to improve americas 
market position in what is truly a critical technology said 
sanford l kane president and chief executive officer of the newly 
formed company 
if approved the venture would break new ground in the federal 
governments attitude toward cooperation between competing 
companies the government has been getting steadily more permissive 
toward deals that once would have run afoul of antitrust laws on the 
theory that concerted action is necessary to meet foreign 
competition 
at this point we dont know enough about the transaction to 
comment one way or the other amy brown a spokeswoman for the 
justice departments antitrust division said wednesday 
either the justice department or the federal trade commission is 
likely to look at the deal although not necessarily conduct a 
fullscale investigation she said 
the corporations preliminary business plan calls for the 
completion of a plant in 1990 and highvolume production of the 
dynamic random access memory chips or drams to begin in the first 
half of 1991 
kane said the corporations first product will be standard 
4megabit drams based on design and manufacturing technology to be 
licensed from international business machines corp 
the plan also says that us memories expects to raise roughly 
500 million from companies that invest in the corporation and 500 
million from borrowings 
memory chips are a vital link of the electronics food chain 
and many us industry and government officials say it is 
unacceptable to rely heavily on chips made in japan for computers 
work stations military gear and other products 
japanese firms control nearly 80 percent of the worldwide dram 
market which they were able to dominate by sustaining 4 billion in 
losses in 198586 to knock out their american competition according 
to the semiconductor industry association 
the number of us companies producing drams for sale on the open 
market an area in which they once were leaders fell dramatically 
from 11 in 1980 to three this year the three are texas instruments 
inc micron technologies inc and motorola inc which recently 
reentered the business 
ibm is a huge manufacturer of drams but only for internal use 
kane who will be its chief executive was formerly a vice president 
of industry operations for ibms general technology division 
the companies that gave money to plan the corporation were 
advanced micro devices inc digital equipment corp 
hewlettpackard co ibm intel corp lsi logic corp and national 
semiconductor corp 
kane said the seven partners must stillobtain enough funds to 
launch the venture successfully negotiate a technology transfer 
agreement with ibm create a detailed business plan and get a 
favorable antitrust agreement 
it is absolutely clear that well need more than the seven we 
have now he added 
kane said us memories would work closely with sematech the 
austin texasbased research consortium that was one of the first 
such cooperative efforts in the united states sematech makes small 
quantities of chips to test manufacturing processes and equipment 
contacted in tokyo on thursday a spokesman for nec corp 
japans largest semiconductor maker said he could not comment 
because there are too many unknown things about the venture 
the electronic industries association of japan a major grouping 
of semiconductor companies and other electronics makers also had 
no specific comment on a us venture because details have yet 
to be known a spokesman said

firefighters sweating in 118degree 
temperatures wednesday contained a 935acre wildfire that briefly 
threatened a national park 
residents in 85 homes were advised to evacuate at the height of 
the fire near joshua tree national monument which is dedicated to 
preservation of the gnarled desert trees but only one building was 
destroyed 
the residents had cleared the brush around their homes and if 
it hadnt been for that clearance the homes would definitely have 
burned said deborah mcclellan of the california department of 
forestry 
temperatures reached above 100 inland and into the high 80s and 
90degree mark elsewhere and gusty santa ana winds hampered 
firefighters as they fought several other brush fires 
fire blackened 175 acres in the hills of san clemente in southern 
orange county and 35 acres in santa clarita in northwestern los 
angeles county firefighters earlier doused a 300acre blaze in 
ventura county and a 115acre fire in san bernardino county 
northern california was also subject to the same hot gusty winds 
and low humidity which helped fan 2600acre wildfire 50 miles 
northeast of san francisco 
heavy smoke from the grass fire forced closure of a 10mile 
stretch of state highway 12 authorities said state route 20 in the 
sierra was closed for 30 miles while firefighters tried to contain a 
blaze on both sides of the highway 
two families were briefly evacuated from their homes in the 
farming community of denverton said marcia chadbourne spokeswoman 
for the solano county office of emergency services 
other smaller fires were reported in the city of vacaville near 
the retirement community of rossmoor and in the sunolcastlewood 
area near pleasanton

alice doesnt cook here anymore but 
this sleepy western massachusetts town captured in paint by norman 
rockwell and in song by arlo guthrie celebrates its 250th birthday 
this weekend 
some things have changed since the days when rockwell made 
stockbridge famous to saturday evening post readers 
police chief william j obanhein whose visage rockwell used as 
the model of the perfect secret service man and whose 
enforcement of the litter laws inspired arlo guthries ballad 
alices restaurant has retired alice brock herself no longer 
has a restaurant 
dr donald e campbell captured by rockwell while aiming a 
hypodermic needle at a barebottomed youngster scrutinizing his 
medical degrees made his last house call in february on his 83rd 
birthday 
but the cat and dog fountain still stands so does the horse 
trough proclaiming utility is preferable to glamor and the line 
of cane rockers on the veranda of the red lion inn 
stockbridges charm has proved irresistible to thousands of 
tourists who sometimes turn main street into a bumpertobumper 
traffic jam 
but for about two hours saturday stockbridge will reclaim the 
thoroughfare for a gala parade of brass bands boy scouts floats 
and more than 500 marchers 
an oldfashioned picnic and fireworks also are planned 
asked to explain stockbridges appeal selectman norman 
charbonneau responded the people and the uniqueness of the 
area 
guthrie agreed 
i grew up in stockbridge and have spent most of my life near 
there guthrie said in a telephone interview from his nearby 
berkshire hills home most of the people in town are wonderful and 
fabulous 
its a place that has retained its turnofthecentury beauty 
and sense of history its always accommodated a wide variety of 
people artists wealthy ambassadors mobsters running booze during 
prohibition but it does so very reluctantly 
and in some ways thats just fine when i was young i didnt 
understand that kind of smalltown politics but ive learned to 
actually like it 
guthrie now the father of teenagers said stockbridge is more 
a town for older folks adding 
i dont recall there being a whole lot to do for a young person 
and there probably still isnt i dont think my kids ever go to 
stockbridge 
but guthrie who will sing alices restaurant at a july 4 
concert in nearby tanglewood can still cackle gleefully in 
anticipation of the towns reaction to his summer plans to market 
tshirts emblazoned with the trail of the garbage that will lead 
tourists on the path of his crime 
it will be sort of our own version of the freedom trail in 
boston he said

they call her old glory she has flown proudly 
from masts of americas ships waved defiantly from her battlements 
lain sadly across her coffins for 202 years the flag has inspired 
oh say can you see but she also has been spat on stepped 
on torn and defiled 
the flag has been flown upside down in derision not just 
distress it has been exploited in advertisements desecrated with 
unseemly mottoes and burned by enemies without and protesters 
within it has been a political issue a legal issue and 
pseudopatriots have been accused of hiding behind it 
it waves for all eternity on the airless surface of the moon 
and now the highest court in the land divided 54 has 
decreed that the freedoms symbolized by the flag protect the very 
people who burn it as a form of political protest 
we do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration for 
in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem 
represents said william j brennan the most senior of the 
justices in the majority opinion 
and justice john paul stevens in dissenting said that condoning 
descecration of the flag will tarnish its value both for those 
who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to 
don the robes of martyrdom by burning it 
the case before the court involved the burning of a flag at the 
republican national convention in dallas in 1984 in which 
protesters chanted america the red white and blue we spit on 
you 
that same year the mcdonalds restaurant chain got some flak for 
lowering the american flag to half staff to observe the death of its 
founder ray kroc 
the difficulty the justices faced in reaching agreement mirrors 
the shifting of american attitudes toward the stars and stripes 
until the vietnam generation americans venerated the flag a flag 
was burned only because it was old and then to spare it the 
indignity of being thrown into the garbage can 
the burning flag however became a searing symbol of the dissent 
over the vietnam war serving to further polarize those who regarded 
the flag with awe it was a schism that remains today 
recall the part the flag played last year in the presidential 
campaign 
there was the suggestion by sen steve symms of idaho a 
republican that kitty dukakis wife of the democratic candidate 
had burned the american flag while she was an antiwar demonstrator 
during the 1960s 
the dukakis campaign was forced to respond that the suggestion 
was totally false and beneath contempt and that she regarded the 
flag as a symbol of our nations commitment to freedom symms 
later admitted the story was only something he had heard and that he 
had no proof 
michael dukakis also took the heat for opposing a massachussets 
bill to require daily recitation of the pledge of allegiance in the 
school dukakis pointed to a us supreme court decision that said a 
forced pledge was unconstitutional but it was a fine distinction 
that swayed few voters 
george bush went to a flag factory and recited the pledge of 
allegiance at innumerable campaign stops 
he won 
in chicago last march an exhibit at the art institute featured 
a flag positioned on the floor in front of a book asking viewers to 
write their opinions on what is the proper way to display a us 
flag the exhibit called how to display dread scott tyler 
sparked strong protests with one woman writing 
an artist he is not this dread scott he is an unpatriotic 
snot he knows not what this country is about another wrote i 
would do anything short of killing you to stop you 
the exhibit prompted a march on the institute with demonstrators 
chanting hut two three four get the flag off the floor 
the flag as a freedomofspeech issue was strongest in the 
vietnam days 
in mineola ny a woman was handcuffed searched fingerprinted 
and jailed for flying the flag upside down during a nationwide 
moratorium observance by opponents of the vietnam war she was freed 
by a judge who ruled her act was not defilement but a distress 
signal 
in philadelphia the state supreme court threw out the conviction 
of a man for displaying a flag on which he had written make love 
not war 
the monmouth county board of freeholders in new jersey decided it 
wouldnt allow citizens to speak at its public meetings if they 
didnt take part in flag ceremonies that began each session 
a 19yearold resident who strolled through leominster mass 
with an american flag sewn to the seat of his pants was sentenced to 
a year in jail the law passed in 1899 forbade treating the flag 
in a contemptuous manner 
yippie leader abbie hoffman who died recently was convicted of 
defiling the flag wearing a shirt made in the design of the flag 
when he showed up for a hearing of the house committee on 
unamerican activities the conviction was overturned 
passions ran so high in a southern new jersey county that the 
governing board voted to require all countyowned cars to carry flag 
decals with the slogan our flag love it or leave 
but in minnesota the state supreme court upheld the defacing 
conviction of a youth who painted a white peace symbol over the 
field of stars a judge who dissented said patriotism is not 
instilled by statute 
and the ultimate in disappointments came in 1987 to a taiwanese 
company that found it difficult to sell american flags labeled 
made in taiwan the company offered its american distributors 
made in usa labels but they wouldnt bite

the united states is skeptical of a soviet 
proposal to seek advice from the united nations security councils 
permanent members on proposed elections among palestinian arabs on 
the west bank and in gaza administration sources say 
we said we werent interested an official said late 
wednesday the official who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified did not reject the idea outright but said it would not 
get anywhere as far as were concerned 
the official said the proposal could complicate efforts to hold 
elections to choose palestinian representatives to negotiate 
selfrule with israel 
it would only muddy the waters and distract from the 
elections idea itself the official said 
participation by the council members would guarantee the soviet 
union a role that israel fears would be used to the advantage of the 
arabs 
the five members of the security council are the united states 
the soviet union britain france and china 
the soviets without committing themselves on palestinian 
elections made their proposal during a twoday meeting in 
washington last week on the middle east it was one in a series of 
conferences on various global problems arranged by the two 
superpowers 
the us delegation was headed by john kelly assistant secretary 
of state for the near east and dennis ross head of the 
departments policy planning staff vladimir polyakov senior expert 
on the middle east in the soviet foreign ministry led his 
governments delegation 
the soviet idea was first disclosed in thursday editions of the 
star tribune of minneapolis 
the elections were proposed by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir as a way of breaking the stalemate between the arabs and 
israel the idea has qualified us support provided arrangements 
are satisfactory to the palestinians and the arab countries 
the palestine liberation organization has rejected israels offer 
as a subterfuge to block the creation of a palestinian state but 
the bush administration is operating on the assumption that the 
shamir proposal still has a chance and in any event is the only 
known vehicle for starting negotiations 
for this reason the official said the soviet proposal to 
consult the un security council members on a proper framework 
received a skeptical us response 
the official said the soviets did not endorse or reject shamirs 
proposition as in the past the soviets said only that it was 
worthy of consideration 
in the past as an inducement to israel the soviets have said 
they would be prepared to resume diplomatic relations once 
negotiations began but the official said the soviets did not repeat 
this offer in the washington sessions 
the soviet union broke relations with israel in 1967 when israel 
defeated a combination of arab countries in a sixday war

the share of first pregnancies beginning out of 
wedlock has risen sharply in the 1980s and single pregnant women are 
no longer rushing to the altar a new census bureau study shows 
there has been a significant rise in the share of first births 
out of wedlock during the last two decades while the share of women 
who tie the knot between conception and birth has been on a decline 
the census report also found a jump in the birth rate among women 
in their 30s noting that most women who had a baby in 1988 were in 
the work force it found that minorities tend to have higher birth 
rates than whites and that nearly threequarters of recent births to 
black women between 15 and 29 were out of wedlock 
overall the national fertility rate was 697 births per 1000 
women age 18 to 44 during the year ending in june 1988 according to 
the report fertility of american women june 1988 
fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1000 women 
during this decade and the 697 for 1988 is not considered 
significantly different from the 71 recorded the year before 
but the profile of women becoming mothers in the united states 
has changed 
for women age 15 to 29 the bureau found 40 percent of first 
births were conceived out of marriage between 1985 and 1988 
thats up from just more than 30 percent when the measure was 
first taken between 1970 and 1974 the report said 
the major change occurred among women who gave birth out of 
wedlock a share which increased from 179 percent of first mothers 
in the early 1970s to 283 percent between 1985 and 1988 
at the same time the share of unwed mothers was rising the 
percentage of women who got married after they became pregnant but 
before they gave birth dropped from 149 percent to 117 percent of 
first mothers 
this shift may reflect the opinion of some women that they may 
be better off in the long run by relying more on the support of 
their parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistance 
than by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solely 
to prevent an outofwedlock birth reported bureau analyst amara 
bachu 
the share of single first mothers varied sharply by race the 
study also found 
among black women 746 percent of first births to women age 15 
to 29 occurred out of wedlock between 1985 and 1988 thats up from 
541 percent between 1970 and 1974 
for hispanic women the rate was 306 percent up from 267 
percent and white women recorded 196 percent premarital births up 
from 115 percent 
the new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of women 
postponing births as they pursue educations and careers 
the increases in childbearing among women over 30 suggest 
that childless women now more than in the past are deliberately 
postponing their childbearing to older ages the report concluded 
for women age 30 to 34 the 1988 fertility rate was 816 births 
per 1000 women up from 60 in 1980 and 564 in 1976 a similar 
though smaller increase was reported for women 35 to 39 
the bureau also asked women about their plans for families and 
reported that among childless wives age 25 to 29 85 percent still 
expect to have a child at some point thats up from 75 percent who 
expected a future birth in this age group in 1975 
and among married women in their early 30s the share who expect 
to have a child someday rose to 544 percent from 335 percent since 
1975 
nevertheless the study concludes the question remains how 
strong is the commitment to childbearing after remaining married and 
childless for several years 
for women age 18 to 44 the study reported that 509 percent of 
women giving birth in 1988 were in the work force up from just 38 
percent in 1980 
labor force participation for among women with newborn children 
is appreciably higher for collegeeducated women than for women 
with less education the report found 
among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were in 
the labor force compared with 49 percent of high school graduates 
and 34 percent who had not finished high school 
by race 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force 
compared to 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among hispanics

cracking down on its critics the 
leftist sandinista government says it has confiscated coffee 
plantations and other property belonging to three opposition 
business leaders 
the three nicolas bolanos jaime cuadra and arnoldo aleman 
were linked to the superior council of private enterprise an 
opposition group and have been sharply critical of government 
regulation of the coffee industry 
the confiscation announcement wednesday came three days after 
coffee growers from all over the country decided to pull out of the 
national coffee commission calling the regulatory and 
developmentoriented panel useless 
an order signed by agriculture development minister jaime 
wheelock and read on staterun voice of nicaragua radio declared the 
properties of the three men of public utility and social 
interest it did not mention compensation 
at a meeting sunday in matagalpa 80 miles north of the capital 
coffee growers unanimously decided to withdraw from the national 
coffee commission they said the panel made up of government and 
private representatives had ruined the industry 
at the meeting bolanos accused the government of causing a 
severe economic crisis through mismanagement adding that only a 
government of national salvation replacing the sandinistas could 
bring nicaragua out of recession 
coffee is one of nicaraguas main export items and a principal 
dollarearner 
commenting on the confiscation order the voice of nicaragua 
accused leaders of the coffee growers of urging chaos disorder 
price gouging smuggling and speculation in the industry 
the properties were ordered confiscated because these leadaers 
adopted irresponsible attitude that was fomenting anarchy in the 
coffee industry at a time when the country is going through an 
economic crisis 
in a speech tuesday president daniel ortega said all 
antipatriotic coffee growers will not receive a single cent in 
credit from the state development bank 
ortega accused the growers of trying to sabotage an economic 
austerity plan to reduce inflation which last year topped 10000 
percent 
as part of the plan the sandinista government earlier this week 
ordered a 110 percent devaluation of the cordoba currency which 
sent prices of consumer goods and services skyrocketing 
enrique bolanos the brother of nicolas bolanos called the 
confiscations an act of vengeance by the sandinistas over what 
happened at the assembly in matagalpa 
enrique bolanos a former chairman of the superior council of 
private enterprise had some of his properties in the eastern 
province of masaya confiscated by the sandinistas some years ago 
in june 1988 the sandinista government confiscated the san 
antonio sugar plantation and mills one of nicaraguas largest 
industries sugar is also an important export item

house republicans are seeking to turn a 
liability into an asset with the case of donald e lukens the ohio 
gop lawmaker convicted on charges involving sex with a 16yearold 
girl 
the republican conference on wednesday made a preemptive strike 
voting to force an ethics investigation of their colleague before 
democrats could do the same or the ethics committee did so on its 
own 
now they are looking to democrats to spotlight some of their own 
colleagues as ethics violators 
i think its an appropriate kind of step to suggest that the 
other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of tough thing 
that is involved in what our conference did said rep robert 
walker rpa a member of the gop leadership 
democrats dont seem to be biting 
there is no calculation that one can properly make that ethical 
problems or concerns are more emphatic in one party than another 
said speaker thomas s foley dwash 
thats absolute nonsense and the public knows it and its i 
think a very unfortunate attempt to try to achieve a political 
point apparently at the expense of one of their own members 
newly elected democratic caucus chairman steny hoyer of maryland 
was more blunt im sure democrats are prepared to kick out their 
own members who are convicted of sexually abusing children 
republicans have sought to make ethics a primary issue in the 
101st congress hoping to capitalize politically on the allegations 
of ethical misconduct against former house speaker jim wright 
dtexas and former majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
but the next two cases likely to come before the ethics panel 
feature republicans lukens and minority whip newt gingrich of 
georgia who is alleged to have set up an improper partnership to 
promote a book he wrote 
lukens was convicted may 30 in franklin county ohio of 
contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a minor after a 
jury found he had sex with the girl at his columbus apartment last 
november lukens 58 and divorced is appealing the conviction 
democrats believe that in political terms lukens case has in 
some ways been more objectionable to the public than the allegations 
involving wright and coelho which involved complicated financial 
transactions 
local and state republican officials in ohio clearly embarrassed 
by lukens have called on him to resign and warned he would not be 
renominated to his seat in 1990 
traditionally members convicted in court of wrongdoing are dealt 
with speedily by the ethics committee which can apply sanctions 
ranging from a reprimand to expulsion from the house 
but lukens has vowed to fight the charges and his spokesman said 
wednesdays action was welcome because an ethics probe could once 
and for all bring forth the truth about this entire episode 
the spokesman william jarrell said lukens was hampered in court 
because he was not permitted to cast doubt on the motives and 
credibility of the girl and her mother who were lukens accusers 
now well be able to bring forth the background and the motives 
he said

decision wednesday that gave constitutional protection to the 
burning of the american flag as a form of political protest 
from justice william j brennans majority opinion 
after publicly burning an american flag as a means of political 
protest gregory lee johnson was convicted of desecrating a flag in 
violation of texas law this case presents the question whether his 
conviction is consistent with the first amendment we hold that it 
is not 
texas claims that its interest in preventing breaches of the 
peace justifies johnsons conviction however no disturbance of the 
peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because of johnsons 
burning of the flag we have not permitted the government to assume 
that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot but 
have instead required careful consideration of the actual 
circumstances surrounding such expression 
johnson was prosecuted because he knew that his politically 
charged expression would cause serious offense if he had burned the 
flag as a means of disposing of it because it was dirty or torn he 
would not have been convicted the texas law is thus not aimed at 
protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances 
but is designed instead to protect it only against impairments that 
would cause serious offense to others 
nothing in our opinion should be taken to suggest that one is 
free to steal a flag so long as one later uses it to communicate an 
idea we also emphasize that johnson was prosecuted only for flag 
desecration not for trespass disorderly conduct or arson 
if there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment 
it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea 
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or 
disagreeable 
we can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag 
that waving ones own no better way to counter a flagburners 
message than by saluting the flag that burns no surer means of 
preserving the dignity even of the flag that burned than by as one 
witness here did according its remains a respectful burial 
we do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration for 
in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem 
represents 
from justice anthony m kennedys concurring opinion 
the hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not 
like we make them because they are right right in the sense that 
the law and the constitution as we see them compel the result 
it is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who 
hold it in contempt 
from chief justice william h rehnquists dissenting opinion 
for more than 200 years the american flag has occupied a unique 
position as the symbol of our nation a uniqueness that justifies a 
governmental prohibition against flag burning in a way johnson did 
here 
no other american symbol has been as universally honored as the 
flag both congress and the state have enacted numerous laws 
regulating misuse of the american flag with the exception of alaska 
and wyoming all the states now have statutes prohibiting the 
burning of the flag 
millions and millions of americans regard it with an almost 
mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social political or 
philosophical beliefs they may have i cannot agree that the first 
amendment invalidates an act of congress and the laws of 48 of the 
50 states which make criminal the public burning of the flag 
from justice john paul stevens dissenting opinion 
a countrys flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and national 
unity it also signifies the ideas that characterize the society 
that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has 
animated the growth and power of those ideas 
it is a symbol of freedom of equal opportunity of religious 
tolerance and of goodwill for other peoples who share our 
aspirations the symbol carries its message to dissidents both at 
home and abroad who may have no interest at all in our national 
unity or survival 
the value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured conceivably 
that value will be enhanced by the courts conclusion that our 
national commitment to free expression is so strong that even the 
united states as ultimate guarantor of that freedom is without power 
to prohibit the desecration of its unique symbol but i am 
unpersuaded 
the creation of a federal right to post bulletin boards and 
graffiti on the washington monument might enlarge the market for 
free expression but at a cost i would not pay similarly in my 
considered judgment sanctioning the public desecration of the flag 
will tarnish its value both for those who cherish the ideas for 
which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of 
martyrdom by burning it

irate members of congress are moving to ensure 
the exxon corp pays the full cost of cleaning up the alaska oil 
spill 
sen harry reid dnev pleaded wednesday for fellow senators to 
support a law that would deny exxon a tax writeoff for expenses of 
cleaning up the spill the largest in the nations history 
i do not want to tell my constituents that the american people 
owe exxon the biggest polluter in history millions of dollars in a 
tax rebate in return for destroying the environment and raising 
prices at the gas pumps reid told the senate finance committee 
reid is chief sponsor of a bill that would prohibit exxon from 
deducting costs of cleaning up the spill unless the federal 
government certified the cleanup meets standards of the clean water 
act or other federal laws 
in the house rep robert g torricelli dnj said wednesday 
he and 61 congressional colleagues have asked the federal government 
to sue exxon and the alyeska pipeline service for the cost of 
environmental damage to prince william sound and the surrounding 
alaskan wilderness 
the congressmen said in a letter to interior secretary manuel 
lujan jr and the justice department that the government shouuld get 
a full recovery of the money necessary to restore or replace the 
lost resources 
my interest is not simple vengeance torricelli said it is 
rather providing the only genuine incentive that will ever prevent 
the repetition of the valdez tragedy 
exxon has been criticized for what some have called a slowness to 
respond to the march 24 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude 
oil from the exxon valdez tanker into prince william sound 
exxon has spent more than 200 million to clean up the mess 
company officials said wednesday an undetermined portion will be 
reimbursed by insurance and the uninsured expenses may be deducted 
from taxable income as a cost of doing business 
since the top federal corporate tax rate is 34 percent the 
effect will be for taxpayers to pay 34 percent of the uninsured 
expense 
the bush administration opposes the senate bill to restrain 
exxons ability to write off the cleanup costs 
the bill would violate the fundamental principle of business 
taxation that a taxpayers ordinary and necessary business expenses 
may be deducted in computing net income kenneth w gideon 
assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy told the finance 
committee 
charles j dibona president of american petroleum institute 
which represents the nations major oil companies said the bill 
sends the message that whatever cleanup costs a taxpayer incurs 
he runs the risk of having them denied at some future time because 
he does not or cannot meet standards determined by the 
commandant of the coast guard or the administrator of the 
enviromental protection agency 
sen ted stevens ralaska said he supports reids bill but 
ackowledged that existing environmental laws contain no objective 
standards for determining whether a cleanup was proper 
the committee did not indicate when it will act on the bill 
also on wednesday the major oil companies criticized a house 
panels move to ban oil exploration in alaskas bristol bay and 
areas off the coasts of california florida and the midatlantic 
states 
the american petroleum institute a trade group of big oil 
companies called the action unwise unjustified and ultimately 
counterproductive to the countrys energy security environmental 
groups applauded the proposed bans 
the house appropriations subcommittee on the interior voted 
wednesday to stop oil companies from drilling in bristol bay for one 
year on lease blocks purchased from the interior department last 
october about 95 million was invested in the leases

with a single sweep of the regulatory hand the 
environmental protection agency has cut in half the amount of toxic 
chemicals that are released into the air soil and water from 
industrial plants 
its not that the volume of chemical pollutants is any less but 
as of today some 12 billion pounds nearly 54 percent of all toxic 
chemicals released in 1987 no longer are considered toxic 
the epa on wednesday officially declared sodium sulfate as not 
posing health concerns that warrant it being in the company of such 
toxic chemicals as sulfuric acid chlorine lead and a variety of 
carcinogens 
the chemical which is widely used as an agent and byproduct in a 
variety of manufacturing processes including the production of 
paper glass and detergents dominated the statistics announced 
recently on toxic chemical releases from industrial facilities 
it was the reason that chemical discharges released into water 
dwarfed releases into the air and soil it was why california was 
ranked as the state with by far the greatest amount of toxic 
chemical releases and it was why the total volume of releases 
nationwide exceeded 225 billion pounds instead of closer to 105 
billion pounds 
the reclassification of sodium sulfate may be only the first of 
several such actions the epa also is reviewing whether two other 
chemicals high on the toxic release list aluminum oxide and 
ammonium sulfate should be taken off the list 
aluminum oxide accounted for 24 billion pounds of toxic chemical 
releases by industry in 1987 nearly 11 percent of the total and 
ammonium sulfate accounted for 918 million pounds about 4 percent 
of the total according to the epa 
the epa has proposed deleting aluminum oxide from the list 
although no final action has been taken it has not yet responded to 
a petition by the chemical industry to delete ammonium sulfate said 
robert israel an epa official involved in the petition process 
because the epa has taken sodium sulfate off its toxic chemical 
list companies will not have to include releases of the chemical 
into the air water and soil when they produce their release 
statistics for 1988 at the end of this month 
the chemical industry had petitioned the epa to reclassify sodium 
sulfate arguing that there is no evidence the chemical poses a 
significant health threat 
the action by the epa had been expected the agency staff in 
april had recommended that sodium sulfate be reclassified as being 
nontoxic due to an apparent absence of significant toxicity 
concerns about the chemical 
israel said in an interview the agency concluded that sodium 
sulfate did not meet the health or environmental toxicity 
criteria for a chemical to be on the toxic list 
the absence of sodium sulfate from the epa toxic chemical list 
which now includes 327 chemicals will result in significant 
changes in the national profile on toxic releases agency officials 
said 
for example the state with the most toxic chemical releases was 
california with 58 billion pounds more than a fourth of all the 
releases in the country but most of the discharges were of sodium 
sulfate with the chemical no longer classified as toxic california 
drops from being the biggest polluter to ninth according to the epa 
water discharges were the most common form of toxic chemical 
releases in 1987 largely because threefourths of all releases of 
sodium sulfate were into surface water without sodium sulfate 
water releases will rank far behind toxic chemical discharges into 
the air which now assumes the no 1 spot accounting for about 
onefourth of all such releases from industrial plants

harlan berk doesnt like to think of the dusty 
diminutive egyptian mummy for sale at his downtown coin and antique 
shop as a body 
its wrapped and i try to think of it as a piece of 
antiquity said berk standing near the plexiglas table that for a 
month has been the resting place for the ancient remains of a woman 
i try to look at the artwork on the outer wrappings and not focus 
on the more macabre aspects 
hes asking 50000 for it adding the market will tell me if 
im right or wrong 
he hopes to sell the mummy to a museum or university 
john larson archivist and egyptologist at the university of 
chicagos oriental institute museum said it is illegal to export 
mummies from egypt without egyptian government permission 
but until well into this century more laissez faire rules 
applied 
berk an antique dealer said he bought the mummy from an 
illinois family a month ago and considers himself free to sell it 
at his shop he said he was told that a family member brought the 
mummy back from egypt about 60 years ago 
the mummy at 4feet 1inch looks smaller than lifesize as it 
rests on the table in a temperaturecontrolled room 
on the front are remnants of the pinkish paint and gold leaf used 
for decoration with some pictures of egyptian gods including horus 
the god of heaven and osiris the god of vegetation and later of 
death 
the pictures tell a story of life death and rebirth paths the 
longdead womans loved ones likely envisioned for her berk said 
we do have respect for the individual even though shes been 
deceased for several thousand years 
larson said he understands why some are disturbed by the sale of 
human remains particulary those of american indians only a couple 
generations old 
i dont think any of us would want to see our grandparents 
bodies on display in a museum he said 
but the time and distance involved for the mysterious egyptians 
seem to make viewing them less distasteful 
letting the rest of the world study and enjoy these things only 
creates greater appreciation of the egyptian culture berk said

a handwriting expert examined betting slips 
contained in baseballs report on pete rose and concluded that his 
handwriting is on wager slips involving cincinnati reds games the 
associated press learned wednesday 
in addition the new york times reported in thursdays editions 
that the slips have roses fingerprints on them as well as being in 
his handwriting 
rose is claiming the sheets are forgeries a federal law 
enforcement official who asked not to be identified was quoted by 
the times as saying he says he didnt write them but were as 
confident as we could be that he did 
the betting slips may support allegations that rose who holds 
the major league baseball record for career hits bet on his own 
team if proven the offense would mean an automatic lifetime ban 
from the game 
rose who has sued commissioner a bartlett giamatti in state 
court has maintained he never bet on baseball his lawyers also 
have said that baseballs report on gambling allegations written by 
john m dowd was based on hearsay and the word of convicted 
criminals 
however a source familiar with baseballs investigation told the 
associated press that the betting slips and the experts 
verification of roses handwriting on them give baseball tangible 
evidence of roses betting the handwriting expert was hired by 
baseball as part of its investigation 
roses lawyers sued giamatti on monday in attempts to block a 
hearing next monday with the commissioner in new york hamilton 
county common pleas judge norbert nadel will consider roses request 
for a temporary restraining order during a hearing thursday 
the betting slips were revealed as part of roses lawsuit against 
giamatti and currently are in the possession of federal authorities 
who have investigated rose on tax matters 
roses lawyers allege that paul janszen who claims to have run 
bets for rose stole three pieces of paper from the home of the 
reds manager the papers are described as the pete rose betting 
sheets in dowds report 
baseball officials declined wednesday to discuss the handwriting 
analysis roses lawyers indicated in their court filing that they 
wanted an expert of their own to examine the sheets as well 
roses lawsuit attacks the reliability of one of the betting 
slips the lawsuit says the first of the three sheets purports to 
set forth a bet made on an april 9 1987 game where cincinnati 
played at montreal 
incredibly dowd places significant emphasis on this sheet of 
paper even though april 9 was an offday for the reds and while 
they played in montreal the previous day the game was in cincinnati 
and not in montreal the suit said 
roses lawyers make no mention of the other two betting slips 
lawyer reuven j katz declined to answer any questions about the 
betting slips or the handwriting analysis 
rose speaking after the reds lost a doubleheader to the braves 
in atlanta was informed of the reports on the handwriting and 
fingerprints 
thats not true he said im not commenting on anything 
like that any other baseball questions i thought it was in the 
courts right now ill say it again im not going to talk about 
it

the governments budget deficit is mounting at 
a slower pace this year than it did in fiscal 1988 due to stronger 
federal income tax collections so far in 1989 
for the first eight months of the 1989 fiscal year which began 
oct 1 the budget deficit totaled 11332 billion 118 percent 
less than the 12843 billion shortfall counted at the same time 
last year the treasury department reported wednesday 
analysts say the figures suggest this years shortfall is likely 
to undershoot both the bush administrations projection for a 1633 
billion deficit and the congressional budget offices estimate of 
159 billion 
for all of last fiscal year the deficit totaled 1551 billion 
the treasury report showed the government posted a 2547 billion 
budget deficit last month 128 percent more red ink than in may 
1988 and higher than most analysts had expected 
the may shortfall followed a record surplus of 4057 billion in 
april when government coffers were fattened by an unusually large 
surge in income tax payments 
last month revenues were up 191 percent from may 1988 to 7112 
billion while spending was up 174 percent from a year earlier to 
9658 billion 
analysts say revenues this year have been running ahead of 
projections due to strong personal income tax collections generated 
in the wake of the 1986 overhaul of the tax code 
even though we had slightly wider red ink in may it does 
appear as if the budget for the entire year will show visible 
improvement over last year said economist william v sullivan of 
dean witter reynolds inc 
sullivan estimated the fiscal 1989 deficit will total 130 
billion to 135 billion and said most of the improvement comes from 
the bulge in personal income tax receipts in april he said the 
surge in tax payments occurred because people shifted some of their 
income from 1987 to 1988 when the top tax rate dropped 
economist samuel kahan of kleinwort benson government securities 
inc in chicago said that although mays deficit was higher than 
expected it looks like the trend in the deficit is working its 
way down slowly 
kahan estimated the 1989 deficit would be around 135 billion to 
145 billion 
as usual the governments largest spending category last month 
was the military defense spending in may totaled 2433 billion and 
reached 19296 billion for the first eight months of the fiscal 
year that was up 23 percent from the same point a year earlier 
other large spending categories were 
social security 1915 billion in may and 14753 billion so 
far in fiscal 1989 up 58 percent from a year earlier 
other programs in the department of health and human services 
1522 billion in may and 11234 billion so far in fiscal 1989 up 
69 percent from a year earlier 
interest payments on the national debt 2006 billion in may 
and 15367 billion so far in fiscal 1989 up 118 percent from a 
year earlier

the us grain market will remain open to china 
despite further tightening of relations in the wake of beijings 
crackdown on prodemocracy forces says agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter 
i would not see that in any way affecting the present status of 
agricultural transactions either actual or potential yeutter 
told reporters on wednesday 
earlier secretary of state james a baker iii said the united 
states deeply regretted chinas execution of three protesters but 
added that no additional us action is being contemplated 
baker said president bush believes the sanctions already in place 
are the proper response to the bloody crackdown by the beijing 
regime and the arrests of more than 1600 demonstrators 
asked about bushs order curtailing contacts by us officials 
with their chinese counterparts and suspending all highlevel 
official visits to china yeutter said he didnt think that would 
have much effect on the agricultural trade situation 
not in terms of commercial transactions between the two 
countries yeutter said it certainly could have some effect on 
the conduct of governmenttogovernment programs of course 
including such issues as potential chinese membership in the gatt 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
but while the commercial sales of us grain to china are 
expected to be unaffected by bushs orders yeutter said programs 
for extending further credit or subsidized sales of wheat to beijing 
are another matter 
there is nothing in the presidents statements to date nor 
will there be in the future that will affect the fundamental 
openness of the american marketplace yeutter said 
however when speaking about credit or the subsidy provisions of 
the export enhancement program for china thats a separate 
question and will be addressed as the situation requires he said 
china is expected to buy about 14 billion worth of us farm 
commodities in the fiscal year that began last oct 1 compared with 
613 million in 198788 according to agriculture department 
estimates that would compare with 79 billion forecast for japans 
purchases traditionally the largest and 34 billion for the 
soviet union

farmers continue to be the major buyers of 
agricultural land according to a preliminary report by the 
agriculture department 
farm owners and operators were involved in 57 percent of all 
farmland purchases in the year that ended on feb 1 the report 
said nonfarmers participated in 29 percent of the sales no 
further breakdown was provided however 
about 87 percent of the farmland sold was expected to remain in 
agricultural use at least five years after purchase 2 percent in 
forestry and 11 percent in other uses 
about twothirds of the sales involved credit financing down 
substantially from 90 percent in the early 1980s when farmland 
prices were their highest the report said wednesday 
the report by the departments economic research service said 
farmland values through 1989 and early 1990 are expected to 
continue increasing at an average rate slightly above this past 
years 6 percent 
higher farm income lower inflationadjusted interest rates on 
real estate loans and moderate growth in inflation were cited as 
reasons for the forecast one report last month predicated that 
farmland values could rise an average of 7 percent to 9 percent in 
1989 compared with the 6 percent gain last year

civil aviation and related businesses pump more 
than half a trillion dollars a year into the nations economy 
according to an aviation industry study 
the study released wednesday by the partnership for improved air 
travel says the industry contributed 522 billion to the economy in 
1987 the latest year for which complete data is available 
since then rapid growth has continued with a doubling of orders 
for civilian aircraft partnership officials said at a news 
conference 
the study is part of the groups effort to convince congress and 
local governments of the need for more airports and other facilities 
to serve the growing aviation industry air travel has doubled since 
the industry was deregulated in 1978 
the partnership was formed last year by airlines airplane 
manufacturers unions local government representatives and others 
interested in expanding the air transportation system 
the figures in the study add up everything from the manufacture 
of airliners to money paid for haircuts at barbershops near 
airports partnership officials said they included transactions 
made possible by the existence of aviation such as purchases made 
at destinations by vacationers and other travelers 
officials acknowledged however the study does not factor in 
some of the negative impact of aviation such as the cost of noise 
pollution abatement at busy airports or losses from accidents 
the report compiled by wilbur smith associates of columbia 
sc says aviation and associated businesses employ 8 million 
people or 73 percent of the nations workforce with a 155 
billion payroll 
the industrys contribution to the gross national product was 
estimated at 254 billion in 1987 or 56 percent of the total gnp 
this figure does not count the haircuts and other indirect impacts 
of aviation the industry claims 
herbert d kelleher partnership president said the united 
states has the safest and most efficient aviation system in the 
world but more construction is needed to accommodate rapidly 
increasing air travel 
the problem is that while we are building twice as many planes 
to accommodate twice as many passengers kelleher said we are 
failing to build the aviation infrastructure rapidly enough to keep 
planes and people moving efficiently 
he said the study is the first to cover all of the countrys 
16949 civil airports as well as airplane manufacturers suppliers 
trade associations travel agents retail business and air cargo 
the study includes a statebystate analysis of the impact of the 
industry but the conclusions for each state are identical 
expansion of the states aviation industry and air 
transportation system is vital to the economic health and 
international competitiveness of the state 
aviationrelated expenditures for each state are in nearly direct 
proportion to the states population

that while men and women may have been created equal one definitely 
takes longer in the bathroom 
the state assembly gave final approval wednesday to a potty 
parity bill that would require new buildings to have as many 
toilets for women as for men 
its been suggested that if we cant find equity here can we 
find it anyplace asked assemblywoman helen marshall the bills 
sponsor 
the bill dubbed a squatters bill of rights and a 
backstall method to enact an equal rights amendment was 
approved 1401 
the dissenter assemblyman kemp hannon the no 2 man in the 
assemblys republican minority said women should have more toilets 
than men because they need more time in the bathroom 
he cited a cornell university undergraduate study that called for 
women to have six toilets for every four that men have including 
urinals 
marshall drew laughs when she noted that the same cornell study 
found that a mans biological needs are cared for within 45 
seconds as compared to a woman who takes 79 seconds 
nonetheless marshall said the law would be a firm step toward 
equity the bill has already passed the state senate there was no

china executed three men wednesday and up to 17 
others were condemned to die for their roles in studentled protests 
that challenged the power of the communist party 
the executions in shanghai were carried out despite appeals for 
clemency by president bush and other western leaders 
premier li peng denounced the foreign criticism 
he told visiting foreign secretary humayun khan of pakistan that 
most of the millions of chinese who took part nationwide in marches 
sitins and hunger strikes for a freer society would be treated 
leniently even if they had extremist opinions 
but li said the tiny minority of criminals will be punished 
according to the law 
the meeting was the first toplevel contact with a foreign 
delegation since the crackdown began june 34 when the army fired 
on students and supporters in beijing to end their prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
more than 1600 arrests have been reported nationwide since and 
the nations highest court has urged lower courts to deal swiftly 
and severely with protestrelated cases 
so far 28 people have been condemned to death the three who 
were executed the 17 who were sentenced on wednesday and eight 
others who were previously sentenced to death 
the shanghai men were convicted of setting a train on fire on 
june 6 after it plowed into a barricade set up by protesters 
killing six people 
they were shot to death wednesday after shanghais highest court 
rejected their appeals a spokesman at the citys foreign affairs 
office said he said he did not know other details and refused to 
give his name 
the national television news reported the executions which an 
official at the citys foreign affairs office on thursday said were 
carried out at an execution ground due to an error in translation 
an official at the office was understood wednesday to have said the 
three were executed before a crowd 
the men were xu guoming a brewery worker yan xuerong a radio 
factory worker and bian hanwu who was unemployed 
beijing radio said 45 people who seriously endangered public 
order were tried in front of an audience of 10000 people in jinan 
in eastern chinas shandong province 
it did not give details of their alleged crimes but said some 
were given the death penalty others were given death sentences 
suspended for two years with the possibility of being commuted to 
life in prison the radio reported 
an editor at the staterun jinan daily said 17 of the 45 were 
given death sentences but said he did not know if the figure 
included those given twoyear reprieves 
the public trial in jinan and executions in shanghai underscored 
chinas emphasis on using the death penalty as a deterrent 
china does not release figures on executions and not all are 
reported in the official media by western count more than 10000 
people were executed in a period of several years after an 
anticrime drive began in 1983 
death sentences usually are carried out by a bullet to the back 
of the head they are sometimes commuted to life in prison but there 
is no record of a sentence being overturned on appeal in communist 
china 
li defended chinas actions as necessary to put down a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
when china is in difficulties for the time being it sees 
clearly who are true friends and who are false ones the 
television news quoted him as saying 
the government did not immediately respond to bushs suspension

americans stand a greater health risk from 
eliminating fruits and vegetables from their diets than they do from 
pesticide residue on the produce food researchers told a house 
agriculture subcommittee 
the real issue is the risk of pesticide use as compared to 
other risks in the food environment sanford miller dean of the 
school of biomedical sciences at the university of texas science 
center said wednesday 
he said food experts agree the risks of exposure to the low level 
of pesticides found on food are significantly less than those 
associated with the pests they kill 
moreover he said there is the question of the risk of 
reducing fruit and vegetable consumption in response to these 
concerns about pesticides 
miller was among 10 witnesses called before the subcommittee on 
domestic marketing consumer relations and nutrition subcommittee 
members said they wanted to reduce public fears about chemical 
residue on food 
as a result of the alar and chilean grape stories of early 
spring consumers lost their trust in the safety of fresh fruits and 
vegetables generally said rep charles hatcher dga 
subcommittee chairman 
ninetynine point nine percent of the food we have gets 
blacklisted because of the 01 percent that is bad agriculture 
committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas complained 
hatcher said it was ironic that consumers have cut back on fresh 
fruit and vegetable consumption even as the national research 
council of the national academy of sciences has recommended people 
should eat more plant foods 
dr sushma palmer of the academy said a study issued in march 
recommends that people eat five or more onehalf cup servings of a 
combination of vegetables and fruits every day especially green and 
yellow vegetables and citrus fruits 
she said extensive studies around the world have shown that 
people who regularly eat a lot of plant foods have low risk of 
hardening of the arteries of the heart which is the leading cause 
of death in the united states 
the reason for this finding is not fully known although the 
lowfat content of these foods is clearly beneficial said palmer 
palmer said there is not much information on whether eating foods 
that have been sprayed with pesticides cause disease but limited 
data in humans thus far suggest that no adverse effects result from 
the ingestion of small amounts of these agents in foods 
furthermore our committee determined that the potential small 
increased risk of these somewhat uncommon tumors that might result 
from increased exposures to pesticides in the general population 
would be greatly outweighed by the potential benefits to be expected 
from greater fruit and vegetable consumption she said 
another house subcommittee and one in the senate are gathering 
testimony on legislation that has been introduced to strengthen the 
standards the environmental protection agency uses to determine what 
chemicals could be used in pesticides 
stephen wood of the new england fruit growers council on the 
environment called the reaction to alar on apples that led the 
manufacturer to remove it from the market absurdly inflated 
national panic that he did not want to see duplicated in 
legislation 
he said growers need to have a range of pesticides to choose from 
as they move away from chemicals 
the sort of trial by media and marketplace that we have just 
observed is devastating to the effort to achieve environmentally 
sound methods of production wood said if this trend continues 
growers will begin to choose chemicals according to vague 
anticipation to the public will

the house ways and means committee turning 
thumbsdown on the first proposed tax increase of the year is using 
a deficitreduction bill to increase spending for social programs 
the package includes higher spending for welfare and childrens 
services and authority for social security recipients to earn 360 
more next year and 240 more in 1991 before losing a portion of 
their benefits 
in a second day of work on a catchall package wednesday the 
committee rejected a recommendation from its humanresources 
subcommittee and defeated a proposed increase in the employers tax 
that finances unemployment compensation the vote in a closeddoor 
session was 1817 against the increase with rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of the committee voting on the losing side 
the bush administration had expressed solid opposition to the tax 
increase which would have cost employers 106 billion over five 
years at the federal level and automatically boosted their state 
taxes as well 
rep tom downey dny acting chairman of the subcommittee that 
proposed the increase said he will not give up the fight for the 
boost and an attached improvement in jobless benefits he told 
reporters the committee was simply signaling opposition to any kind 
of tax increase at this point in the budget negotiations 
the committee voted to raise by a total of 600 over two years 
the annual amount social security recipients may earn without losing 
part of their benefits the new limits 9720 in 1990 and 10440 
the following year 
for each 3 earned above those levels the beneficiary would lose 
1 of social security 
the bill does not affect the lower earnings limit that applies to 
retirees 62 63 or 64 that ceiling will rise under current law from 
6480 this year to 6840 next year 
persons 70 and older also would be unaffected they could 
continue to earn an unlimited amount without losing any pension 
benefit 
the committee also agreed to raise a special social security 
minimum benefit for retirees who worked long years at low wages the 
net effect would be to increase to about 5676 the special 5256 
minimum benefit for a person who worked 30 years and retired at age 
65 
while the minimumbenefit increase would help only the poorest 
recipients of social security the boost in the earnings limit would 
help those at the other end of the income scale 
the congressional budget office estimates that in 1986 only 10 
percent of the people between 65 and 69 and eligible for social 
security gave up a part of their pension because of the earnings 
limit more than 40 percent had total income over 42000 
under present law a person age 65 through 69 may earn up to 
8880 and still draw a full social security benefit for each 2 
earned above that level the worker must give up 1 in benefits 
starting next year the giveback is only 1 for every 3 earned above 
the maximum 
other parts of the package approved wednesday would increase 
slightly benefits under the supplemental security income program for 
poor and disabled individuals boost grants to the states for such 
social services as meals on wheels and raise spending for foster 
care 
the legislation would strip the social security administration 
from the department of health and human services the new 
independent agency would be governed by a threemember board 
appointed by the president an executive director named by the board 
would oversee daytoday operations

an emergency spending bill congress has been 
debating since april has run into new trouble that threatens to 
cause cuts in some veterans programs as lawmakers prepare to leave 
for their fourth of july holiday 
the house in a surprise 218201 vote sent the bill back to 
committee wednesday house leaders immediately asked the senate to 
hold new talks in search of a compromise acceptable to president 
bush and democrats 
with warnings of service cuts at veterans hospitals and with the 
senate scheduled to begin a twoweek recess on friday there was 
increasing pressure on congress to complete the task and leaders 
searched for another way to keep veterans programs running while 
other subjects continued in dispute 
the key dispute is over an 821 million drug law enforcement 
amendment which house democrats were trying to push past the senate 
and president bush who has threatened a veto 
by beating the 35 billion emergency spending bill in an early 
procedural vote republicans were able to avoid voting on the 
antidrug spending which is opposed by the president as wasteful 
despite its political popularity 
all but five republicans voted against the bill and 52 democrats 
joined the gop lawmakers partly because of a republican memo 
highlighting pork barrel spending in the measure 
the tally was a surprise defeat for the newly installed 
democratic leadership speaker thomas s foley had confidently 
predicted they would prevail 
there are going to be times when the unexpected occurs we will 
have our ups and downs said house majority whip william h gray 
iii dpa who said leaders had not pressured democrats to keep in 
line 
the bill under congressional budget rules is supposed to 
provide money only for dire emergencies which the government 
must attend to before sept 30 the end of the current fiscal year 
there is no disagreement over the largest single item 12 
billion for the department of veterans affairs to cover a shortfall 
in money for medical care compensation and pensions and in other 
areas 
congressional leaders wednesday night began exploring a 
shortterm bill for only veterans programs to prevent major 
disruptions according to democratic and republican aides who spoke 
on condition they not be identified 
final details were still being worked out but such a bill would 
carry the veterans programs through july 22 giving congress extra 
time to iron out the drug and other disputes the aides said 
nearly 900 million would be added to the federal guaranteed 
student loan program 342 million to cover the cost of fighting 
last years widespread forest fires and 423 million for foster 
care and adoption 
the food stamp program would be increased 225 million aid to 
the unemployed 90 million and refugee assistance 100 million 
however influential lawmakers also used the mustpass 
legislation as a vehicle for cherished spending projects for their 
constituents for example senate appropriations committee chairman 
robert c byrd dwva included 75 million to rebuild a 
radiotelescope in his state 
the white house said wednesday that bush would sign the bill 
even with most of those constituent projects if the drug money were 
left out and some budget gimmicks which threatened future excess 
spending were deleted 
the gimmicks included moving the dates on paychecks for some 
federal workers up one day so the money would count against this 
fiscal year instead of fiscal 1990 another accounting change would 
allow congress to dodge agreedupon spending limits for housing and 
related agencies

soldiers armed with blowtorches cut 
up the gun barrels of battle tanks while other troops ripped the 
frames apart to demonstrate how serious this country is about 
disarmament 
this is not an empty show put on for the worlds benefit 
col joachim nicolaus said wednesday during a tour for western 
journalists we are holding true to the intention to destroy these 
weapons and you are witnesses to the fulfillment of this pledge 
officials showed reporters some of the 600 mediumsized tanks the 
government says it plans to dismantle as part of a unilateral 
decision to trim its conventional arsenal 
east germany in january announced it was reducing its armed 
forces by 600 tanks 10000 troops and 50 combat aircraft it plans 
to complete the cuts by next year according to east german figures 
the countrys armed forces have 3140 battle tanks 
nicolaus commander of the two bases along east germanys 
southeastern border with poland said more than 130 tanks had been 
brought to the site to be scrapped or converted for civilian use 
about 150 of the 36ton tanks will be modified for use in heavy 
industry mainly in the nations coal mining operations said col 
helmut erdmann a military spokesman he said the remaining 450 
soviettype t55a tanks will be destroyed 
some spare parts and sophisticated equipment will be salvaged he 
said 
reporters saw more than 11 tanks in various stages of demolition 
at the first base near charlottenhof 
huge cranes lifted the tanks sixton turrets from their armored 
frames dumping them in neat rows where soldiers stripped them of 
their inchthick antiradiation interior coating 
other soldiers removed machine guns while their comrades used 
acetylene torches to cut 15footlong 100mm gun barrels into small 
pieces 
at the second installation near the town of ostritz soldiers 
were busy in workshops melting down machine guns and breaking up the 
thickly armored tank bodies into small chunks the ostritz facility 
finishes the job begun near charlottenhof 
piles of metal and other tank parts were scattered across both 
compounds near a jumble of former gun carriages a sign read 
cannon junk 
erdmann said most of the tanks were five to 15 years old 
were not just throwing out ancient clunkers he said 
these tanks still have a lot of mileage left in them 
olaf windisch a 19yearold soldier from the industrial city of 
leipzig said he had mixed emotions about the demolition 
you put a lot of work in keeping these tanks in combat shape 
and you develop an affection for them the same as people get 
attached to cars said windisch wiping perspiration from his brow 
after removing armor plating from the inside of a gun turret 
but i grew up in a time of peace and i dont want to see war 
im glad were getting rid of some weapons 
commandant nicolaus said he had seen some difficult moments among 
crews selected to consign their tanks to the junk pile 
ive seen tank commanders stroke the sides of their machines 
with tears in their eyes he said that was their tank and they 
didnt want to part with it

celebrated novelist mario vargas llosa says he 
is bowing out of the presidential race in this troubled andean 
nation blaming political wrangling within the centerright 
coalition that has been backing him 
vargas llosa the frontrunner for march 1990 elections and among 
latin americas leading writers made his decision known in a letter 
to leaders of the two principal parties that comprise his democratic 
front coalition 
also wednesday the government for the first time appealed for 
foreign help to fight maoist shining path guerrillas whose latest 
ambush the military said left 15 soldiers and 20 rebels dead in a 
cocaineproducing jungle region 
vargas llosa 53 criticized the mediocre and petty motives 
of some within his coalition to raise their own interests above 
those of the nation 
in his letter read during a television broadcast vargas llosa 
said he was withdrawing because of the rivalry between former 
president fernando belaunde terry of the popular action party and 
former lima mayor luis bedoya of the popular christian party 
belaunde and bedoya had been unable to agree on how to proceed in 
november municipal elections each party wanted to field its own 
candidates but vargas llosa argued that would divide the coalition 
this has obliged me to renounce my candidacy for the president 
of the republic vargas llosa said 
the collapse of the front could open the door in our country to 
totalitarian marxism or a bloody military adventure vargas llosa 
wrote 
miguel cruchaga secretary general of the liberty movement one 
group in the coalition said the decision appeared to be 
irrevocable but added we are going to mobilize public 
opinion so that vargas llosa is a candidate 
another leader of the liberty movement speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press that vargas llosas resignation 
appeared to be aimed at achieving undisputed leadership of the front 
vargas llosa who once described himself as a specialist in 
fantasies in dreams began his candidacy just 18 days ago in the 
southern city of arequipa his birthplace 
he was catapulted into the political arena after organizing a 
huge rally against populist president alan garcias plan to 
nationalize the banks 
garcias 4yearold government is beset by an economic crisis 
tripledigit annual inflation and the shining path insurgency now 
in its ninth year and plaguing much of peru 
garcia is prohibited by law from running for reelection and his 
partys presidential candidate former finance minister luis alva 
castro is given little chance of winning because of voter 
discontent with garcia 
nearly 15000 people have been killed in the conflict with 
shining path including rebels police soldiers public officials 
and highland peasants 
in addition to the soldiers slain in the jungle shining path 
guerrillas this week assassinated the mayor of a northeastern 
tourist town and killed five exsoldiers traveling on a bus in the 
andean highlands authorities said 
the mayor a member of garcias aprista party was the 46th 
killed in the last two years by guerrillas

fourteen babies have died of 
dehydration since the beginning of may in a hospital that cant 
afford air conditioning in its pediatric ward 
little relief is in sight from a heat wave that began last week 
and has sent many looking for medical help patients at juarez 
general hospital sometimes find conditions inside almost as 
unbearable as outside 
on wednesday more than a dozen infants being treated for 
dehydration endured the heat of the nonair conditioned tworoom 
pediatric ward as the temperature outside climbed to 105 degrees 
its unforgivable to have our children without air 
conditioning hospital director victor manuel jurado said as he 
wiped sweat off the forehead of a baby many times they get worse 
when they get here 
jurado said the staff juarez general where the 14 infants have 
died remains committed but can do little about the heat because 
the hospital simply cant afford air conditioning 
people have been reporting heatrelated medical problems all over 
the sunbaked city red cross officials said they are treating about 
24 cases of dehydration a day and the social security hospital 
reported it has admitted 137 patients suffering from heatrelated 
illnesses since the beginning of may 
most cases of infant dehydration are coupled with severe 
diarrhea a leading cause of infant death in the third world 
temperatures have topped 100 degrees daily since late last week 
and a high of 100 was expected today because the desert skies 
remain cloudless and humidity drops to the single digits or teens 
during daytime there is nothing in the air to diffuse the suns 
oppressive rays 
jurado said parents often make the mistake of waiting too long to 
take their children to the hospital 
people wait until the child is agonizing before bringing him 
here the doctor said they come to us in serious condition and 
many times there is little we can do 
officials in el paso and juarez are urging people to remain 
indoors from noon to 5 pm and drink lots of nonalcoholic beverages

a pentagon official boosting president bushs 
plan to build both the midgetman and mx missiles told congress some 
of the landbased nuclear missiles deployed by the united states 
must be able to survive a sudden nuclear attack 
the statement by paul wolfowitz the undersecretary of defense 
for policy was hailed wednesday as a step forward by congressional 
leaders who have criticized the president for failing to make a 
stronger case for his twomissile plan 
our landbased missile deterrent program is now being designed 
with the presidents proposal to basically have a deterrence against 
both a boltoutoftheblue attack as well as a first strike 
said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
in arguing for the twomissile plan wolfowitz said survivability 
is a consideration in all parts of the socalled nuclear triad the 
combination of land air and seabased nuclear weapons 
if some of our icbms were survivable this would provide among 
other things a hedge should vulnerabilities emerge in the bomber or 
submarine legs and in conjunction with the alert bombers and atsea 
ssbns the strongest possible deterrent against soviet preemptive 
strike wolfowitz told the senate panel 
he acknowledged deterrence has been the center of the debate over 
modernization of landbased missiles for almost two decades the 
administration concluded after a recent review that some of each 
portion of the triad must be survivable as part of that deterrent 
the nations bombers and submarines meet that goal and the 
emphasis is now on landbased missiles he said 
the bush administration is looking to protect landbased missiles 
in silos against a soviet strike during a crisis or even a 
conventional war and from a sudden attack in the absence of any 
hostilities other missiles would be mobile 
wolfowitz also told the panel verification and funds for the two 
missiles are necessary before the united states can reach a treaty 
agreement with the soviet union to limit mobile missiles 
bush told congressional leaders tuesday he was willing to abandon 
the mobilemissile ban at the negotiating table in geneva if it 
would strengthen his chance of winning congressional approval for 
his twomissile plan 
bush in april proposed spending 12 billion in fiscal 1990 on 
moving the existing multiplewarhead mx missiles from silos to 
railroad cars and another 100 million on the singlewarhead 
midgetman 
bushs decision tuesday received a favorable response from 
members of congress as did his decision to increase funds for the 
midgetman by about 1 billion 
while bush has tempered the opposition to the twomissile plan 
complaints about the b2 stealth program are growing in congress at 
about 500 million a copy the radarevading is the most expensive 
in history 
nunn raised the issue with gen larry welch air force chief of 
staff saying the problems with the earlier b1 budget constraints 
and concerns about not flying before we buy have contributed to 
the opposition 
welch argued that if the pentagon attempted flight tests of three 
or four planes while shutting down production the cost of the 
aircraft would increase significantly 
delaying production would cost 3 billion for one year welch 
said 
defense secretary dick cheney has already proposed pushing back 
production of the stealth bomber a year to 1993 and cutting almost 
41 billion from fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the plane

government officials say millions of dollars in 
losses in the governments largest program for insuring home 
mortgages are probably a temporary aberration that will improve 
as the housing market shores up 
the federal housing administration which insures 247 billion 
worth of mortgages under its program for singlefamily homes lost 
369 million in fiscal year 1988 which ended sept 30 and 1495 
million in the first six months of fiscal 1989 ended march 31 
according to the department of housing and urban development the 
fhas parent agency 
the net worth of the fund for the fhas most popular insurance 
program the mutual mortgage insurance fund fell from 34 billion 
at the end of fiscal 1987 to about 28 billion at the end of 1988 
and has declined below 27 billion so far in 1989 according to a 
hud financial officer who spoke wednesday on condition of anonymity 
the hud official termed the losses a serious situation but 
said the fund was not in danger of exhausting its net worth which 
would require congress to step in and rescue the selfsupporting 
program 
theres nothing we see at this stage that would put us in that 
position short of an absolutely severe regional downturn for a 
sustained fivetosixyear period the official said 
mortgage defaults particularly in southwestern states suffering 
from a depressed oil industry have largely helped fuel the losses 
according to government officials 
the official predicted continuing although diminishing losses 
the rest of this year and in 1990 with profitability returning in 
1991 
dennis j duquette of the general accounting office congress 
auditing wing said gao has examined the situation and im not so 
sure the public needs to be overly concerned we think its probably 
a temporary aberration 
he said fha holdings are well diversified with mortgages from all 
regions of the united states both ailing and healthy 
what we have here is not a savings and loan crisis he said 
a report in the new york times which quoted fha officials as 
saying the agency had only enough money to cover five months of 
claims is incorrect said william glavin a hud spokesman 
however duquette said the losses are a matter of concern for 
federal budget writers even if they do not threaten the mortgage 
programs net worth 
when the fha has a cash outflow because it pays out more for 
insurance claims than it collects in fees that adds to the budget 
deficit conversely when housing markets are hot and the fha is 
underwriting a lot of mortgages its fee income jumps and it 
actually helps to reduce the budget deficit that happened in 1987 
when the fha had a profit of 101 million according to the hud 
official 
the gao which tracks fha finances on a somewhat different 
accounting basis from what the agency uses showed a cash outflow of 
452 million in fiscal 1988 according to a report it issued last 
month the agency plans to issue a complete fha audit for 1988 in 
about a month duquette said 
the gao attributes the recent outflows to the cyclical nature of 
the fhas business said duquette 
the residential housing market peaked nationally in 1986 and 1987 
and so did insurance premium income unlike private mortgage 
insurors the fha collects all of its premium up front in a single 
fee rather than collecting it monthly over the early years of a 
mortgage 
also defaults generally peak two to three years after a mortgage 
is written so the fha is just now experiencing the after effects of 
its 198687 bulge in business which fell by 50 percent between 1987 
and 1988 defaults according to budget documents are expected to 
leap from 29 billion in 1986 to 66 billion this year

the dollar continued its slide against the japanese 
yen on thursday while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange 
inched down 
the dollar ended the days trading at 14140 yen down 355 yen 
from wednesdays 14495yen finish the currency opened at 14175 
yen and fell further while fluctuating between 14035 yen and 14175 
yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which gained 11181 points 
wednesday lost 2031 points or 006 percent finishing at 
3332497 the index which moved higher during the morning session 
suffered a setback in the afternoon 
dealers said the index fell as profittakers sold issues while 
others stepped off to the sidelines in the absence of 
marketaffecting incentives 
a trader said the market which suffered consecutive losses last 
week has not fully recovered its strength 
in currency dealings traders said the dollars decline followed 
sharp overnight retreats on overseas markets 
minori takeuchi a dealer with chemical bank in tokyo said the 
majority of investors have lost confidence in the us unit after 
recent market movements 
some trust investment companies and foreign investors bought 
the dollar when it approached 14025 yen but many participants sold 
it to reduce the amount of the currency at hand she said 
ms takeuchi said the market sold the dollar to avoid losing 
profits while watching how far the currency can fall to determine 
the market direction 
nothing has changed in the us economy so the dollar would 
eventually return to its previous level somewhere around 130 yen 
she said the market thinks this is what the central bank also 
intends 
kyodo news service quoted a central bank official as saying it is 
desirable for the yen to be a bit higher against the dollar to 
forestall inflation 
attributing the yens surge to dollarselling by speculative 
investors in the middle east chicago and asia the official said 
the yens further rise will help correct the trade imbalance between 
japan and the united states 
the bank of japan reportedly intervened in the market thursday to 
sell the us currency to keep it lower against the yen neither the 
action nor the amount were confirmed because the central bank does 
not comment on its monetary activities

a few major cable television operators are now 
the godfathers of the industry exacting tribute from startup 
companies and withholding programming from rural viewers a senate 
panel was told 
an increasingly prosperous cable industry has raised prices and 
stiffarmed microwave and home satellite dish companies that need 
programming while growing into a cable cosa nostra that can do 
as it pleases without fear of regulation or competition sen albert 
gore dtenn said wednesday 
since 1986 when a 1984 law deregulating cable was fully in 
place only about six new cable program networks have been 
successful and they all are at least partially owned by major cable 
system operators gore said at a senate communications subcommittee 
hearing on ownership of the cable tv industry 
in the wake of deregulation we have witnessed an extraordinary 
concentration of control and integration by cable operators and 
program services manifesting itself in blatantly anticompetitive 
behavior towards those who would compete with existing cable 
operators for the right to distribute services gore said

the fbi is making violent crime a nationwide 
investigative priority to counter a 40 percent increase in such 
offenses in the 1980s director william s sessions says 
sessions told reporters that violent crime will rank with foreign 
counterintelligence terrorism drugs organized crime and white 
collar crime as major priorities of the fbi 
with the acknowledged 40 percent increase in violent crime the 
american public is understandably outraged by the growing disregard 
for human life by criminals sessions said 
while state and local police still have jurisdiction to 
investigate the vast majority of violent crimes sessions said the 
fbi can expand its role in this area

h robert heller citing financial hardships in 
living on his 82500ayear government salary has announced his 
resignation as one of the seven members of the federal reserve board 
an expert in international economics heller said wednesday he 
would return to california to become an executive vice president of 
visa international the giant credit card company 
in a meeting with reporters he refused to disclose his exact 
salary at visa saying only that it would be a pretty sizable 
increase that would represent a multiple of his government pay 
heller specifically cited congress rejection earlier this year 
of a proposed federal pay raise as one factor in his decision to 
leave under the proposal which would have boosted congressional 
salaries as well as those of top officials the pay of a federal 
reserve governor would have risen to 125000 
his resignation will give president bush his first opportunity to 
appoint someone to the federal reserve board the other six members 
including chairman alan greenspan were appointed by former 
president reagan

a 10yearold girl whose mother went to jail to 
keep her hidden after the child alleged she was sexually abused by 
her father has been placed in her fathers custody 
under the judges ruling wednesday virginia and stephen lalonde 
will share joint physical custody of the child effective july 9 the 
girl will be with her father four days a week and with her mother 
the rest of the week 
lalonde was given sole legal custody 
beth herr ms lalondes attorney said an appeal was planned 
adding its certainly a unique decision for a case of this 
nature 
the couples fight over custody of their daughter nicole went 
to trial in may 1988 before suffolk county probate judge mary 
fitzpatrick in boston 
a central issue was whether nicole was abused by her father 
virginia lalonde and nicole claimed the child had been abused by 
him lalonde has denied sexually abusing his daughter 
the judge ruled wednesday no sign of sexual abuse existed as 
nicole has claimed 
the ruling gives stephen lalonde sole legal custody to determine 
such matters as where nicole attends school and her daytoday care 
nicole asked to see both parents regularly and a schedule of visits 
has been worked out 
the idea is to give nicole as much access as possible said 
peter digangi lalondes lawyer 
his client he said is elated 
ms lalonde must report to a probation officer every day that 
nicole is in her care the judge also ordered that nicole continue 
sessions with a therapist treating her for more than a year 
ms herr said an appeal would be based on claims the ruling is 
against the weight of the evidence of the case 
digangi said an appeal would be unfortunate 
were sorry that virginia wishes to continue on the 
litigation he said its time for nicole to enjoy her 
childhood while she has it 
the case drew national attention in 1987 when ms lalonde spent 
six months in the framingham state prison for women rather than 
disclose her daughters whereabouts 
the wrangling over nicole began three years after the lalondes 
1983 divorce when ms lalonde accused her exhusband of abusing 
their child during visits a probate judge investigated the matter 
then and decided the allegations were baseless 
rather than allow lalonde to have custody of his child in june 
1986 the mother and child fled the state they settled in florida 
but in march 1987 ms lalonde returned alone to massachusetts to 
settle the custody matter 
when ms lalonde refused to say where nicole was a judge held 
her in contempt of court and ordered her imprisoned until she would 
disclose the childs location 
the woman was freed only after a baby sitter in durham nc 
tipped off police that the child was being sheltered by an 
underground network of women 
in october 1987 nicole was returned to massachusetts and placed 
in the custody of the state department of social services after she 
was examined and interviewed at cambridge hospital the child was 
placed with a foster family

a protester whose flagburning conviction was 
overturned by the us supreme court called the ruling an important 
victory and his lawyer said it was not the insult some patriots 
claim 
but the korean veteran who retrieved the fragments of the burned 
flag said the courts ruling left him grieving 
some do not respect the country and the flag its symbol 
said dan walker of fort worth 
the high court voting 54 threw out the conviction of gregory 
joey johnson of new york city who was sentenced to a year in 
jail and fined 2000 for burning the flag in texas 
the court said the flagburning at a demonstration in dallas 
during the 1984 republican national convention was a form of 
expression protected by the constitutions guarantee of freedom of 
speech 
i think its an important victory that the supreme court 
was forced to back off johnson said in a telephone interview from 
new york i think they got in a situation where it was too 
exposing of their whole professed belief in freedom of expression 
ive talked to thousands about the issues involved in this 
case he said many of them dont think burning the flag is the 
most effective form of protest but they were disgusted that the 
very government that wrapped ollie north in the flag to commit all 
sorts of horrendous crime is now going to slap his wrist and was 
attempting to jail an antipatriot revolutionary 
i dont consider myself an american said johnson a member 
of the revolutionary communist youth brigade im not im an 
internationalist a proletarian internationalist 
his lawyer stan weinberg of dallas said veterans should be 
encouraged by the ruling because it shows that values fought for in 
the bill of rights are intact 
the flag is important and if that is what people believe then 
they should fly it said weinberg that is the way that they 
affirm their belief in it 
justice william j brennan said a texas law that bans conduct 
leading to breaches of the peace is unaffected by wednesdays ruling 
but brennan said it violates constitutional freespeech 
guarantees to ban flag burning at political rallies or protests 
merely because the destruction of the flag offends some people or 
because the state wishes to preserve the flag as a symbol of 
national unity 
but walker said the ruling hasnt changed his opinion 
i havent mellowed any walker a 61yearold retired 
engineer from the us army corps of engineers said in a telephone 
interview but i am convinced now that they can burn the material 
but not burn the spirit so it is just the body they may kill but 
they will not kill the soul 
walker said he was in the city hall area the day of the flag 
burning he gathered the fragments of the flag and buried them the 
west point graduate later received a letter of thanks from president 
reagan 
it was uncalled for and i still do not know what they were 
protesting walker said if they were interested in exercising 
their freedom of speech they should jolly be well be able to talk 
and identify what it is that they were protesting

a teenager challenging a law that 
suspended his driving privileges for dropping out of school has his 
license back but only temporarily 
his lawyer intends to appeal the case to the us supreme court 
if necessary 
kanawha county circuit judge paul zakaib jr on wednesday gave 
attorneys for both sides 15 days to file documents supporting their 
cases 
the judge said 17yearold michael means can drive for 30 days 
while the attorneys compile more information and the court studies 
the case 
means a married charleston teenager who dropped out of the 
ninth grade last year has appealed a department of motor vehicles 
decision to suspend his license under a firstofitskind law aimed 
at reducing the states dropout rate 
under the measure passed by the west virginia legislature last 
summer students younger than age 18 who miss more than 10 
consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences must give 
up their driving privileges 
i didnt think in the long run that he was going in our 
favor means lawyer christopher butch said of the judge 
but the attorney added i fully expect to appeal this to the 
state supreme court and all the way to the us supreme court if 
necessary because frankly this law is ridiculous 
after calling the judges ruling fair means said he was somewhat 
disappointed with the outcome 
he cant just let me drive and then not let me drive it should 
be a yes or no answer means said i think theyre trying to 
pressure me to force me to enroll in a high school equivalency 
program i dont like being forced to do anything 
butch argued that the law was in conflict with another state law 
permitting students to drop out of school at age 16 the license 
suspension he said was condemning the teenager and his family to 
poverty because he was unable to earn the money he needed to support 
them without a drivers license 
means 16yearold wife tonya who is expecting a child in 
august also had her license suspended because she is a dropout 
deputy attorney general bruce wilson who represents the 
department of motor vehicles argued that revoking the decision to 
suspend means license would send the wrong message to other 
teenagers 
it will encourage those people who want to avoid their 
responsibility to the state and to themselves wilson said 
therese wilson of state department of education testified that 
since the law went into effect in the fall 1800 dropouts had 
returned to the classroom of that number 50 percent were still 
attending school in march 
in recent years the states dropout rate was about 17 percent 
or 5000 students she said the state expected to reduce the rate 
this year by 1000 students as a direct result of the law she said 
several states including wisconsin and texas where gov bill 
clements signed a dropout bill into law friday have passed similar 
legislation and others are considering such laws

a us supreme court ruling allowing 
newspapers to identify rape victims in some instances is unlikely to 
change voluntary policies against doing so a newspaper executive 
said 
the court ruled 63 that the florida star a jacksonville weekly 
newspaper doesnt have to pay 97500 to a rape victim whose name 
was published in 1983 wednesdays ruling limits states power to 
punish the reporting of truthful information that is lawfully 
obtained 
many news organizations including the florida star voluntarily 
withhold names of victims of sex crimes the newspapers lawyers 
said the womans name was published inadvertently 
pete weitzel managing editor of the miami herald said he didnt 
think the decision will change what newspapers do he pointed out 
that the american press has become more sensitive to privacy issues 
in recent years 
i think all this really does is say youve got to make the 
judgment yourselves said weitzel chairman of the florida society 
of newspaper editors freedom of information committee 
the committee filed a court brief on the side of the star 
it was a pretty straightforward win weitzel said it 
bascially says yes you can go after a newspaper based on privacy 
but it must be on very narrow grounds 
the justices ruled that a state can punish the publication of 
lawfully obtained information only when narrowly tailored to a 
state interest of the highest order 
that interest was not present in the stars case the court found 
allowing censorship for an interest of the highest order will 
have little practical application because that terminology 
previously has been used only for national security matters said 
attorney george rahdert who represented the star 
it raises the fundamental question of whether a privacy issue 
could ever be an interest of the highest order rahdert said 
he said the ruling could have a wide ranging effect against 
attempts at censorship 
the victims lawsuit was based on a florida law that outlaws 
printing publishing or broadcasting the names of sex crime victims 
weitzel said the editors group has long questioned the 
constitutionality of the law 
mitch franks assistant deputy state attorney general said he 
was uncertain what impact the courts decision would have on the law 
we would urge in the interest of protecting the victims of 
crime that the news media continue to adhere to their policy of not 
publishing the names of rape victims franks said 
star publisher eric o simpson said he was pleased with the 
ruling but regretted the award wasnt reversed by state courts 
we were being denied the right to publish the truth 
simpson said it constituted prior restraint 
the rape victims name had been obtained from a report posted 
apparently by mistake in the press room of the duval county 
sheriffs department 
had the court allowed the award to stand it could have lead to 
passage of laws to prevent the publication of victims names in 
other types of crimes simpson said 
a person being raped is no worse than a person being killed 
he said

rita schwernerbender stayed away from 
mississippi for 25 years after the violent summer of 1964 
but when she finally returned she quickly showed why she and her 
slain husband were in the vanguard back when the south was the 
battleground of the civil rights movement 
she broke a long silence about those bloody days in a scorching 
speech to a crowd commemorating the 25th anniversary of the deaths 
of michael schwerner andrew goodman and james chaney 
the crowd listened intently as she recalled leaving philadelphia 
a brokenhearted young widow but when she spoke wednesday it was 
as a grayhaired woman who has put the past behind her 
schwernerbender who has remarried and lives in seattle quickly 
made it clear she has not forgotten the sad lessons she learned 
about hatred and prejudice in mississippi and about the 
mississippians who were willing to fight against these evils 
this is a bittersweet moment for me she told the hushed 
crowd its sad because it recalls personal pain but good because 
i have the opportunity after all these years to say hello to many 
people whose kindness and courage was beyond explaining 
mickey and i lived for six months in meridian during that time 
we were housed and fed and befriended by people who took great risk 
to take care of us and be our friends 
she said she has thought a lot about the significance of the 
socalled philadelphiatophiladelphia project that brought 
people from pennsylvania and new york to commemorate the anniversary 
of the three deaths 
this isnt about just three men she said these men were 
part of a continuum of history in the united states and in 
mississippi where should we start with rosa parks who sat in a 
bus seat in montgomery and started a boycott which grabbed the 
attention of a country which preferred not to know with medgar 
evers whose efforts brought death to himself but whose work helped 
to ensure the changes which were destined to occur 
by now the crowd was urging her on as she ticked off a list of 
heroic figures in the civil rights movement 
she continued and all the brave men and women whose names are 
not part of the history books but who dared to risk their lives and 
honor for a most overwhelming and simple concept that all women 
and all men are born to be free to live with dignity respect and 
hope 
she said she had had the difficult task of explaining to her 
children when they were young why anyone would intentionally hurt 
or kill another person and she said she had had to try and explain 
racism 
we as a nation she said have yet to purge ourselves of 
the cultural and institutional racism which was certainly a part of 
mississippi of 25 years ago and continues to be a part of this 
country today i believed at that time and i believe now that if 
all three of the men killed in neshoba county 25 years ago had been 
black the nation would have taken little notice 
this is a society which values some lives more than others 
she recalled how during the years of the civil rights movement 
the states used their powers to deny blacks and others their 
constitutional birthrights and how the fbi itself engaged in 
deliberate activities to discredit and destroy the civil rights 
movement 
the current and recent administrations in washington dc she 
said still are impeding efforts of people to secure unfettered 
civil rights she cited cutbacks of social services and recent 
efforts by the justice department to roll back laws that deal with a 
persons right to seek redress for racial or sexual discrimination 
the backwards slide of the last several years must be 
resisted she said the only appropriate honor to the many men 
and women who have participated in this struggle is its 
continuation

the new leader of the nations mayors is 
confident the bush administration will pay attention to urban needs 
but her optimism wasnt shared by all her colleagues at the end of 
their annual conference 
houstons kathryn whitmire a democrat who is mayor of the city 
president bush calls home assumed the presidency of the us 
conference of mayors as the group ended its fiveday annual meeting 
wednesday 
the mayors adjourned on a discordant note with an unprecedented 
floor fight over future leadership of the conference 
the contest was decided along party lines with the selection of 
bostons mayor raymond flynn a democrat and outspoken critic of the 
bush administration as a future president of the conference 
whitmire maintained an optimistic and conciliatory tone toward 
the administration following the meeting and praised cabinet members 
and other administration officials who spoke to the mayors 
after hearing from them we are optimistic that our issues will 
be on their agenda she said 
but mayors called on the white house to provide support for 
increased federal aid to cities and for urban problems of drugs 
crime homelessness and poverty the mayors asked congress for an 
immediate 822 million increase in the fight against drugs 
urban america has been neglected over the last eight years and 
the need is even greater than before said mayor arthur holland 
jr of trenton nj outgoing president of the group 
flynns election capped a partisan fight for the job that puts 
him in line to be president of the organization and leading 
spokesman for the nations mayors in 1991 
whitmire voted against flynn and in favor of a republican william 
althaus mayor of york pa in a vote that was otherwise decided 
largely along party lines 
flynn said that at issue in the dispute was whether mayors were 
willing to have an aggressive voice against bushs urban 
policies 
i dont think this is the time for mayors to sit back and just 
go along to say everythings all right in our cities flynn said 
everything is not all right in our cities the federal 
government has walked away from our cities 
the mayors devoted scant attention during their meetings to the 
unfolding scandals at the department of housing and urban 
development the agency that handles most federal aid to cities 
the scandals include evidence of massive embezzlement and the 
steering of millions of dollars in grants to projects based on 
political favoritism during the reagan administration 
frankly our efforts with hud will be primarily aimed at the 
future rather than the past whitmire said we do believe it is 
the duty of mr kemp secretary jack kemp to address the scandals 
our goal will not be to chastise someone now gone from the 
agency about what was done or not done last year 
the conference approved unanimously a policy statement calling on 
the administration and congress to raise federal taxes to reduce the 
deficit and to finance greater spending on urban problems 
the mayors also called for an outright ban on possession as well 
as manufacture and sale of militarytype semiautomatic assault 
weapons that goes far beyond bushs ban on the importation of 
foreignmade assault weapons and would if it became law render 
illegal thousands of such weapons now owned by americans 
the mayors resolutions become the new policies that will guide 
conference lobbying in congress 
they approved a resolution saying mayors deplore recent 
supreme court decisions that are weakening affirmative action 
programs and making it more difficult to ensure equal 
opportunities in employment for all americans 
other resolutions called for tougher action against drugs 
poverty homelessness and aids but in an earlier committee mayors 
deleted a proposal by flynn to encourage free distribution of 
needles to drug addicts as a way to reduce spread of aids

with a new test doctors may be able to begin 
treating aidsinfected babies soon after birth rather than waiting 
more than a year to make sure they truly carry the virus doctors 
reported today 
babies of infected women have about a one in three chance of 
picking up the aids virus from their mothers but until about age 16 
months there is no foolproof way of sorting out which infants are 
infected and which are not 
therefore doctors have been unable to try early treatment with 
the aids medicine azt the drug has been shown to help though not 
cure youngsters with more advanced disease 
doctors caution however that the test may miss some infected 
babies and it is still too difficult to be used routinely the 
technique known as polymerase chain reaction or pcr can spot the 
genes of viruses that have invaded blood cells 
its something of a breakthrough we have been very hindered by 
the fact that we dont have diagnostic tests in infants said dr 
martha f rogers of the us centers for disease control in atlanta 
we need that critically she added because people would 
like to start treatment with azt very early on but you are stuck 
with treating every child born to a virus positive mother with a 
fairly toxic drug and youll be treating some kids who dont have 
the infection and dont need it 
ordinarily doctors check for aids infections by testing the 
blood for antibodies to the virus those who carry antibodies are 
presumed to be infected 
this method is worthless for newborns babies whose mothers were 
infected will carry their mothers aids antibodies for months even 
if the babies themselves are not infected 
this will be the key role of pcr commented dr cody meissner 
of new england medical center in boston we will be able to do a 
test on the babys blood in the first weeks of life and hopefully 
this will differentiate between kids who are truly infected and 
those who are simply born to women who are infected 
doctors have been reluctant to treat all newborns of infected 
mothers with azt until they can find out which ones are truly 
infected otherwise they would be giving the toxic drug to twice as 
many uninfected babies as infected ones 
rogers and colleagues at six new york hospitals tried out the 
test on newborns of women infected with the aids virus they report 
their results in the new england journal of medicine 
in the study the test revealed aids infections in five of seven 
newborns who later went on to develop aids it also showed infection 
in one of eight newborns who later had nonspecific symptoms such 
as swollen lymph glands that could have been caused by the aids 
virus the test results were negative in nine infants who remained 
well 
while childhood aids infections are rare in the united states 
they are becoming a major health hazard in parts of africa another 
study in the journal describes the results of a study on 475 infants 
who were born to infected mothers at two hospitals in zaire the 
research directed by dr robert w ryder of the department of 
public health in kinshasa concludes that aids may already have 
increased infant mortality there by 15 percent 
the study found that women with more advanced aids infections are 
more likely to pass the virus to their babies during pregnancy 
infected women are also more apt to deliver babies who are premature 
or unusually small

preservationists and admirers of author 
john steinbeck have won a temporary victory in their battle to save 
a hotel he once frequented 
monterey county superior court judge john phillips ruled 
wednesday the city failed to obtain an adequate environmental impact 
report before ordering the cominos hotel torn down 
the building built in 1874 and remodeled in 1919 was visited 
often and mentioned in several works by steinbeck famous for such 
books as the grapes of wrath east of eden and of mice and 
men 
the city decided in april to raze the hotel for a parking lot 
office building and museum 
but the monterey county historical society sued saying the 
environmental analysis was deficient the group actively promotes 
steinbecks connections to the agricultural region 
preliminary studies indicate it would cost 45 million to 
refurbish the hotel 
steinbeck who won the nobel and pulitzer prizes died in 1968

panicked families are crowding the airport of a 
soviet central asian desert town where four people have been killed 
in ethnic violence pravda reported today 
two people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds after the unrest 
in the kazakhstan town novy uzen spread wednesday to settlements 
40 miles away the communist party newspaper said 
the novy uzen airport is packed with families trying to leave 
town and threats by inciters of further violence are keeping 
the 56000 residents near the caspian sea on edge pravda reported 
most of the violence in novy uzen has been aimed at settlers from 
the caucasus mountains region who make up more than a third of the 
towns population 
native kazakhs complain the caucasus settlers dominate the oil 
industry jobs on which the town depends and receive preferential 
treatment in housing and other benefits 
the settlers have also set up private businesses that are accused 
of selling supplies in the isolated town for exorbitant prices the 
newspaper izvestia said 
the novy uzen violence which began last weekend was the third 
outbreak of ethnic rioting fueled by economic hardship in soviet 
central asia in the last six weeks 
in the worst of the violence about 100 people were killed in the 
fergana valley of eastern uzbekistan in attacks by ethnic uzbeks 
against the meskhi turkish minority which was forcibly resettled 
there by josef stalin in 1944

have been injured while restoring order after a fight at a dance 
hall erupted into four days of brawling and arson hundreds of 
interior ministry soldiers were sent in and a 9 pm6 am curfew 
was imposed 
izvestia said authorities have ordered increased security for the 
towns water sewer and electricity systems as well as food stores 
and a bread factory all targets of rioters who want to be able 
to dictate their own conditions to the authorities 
pravda said that although novy uzen was quiet wednesday 
disturbances spread to munaishi where two people were hurt and to 
zhetibai where about 500 people demonstrated

seven more rioters were executed today 
bringing to 27 the number reported put to death in two days for 
their roles in protests against the violent suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement 
the official xinhua news agency said the seven people executed in 
beijing today were convicted of setting army trucks on fire 
stealing army goods or assaulting soldiers when the military invaded 
the capital on june 34 
the executions were carried out despite international pleas for 
clemency 
they came a day after three men were executed in shanghai for 
setting fire to a train june 6 after it ran through a barricade 
striking and killing six protesters 
also wednesday 17 people were executed in the northeastern 
provincial city of jinan a reporter for a local newspaper said by 
telephone 
xinhua gave no details of todays executions other than to say a 
court had rejected appeals of the seven who were convicted saturday 
and included workers but not students 
most executions in china are with a bullet to the back of the 
head 
the shanghai executions were the first announced for crimes 
allegedly committed during nationwide protests after the army killed 
hundreds of unarmed civilians in beijing in june 4 
none of the 27 people reported executed have been identified as 
students who inspired the prodemocracy movement 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said today it was 
futile for foreign countries to try to exert pressure on china 
she said suppression of the nationwide rebellion was an internal 
affair and other nations should not interfere 
she also urged the more than 20 chinese diplomats who have 
defected abroad to return home saying they were led astray by 
misinformation 
foreign leaders have urged china to be lenient with people 
arrested for roles in the prodemocracy movement and for taking part 
in protests once the crackdown began 
us secretary of state james baker iii referring to the 
execution of the three workers in shanghai on wednesday said we 
deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone forward 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said she was 
utterly appalled by the executions while australian prime 
minister bob hawke called the death sentences intolerable 
new zealand prime minister david lange said today that his 
country would lodge a formal diplomatic complaint to demonstrate its 
revulsion at the executions 
in japan the kyodo news service quoted prime minister sousuke 
uno as saying that this kind of thing should happen amid rising 
international criticism is extremely regrettable 
premier li peng on wednesday said countries that try to exert 
diplomatic and economic pressures on china the worlds most 
populous country are shortsighted and unwise 
the foreign ministrys li said china hopes to maintain good 
relations with the united states but we firmly oppose the 
american government interfering in chinas internal affairs and 
exerting pressure on china 
washington has curtailed military sales and contacts and 
suspended highlevel meetings to protest the harsh suppression of 
dissent 
the 17 people executed in jinan on wednesday had been sentenced 
the day before at a public rally the reporter for the jinan daily 
said the reporter who declined to be identified said the 17 were 
common criminals not participants in the studentled movement for 
democracy 
however a local radio broadcast said wednesday that the 17 were 
among 45 people put on trial for taking part in disturbances in 
shandong province 
most major chinese cities were wracked by demonstrations and 
riots after the military assault in beijing which ran out of 
central tiananmen square students who had for seven weeks agitated 
for a freer china 
more than 1600 people including student and labor activists 
have been arrested since the government crushed the prodemocracy 
movement and began a campaign against dissent the propaganda 
barrage has included calls for people to inform on friends and 
relatives 
official media today announced the arrest of 13 spies 
allegedly working for the rival government in taiwan to foment 
unrest during the student democracy movement 
they identified one as ou zongyou a chinese man arrested in 
guiyang southern china said to have spread rumors slandered the 
ruling communist party collected banned publications and taken 
pictures of antistate demonstrations during the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the other 12 alleged spies included three from beijing five from 
shanghai two from canton one from shenyang and one from ningxia 
the reports said they had been recruited by taiwan military 
intelligence or local agents to infiltrate the prodemocracy 
movement television tape showed several of them joining 
demonstrations and chanting along with the crowds in tiananmen 
square before the military recaptured it 
chinas official press also reported 37 more people had turned 
themselves in in shanghai bringing to 102 the number of shanghai 
residents who had surrendered to police they included some leaders 
of the independent student and citizens groups that sprung up 
during the protests 
the supreme court has told local courts those who turn themselves 
in and confess their wrongdoings should be given lenient treatment 
while those who resist arrest should be punished severely 
beijing radio said zhou chifeng a student who helped organize 
the illfated threeweek student sitin at tiananmen square was 
arrested in the northeastern city of changchun

tambourine got broken

songs at a small arena here for an audience of about 5000 people

regrouped for its 25th anniversary

free speech advocates are hailing a supreme 
court ruling in a texas flagburning case they say fortifies and 
expands constitutional protection for political dissent 
but conservatives and veterans groups expressed anger and sadness 
the justices by a 54 vote wednesday said burning the american 
flag as a form of political protest is protected by the 
constitutions free speech guarantees 
the court said texas authorities violated a protesters rights 
when they prosecuted him under a state law barring desecration or 
destruction of the flag the justices upheld a lower court ruling 
that overturned the protesters conviction oneyear prison term and 
2000 fine 
the federal government and every state except alaska and wyoming 
have similar laws against flagburning 
professor martin redish of northwestern university said the 
ruling means the government cannot censor a viewpoint based on its 
offensiveness 
he said he was delighted and somewhat surprised that justices 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy both appointed to the high 
court by former president ronald reagan voted with the majority 
ive been called an extremist for free speech im in good 
company now redish said 
arthur j kropp president of the liberal people for the american 
way said as a nation we are strong enough to withstand the pain 
of seeing our flag burned what we could not withstand is seeing the 
first amendment cast aside out of a misguided sense of nationalism 
but hf sparky gierke national commander of the american 
legion said as a veteran my first reaction to the decision is 
one of anger then my anger turns to extreme sadness this is a sad 
day for the united states of america 
robert spanogle national adjutant of the american legion said 
on cbs this morning that all americans should fly the flag and 
wear flag lapel tacks as a sign of positive protest of the 
decision 
were going to seek legislation and if it comes to the fact of 
seeking a constitutional amendment to make desecration of the united 
states flag a crime well do that too he said 
alan slobidin of the conservative washington legal foundation 
said for anyone who loves the flag this is an outrage a kick 
in the teeth 
senate minority leader robert dole rkan also criticized the 
ruling 
in my view the constitution for which millions of men and 
women have given their lives to defend holds no guarantee for 
desecration no basic right to deface he said 
the closely watched case echoed publicpatriotism themes from 
last years presidential campaign and called to mind the political 
turmoil during the vietnam war 
george bush campaigning for the presidency in 1988 attacked 
democratic opponent gov michael dukakis of massachusetts for 
vetoing legislation to require that public school teachers lead 
their classes in the pledge of allegiance dukakis said the 
legislation was unconstitutional and he said he resented bushs 
questioning of his patriotism both men made heavy use of american 
flags during campaign appearances 
during the height of us involvement in the fighting in vietnam 
some two decades ago draft card burning and flags bearing peace 
symbols were common forms of protest 
while wednesdays ruling broadly limits the power of the state 
and federal governments to restrict even offensive dissent the 
decision does not condone flagburning that could incite a riot 
the court said there are laws against breaches of the peace that 
outlaw incitement to riot and that those statutes are not affected 
by the ruling 
the central figure in the case was gregory joey johnson of 
new york city a member of the revolutionary communist youth brigade 
he was convicted of flagburning during a 1984 rally at the 
republican national convention in dallas in which protesters 
chanted america the red white and blue we spit on you 
the demonstration ended with the marchers pouring lighter fluid 
on and igniting an american flag that authorities said was taken 
from a pole outside a bank building 
i think its an important victory that the supreme court 
was forced to back off johnson said i dont consider myself an 
american johnson added im not im an internationalist a 
proletarian internationalist 
the korean war veteran who scooped up the fragments of the flag 
said he is grieved that the conviction has been overturned dan 
walker 61 a west point graduate said the burning was uncalled for 
and i still do not know what they were protesting he buried 
what was left of the flag according to army regulations and received 
a letter of thanks from president reagan 
in another important test of the rights of free expression the 
court limited states power to punish the news media for reporting 
truthful legally obtained information 
by a 63 vote the court threw out a 97500 award against a 
newspaper won by a rape victim whose name the paper had published 
in other decisions wednesday the court 
unanimously ruled that a federal law allowing public scrutiny of 
governmental advisory groups does not apply to the american bar 
associations role in picking federal judges 
voted 54 to give railroads more leeway to sell off rail lines 
without first entering into collective bargaining about the effect 
of the sale 
made it easier in a case involving a dispute between the 
internal revenue service and the church of scientology for the 
government to conduct taxfraud investigations

the governmentrun media today published a 
university resolution blaming the soviet secret police for the 
massacre of polish soldiers at katyn in world war ii 
it was the most direct statement of blame reported by the 
official press 
the warsaw university faculty condemned what it called efforts to 
obscure the basic fact known in poland and the world for nearly 
half a century namely the katyn crime committed on thousands of 
polish officers interned by the soviet union in 1939 was committed 
by nkvd soviet secret police bodies 
the resolution was carried by the official pap news agency and 
was published in the daily progovernment catholic slowo poszechne 
newspaper 
in recent months the polish government has moved toward 
rejecting the official version of the katyn massacre which says the 
4200 officers were shot by the nazis in 1941 after germany invaded 
the soviet union 
although discussion of katyn was taboo in poland for four 
decades most poles and historians in the west believe the slayings 
were carried out by the soviet secret police on josef stalins order 
in 1940 while the soviet union and nazi germany were allied 
the officers the cream of polish society called up from the 
reserves and interned by the soviets shortly after the outbreak of 
the war were shot in the back of the head and dumped in mass graves 
in katyn near the soviet city of smolensk 
the fate of another 10000 officers interned at two other soviet 
camps has never been revealed they are also presumed to have been 
executed 
the polish side of a joint commission investigating blank 
spots in polishsoviet history has reported the tentative 
conclusion of soviet responsibility for katyn and a government 
spokesman has said there is circumstantial evidence 
but there has been no direct statement assigning blame and no 
response from the soviet side of the joint commission 
the resolution said the maneuvers around the katyn crime 
consist in attempts to create a false appearance that despite 
obviousness the katyn case is very unclear and calls for longterm

a 1950sera carwash with a thing that looks 
like a tripod made of boomerangs on its roof lost a bid to be 
designated a cultural landmark 
the cultural heritage commission voted 21 wednesday to declare 
the carwash with its eyecatching 55foot tower the official 
gateway to the san fernando valley and a symbol of los angeles love 
affair with the automobile 
but the carwash needed three votes to become a cultural landmark 
the panel will vote again after a fourth commissioner is confirmed 
by the city council 
homeowners are seeking landmark status for the carwash and the 
adjoining 50sstyle tiny naylors restaurant such a declaration 
delays demolition for a least a year 
a developer wants to tear down both buildings and put up a 15 
million minimall 
in this crazy world of los angeles the carwash gives you 15 
minutes to stop and smell the roses to watch the suds said jack 
mcgrath organizer of the savethecarwash campaign

a drug used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy to 
prevent birth defects may itself harm the unborn baby scientists 
reported today 
in the report doctors linked the drug tegretol or 
carbamazepine with minor facial abnormalities and retardation 
several other drugs to treat epilepsy which afflicts an estimated 
49 million americans also have been shown to be bad for the fetus 
physicians who treat women with seizures are in a very 
difficult position said dr ronald v lacro whose study appears 
in the new england journal of medicine 
this is the drug of choice because it seemed to be safe we 
cant say that anymore 
cibageigy which makes tegretol said the study is a reminder 
that the risks and benefits of anticonvulsant drugs need to be 
weighed carefully but the medicine should still be considered for 
epileptics who want to have children 
we feel that our past data show that tegretol is a good option 
for epileptic women we still feel that way said spokeswoman 
cathy kernen 
lacro a pediatrician at childrens hospital in boston was a 
coauthor of the study directed by dr kenneth lyons jones of the 
university of californiasan diego 
the report found evidence that women who took tegretol during 
pregnancy were more likely to produce babies with delayed 
development and mental retardation they also were more likely to 
have unusual facial formations including upward slanting eyes 
long upper lips and short noses and incomplete development of 
finger nails 
studies have shown that severe epileptic seizures during 
pregnancy can temporarily interrupt the flow of blood to the fetus 
causing brain damage however epileptic women have an increased 
risk of producing babies with minor birth defects even if they 
dont have seizures during their pregnancies 
counseling has to start before pregnancy for these women 
said lacro if the woman has severe enough seizures and needs the 
medicine then by all means you have to give it but there is no 
completely safe therapy other than being off medications 
the researchers first identified the pattern of birth defects in 
eight children who had been exposed to the drug before birth they 
confirmed it by evaluating 48 other children whose mothers had taken 
the medicine 
they found that 11 percent of those exposed had facial 
abnormalities 26 percent had incomplete finger nails and 20 percent 
were slow to develop 
only one youngster with delayed development was old enough to 
take an intelligence test that child a 6 year old had an iq of 65 
cibageigy criticized the study for serious methodological 
problems it noted that the doctors used women who did not have 
epilepsy in a comparison group the higher risk of birth defects 
among the children of the epileptic women might have resulted from 
the epilepsy not the medications 
lacro said i think that what we are seeing is due to the drug 
if the changes that we saw were due to seizures alone then we would 
see the same pattern of malformations for all kinds of seizure 
drugs i think the defects are drug specific but i cant prove 
that

iran has rejected several 
recent attempts by third countries to mediate with washington 
irans foreign minister was quoted as saying today 
foreign minister ali akbar velayatis interview in the 
dubaibased arabic newspaper albayan was published as irans 
parliament speaker visited the soviet union the highest ranking 
iranian official to do so in a decade 
velayati said iran was interested in good foreign relations as 
long as that doesnt compromise its independence albayan reported 
several countries have approached us for some kind of mediation 
with the united states but we reject that as the islamic republic 
in iran has never welcomed such mediations velayati was quoted as 
saying in the interview in tehran the newspaper did not say when 
the interview occurred 
velayati refused to give names of the countries which approached 
tehran for mediation nor to elaborate on relations with washington 
said the paper 
he said iran wanted good relations with other nations but only 
if that doesnt require sacrifices of islamic principles and 
independence 
he did not say in what way having relations with washington would 
be compromising for iran ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died of a 
heart attack june 3 repeatedly referred to the united states as the 
great satan 
relations were severed in 1979 after students declaring 
allegiance to khomeinis islamic revolution seized the us embassy 
and held 52 americans hostage for 444 days 
velayati said iran wants to improve relations with the soviet 
union and arab states on basis of mutual respect among neighbors 
irans professed goal of spreading its islamic revolution 
strained its relations with several arab nations 
the soviet union is our neighbor and we want to expand 
bilateral ties with moscow on basis of friendship and good 
neighborly relations and not on the base of scaring others he 
said 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani has been in moscow since 
tuesday to sign a number of economic and commercial agreements 
velayati said his country hoped to have good relations with arab 
states 
at present we have strong relations with a number of arab 
states but we have problems with others and normalizing relations 
with these depends on the ability of those countries to solve these 
major problems he said velayati said the problem nations include 
egypt and saudi arabia 
iran has condemned egypt for signing a peace treaty with israel 
saudi arabia broke ties in 1988 and strains persist with tehran 
especially over the restrictions the kingdom imposed on the number 
of pilgrims to the annual hajj to mecca and medina

casinos can be held liable for money lost by 
drunk gamblers a federal judge ruled 
a casino has a duty to refrain from knowingly permitting an 
invitee to gamble where that patron is obviously and visibly 
intoxicated andor under the influence of a narcotic substance 
us district judge mitchell cohen said wednesday 
the judge said casinos should fall under new jerseys dram shop 
laws which hold taverns responsible for injuries caused by their 
intoxicated patrons 
marvin b roffman a gaming analyst for janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia said the ruling is a blow to the casinos 
if it holds up what that means is anybody who was a big loser 
can say look i had too many drinks i dont owe anything he 
said 
the golden nugget hotel and casino had sued schmuel aboud of new 
york for 30000 in losses incurred in 1985 during a twoweek 
gambling visit aboud countersued claiming he lost 200000 because 
casino employees plied him with free alcohol 
the golden nugget had asked the judge to throw the case out 
arguing that no law holds casinos responsible for debts incurred by 
intoxicated patrons 
the ruling wednesday allows the court case to continue toward a 
finding of whether the golden nugget was responsible for abouds 
losses 
we were saying to the judge that unless these cases are cut off 
at the pass there will be a flood of these said stephen dratch 
attorney for the golden nugget essentially the judge is saying 
thats the price you pay for being in this business 
aboud whose gambling money came from a 395000 settlement of an 
auto accident case also is suing two doctors the casino supplied 
when he complained of back pain 
he says the doctors gave him painkillers and that he lapsed into 
unconciousness after washing them down with cognac offered by casino 
employees 
at that point he claims casino officials told him he would have 
to wake up and continue gambling or leave his complimentary 
1000anight suite 
atlantic citys 11 casinos have various promotions that provide 
free drinks meals show tickets rooms transportation and coins to 
gamblers particularly to high rollers cocktail waitresses walk 
among gamblers at slot machines and gaming tables taking drink 
orders 
the ruling could halt the serving of free drinks and could force 
gaming hall operators to forbid drunk patrons from gambling roffman 
said 
i really dont think the casinos would win as much money if 
they didnt offer drinks on the gambling floor he said 
abouds lawyer stephen goldman did not return calls wednesday

underwater explorer robert d ballard whose 
deepsea robot discovered the german battleship bismarck on the 
bottom of the atlantic two weeks ago said today he believed the 
world war ii vessel had been scuttled by its own crew 
at a news conference to disclose details of the discovery 
ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory 
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by british fire in one 
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war 
only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one 
piece ballard said it appears the crew opened it up along its 
entire length it was clearly flooded stem to stern 
the sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the 
robot called argo the same device that was used four years ago to 
find the wreck of the titanic the british passenger liner that sank 
in 1912 after striking an iceberg 
the bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the german navy when 
it sank during a battle with the british on may 27 1941 of the 
bismarcks 2200man crew only about 115 survived 
the sinking occurred only eight days after the bismarck left 
gydnia poland for her first operation intended to attack convoys 
of merchant shipping and damage british morale at a time when 
england stood virtually alone against combined german sea and air 
power 
the british sent the warship hood after the bismarck but five 
days after the bismarck went to sea it sank the hood with the loss 
of all but three of the british vessels crew of 1419 
the hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of 
world war ii and symbolized british sea power so its loss stunned 
the british public and the war government and made sinking the 
bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature 
ballard said the bismarck was found in a remarkable state of 
preservation there doesnt appear to be as much damage as i had 
expected 
ballard is a senior scientist at the woods hole oceanographic 
institution in massachusetts 
the bismarck was found in more than 15000 feet of water about 
600 miles west of brest france

the highestranking iranian official to visit 
moscow since the 1979 iranian revolution said today that talks with 
mikhail s gorbachev had set oncestormy relations on a path of 
close cooperation 
the optimism that we had before the meetings has been totally 
justified the official hashemi rafsanjani told a news 
conference after two days of talks with the soviet leader 
asked about a recent series of bloody clashes in traditionally 
moslem soviet central asia part of which borders iran rafsanjani 
said that his country would not interfere in soviet internal affairs 
but he added we consider mr gorbachev has a long way to come 
in providing freedoms and peoples participation in the democratic 
process he did not elaborate 
on other issues rafsanjani 
said the late ayatollah khomeinis order stands for the killing 
of salman rushdie british author of the novel the satanic 
verses which many moslems consider blasphemous khomeinis 
judgment was based on islamic law and this is not the kind of 
prescription that can be reversed there is no one in iran who could 
reverse it 
accused the united states of unspecified plots and 
conspiracies against iran when asked about the possibility that 
relations would improve after khomeinis death 
said afghans must be free to resolve their differences without 
outside interference after the withdrawal of soviet soldiers from 
their country more than four months ago 
rafsanjani originally was expected to leave today but extended 
his visit tass reported that he left for leningrad after the news 
conference 
teheran radio monitored in london said rafsanjani also planned 
to visit the southern republic of azerbaijan whose population is 
predominantly shiite moslem iran has a consulate in the republics 
capital which the iranian broadcast called the moslem city of 
baku 
gorbachev and rafsanjani agreed on a broad spectrum of economic 
cooperation and iran and the soviet union are expected to increase 
joint efforts in areas including atomic energy space and gas 
processing 
rafsanjani suggested a joint sovietiranian space voyage during 
the visit and gorbachev ordered his deputies to begin working out 
the details 
rail links between the two countries will be restored and another 
rail line constructed the official tass news agency said 
rafsanjani invited gorbachev to iran gorbachev thanked 
rafsanjani for the invitation and said frequent highlevel contacts 
would be appropriate 
no date was set for a gorbachev visit 
topics discussed by the two included arms sales to iran but 
rafsanjani sidestepped questions about any deals with the soviet 
union he said only that iran was trying to be selfsufficient in 
arms but has some technical requirements that we would like to see 
met by various sources 
only a handful of third world leaders have visited tehran since 
the islamic revolution in 1979 sent mobs into the streets shouting 
death to america death to russia 
the soviet union was the chief arms supplier to iraq during its 
long war with iran that ended in a ceasefire last august 
rafsanjani emphasized in remarks distributed by tass on wednesday 
that several months before his death on june 3 khomeini called for 
better relations with the soviet union 
tass said gorbachev and khomeini exchanged messages in february 
and since then their foreign ministers have met four times 
the soviet union has about 50 million moslems most of them 
living in rapidly growing central asia which borders iran 
afghanistan and china 
the soviet union has been troubled in the past year and a half by 
outbreaks of unrest among its more than 100 ethnic groups and the 
disturbances have spread in the last six weeks to central asia 
about 100 people were killed in rioting in the fergana valley of 
eastern uzbekistan earlier this month

an african summit to resolve 
angolas 14yearold civil war will fail without talks between the 
rebels and the government guerrilla leader jonas savimbi said 
before todays meeting 
speaking at his bush camp wednesday savimbi also said that 
never in 14 years of war have we come so close to peace 
angolan president jose eduardo dos santos left the capital 
luanda early today for gbadolite zaire where leaders of 22 
african nations were gathering for the conference 
in an interview with the new york times published today zairean 
president mobutu sese seko said dos santos would meet savimbi during 
the summit 
but savimbi head of the rebel national union for the total 
independence of angola made no mention of talks with dos santos 
during his news conference wednesday in boa esperanca in southern 
angola 
before leaving for zaire dos santos commuted the death sentences 
of 50 unita rebels condemned for high treason and terrorism between 
1981 and 1987 the state news agency angop reported 
angop reported wednesday that the government released 700 rebel 
prisoners june 2 the prisoners reportedly renounced the rebel 
movement and accepted the governments offer of clemency the 
dispatch said 
the goal of the summit was to clear the way for peace talks 
between angolas marxist government and the rebels 
savimbi said his delegation in zaire was flexible about 
procedures leading to elections and formation of a national 
government but the rebels do not want any amnesty or clemency that 
would imply they are criminals savimbi said 
our army 75000 men in the field will not accept amnesty 
clemency or integration savimbi said that wording has a 
political context that means the rebel army is considered 
criminal our army was not defeated and is not going to be 
defeated 
savimbi said he had agreed to stay out of the negotiations and 
would not demand a role in any transitional government he said 
however that he would continue to head his party and also wants to 
participate in free elections within two years of a formal 
ceasefire 
the government has rejected elections saying it wants to 
maintain oneparty rule with some rebels participating in the 
administration 
under a peace plan put forward by dos santos savimbi would go 
abroad and recognize the legitimacy of the government and the rebel 
movement would then be integrated into the oneparty state 
savimbi vetoed all these proposals 
in six months half the 50000 cuban soldiers who have supported 
the angolan government will have left angola under a usmediated 
peace agreement reached in december 
savimbis usbacked rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war 
to force the cuban and sovietassisted government to share power 
since shortly after angola gained independence from portugal in 1975

mortgage bank and the atlantic bank of new york a subsidiary of the 
staterun national bank of greece

a private panel formed to monitor the upcoming 
nicaraguan elections says it plans to conduct polls in that country 
and seek a meeting with president daniel ortega 
however curtin winsor jr cochairman of the bipartisan 
commission on free and fair elections in nicaragua expressed 
concern wednesday about managuas recent announcement that it will 
require american visitors to have visas beginning july 1 
visas have not been required of americans before 
this has an element to it which suggests restriction 
restriction for press and foreign observer presence and we hope 
that will not be the case it is a matter of some concern 
however winsor a former reagan administration ambassador to 
costa rica told reporters 
in a letter to leonor huper charge daffaires of the nicaraguan 
embassy in washington winsor and cochairman gaylord nelson a 
former democratic senator from wisconsin said the commission plans 
to send its six commissioners and several staff members to nicaragua 
sometime this summer the letter also asked for visa applications 
margarita suarez press officer for the nicaraguan embassy said 
she assumes the visas will be granted but the official position 
is that the only people who will be allowed to be observers are 
those that have been invited to be observers by the government 
there is really no restriction on the visas unless someone is 
really undesirable ms suarez said there is no new 
qualification that people must go through simply because they are 
americans 
winsor spoke at a news conference at which the commission 
released a report saying international observers press and 
broadcast media must be free to travel throughout nicaragua during 
the campaign to monitor the election process the nicaraguan 
elections are scheduled for february 1990 
ms suarez said the embassy had not yet received a copy of the 
report 
nelson did not attend the news conference but said in a statement 
a number of delegation trips are planned to examine nicaraguas 
political climate 
the first delegation plans to go to nicaragua in late july or 
early august and will request a meeting with ortega nelson said 
another integral part of the commissions activities will 
include a series of polls nelson said the first poll will 
examine the political and economic climate in nicaragua and how the 
nicaraguan people feel about the possibility of free elections 
after that he said polls comparing support for opposition and 
government candidates are planned 
the commission released letters seeking meetings with president 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
winsor told reporters it was uncertain whether the supreme 
electoral council whose members were chosen by ortega will 
operate fairly 
commission member sergio bendixen a democrat and international 
political consultant said even though there are some questions 
about the composition of the council which may or may not be valid 
it is by the actions of the electoral council that they should be 
judged 
if we find that the decisions of the electoral council are 
being arrived at by consensus i think that would be a very positive 
point bendixen said if on the other hand most of the votes of 
the electoral council are 41 or 32 always in favor of the 
sandinista position then i think the entire electoral process in 
nicaragua should be questioned 
the commission which held three days of hearings in washington 
may 911 is sponsored by the conservative world freedom foundation

a sliver of light known as the sun 
dagger missed its mark on an ancient indian rock etching on the 
opening day of summer for perhaps the first time in 1000 years 
scientists say 
a shift in the position of a 9foottall slab of sandstone atop 
nearby fajada butte probably because of erosion changed the angle 
at which the light fell wednesday 
its very serious and sad said archaeoastronomer ana 
sofaer who is credited with discovering the sun dagger 12 years 
ago we knew when we first saw the site that it had a fragility 
that was remarkable 
researchers believe that the rock drawing or petroglyph was 
carved between 950 and 1150 at the peak of the anasazi indian 
culture 
it is believed the carving was a kind of calendar with the rocks 
arranged to cast distinctive patterns of light and shadow across it 
on important days of the year the sun dagger occurred on the 
summer solstice the first day of summer when the sun is at its 
highest point of the year in the northern hemisphere 
distinctive patterns of light are also cast at the winter 
solstice and the fall and spring equinoxes when day and night are 
of equal length 
were used to this thing acting like a clock physicist rolf 
sinclair said 
when the solstice arrived wednesday the dagger widened 
lengthened and missed the circular dawing entirely appearing above 
and to the left 
michael zelik a physics and astronomy professor at the 
university of new mexico said its clear the rocks have not moved 
much if at all over the years he said the erosion noticed this 
year may be due to 10 years of wet weather 
many researchers believe englands ancient rock monument known as 
stonehenge is also arranged to take advantage of the summer solstice

security forces killed one person and 
wounded another when they shot into an opposition political rally 
the government today accused the main opposition party of inciting 
unrest and ordered it to stop 
it was the sternest statement to date issued to the national 
league for democracy and came one day after the shooting at the 
rally organized by the league 
the government has been tolerant for a long time the party 
concerned will have to bear the consequences of irresponsible and 
illegal acts a spokesman for the military government told a news 
conference it must be remembered that martial law is in force 
the spokesman kyaw san accused the party and its leader aung 
san suu kyi of inciting the public to defy laws of urging students 
to form suicide squads and of organizing demonstrations to 
commemorate last years prodemocracy uprising 
wednesdays incident appeared to be one of the most serious 
outbreaks of antigovernment agitation since september when troops 
crushed demonstrators in a hail of gunfire 
the official radio rangoon said wednesday night that about 500 
people gathered at myenigon circle north of downtown rangoon to give 
agitating speeches chant slogans and lay bouquets at the site 
witnesses said demonstrators were honoring prodemocracy 
demonstrators killed by government forces at the spot on june 21

us officials have virtually given up hope 
that organization of american states mediators will be able to 
succeed in arranging a democratic transfer of power in panama but 
secretary of state james a baker iii remained publicly optimistic 
today 
one official dismissed the mediation as a corpse and said 
alternative ideas must be pursued for pressuring gen manuel antonio 
noriega to step down 
three oas mediators aided by secretary general joao baena 
soares have made two visits to panama over the past month to 
attempt to seek a solution to the countrys political crisis 
on their last visit the mediators left some ideas with the two 
most powerful political blocs in panama and with the defense forces 
on how to promote a dialogue 
baena soares is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the 
prospects for success but believes the progress achieved to date has 
been satisfactory according to an aide 
but a us official criticized the effort saying the oas has 
fallen on its face on this 
the official asking not to be identified said us diplomats 
from around the hemisphere have been trying to enlist governments 
from latin america and the caribbean to support the us position 
testifying before the house foreign affairs committee this 
morning baker said today he remains very hopeful that the oas 
mediators will be successful 
he reaffirmed the longstanding us view that there can be no 
normalization of relations with panama so long as noriega remains in 
power 
the united states has been attempting to force noriega out of 
office since he was indicted by two florida grand juries on drug 
smuggling charges in february 1988 
but few if any governments in the hemisphere are as 
unswervingly opposed to noriega as the united states many are 
reluctant to intervene in panamas internal affairs while others 
see the issue as a uspanamanian problem that should be dealt with 
as such the officials said 
the official state department position is that the mediation 
effort should not be judged until july 19 the deadline for the 
mediators to submit a report on their activities to oas foreign 
ministers 
the administration believes the only acceptable solution is for 
noriega to agree to step down as defense force commander before the 
deadline privately officials say there is no sign that will occur 
the crisis arose last month when panamas electoral tribunal 
dominated by noriegas allies tossed out the returns from the may 7 
presidential elections independent observers said the opposition 
slate had won by a landslide 
there was indignation throughout the hemisphere when three days 
after the election opposition candidates were beaten by government 
security agents a week later the oas mediating team was set up 
oas foreign ministers blamed noriega for the grave events and 
abuses in panama 
but much of the antinoriega sentiment has dissipated over the 
past six weeks generating pessimism here that the mediators will be 
able to fulfill their mandate 
the officials said the administration is weighing a series of 
options for bringing additional pressure to bear on noriega 
including the seizure of his overseas assets believed to number in 
the hundreds of millions of dollars

former president valery giscard destaing has called 
for unifying frances conservative parties and said this is the only 
way to wrest power from the socialists 
giscard destaing made the comments in an interview published 
today in the newspaper le figaro and in comments on television 
wednesday night 
he is president of the union for french democracy a federation 
of five small centerright parties the other main opposition party 
is the neogaullist rally for the republic 
giscard destaings comments came after his party and the rally 
for the republic joined forces in european parliament elections 
during the weekend the list of candidates put forward by the 
parties finished first with 289 percent of the vote leading 
laurent fabius socialist list which had 236 percent simone veils 
separate centrist list won 84 percent of the vote 
it was division that caused the opposition to lose last 
years presidential and legislative elections giscard destaing 
said it is union that will cause it to win 
jacques chirac the president of the rally for the republic who 
lost his bid last year to unseat socialist president francois 
mitterrand reacted coolly to giscard destaings idea he told 
todays opening session of the partys national council there would 
be no fusion of the two parties 
we have no intention of fusing with anybody but reinforcing 
the links of solidarity between the opposition groups he said 
giscard destaing said a convention of the opposition parties 
should be held soon and a new unified party created before the end 
of the year such a party he said would still be a place where 
ideas could be debated 
the socialists have the advantage of a single party and while 
that party has its different wings once decisions are made or 
candidates designated its leadership usually pulls together 
it is the lack that cohesiveness that troubles the opposition 
in last years presidential elections chirac had to battle not 
only mitterrand but the union for french democracys raymond barre 
and the national fronts jeanmarie le pen mitterrand calmly ran 
his own campaign with only the small communist thorn in his side

the supreme court today unanimously upheld a 
200000 libel award against hartehanks communications but its 
ruling did not appear to weaken significantly the news medias 
protection against libel lawsuits by public officials and public 
figures 
the justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled against 
hartehanks because of a 1983 article in the hamilton ohio 
journalnews but the decision also said the appeals court issued a 
misleading opinion about the standards of reporting and 
investigation by the media 
the lawsuit against hartehanks which formerly published the 
hamilton newspaper was filed by daniel connaughton a hamilton 
lawyer who unsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a 
1983 election against incumbent james n dolan 
a nov 1 1983 article in the journalnews said one of the women 
who offered testimony before a grand jury investigating alleged 
corruption in the municipal court system claims dan connaughton 
offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to florida in 
appreciation for their help in the investigation which he 
instigated 
the article quoted the woman as saying she thought connaughton 
used dirty tricks in obtaining her cooperation with his 
investigiation of billy new the courts chief administrative 
officer 
the woman who was quoted in the article and was its only source 
was one of seven people who had attended a meeting with connaughton 
when the offer allegedly was made the others who attended denied 
that any offer of jobs or a florida trip was made 
connaughton sued hartehanks three months after he lost the 
election a federal jury awarded him 5000 in compensatory damages 
and 195000 in punitive damages 
writing for the court justice john paul stevens said the 
evidence in this case when reviewed in its entirety is 
unmistakably sufficient to support a finding of actual malice 
despite that the decision today adhered to a 1984 ruling in 
which the nations highest court said appellate courts must 
secondguess juries that rule for public officials and public 
figures in libel suits against news media defendants 
in that 1984 decision bose vs consumers union the justices 
said appeals courts have broad authority and a constitutionally 
required obligation to review jury verdicts that favor public 
officials and public figures who sue for libel 
to win such a suit a public official or public figure must prove 
the allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with 
actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity 
according to the record in todays case connaughton filed a 
private criminal complaint about five weeks before the election with 
hamilton police based on corruption allegations against new the 
administrative officer 
connaughton told police that two women claimed to have paid 
bribes to new to fix cases and that one of the women said some 
of the transactions occurred in dolans presence 
new eventually was convicted of bribery dolan was not indicted 
but connaughtons campaign contended that dolan bore the ultimate 
responsibility for any failure to manage the court or its 
employees 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals in cincinnati upheld the 
award last year rejecting hartehanks arguments that the 1984 
supreme court decision required a reversal of the jury verdict 
the appeals court said the 1984 call for independent appellate 
review does not apply to a cases facts but instead was limited to 
a review of the ultimate conclusion of clear and convincing proof of 
actual malice 
today the justices said the 6th circuit courts language was 
misleading 
the appeals court opinion could appear to mean that a newspaper 
faces liability if it strays from the standards of investigation 
and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers 
stevens said but that is not the same as actual malice 
hartehanks has since sold the journalnews its new owner is 
dean singleton 
the case is hartehanks vs connaughton 8810

the federated group a west coast chain of 
40 electronics stores has agreed to pay 121 million to as many as 
15000 employees and job applicants who were required to take 
polygraph tests 
the settlement comes 18 months after four applicants filed a 
classaction suit claiming the liedetector tests violated both a 
california labor code ban on involuntary polygraphs and the state 
constitutional right to privacy 
the agreement announced wednesday is subject to approval by a 
superior court judge 
it tells all employers that workers do not hang up their rights 
at the door of the workplace brad seligman a lawyer for the 
plaintiffs said in a statement 
the suit was filed on behalf of all applicants and employees of 
the federated group in california since nov 23 1983 
the company may have given 15000 polygraph tests since 1983 the 
plaintiffs said 
gregory pratt chief financial officer for atari corp said the 
tests were discontinued shortly after atari bought the federated 
group in 1987 for 67 million 
according to the suit one woman was told she had the job 
before she was given a polygraph test in which she was asked if she 
had ever been to a psychiatrist or a therapist 
she refused to answer saying the question was too personal and 
was told she was neurotic and high strung according to the 
suit she did not get the job

home ownership among young americans is 
declining alarmingly and threatens to produce a permanent 
underclass of disadvantaged renters a harvard university study 
released today said 
the annual report on the state of the nations housing released 
by harvards joint center for housing studies said the 
homeownership rate for households in the 2529 age group fell to 
362 percent in 1988 in 1980 it was 433 percent 
for households in the 3034 age group the rate fell to 526 
percent off nearly 10 percentage points from the 1976 rate of 624 
the report also said that 30 percent of the nearly 57 million 
unsbsidized housing units renting for less than 300 a month are 
physically inadequate and at risk of loss 
it said singleparent households accounting for an increasing 
share of the nations total population of children are the most 
vulnerable to the cost crunch 
the median income of a single parent under 25 was 6223 in 1988 
down 15 percent in inflationadjusted terms from 1974 the report 
said 
at the same time it said 71 percent of all singleparent 
households pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent 
because it is rooted in fundamental social economic and 
demographic factors this trend is not easily reversed the study 
said left unchecked it threatens to produce a permanent 
underlcass of disadvantaged renters and to jeopardize the longterm 
financial security of future generations 
the study offered no specific solutions to the housing problems 
it identified saying that they are subject to debate but that 
policymakers must act to develop creative approaches to advance 
the goal of decent housing for all 
the study was coauthored by william apgar and denise dipasquale 
professors at the joint center

south africa opposes an 
international effort to ban the ivory trade a government spokesman 
said today 
south africa botswana and zimbabwe which must cull their 
elephants to keep the population under control say such a ban could 
drive up the price of illegal ivory and doesnt take into account 
legal ivory exports that generate income for conservation programs 
our basic position is that we do not support a total ban on the 
ivory trade worldwide said bosman olivier a spokesman for the 
department of environmental affairs 
olivier said south africa wanted to make its position known but 
does not plan to campaign in support of ivory trade 
in south africa we have a very healthy elephant population that 
must be culled or it will simply destroy its own environment he 
said the selling of the ivory in a legal manner makes good 
sense 
south africa earns 2 million annually from the sale of elephant 
tusks at the culling program in kruger national park olivier said 
the money is spent on animal research and maintaining the park he 
added 
dick pitman chairman of the zimbabwean conservation group the 
zambezi society said there is a question whether bans really work 
or whether they merely raise prices and drive trade underground 
soaring ivory prices in the last decade have fueled a killing 
spree that has cut africas elephant population from an estimated 
15 million in the 1970s to less than 700000 today experts say an 
average tusk weighs 11 pounds and can fetch 109 a pound on the 
international market 
this month the united states canada the 12nation european 
economic community switzerland and canada have imposed bans on 
ivory imports that make elephant poaching profitable the eec japan 
and the united states consume up to 75 percent of the ivory in world 
markets 
the 102member convention in trade of endangered species will 
consider such a ban in an october meeting in geneva 
kenya one country that supports a total ban on the trade today 
announced plans to destroy 12 tons of ivory the government has 
seized from poachers and it urged other nations to do the same 
president daniel arap moi gave no specific date for the incineration

the supreme court today made it easier for 
communities to turn down the volume on rock concerts upholding new 
york citys effort to avoid earsplitting noise levels in central 
park 
the justices by a 63 vote said officials may require sponsors 
of rock concerts in the parks naumberg acoustic bandshell to use a 
sound system operated by a citydesignated engineer 
that requirement does not violate the freedomofexpression 
guarantees of the constitutions first amendment justice anthony m 
kennedy wrote for the court 
the decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that said 
city officials had to devise a less restrictive way to satisfy 
their concern over noise levels 
this lessrestrictivealternative analysis has never been a 
part of the inquiry into the validity of a time place and manner 
regulation on expression kennedy said 
he added the citys sound amplification guideline is narrowly 
tailored to serve the substantial and contentneutral governmental 
interests of avoiding excessive sound volume and providing 
sufficient amplification within the bandshell concertground 
accordingly it is valid under the first amendment as a 
reasonable regulation of the place and manner of expression 
kennedy said 
in a dissenting opinion justice thurgood marshall said the court 
plays to our shared impatience with loud noise to obscure the 
damage that it does to our first amendment rights 
calling new yorks requirement for a cityrun sound system at 
rock concerts an impermissible prior restraint marshall said 
because judgments that sounds are too loud noiselike or 
discordant can mask disapproval of the music itself government 
control of the soundmixing equipment necessitates detailed and 
neutral standards 
quoting one music critic the 80yearold marshall added new 
music always sounds loud to old ears 
he was joined in dissent by justices william j brennan and john 
paul stevens 
the citys noisecontrol campaign is aimed at protecting visitors 
to the parks neighborhing sheep meadow a 13acre area decreed a 
quiet zone by mayor edward koch in 1985 and residents of a 
fashionable neighborhood called central park west 
the city policy was challenged by rock against racism which

the united states is skeptical of a soviet 
proposal to seek advice from the un security councils permanent 
members on proposed elections among palestinian arabs on the west 
bank and in gaza administration sources say 
and secretary of state james a baker appearing today on capitol 
hill again registered us opposition to moves by the soviets and 
the european economic community for an international peace 
conference on the middle east 
we have tried to discourage the soviet union and the eec from 
pressing forward baker said it could be detrimental to the 
prospects for direct negotiations between israel and the 
palestinians 
but at the proper time and properly structured an 
international conference could be helpful baker told the house 
foreign affairs committee 
he said some supporters of a conference were now inclined to give 
the idea of palestinian elections a chance to develop he did not 
identify the countries under questioning by the committee 
as for apporaching the united nations about elections an 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said late wednesday 
we said we werent interested 
he said the united states did not reject the idea outright but 
the official said it was unlikely to get anywhere as far as were 
concerned 
the official said the proposal could complicate efforts to hold 
elections to choose palestinian representatives to negotiate 
selfrule with israel 
it would only muddy the waters and distract from the 
elections idea itself the official said 
participation by the council members would guarantee the soviet 
union a role that israel fears would be used to the advantage of the 
arabs 
the five members of the security council are the united states 
the soviet union britain france and china 
the soviets without committing themselves on palestinian 
elections made their proposal during a twoday meeting in 
washington last week on the middle east it was one in a series of 
conferences on various global problems arranged by the two 
superpowers 
the us delegation was headed by john kelly assistant secretary 
of state for the near east and dennis ross head of the 
departments policy planning staff vladimir polyakov senior expert 
on the middle east in the soviet foreign ministry led his 
governments delegation 
the soviet idea was first disclosed in thursday editions of the 
star tribune of minneapolis 
the elections were proposed by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir as a way of breaking the stalemate between the arabs and 
israel the idea has qualified us support provided arrangements 
are satisfactory to the palestinians and the arab countries 
the palestine liberation organization has rejected israels offer 
as a subterfuge to block the creation of a palestinian state but 
the bush administration is operating on the assumption that the 
shamir proposal still has a chance and in any event is the only 
known vehicle for starting negotiations 
for this reason the official said the soviet proposal to 
consult the un security council members on a proper framework 
received a skeptical us response 
the official said the soviets did not endorse or reject shamirs 
proposition as in the past the soviets said only that it was 
worthy of consideration 
in the past as an inducement to israel the soviets have said 
they would be prepared to resume diplomatic relations once 
negotiations began but the official said the soviets did not repeat 
this offer in the washington sessions 
the soviet union broke relations with israel in 1967 when israel 
defeated a combination of arab countries in a sixday war

the supreme court ruled today the government 
may confiscate from criminal defendants money and property they 
intended to use to pay their legal fees 
the justices in separate 54 votes in cases from virginia and 
new york handed federal prosecutors a major victory in their fight 
against illegal drug dealing 
the court said a defendants constitutional rights to due process 
and to be represented by a lawyer in a criminal case are not 
violated when profits of an allegedly illegal enterprise are seized 
justice byron r white who wrote for the court in both cases 
said no one has a constitutional right to spend another persons 
money for services rendered by an attorney even if those funds are 
the only way that that defendant will be able to retain the attorney 
of his choice the money though in his possession is not 
rightfully his 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justice harry a blackmun in a dissenting opinion said it is 
unseemly and unjust for the government to beggar those it prosecutes 
in order to disable their defense at trial 
he said the court should heed the warnings of federal trial 
judges who understand perhaps far better than we the devastating 
consequences of attorneys fee forfeiture for the integrity of our 
adversarial system of justice 
blackmun was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and john paul stevens 
in one case decided today the law firm of caplin amp drysdale here 
was denied 170000 in legal fees for representing chistopher 
reckmeyer he pleaded guilty in 1985 in virginia to charges stemming 
from what prosecutors said was his role as kingpin of a 
multimilliondollar drug operation 
reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and was ordered to 
forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals the seizure of the money 
left him without funds to pay caplin amp drysdale 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that 
reckmeyer was not entitled to use any of the money to reimburse the 
law firm 
in the second case the former reagan administration appealed a 
ruling that would have allowed peter monsanto access to assets worth 
400000 to help him pay his lawyers 
monsanto was convicted in new york city of charges he headed a 
heroinselling ring 
the jury also had ordered him to forfeit to the government a 
house in mount vernon ny valued at 335000 a 30000 
cooperative apartment in the bronx and 35000 in cash 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled last year 
monsanto could use the assets to pay legal fees incurred in his 
defense 
at issue in both cases were forfeiture provisions of key federal 
crimefighting laws including the continuing criminal enterprise 
act and the racketeer influenced corrupt organizations statute 
in other action the court 
gave cities important new protection against big damage awards 
when they are accused of violating peoples civil rights 
by a 54 vote the court narrowed the scope of a centuryold 
civil rights law invoked by a former dallas high school football 
coach who said he lost his job because he is white 
unanimously upheld a 200000 libel award against hartehanks 
communications however its ruling did not appear to weaken 
significantly the news medias protection against libel lawsuits by 
public officials and public figures 
the justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled against 
hartehanks because of a 1983 article in the hamilton ohio 
journalnews but the decision also said the appeals court issued a 
misleading opinion about the standards of reporting and 
investigation by the media 
made it easier for communities to turn down the volume on rock 
concerts upholding new york citys effort to avoid earsplitting 
noise levels in central park 
the justices by a 63 vote said officials may require sponsors 
of rock concerts in the parks naumberg acoustic bandshell to use a 
sound system operated by a citydesignated engineer 
in one of the forfeiture cases caplin amp drysdale and other 
attorneys argued that confiscating the assets of people when they 
are indicted will leave them too poor to pay their own lawyers 
but white today compared the plight of the accused drug dealer to 
that of a robbery suspect 
a robbery suspect has no constitutional right to use funds he 
has stolen from a bank to retain an attorney to defend him if he is 
apprehended he said 
if defendants have a right to spend forfeitable assets on 
attorneys fees why not on excercises of the constitutional right 
to speak practice ones religion or travel white asked 
rhetorically 
also he said a defendants assets may be frozen before 
conviction if there is probable cause to believe the money or 
property was obtained illegally 
the forfeiture cases are caplin amp drysdale vs us 871729 and 
us vs monsanto 88454

a congressional panel investigating influence 
peddling in federal housing programs wants a us ambassador to 
explain how he was named developer on several lucrative projects to 
refurbish federally subsidized housing for the poor 
philip winn ambassador to switzerland was one of several 
witnesses called today to tell the house government operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing how contracts were awarded 
for the department of housing and urban developments moderate 
rehabilitation program 
winn a former assistant secretary of housing led a group that 
included several other former hud officials in the reagan 
administration and won development contracts for at least seven 
projects in the west and southwest 
abuse and favoritism were pervasive at hud in awarding these 
scarce and desirable moderate rehabilitation funds said 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif 
we are eager to hear from these witnesses how projects they 
pushed came to be selected by hud for federal subsidies over many 
competing projects lantos said before the hearing 
among winns partners were silvio debartolomeis former general 
deputy assistant secretary for housing j michael queenan the 
former director of huds denver regional office and philip abrams 
a former hud undersecretary 
according to a hud inspector generals report one proposal from 
the group to develop 202 units of the windsong apartments in tulsa 
okla was chosen after abrams told the local housing authority how 
it could obtain funding 
abrams was also scheduled to testify today debartolomeis 
testified earlier this month 
joseph strauss a former special assistant to thenhud secretary 
samuel pierce was the first witness 
strauss received 13 million in consultant fees in connection 
with 13 moderate rehabilitation projects former interior secretary 
james watt told the panel earlier this month that he instructed a 
developer to send strauss 131000 of the 300000 fee watt was to 
receive for a consulting job 
strauss testified that he retained watt in march 1984 as a 
consultant to his company phoenix associates because he had 
problems getting responses from hud for his clients 
a letter which strauss read and said formalized his relationship 
with watt noted watts well developed flair for innovation 
lantos asked strauss if he had hired watt to use his influence 
thats what this letter says strauss responded 
a hud inspector generals report said the winn group utilized a 
number of corporate titles to buy projects that might be eligible 
for the program the group would approach local housing authorities 
advise them to apply to hud for funding and the units and then help 
local officials prepare solicitations for proposals on the projects 
in one instance queenan notified the housing authority in 
richland wash it had been awarded 158 units before the hud 
regional office in seattle was even aware of the funding the hud 
report said

underwater explorer robert d ballard whose 
deepsea robot discovered the german battleship bismarck on the 
bottom of the atlantic two weeks ago said today he believed the 
world war ii vessel had been scuttled by its own crew 
at a news conference to disclose details of the discovery 
ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory 
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by british fire in one 
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war 
only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one 
piece ballard said it appears the crew opened it up along its 
entire length it was clearly flooded stem to stern 
ballard said he could only speculate on why the german commander 
decided to send his vessel to the bottom in may 1941 he said 
perhaps it carried technologically advanced equipment that the 
germans did not want to fall into british hands 
maybe the germans didnt want it taken as a war prize he 
said 
in 1939 after a battle with three smaller british ships the 
german pocket battleship graf spee was cornered in the neutral port 
of montevideo uruguay adolf hitler ordered it scuttled possibly 
to prevent the british from learning the secrets of its construction 
and weapons 
in the 1941 battle the bismarcks four main guns were quickly 
knocked out of action and the attacking british ships were out of 
range of the bismarcks secondary guns ballard said with the ship 
helpless and taking hundreds of hits its sinking was clearly 
inevitable he said 
asked if the germans couldnt have surrendered the ship to save 
lives ballard said there was no mast left on which a white flag 
could have been hoisted 
asked if the germans couldnt have surrendered by ceasing fire 
ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have 
been unlikely that the british would have recognized that the german 
fire had ended 
the british ships did halt their gunfire but continued to send 
torpedos ballard said however he said the lack of evidence of an 
implosion in the remains persuaded him that the ship had been 
blasted open by its own crew rather than sunk by british torpedoes 
he said he would keep secret the exact location of the bismarck 
and let the german people decide its future fate 
the sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the 
robot called argo the same device that was used four years ago to 
find the wreck of the titanic the british passenger liner that sank 
in 1912 after striking an iceberg 
the bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the german navy when 
it sank during a battle with the british on may 27 1941 of the 
bismarcks 2200man crew only about 115 survived 
the sinking occurred only eight days after the bismarck left 
gydnia poland for her first operation intended to attack convoys 
of merchant shipping and damage british morale at a time when 
england stood virtually alone against combined german sea and air 
power 
the british sent the warship hood after the bismarck but five 
days after the bismarck went to sea it sank the hood with the loss 
of all but three of the british vessels crew of 1419 
the hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of 
world war ii and symbolized british sea power so its loss stunned 
the british public and the war government and made sinking the 
bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature 
ballard said the bismarck was found in a remarkable state of 
preservation there doesnt appear to be as much damage as i had 
expected 
ballard is a senior scientist at the woods hole oceanographic 
institution in massachusetts 
the bismarck was found in more than 15000 feet of water about 
600 miles west of brest france

the supreme court today set aside an award of 
more than 180000 in attorneys fees stemming from a 1970 sexbias 
lawsuit against trans world airlines by female flight attendants 
in a 62 decision the court said people who intervene on the 
side of defendants in civil rights cases but who themselves are 
not found to have violated anyones rights generally cannot be 
forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who 
successfully sue 
the complicated case stems from a lawsuit filed 19 years ago that 
challenged twas policy of firing female flight attendants when they 
became mothers 
the suit was resolved in 1979 when twa agreed to reinstate fired 
women and grant them seniority from the date of their dismissal 
the airline which had abandoned its no motherhood policy 
soon after the suit was filed also created a 3 million fund for 
the fired attendants 
the settlement was challenged by the independent federation of 
flight attendants on behalf of twa flight attendants who could have 
suffered by being laid off before those with the newly won seniority 
the union acted in the case as an intervenor a concerned third 
party not named as a plaintiff or defendant 
the unions challenge to the settlement ultimately failed and 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last year ordered the union to 
pay 180915 toward the legal fees incurred by the female flight 
attendants who sued 
but the supreme court said today that the appeals court wrongly 
presumed that the union was liable under a federal law allowing 
courts to make such lawyerfee awards 
such intervenors are liable under that law justice antonin 
scalia wrote for the court only when their intervention is 
frivolous unreasonable or without foundation 
the court sent the case back to the 7th circuit for further study 
justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan dissented and 
justice john paul stevens did not participate in the case 
the case is independent federation of flight attendants vs

home ownership is declining among young 
americans but increasing among those 65 and older according to a 
harvard university study released thursday 
harvards joint center for housing studies said in its annual 
report on the state of housing in the united states that the home 
ownership rate for those in the 2534 age group was 45 percent in 
1988 down from 523 percent in 1980 
among households headed by people 65 and older however the rate 
increased from 723 percent in 1980 to 75 percent in 1988 the 
report said that many of those people already owned homes before 
housing costs increased in the 1970s and early 1980s 
young people the study found are increasingly unable to 
accumulate the down payment and other costs involved in buying a 
house 
this trend is not easily reversed the report said left 
unchecked it threatens to produce a permanent underclass of 
disadvantaged renters and to jeopardize the longterm financial 
security of future generations 
the study was coauthored by harvard professors william apgar and 
denise dipasquale 
the situation is likely to worsen ms dipasquale said at a 
news conference federal budget cutbacks and expiring use 
restrictions threaten the subsidized housing stock 
the report said inflationadjusted rents for poor people living 
in unsubsidized units increased 34 percent from 1974 to 1985 
as long as these trends persist the gap between those who can 
afford decent shelter and those who cant will continue to widen 
apgar said 
singleparent households which account for an increasing share 
of the nations total population of children are living in some of 
the worst housing the report said 
the median income of a single parent under 25 was 6223 in 1988 
down 15 percent in inflationadjusted terms from 1974 the report 
said at the same time 71 percent of all singleparent households 
pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent

east german border because it was a headquarters vehicle and would

tourists coming for the bicentennial of the french 
revolution next month may find out that they picked the worst of 
times 
they will have to stay in a hotel far from the capital a parking 
space in paris might be just as tough to get 
motorcades for the 30 or so presidents and prime ministers will 
whiz through streets and authorities will deploy 30000 police 
twothirds from out of town during the july 1117 peak of 
festivities 
tourists flock to paris every summer but officials say the 
number of visitors already is considerably larger than last year 
during the bicentennial period about 3 million tourists are 
expected to flood this city of 23 million people 
with a bit of luck a tourist can still find a room this month 
next month forget it 
impossible says a woman at the hotel reservations counter of 
the tourist office on the champselysees youll have to go at 
least 100 kilometers 60 miles outside of paris paris is booked 
solid 
many vips will be attending a july 1416 summit of the seven 
major industrial nations and their entourages will fill hundreds of 
hotel rooms 
mikhail s gorbachev is coming to town july 46 followed by 
corazon aquino of the philippines also attending celebrations are 
10 african presidents six north and south american presidents six 
asian presidents and six prime ministers or presidents from western 
europe with baggage among those attending is president bush 
the elaborate preparations for the foreign leaders have left many 
people grumbling 
allowing a few dozen privileged people to be lodged and to move 
about tranquilly must not in any way be done to the detriment of 
hundreds of thousands of other people elected officials from the 
greens party wrote to president francois mitterrand 
police have put together a security and traffic strategy worthy 
of the joint chiefs of staff 
for the crucial week of july 1017 parts of central paris will 
be off limits to all motor vehicle traffic and no cars allowed to 
park on the streets all vehicles must be removed from those areas 
permits must be sought for delivery trucks and residents heading for 
garages taxis may carry passengers into the areas 
special parking lots are being set up in the bois de vincennes 
and bois de boulogne forests on the east and west extremities of 
paris that could seriously upset the thriving transvestite 
prostitution business in the woods 
officials have played down the inconvenience 
at least once in our lifetime we will have seen the heart of 
paris without cars without trucks without exhaust fumes without 
backfiring motors said premier michel rocard 
the louvre will be shut down july 1315 for security reasons 
while delegations gather at the art museum for sessions 
and the bateaux mouches the tourist boats that ply the 
seine will drop anchor those three days because they will not be 
allowed to use their alma bridge terminal 
july 14 is bastille day the 200th anniversary of the storming of 
bastille prison that started the revolution 
the tourist office said about 100 families have responded so far 
to calls for private citizens to rent rooms to visitors 
and we certainly will have more says florence quercia 
director of the champselysees office if you have any problems

men four of them in the back of the truck pulled alongside their 
vehicle 
they stayed alongside and pulled closer and i didnt 
understand what was going on then i heard a noise and thought they 
had bumped us i didnt realize it was a bullet she said 
the single shot broke the side window and entered sister mackeys 
skull at the left temple 
the identities of the attackers were not known 
earlier hospital sources said sister mackey was in serious 
condition after being operated on wednesday night myers and sister 
brangan described her condition as critical 
the nuns work with myers at a home for war orphans in zaragoza 
sister mackey a native of ireland and naturalized us citizen is 
a registered nurse and in charge of the clinic at the zaragoza 
orphanage 
some salvadoran armed forces officers consider nuns priests and 
other church people who work in poor communities sympathizers of 
leftist guerrillas battling the usbacked government in the 
9yearold civil war 
in december 1980 four us churchwomen three nuns and one lay 
worker were killed by national guard troops in el salvador the 
case led to a temporary suspension of us aid to this country 
five national guardsmen were convicted of the murders in 1984 and 
sentenced to 30 years in prison the men said the church workers 
were subversives 
myers founded the zaragoza orphanage the oscar arnulfo romero 
community in 1980 and the nuns were headed there when the attack 
occurred the orphanage is named after the salvadoran archbishop 
murdered in march 1980 
myers said neither he nor the sisters had received threats and 
he said the crime did not appear to have been politically motivated 
there were at least six men in the truck and only one 
weapon he said they may have been thieves maybe they were 
drunk 
sister brangan said she and her two companions had stopped at the 
bank before heading for zaragoza she said the other nun in their 
vehicle sister juana flores saw a man standing in the back of the 
yellow pickup fire the single shot 
sister brangan said she pulled to the shoulder and stopped and 
that the yellow pickup stopped up ahead of her vehicle when she 
began driving again the assailants car sped away 
myers said policlinica doctors attending sister mackey believe 
she will survive he said if she survives she will lose her left 
eye if she stabilizes enough she will probably be flown to houston 
for further treatment he said

a former hostage said thursday he 
sweltered in 111degree heat in a sealed room during part of his 
13month captivity in lebanon and kept track of time by reading the 
expiration date on yogurt containers 
when a guard told jan cools to leave his tiny cell on june 14 he 
thought they are going to shoot me 
despite his ordeal the 32yearold belgian doctor told a news 
conference one week after his release that he was ready to return to 
lebanon if his safety was guaranteed 
i have seen so much misery and distress that hundreds of 
doctors could work for hundreds of years to help he said of the 
conditions in lebanons palestinian refugee camps where he worked 
before his kidnap 
cools a member of the marxist relief group medicine for the 
people read a statement on his ordeal to reporters but declined to 
answer questions saying he was still too tired 
his statement shed no light on the identity of his kidnappers 
the soldiers of justice a proiran fundamentalist group in beirut 
claimed it kidnapped him near the southern lebanon city of tyre on 
may 21 1988 and held him for 13 months 
cools said he never knew for how long he would be held until the 
tiny window of his cell swung open on june 14 and a guard told him 
get up 
cools said his first reaction was they are going to shoot me 
but it was soon clear it meant my release it is a moment i 
will never forget in my life 
he was freed one day later after intervention by a belgian 
government minister he rested several days in greece and arrived in 
brussels on a belgian military plane sunday belgian officials have 
said no ransom was paid 
in his statement cools spoke of his capture his insecurity 
about his fate and the plight of his parents and friends 
he was kept in a room so small he could barely stand or stretch 
but for the first six months guards were friendly and food was good 
and plentiful 
i had to watch out that i did not get any fatter cools said 
after five days he was even given a radio he said temperatures 
in his cell reached 111 degrees at times and that guards 
occasionally fanned him with a tray to cool him off 
but in november the conditions of his imprisonment worsened for 
no apparent reason 
guards took his radio and watch all openings in the wall of his 
room were sealed in december making it impossible to tell night 
from day 
i started to cry cools said 
cools said he was allowed only 10 showers in eight months his 
hands would get so greasy he could no longer button his shirt he 
said 
he said he tried to keep time by listening to barking dogs at 
night or looking at the expiration date on the containers of yogurt 
he was given 
he knew it was the end of ramadan the month of fasting in the 
moslem year when guards offered him the traditional sweets 
i sometimes was very desperate but i never lost confidence in 
a happy ending 
what kept him going was the belief that i came to help 
people in lebanon cools said 
i made no mistake the abductors in fact made a mistake 
cools was released after a meeting between belgian trade minister 
robert urbain and libyan leader moammar gadhafi in tripoli last week 
urbain then left for syria and lebanon where cools was handed 
over to him 
urbain said the release was obtained without giving back 
anything without compromise 
fourteen foreigners are believed held hostage in lebanon 
including nine americans the longest held is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press he was abducted 
march 16 1985

a private research and education organization 
urged routine cholesterol testing in children thursday saying high 
levels go undetected in many youngsters 
cholesterol should be checked at some point from ages 2 to 10 
and the sooner the better said ernst wynder president of the 
american health foundation in new york 
high cholesterol can lead to disease in the arteries that feed 
the heart muscle that sets the stage for a heart attack in adult 
life 
the american heart association recommends childhood cholesterol 
testing only if a childs family history suggests he is at risk 
but that strategy overlooks many children with high cholesterol 
wynder said in a recent interview children are considered at risk 
if their fathers have had a heart attack for example but a young 
father may not have had his heart attack while the child is still 
young wynder said 
the health foundation said research shows that some 5 percent to 
15 percent of children in industrialized countries have excessive 
cholesterol levels using the adult standard of 200 milligrams per 
deciliter or more almost a third are above 175 milligrams per 
deciliter which may be a more appropriate marker for children the 
foundation said 
wynder said screening all children would be costeffective 
because it would reduce such later costs as those of coronary bypass 
operations and time off work from heart attacks 
the heart associations recommendation was published in 1986 
william weidman a member of the committee that developed it said 
it was based on the state of cholesteroltesting technology and 
knowledge about childhood cholesterol at that time 
we felt we werent ready for universal childhood screening 
he said in a recent interview 
now such screening is being studied by a committee organized by 
the national heart lung and blood institute weidman said 
the heart association is awaiting the committees conclusions 
before deciding on any change in its recommendation said 
association spokesman howard lewis 
the health foundation said a feasible target for childrens 
cholesterol is 140 milligrams per deciliter weidman agreed that is 
a goal to shoot for but said diet and exercise will not be 
enough to reach it in all children so medications may be needed he 
said

ship sailed into leningrad on thursday bringing 300 american 
sailors to the former imperial russian capital at the time of its 
white nights 
it was the first port call of an american warship to a soviet 
city since 1975 said capt peter huchthausen the us naval 
attache in moscow 
the picturesque eagle doesnt carry any weapons even though its 
called a warship instead it sails with a crew of 55 and 250 coast 
guard academy cadets wouldbe officers learning their seamanship 
skills on an annual summer training cruise huchthausen said 
for three days the cadets will see leningrad in the midst of the 
white nights when most of the population spills out onto nevsky 
prospect and other avenues in a vast street party it is a time when 
the sun just barely sets and the skies never completely darken over 
the northern city

the bush administration wants to stress us 
outrage over chinas crackdown on the democracy movement without 
pressing that nation to the point where its only real prospect for 
reaching out to the world is back toward the soviet union richard 
h solomon said thursday 
solomon president bushs nominee for assistant secretary of 
state for east asian and pacific affairs said that only china can 
answer the question whether it can now return to the path of 
reform 
solomon who heads the state departments policy planning staff 
appeared at an asian policy conference sponsored by the heritage 
foundation a private research organization 
sen frank murkowski ralaska another speaker described china 
as a tragedy of old men holding onto power by executing their own 
grandchildren he added that i hope im wrong but i believe our 
relations with china are going to get worse for a long time 
murkowski said that a new leadership in beijing would give 
everybody the opportunity for a way out of the current situation 
solomon said that prospects of continued openness and stability 
in china are now clouded by repression and possibly turning inward 
if not returning to centralized management 
he said us policymakers face a challenge of balancing the 
totally appropriate outrage our people feel about the violent 
massacre inflicted on peaceful chinese demonstrators with the 
desirability of not pushing china into moscows arms 
solomon said that the policymakers want to express that outrage 
without pushing china into a situation where its only real 
prospect of reaching out to the world is back toward the soviet 
union 
he said another challenge of us asian policy is to better 
manage relations with japan which form the keystone of our 
dealings in the pacific and preventing trade and technology 
disputes from undermining them 
solomon said the administration does not favor a free trade 
arrangement with japan that would exclude other pacific countries 
but seeks a regional consensus on some form of appropriate 
mutilateral mechanism to deal with trade financial technological 
and environmental issues 
secretary of state james a baker iii will unveil such proposals 
in a new york speech monday and during an asian tour solomon said 
he also said the administration is gearing up for a major 
diplomatic effort for a peace process in cambodia that will spare 
the cambodians from a new civil war and allow them to choose their 
own government after the expected end of the vietnamese occupation 
later this year 
solomon said the united states also needs to reaffirm the 
consensus which has been underpinning security since world war ii 
in asia and the pacific 
he said the situation in korea remains highly explosive 
because north korean leaders are not undertaking the kind of reforms 
we see in much of the communist world

with the minds of engineers and the 
spirits of pioneers 18 teams are gambling their reputations and 
their survival in the first humanpowered submarine races 
theres both a fun and serious side to the races said maggie 
linskey merrill director of the ha perry foundation inc a 
hingham massbased undersea research group that along with 
florida atlantic university of boca raton organized the threeday 
event starting friday 
we want to see the type of materials used and what shape 
performs the best ms merrill said there could be a commercial 
and recreational application for humanpowered subs 
and for the competitors who will race their twoperson craft 
1000 feet offshore in about 20 feet of water theres the spice of 
a 5000 overall performance prize and several smaller cash awards 
for design and efficiency 
the lightweight subs with one person steering and the other in 
the crankman seat providing the pedal power will race 
headtohead over a onekilometer course the eight winners of 
fridays first rounds will move on to elimination rounds over the 
weekend the subs will tow surface floats to mark their progress 
about the pace of a brisk walk 
all the subs are wet designs that fill up with water and 
require the crews to wear scuba gear 
for most entrants the nearly 18 months of design and 
construction was plotted on computers and bankrolled by universities 
or corporate sponsors a few however pulled the car out of the 
family garage for their work space 
ed leibolt and two coworkers at the david taylor research center 
in bethesda md combed junk yards for parts the crew seats are 
old plastic cafeteria chairs and an old 10speed bike was converted 
into the subs gear system 
they dubbed the 600pound fiberglass sub the turtle after the 
first humanpowered sub built in 1775 but abandoned after its first 
unsuccessful mission to sink british ships in new york harbor 
hope we have better luck said leibolt we literally funded 
this by passing around a hat in the office 
in concord calif an auto shop donated a pinkandgreen paint 
job for the independent subhuman 
we sort of winged it said crankman chris reno who still 
shivers when he recalls the first test run in 46degree lake tahoe 
while most of the subs resemble sleek torpedos many teams 
boasted of subtle differences 
ours may look like some of the others but theres one 
difference ours is fastest said paul friedman a backup 
navigator for the massachusetts institute of technologys 
icarus which uses a cableandpulley propulsion system rather 
than the more common chainandgear 
we designed ours in a perfect hydrodynamic shape said 
university of washington mechanical engineering graduate george 
poor it should slice right through the water 
the gossamer albacor built by lockheed advanced marine 
systems in san diego was one of two entries using a waving 
fishtail propulsion device rather than propellers 
were looking at all things the cleverness of design and the 
materials used said engineer robert phillips one of six judges 
assigned to award 500 prizes for cost effectiveness and innovation 
anyone can build something with a blank check ill be looking for 
some real imagination 
surely 73yearold calvin gongwers knuckle ball will not go 
unnoticed 
gongwer president of innerspace corp of covina calif will 
be the navigator inside his 60inchdiameter plastic sphere 
there are some ideas i want to test out with spheres 
underwater said gongwer looks arent everything 
on the beach perry foundation president ha perry watched all 
the preparations 
the response has been four of five times what we imagined 
said perry at first we thought wed have a few subs a few races 
and a keg of beer we didnt expect this

president bush today called upon all american 
citizens and institutions to join a voluntary crusade to fight 
poverty drugs and other societal ills by extending national service 
into every corner of america 
bringing a campaign metaphor to life he unveiled his blueprint 
for a foundation called the points of light initiative that 
would get 25 million a year in taxpayers funds to spur americans 
to volunteer for social service 
he made the pitch in a speech for the new york city partnership 
a civic group after touring a shelter for runaway youth called 
covenant house 
bush also named new jersey gov tom kean to head an advisory 
committee that will recommend legislation to achieve the 
foundations goals and propose a structure for the organization 
i ask all americans and all american institutions large and 
small to make service central to your life and work bush said 
we know that during the past two decades we have spent more 
money on more social programs than at any time in our history and 
some problems arent better in fact theyre worse 
bush said too many americans still endure a living nightmare of 
want and isolation that must stop 
the key to constructive change is building relationships not 
bureaucracies he said 
today more than ever we need community service to help 
dropouts pregnant teens and drug abusers the homeless and aids 
victim the hungry and illiterate 
invoking again the guiding metaphor of his campaign bush said he 
wanted to unleash the energy of every citizen school business 
church and synagogue and civic group 
this is what i mean when i talk of a thousand points of light 
that vast galaxy of people and institutions working together to 
solve problems in their own back yard he said 
bush said he was asking both the public and private sector 
including all branches of government to join this great movement 
to extend national service into every corner of america 
he urged every church and synagogue to become an 
aroundtheclock community center every restaurant and grocery to 
distribute surplus food to soup kitchens and shelters every 
corporation to teach illiterate employees to read and every college 
to start a big brother or big sister program 
bush said that in addition to the youth engaged in service to 
america program yes announced wednesday the new foundation will 
include a servnet project that will encourage corporations 
professional firms and other groups to donate the services of their 
top talent 
bush said the yes program will select annually two collegeage 
youth from each state to serve as roving service ambassadors and 
salespeople we know that volunteerism can help those freefalling 
through society bush said 
at covenant house a shelter near times square bush and his wife 
barbara heard 11 young residents tell of their lives on the streets 
mrs bush cradled a threeweekold baby of one of the youths as they 
spoke 
monique 20 said of her life on the streets you dont want to 
be there she said as a child she was beaten at home tied up 
and hung over a spiral staircase 
walter 18 told the president that kids wound up on the streets 
because its hard to get good jobs working in mcdonalds at the 
minimum wage it just doesnt pay 
he said that he could make 100 in 15 minutes selling drugs 
he said his father was an alcoholic and his mother was dead 
the white house billed the new community service drive as a 
potential panacea for a welter of social problems from drug abuse 
to homelessness and said it could be the most comprehensive and 
inclusive movement of our time 
during his acceptance speech at the republican convention last 
aug 18 bush first spoke of what he called the brilliant 
diversity of volunteerism in america shining like a thousand 
points of light across society 
the metaphor drew guffaws from democratic rival michael dukakis 
but bush returned to the theme repeatedly and promised to help spur 
volunteerism with a youth entering service to america initiative

a sled dog lost in poor weather during a 
climbing expedition on mount mckinley has turned up weak but alive 
after 18 days on the icecovered mountain 
patricia and jeanfrancois tuveri of chamonix france assumed 
the dog had fallen in a crevasse and died after it disappeared may 
31 
the tuveris had four dogs in harness when they started mushing up 
north americas tallest peak on the sixth day of the journey while 
descending to their camp at the 11000foot level after ferrying 
supplies higher they unhitched the dogs because of treacherous ice 
conditions 
by the time they got around windy corner at 13200 feet only 
three dogs were with them a 15monthold siberian husky named 
oukiok was gone 
a snowstorm forced the tuveris to hole up for the next four days 
when they climbed to a medical research camp at 14200 feet they 
asked other climbers if they had seen the dog none had and they 
assumed he had fallen to his death 
with only three dogs left the tuveris abandoned their sled and 
simply climbed to the 20320foot summit with the dogs it was only 
the second expedition to reach the top with dogs 
the tuveris left the mountain for some sightseeing around alaska 
then returned to talkeetna near the mountain to pick up the 
remaining dogs for the trip back to france 
thats where they learned that 18 days after he disappeared 
oukiok had walked into the high basin where the medical camp is 
located denali national park rangers said the dog didnt have any 
broken bones but was exhausted 
it would seem pretty spectacular but its not impossible 
said jim leach chief veterinarian for the iditarod trail sled dog 
race snow and ice could provide enough liquid to prevent death 
through dehydration he said 
the dog was being nursed back to health by staff members at the 
research camp rangers said he should soon have enough strength to 
make the trip to the kahiltna glacier base camp at 7200 feet from 
there he will be flown to talkeetna hopefully in time to accompany 
the tuveris and the other three dogs back to france on monday

president bush today declared that while he 
would support the supreme court decision backing the right of 
protesters to burn the american flag flag burning is wrong dead 
wrong 
the flag of the united states is very very special bush 
said departing from the text of a speech on volunteerism to the new 
york partnership a civic group 
the president made the flag a major focus of his 1988 
presidential campaign even giving a stump speech outside a new 
jersey flag factory he repeatedly attacked democratic opponent 
michael dukakis for having vetoed as governor of massachusetts a 
proposed state law requiring recitation of the pledge of allegiance 
in schools 
in a 54 ruling wednesday the supreme court restricted the power 
of states to punish those who burn or otherwise desecrate an 
american flag 
i understand the legal basis for that decision and i respect 
the supreme court and as president of the united states i will see 
that the law of the land is fully supported bush said

a federal judge has declared an emergency 
at the state penitentiary at angola in the wake of 11 escapes four 
fatal stabbings and four suicides in 14 months 
us district judge frank polozola in an order signed wednesday 
appointed ross maggio jr a former warden to oversee an 
investigation polozola ordered us attorney ray lamonica to 
conduct any necessary criminal or civil investigations 
the judge noted that the 11 prisoners who escaped since april 
1988 were serving longterm sentences for serious crimes including 
murder rape and kidnapping ten have been captured 
while the court understands escapes will occur in a prison it 
appears escapes at the louisiana state penitentiary are occurring on 
a more frequent basis and are beginning to affect the lives and 
property of the general public polozola wrote 
the judge said some prison deaths apparently resulted from drugs 
and weapons being smuggled into the prison where the weapons were 
used to retaliate against those who failed to pay for the drugs 
warden hilton butler said he has a good record of keeping 
violence at angola to a minimum noting there have been only three 
murders this year 
there were three murders in one night under maggio butler 
said when everything is dug out youll find out my record is 
better than the man whos investigating me 
i think the judge is sincere but hes getting bad 
information butler said 
corrections secretary bruce lynn said wednesday he and gov buddy 
roemer met with polozola several weeks ago and again last week to 
discuss the prison 
roemer approved of the appointment of maggio an aide said 
maggio 50 was warden in 1976 and 1977 and from 1981 to 1984 he 
said by telephone from his home in florida that he would resign from 
his job with a private security company there and move back to baton

the us economy expanded at a 44 percent 
annual rate in the first three months of the year but the overall 
growth rate masked a significant slowdown in business activity the 
government reported thursday 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
countrys total output of goods and services rose at the fastest 
rate in more than a year during the first quarter 
however more than half of the increase resulted from a 
statistical rebound from last years drought a onetime accounting 
change necessary to return expected farm production this year to its 
predrought levels 
discounting this change the nonfarm economy grew at a 
lackluster annual rate of 19 percent in the first quarter down 
from a nonfarm growth rate of 35 percent in the final three months 
of 1988 
economists have been predicting for some time that economic 
growth will slow markedly this year under the impact of high 
interest rates engineered by the federal reserve in an effort to 
cool off inflationary pressures 
on the inflation front a price index tied to the gnp rose at an 
annual rate of 46 percent in the first three months of the year a 
less worrisome figure than a 5 percent increase estimated a month 
ago the improvement came from slower price increases for farm 
products and industrial supplies 
the effect of the economic slowdown was evident in a companion 
report that showed the aftertax profits of american corporations 
fell by 11 percent in the first three months of 1989 the decline 
which was revised from an even larger 17 percent estimated drop a 
month ago was the first setback for corporate profits since a 25 
percent fall in the first quarter of 1987 
economists said the new gnp report was a generally favorable sign 
that the fed can engineer a softlanding with slower growth and less 
inflation without pushing the country into a recession 
the federal reserve seems to be getting precisely what it asked 
for said robert dederick chief economist of northern trust co 
of chicago we have an economy that is continuing to expand but at 
a subdued rate 
many analysts believe that the country has now entered what is 
termed a growth recession a period when the economy keeps growing 
but at such a sluggish pace that unemployment rises 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc of 
lexington mass predicted that the unemployment rate now at 52 
percent would climb to 59 percent early next year 
she forecast gnp growth in the second quarter of around 18 
percent very much like the nonfarm increase in the first three 
months of the year in the second half of 1989 she predicted growth 
would slow to around 1 percent but without a recession 
it is still our bet that we can avoid a recession she said 
the new gnp report provides further ammunition for those arguing 
for a soft landing 
the primary reason for the slight upward revision in the overall 
44 percent gnp figure up from a 43 percent estimate a month ago 
was a better performance in trade than previously believed 
the countrys huge trade deficit which had been getting worse 
since last spring narrowed significantly in the first quarter and 
business investment shot up substantially 
the us trade deficit as measured by the gnp narrowed by 195 
billion in the first quarter as exports shot up by 15 percent and 
imports fell by 05 percent while business investment advanced by 
76 percent rebounding from a 29 percent decline in the fourth 
quarter 
the bush administration is counting on both trade and business 
investment to be strong this year to keep the economy moving forward 
while consumer spending slackens 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of all economic 
activity rose at a sluggish annual rate of 13 percent in the first 
quarter reflecting in part weak auto sales housing construction 
which also has been hard hit by the feds antiinflation campaign 
dropped by 46 percent in the first quarter the poorest performance 
in a year 
the federal reserve signaled last week that it had begun lowering 
interest rates slightly amid signs that inflationary pressures are 
abating somewhat that move is expected to revive the fortunes of 
interestrate sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at an annual level of 4077 trillion in the first quarter 
the latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by the 
blue chip economic indicators newsletter put the consensus growth 
forecast this year at 27 percent down significantly from gnp 
growth of 39 percent in 1988 the best performance in four years 
the bush administration which needs significant growth to lower 
the budget deficit without the need to resort to a tax increase is 
more optimistically forecasting growth this year of 32 percent 
that estimate will be revised by midjuly and administration 
officials have indicated that they expect to lower their growth 
figure somewhat

a private space research organization said 
thursday it has asked for proposals from satellite manufacturers to 
build a probe to look for water on parts of the moon that have never 
seen daylight 
gregg maryniak executive vice president of the space studies 
institute said the probe can be built for 5 million and sent to 
the moon in 1992 with a little bit f help from the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
for example he told a news conference nasa has in storage an 
apolloera gamma ray spectrometer that could be dusted off and used 
to map the moons surface and search for water at the poles areas 
of which never face the sun 
nasa or rocketlaunching firms could also carry the probe into 
orbit as nonpaying cargo either on the space shuttle or as a 
hitchhiker on a rocket taking a satellite to an orbit 22300 miles 
above earth maryniak said 
he said ssi a 12yearold organization supported by 4000 
private members is looking for financing from aerospace 
corporations and organizations 
the six teams of astronauts who visited the moon in the 19691972 
period all landed closer to the equator of the moon than to the 
poles and the question of whether there is water to be found in the 
shadowed area never was answered 
finding water which is composed of hydrogen and oxygen the 
fuel for chemical rockets would be of enormous value to future 
space exploration the national commission on space recommended such 
a search as its first priority it takes less than onetwentieth the 
energy to lift materials form the moon as it does from earth

the man nominated as commissioner of the 
internal revenue service told congress on thursday that he wont 
tolerate harassment of whistleblowers who point out agency problems 
privates often know a lot more about fighting wars than the 
generals fred t goldberg jr told the senate finance committee 
which is considering his nomination if they cant feel free to 
communicate their perceptions we will lose touch 
goldberg who served two years as chief counsel to the irs also 
condemned illegal leaks of confidential tax information such as 
apparently occurred in the case of former house speaker jim wright 
dtexas 
while wright was the subject of an ethics investigation that 
eventually led him to resign news reports quoted unnamed irs 
sources as saying wrights taxes were being investigated 
the fastest way to lose faith with the american people is to 
have them believe we disclose that confidential information 
goldberg said 
sen david pryor dark questioned goldberg about recent 
allegations of irs wrongdoing some of which could involve criminal 
activity 
misconduct will not be tolerated in this institution 
goldberg said 
goldberg praised the new taxpayer bill of rights designed to 
help taxpayers who run into trouble with the irs as essential to 
sound tax administration 
goldberg 41 would succeed lawrence b gibbs who left earlier 
this year to resume a private law practice

newly filed documents detail how ferdinand 
marcos allegedly looted the philippines using kickbacks dummy 
corporations and war reparations with japan to amass 5 billion a 
newspaper reported today 
the papers were filed wednesday in federal court to amend a 
3yearold lawsuit brought by the philippine government which seeks 
50 billion in damages against the deposed philippine president and 
his wife imelda 
the documents portray the couple as sophisticated schemers who 
ran the philippines as though it were their own personal enterprise 
the los angeles times reported 
the lawsuit accuses the marcoses of racketeering from 1965 to 
1986 illegally transporting stolen money to the united states and 
laundering investments through associates and front companies 
the two were indicted last year in federal court in new york on 
similar allegations 
marcos was reported in very critical and unstable condition this 
morning at st francis medical center in honolulu 
attorney john j bartko of san francisco who represents the 
couple was not in his office this morning a secretary said 
the documents provide the most complete public description to 
date of how the marcoses amassed their wealth over two decades said 
ronald l olsen he and alan d bersin head a team of lawyers 
representing the philippine government 
listed are bank accounts allegedly controlled by the marcoses and 
their associates in the philippines switzerland hong kong 
lichtenstein and great britain the times said 
the new filings also list dummy firms allegedly used to launder 
money along with others that allegedly diverted millions of dollars 
in philippine government proceeds from sugar coconut and other 
commodity sales 
the customs service in honolulu is holding millions of dollars in 
jewelry and filipino pesos and five handguns that the marcoses are 
trying to recover a federal court case on that matter is pending 
the lawsuit by the government of president corazon aquino is one 
of 40 cases pending against the marcoses in this country and in the 
philippines 
besides the marcoses the nine defendants in the los angeles case 
include saudi arabian millionaire adnan khashoggi who lives in 
switzerland and roberto d benedicto a former marcos associate who 
is a federal fugitive from criminal charges in new york stemming 
from many of the same allegations outlined in this suit 
other defendants are the california overseas bank in los angeles 
and the redwood bank in san francisco which were allegedly 
controlled by marcos and his associates and three companies krodos 
properties nv of the netherlands antilles al djebel corp of the 
cayman islands and lei investments ltd of the channel islands 
frederick j hoey chief administrative officer of redwood bank 
said he had not been served with papers in the case and therefore 
would not comment 
among other things the documents accuse the marcoses of 
embezzling philippine assets and taking kickbacks from companies 
doing business in that country 
one item states that from july 1965 to february 1986 the marcoses 
received 53 million in kickbacks on government contracts negotiated 
with seven japanese citizens as part of a war reparations treaty

the supreme court on thursday made it easier 
for communities to turn down the volume at rock concerts a decision 
freespeech advocates found disquieting 
the court by a 63 vote upheld new york citys effort to avoid 
earsplitting noise levels in central park by requiring sponsors of 
rock concerts to use a sound system operated by a citydesignated 
engineer 
such requirements dont violate the freedomofexpression 
guarantees of the constitutions first amendment the court said 
but dana beal political coordinator for a concertsponsoring 
organization called rock against racism said the ruling strikes at 
the heart of rock 
bit by bit each municipality in the country will be able to 
turn rock n roll into easy listening music beal said 
the decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that would 
have forced city officials to devise a less restrictive way to deal 
with what they deem excessively loud entertainment 
this lessrestrictivealternative analysis has never been a 
part of the inquiry into the validity of a time place and manner 
regulation on expression justice anthony m kennedy wrote for the 
court 
the citys sound amplification guideline is narrowly tailored 
to serve substantial and contentneutral governmental 
interests he wrote accordingly it is valid under the first 
amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of 
expression 
in a dissenting opinion justice thurgood marshall said the court 
plays to our shared impatience with loud noise to obscure the 
damage that it does to our first amendment rights 
marshall called new yorks requirement for a cityrun sound 
system an impermissible prior restraint and said such 
government actions should be subjected to the same scrutiny as 
regulations based on an expressions content 
judgments that sounds are too loud noiselike or discordant 
can mask disapproval of the music itself he said 
quoting one music critic the 80yearold marshall said new 
music always sounds loud to old ears 
he was joined in dissent by justices william j brennan and john 
paul stevens 
the citys noisecontrol campaign is aimed at protecting visitors 
to central parks sheep meadow a 13acre area decreed a quiet 
zone by mayor ed koch in 1985 and residents of fashionable 
central park west 
the city policy was challenged by rock against racism which 
sponsors an annual program of speakers and musical groups in the 
parks naumberg acoustic bandshell 
the losing lawyer in the case was william kunstler who a day 
earlier found himself on the winning side when the justices ruled 
that burning the american flag is a form of constitutionally 
protected political protest 
what the court gives with one hand it takes away with the 
other kunstler said now art is subject to government control 
something the framers of the constitution certainly would not have 
countenanced

baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti has 
substantial and heavily corroborated evidence that pete rose bet 
on his own teams games a lawyer for major league baseball told a 
judge today 
the statement by louis hoynes jr was baseballs first assertion 
that it has evidence that could get the cincinnati reds manager 
banned from baseball for life 
the associated press has learned the evidence includes an 
experts determination that roses handwriting is on betting slips 
involving reds games in addition a federal law enforcement 
official told the new york times that roses fingerprints are on the 
slips 
roses lawyers today asked common pleas judge norbert nadel for a 
temporary restraining order blocking giamattis hearing monday with 
rose in new york to consider the gambling allegations the lawyers 
charge that giamatti is biased 
there is evidence substantial and heavily corroborated 
evidence that mr rose bet large sums of money on major league 
baseball games and on games of the cincinnati reds hoynes said in 
arguing against the request 
rose who did not attend the hearing has consistently denied 
betting on baseball one of his lawyers robert stachler argued 
today that rose had been denied a fair investigation by giamatti 
hoynes today asked nadel to release to the public a 225page 
report by baseball investigator john m dowd on the allegations 
nadel refused 
dowds report includes three pete rose betting sheets 
supplied to investigators by paul g janszen who claimed to have 
run bets for rose to bookmaker ronald peters janszen later became 
an fbi informant 
roses lawyers revealed the sheets existence monday in their 
lawsuit and released correspondence that confirms rose supplied 
writing samples at baseballs request the lawsuit said nothing 
about the analysts conclusions 
janszen who last week completed a sixmonth sentence in a 
halfway house for failing to report income from the sale of 
steroids gave the betting sheets to federal authorities while he 
was investigated a source said 
he kept a copy and later supplied that to baseballs 
investigators when they started looking into roses alleged 
gambling the source said 
rose is claiming the sheets are forgeries a federal law 
enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the 
times he says he didnt write them but were as confident as we 
could be that he did 
rose speaking wednesday night after the reds lost a doubleheader 
to the braves at atlanta was informed of the reports on the 
handwriting and fingerprints 
thats not true he said before declining to comment further 
rose also is being investigated by a federal grand jury in 
cincinnati that is examining his taxes 
reuven j katz one of roses five lawyers declined to comment 
when asked about the betting slips 
rich levin a spokesman for giamatti also declined to comment 
in the suit roses lawyers allege that janszen stole three 
pieces of paper from the home of the reds manager 
robert a pitcairn jr another rose lawyer suggested in a may 
12 letter to dowd that janszen might have forged the sheets 
janszen is quite clever and has access to mr roses 
signature pitcairn wrote in fact we understand that mr rose 
has signed blank pieces of paper for janszen to use in connection 
with certificates of authenticity for various items janszen is not 
above transposing writing from one sheet to another or creating 
documents that would appear authentic

china executed seven more people thursday for 
attacking soldiers who crushed the prodemocracy movement and it 
charged 13 others with spying for taiwan and helping the student 
protesters 
the executions continued despite mounting international 
condemnation of the governments crackdown on internal dissent 
the seven put to death by the state had been convicted of burning 
military vehicles when the army marched into beijing on june 34 and 
drove thousands of demonstrators out of tiananmen square 
a poster board outside the beijing high court was filled with 
small arrest notices and those involving the condemned said they 
ranged in age from 18 to 33 there was a large red check indicating 
execution on each of the notices with the word proclaimed 
soldiers later tore the notices off the board 
so far 27 people have been put to death the seven in beijing 
and on wednesday three in shanghai and 17 in jinan 
the shanghai residents were condemned of leading an angry mob 
that burned a train on june 6 after it smashed through a barricade 
set up by protesters killing six people 
the 17 in the northeastern city of jinan were among 45 people 
convicted at a public rally of 10000 of seriously endangering 
public order a local reporter said they were common criminals not 
associated with the student movement but a radio broadcast said 
they had taken part in disturbances in shandong province 
jinan like many other chinese cities was rocked by 
demonstrations and riots after the military crackdown ended seven 
weeks of protests in beijing 
police since have arrested more than 1600 nationwide for 
participating in what the government calls the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
many nations including the united states appealed to china for 
clemency for the condemned and denounced the executions when the 
government carried them out 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said thursday it was 
unwise and futile for other countries to try to dictate how 
china should handle its domestic turmoil 
china hopes to maintain relations with the united stats but we 
firmly oppose the american government interfering in chinas 
internal affairs and exerting pressure on china li said at a 
weekly press briefing 
the bush administration has cut off military sales and toplevel 
contacts to protest chinas suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement 
in announcing the arrests of the 13 people charged with spying 
for taiwan national television news showed secretly filmed scenes 
of the accused mixing with demonstrators and joining in chants 
during rallies in tiananmen square it also showed secret codes and 
invisible ink allegedly used by the men all chinese citizens 
china has maintained that the student protesters were manipulated 
by outside forces 
news reports said the 13 were recruited by military intelligence 
officers of the nationalist government on taiwan and by local 
agents 
chinas xinhua news agency quoted the state security ministry as 
saying that taiwan ordered the alleged spies to exploit the 
socalled democratic movement escalate it into an overall 
anticommunist movement and collect information for the taiwan 
secret service 
national television also gave prominent coverage to a meeting of 
state education commission head li tieying and a delegation from the 
world bank 
li has been mentioned frequently in recent news reports 
bolstering theories he is rising in chinas political hierarchy and 
may be headed for a position on the powerful communist party 
politburo standing committee 
party officials are expected to meet soon and two moderates on 
the fivemember committee party general secretary zhao ziyang and 
party propaganda chief hu qili are expected to be officially ousted 
from their posts 
qiao shi the committee member responsible for security matters 
is expected to succeed zhao as party boss li is a candidate to fill 
hus position 
the moderates reportedly were stripped of their authority after 
losing a power struggle to senior leader deng xiaoping premier li 
peng and other political hardliners who backed the crackdown on the 
democracy movement 
zhao has not been seen since may 19 when he met with protesting 
students in tiananmen square and expressed sympathy for their 
demands including an end to official corruption and a free press 
premier li imposed martial law on the city the next day

misery gore on the shore of moosehead lake in northern maine 
was created in the early 1800s by mistake according to legend two 
sets of township boundary lines established by separate surveying 
teams inadvertently left a sliver of land in between 
what remained was a 17milelong string beanshaped tract only 
a halfmile wide at its widest point that became known as misery 
gore its not clear how the misery part of the name came about but 
gores are small uusually triangular pieces of land 
the legislation signed by gov john r mckernan corrects the 
surveying error and gives pieces of the area to adjoining 
unorganized townships a designation for roughly half of rural maine 
the bill also frees scott paper co which owns most of the land 
in misery gore from having to maintain two sets of property lines 
maine is not left without its gores however still remaining on 
the map are moxie gore hibberts gore and veazie gore among others

it took john dezell 25 years but hes 
finally passed the bar exam on his 10th attempt 
it takes persistence and knowledge the 56yearold insurance 
salesman said but i would always tell people i would trade some 
of that persistence for more knowledge 
neither the oregon bar association nor the state supreme court 
keeps track of this kind of effort but dezell figures he holds the 
state record for most attempts on the bar exam 
along the way dezell learned a lot about broken dreams he 
received an appointment to the us naval academy but was forced 
out by a medical problem 
he earned a law degree from lewis amp clark college in portland 
but failed the bar exam three straight times the maximum allowed 
in 1966 he turned to selling insurance to support his family 
then the us supreme court ruled it was unconstitutional to 
restrict the number of times someone could take the bar exam 
so with encouragement from his wife dezell decided in 1986 to 
try again 
dezell didnt do very well in his first comeback bid but did a 
little better the next five times until last july he missed passing 
by just one point 
i thought it was within my reach finally he said i was 
studying and reading law books most of the time 
dezell said if he hadnt passed februarys test on his 10th 
attempt he still would be trying 
im very committed to the practice of law and im going to 
enjoy it dezell said

hundreds of civil rights activists 
boarded buses thursday to retrace the trail of the 1960s freedom 
riders and honor three slain volunteers many carried with them a 
new attitude about this southern state 
im leaving with an improved image of mississippi said 
minnie sutton 65 of new york this state has made strides 
forward although it looks like theres still a ways to go 
sutton was among 470 pilgrims who arrived in a caravan of 13 
buses from new york and philadelphia pa to attend ceremonies 
wednesday in philadelphia miss honoring three civil rights 
workers who were slain 25 years ago 
more than 1000 people went to a church once burned by the ku 
klux klan to hear veteran civil rights activists and state officials 
pay tribute to the work of james chaney andrew goodman and michael 
schwerner during a commemoration of their deaths on june 21 1964 
on thursday 10 chartered buses left meridian en route to 
washington and additional ceremonies the caravan modeled on the 
northtosouth freedom rides of the 1960s will end in new york 
later in the week 
several of those boarding the buses described thier trip as a 
learning experience and several agreed with sutton that improvements 
had occurred in mississippi in the years since the killings 
secretary of state dick molpus a philadelphia native who was 14 
at the time of the slayings said the ceremony was good for 
mississippians and for people acorss this country 
we were able to send the message out very clearly that a new 
day has dawned here in our state and at the same time we had the 
opportunity to acknowledge a dark corner of our past said molpus 
who offered an apology in remarks to wednesdays ceremony 
obviously things arent perfect in mississippi but because of 
the turmoil of our past there is a special racial sensitivity and 
we hope that sensitivity can serve as a beacon for the rest of the 
nation molpus said 
we deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago he said 
we wish we could undo it every decent person in philadelphia and 
neshoba county feels that way 
the observance in front of the mount zion methodist church 
where chaney goodman and schwerner had been conducting a black 
voter registration meeting the night they were killed showed that 
mississippi and america are far different places than they were 25 
years ago gov ray mabus said 
after leaving the church the three men were arrested on a 
traffic violation and taken to the neshoba county jail in 
philadelphia 60 miles northeast of jackson 
they disappeared after being released and an fbi investigation 
concluded they were shot to death by members of the ku klux klan 
their bodies were found 44 days later buried in an earthen dam 
schwerner 24 and goodman 20 were white volunteers from the 
new york city area chaney was a 21yearold black man from meridian

the only son of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini wants a role in irans hierarchy following his fathers 
death but is not sure what to aim for tehran radio reported 
thursday 
the report quoting hojatoleslam mohammad ali ansari indicates 
ahmad khomeini wont run in presidential elections scheduled july 28 
when we have been with him ahmad we have never heard a word 
which would indicate his participation or his aim of participating 
in political issues ansari said in an interview with tehran 
radio which was monitored in nicosia 
ansari is a leading radical clergyman working at the ayatollahs 
office and a close friend of ahmad khomeini 
the younger khomeini allied himself with radicals when his father 
unleashed a resurgence of fundamentalism in february calling on 
moslems to kill british writer salman rushdie for allegedly 
blaspheming islam in his novel the satanic verses 
i think that society expects a person who has been trained at 
the side of the imam like him ahmad to be always on the stage 
in the path of the advancement of the imams aspirations and this 
is also what he intends to do ansari said 
however he stressed no firm decision has been taken by him 
iranians called the revolutionary patriarch who died of a heart 
attack june 3 their imam or supreme leader khomeini was 86 years 
old 
several officials had predicted the younger khomeini who was his 
fathers closest adviser would exploit the wave of emotion 
engulfing iran after khomeinis death to advance his political 
ambitions 
khomeinis daughter zahra mustafavi said in a recent interview 
that ahmad had aspired to become president since 1981 but that her 
father always insisted on keeping his children out of politics 
she said she expected ahmad to run for presidency this year but 
he still had not declared any plan six days before the consitutional 
period for announcing candidacy ends june 28 
the powerful parliament speaker hashemi rasfsanjani is the only 
candidate for the post 
rafsanjani who also is acting commander in chief of the armed 
forces leads the socalled pragmatists who advocate a more open 
policy toward the west and an end to the isolation imposed since 
khomeinis 1979 islamic revolution 
rafsanjani 55 is allied with ali khamenei irans president 
since 1981 who cannot run for reelection when his second term 
expires next month

city councilor richard chapman likes to 
quote the late supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes as he 
fights a recall campaign that began when he successfully sponsored 
an antismoking ordinance 
he said your right to throw a punch stops where my nose 
begins said chapman i think thats very apropos for the 
smoking issue 
elected to the council from a heavily republican district two 
years ago democrat chapman has angered prosmoking groups so much 
that they are seeking his removal in an election tuesday 
the ordinance that he sponsored was passed last fall by an 81 
vote and took effect april 19 similar laws are in effect in more 
than 300 cities for now violators are simply receiving a warning 
but beginning july 19 they will face up to a 100 fine for each 
offense 
smokers rights of new mexico contends the council violated the 
civil rights of thousands of tobacco users by prohibiting smoking in 
such places as offices art galleries shopping malls libraries 
theaters bingo parlors taxis and buses 
its an overregulation of government and discriminatory because 
it segregates the smokers from nonsmokers said dorothy jameson 
one of the recall backers it is making a criminal act out of a 
legal act 
if the recall is successful said jameson supporters hope it 
will be a message to the council to reconsider the ordinance the 
group had no plans to seek removal of other council members she 
said 
we feel the person who wrote it is the one we should go 
after said jameson 66 who by her estimation averages a pack of 
cigarettes a day 
only the 20000 registered voters in chapmans northeast 
albuquerque district are eligible to vote for the recall proposal 
to pass it must get not only a majority of the votes cast tuesday 
but also more than half the number of votes cast in the 1987 city 
council election 
chapman said his campaign against the recall has received more 
than 5600 in contributions and he he expects the tobacco industry 
to make at least a token contribution to the other side 
this is a landmark situation for them and if they were 
successful in the recall then theyd have something going he 
said id be very surprised if they dont do a computerized 
mailing to smokers 
they are not involved countered jameson its just a bunch 
of people beginning to stick up for their rights 
she and other recall supporters go so far as comparisons to 
events in the early days of the nazis rise to power 
a friend of mine was raised in germany during the war and she 
said it started out on a very low key said gloria mitchell also 
of smokers rights of new mexico one by one their rights were 
taken away its like a mouse eating away at a mound of cheese a 
bite at a time and pretty soon the whole cheese is gone 
on the other side a letter to the editor from lindsay mcmurray 
said until smokers become responsible for their actions someone 
has to make reasonable and responsible choices for all citizens 
chapman said he was not surprised by the furor created by the 
ordinance but he said the council was merely adopting a policy that 
many of the larger private companies and the citys school system 
already had in place he said that he had never heard of another 
official facing a recall election because of an antismoking 
ordinance 
chapman also cited a study done last year for the american lung 
association that showed a far greated number of people than 
previously estimated up to 46000 a year die from passive smoking 
inhaling the smoke from cigarettes of other people 
were talking large numbers of people that if they were to go 
to one place and die at the same time it would be a national 
disaster chapman said but they all go to their individual 
hospitals and homes and die an agonizing slow and private death 
that just doesnt show up 
only about 15 percent of the registered voters in the district 
3885 voted in the city election two years ago both chapman and 
his opponents expect a light turnout again tuesday although he 
endured 100degree temperatures this week in a doortodoor campaign 
im taking it absolutely serious chapman said a recall 
has never happened in albuquerque and when people hear the word 
they assume you have done something illegal or immoral my job is to 
convince them that i havent

a federal judge has ordered the yahweh sect to pay 
940000 to tenants who lost their homes in a strongarm eviction 
that ended in the deaths of two residents at a crimeridden 
apartment complex 
the tenants attorney called thursday for a police investigation 
of the sect saying the civil trial testimony demonstrated that the 
whiterobed yahwehs engaged in a policy of violence against those 
who opposed them 
they firebombed an entire block in delray beach and they were 
involved in slayings in other cities thomas equels said i 
think the state and federal government need to carefully examine the 
judges findings here 
in delray beach after some residents took offense at the 
yahwehs doortodoor proseletyzing someone threw firebombs into 
apartments no one was injured and the crime is unsolved witnesses 
also mentioned slayings including the unsolved killing of a former 
sect member 
the yahwehs attorney ellis rubin said he would appeal the 
ruling saying the sect should not be blamed for what a few members 
did 
were appealing as a matter of religious freedom rubin said 
if a catholic commits a crime you dont punish the pope or the 
priests because of his wrongdoing 
us district judge james kehoe issued his decision wednesday in 
the lawsuit filed by 27 former residents of an opalocka apartment 
complex against the temple of love the miamibased mother church 
run by the sects leader yahweh ben yahweh 
the church which takes a strong stand against drugs moved to 
buy the apartments in 1986 after the previous owner abandoned them 
saying crack dealers and criminals had taken over the complex 
they will go into a distressed area that is overrun by drug 
dealers and criminal element and they will clean them up kick out 
all the wrongdoers and then either sell or make housing available 
for poor people rubin said 
the yahwehs who teach that blacks are the true chosen people of 
god run businesses and property in predominantly black 
neighborhoods the opalocka apartment building was eventually 
abandoned and now is empty 
in the opalocka case the yahwehs many carrying sixfoot wooden 
staffs evicted everyone in the complex threatening residents and 
dumping their belongings on the street according to the lawsuit 
which called the tactics a terrorist occupation strategy 
on oct 30 1986 two tenants who publicly opposed the evictions 
were shot and killed sect member robert rozier was later convicted 
of murder in the case and testified in the tenants lawsuit 
he said yahweh ben yahweh had tortured sect members and taught 
them ritual murder techniques but other witnesses disputed his 
account he also recounted acts of violence allegedly committed by 
the sect in other communities 
the judge did not rule on who was responsible for the deaths of 
the two tenants citing conflicting testimony 
but he found that the church had engaged in running a criminal 
enterprise extortion and assault and ordered it to pay 10000 to 
each tenant for emotional distrress as well as reimburse them for 
six times the value of the belongings they lost an additional 
500000 in punitive damages also will be divided among the tenants 
former tenant shadell hamilton brotherinlaw of one of those 
killed said he was pleased by the verdict recalling his initial 
sense of helplessness 
i gave up i said that there wasnt any justice that nothing 
would be done about it because there were so many things they got 
away with before hamilton said

natural erosion apparently has blunted 
a spike of light dubbed the sun dagger that ancient pueblo 
indians are believed to have used to mark the summer solstice 
the dagger was formed by light shining between 9foottall 
sandstone slabs sitting just below the top of the 500foottall 
fajada butte in chaco canyon in northwestern new mexico on the 
solstice the longest day of the year the light would shine on a 
spiralshaped petroglyph etched on rock behind the slabs 
but erosion apparently caused a rock to shift and on wednesday 
the daggershaped pattern of light missed its summersolstice mark 
on the petroglyph for perhaps the first time in 1000 years 
researchers said instead the light shined above and to the left of 
the indian pattern 
were used to this thing acting like a clock physicist rolf 
sinclair said wednesday 
the dagger widened and lengthened into an overgrown carrot 
said anna sofaer an artist and archaeoastronomer who discovered 
the dagger in 1977 in chaco culture national historical park which 
contains numerous ancient stone dwellings 
the rock formation also cast distinctive light patterns at the 
winter solstice and the fall and spring equinoxes when day and 
night are of equal length 
the petroglyph near the canyons south entrance was believed to 
have been carved between ad 950 and 1150 at the peak of the 
anasazi culture that once thrived in chaco canyon 
sinclair sofaer and others contend rocks originally might have 
been manipulated to cause the sunlight patterns 
but on sunday a group that included sinclair discovered that one 
of the rock slabs had shifted and had altered the phenomenon 
its very serious and sad ms sofaer said we knew when we 
first saw the site that it had a fragility that was remarkable 
michael zelik a physics and astronomy professor at the 
university of new mexico said the alteration raises questions about 
how much or how often rocks have moved previously at the site and 
about just how old it really is 
however sinclair said its clear the rocks have not moved much 
if at all over the years he said the erosion which caused the rock 
to slip might be due to 10 years of relatively wet weather at chaco

bulgaria said thursday that 250000 ethnic 
turks have applied to emigrate to turkey and 150000 already have 
their passports for an exodus from the communist country 
deputy foreign minister ivan ganev giving the figures at a news 
conference said about 50000 bulgarian moslems have crossed the 
border into turkey in the past month 
in keeping with bulgarian practice he refused to speak of ethnic 
turks the estimated 1 million ethnic turks in bulgaria about 
oneninth of the countrys population have been forced to adopt 
bulgarian names since 1984 and had their language and religious 
rites banned 
in ankara turkish officials said thursday nearly 55000 people 
have crossed into turkey from bulgaria since last month when police 
used clubs and dogs to break up demonstrations by the ethnic turks 
officials said seven people were killed but western diplomats say 
up to 30 died 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said up to 5000 
turks many of whom openly protesting ethnic and religious 
discrimination have been expelled since then 
the mass voluntary emigration began may 29 when president todor 
zhivkov said any bulgarian citizen could leave the country zhivkov 
clearly alluded to bulgarian turks who have been receiving 
passports under a new law that was passed in parliament in may 
an official in haskovo a town in southeastern bulgaria told the 
associated press on wednesday that his office has issued up to 2000 
passports a day since june 4 
thousands of ethnic turks many of them farmers and construction 
workers were observed this week on their way out of bulgaria with 
every piece of property they could take 
government officials at the news conference indicated the labor 
drain is already disrupting agriculture and many industries 
ivan angelov a government adviser said those departing had 
withdrawn up to 260 million from banks adding the sum might reach 
1 billion if people keep leaving 
to cope with the sudden loss of manpower ganev said the the 
government will order longer working hours relocate workers 
reschedule summer vacations and start a crash retraining program 
in addition manpower is to be moved from not critical to 
critical industries or areas ganev told the news conference 
without elaborating 
bulgaria has been short of labor even before the current wave of 
emigration and at least 30000 vietnamese are employed in bulgarian 
factories 
throughout the news conference ganev and five other senior 
government officials blamed the huge outflow of turks on turkish 
propaganda and instigation 
turkey has whipped up a psychosis among the moslem 
population ganev said accusing turkish premier turgut oezal of 
repeatedly issuing military threats against bulgaria 
bulgarias christian slavs and ethnic turks have been deeply 
suspicious of one another since the fivecentury rule of turkeys 
ottoman empire 
asked if bulgaria would accept the assistance of the un high 
commissioner for refugees he said we have no refugees so we do 
not need him

a deepsea inspection of the bismarck suggests 
that the most powerful battleship in adolf hitlers navy was 
scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the british in a 
celebrated battle underwater explorer robert d ballard said 
thursday 
during a 90minute news conference ballard described how he his 
oceancrawling robot located the bismarck sitting upright and 
proud two weeks ago 
then the american oceanographer whose father was of british 
background and whose mother was of german heritage addressed 
himself to the german people in german 
i am an underwater explorer not a treasure hunter he said 
translating himself back into english we found no human remains 
we touched nothing and took nothing the future of the bismarck 
is in the hands of the german people 
he said he will disclose its exact location only to germany so 
germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship 
which sank after a battle may 27 1941 
ballard a senior scientist at the woods hole oceanographic 
institution in massachusetts said structural evidence satisfied him 
that the germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to 
surrender or allowing her to be sent down by british fire 
only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one 
piece ballard said it appears the crew opened it up along its 
entire length it was clearly flooded stem to stern 
maybe the germans didnt want it taken as a war prize he 
added 
it is known that two years earlier hitler ordered the german 
pocket battleship graf spee scuttled after it was cornered in the 
neutral port of montevideo uruguay and attacked by british ships 
hitler apparently wanted to keep the british from learning the 
secrets of the graf spees construction and weapons 
in the 1941 battle the bismarcks main guns were quickly knocked 
out and the attacking british ships were out of range of her 
secondary guns ballard said so its was helpless and taking 
hundreds of hits its sinking clearly inevitable 
rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabriccovered 
british biplanes it was unable to escape 
asked if the german commander couldnt have surrendered by 
ceasing fire ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas 
it would have been unlikely that the british would have recognized 
that the germans were giving up 
again he speculated perhaps the germans did not want the ships 
technologically advanced equipment to fall into british hands 
the bismarck was found by ballard in more than 15000 feet of 
water about 600 miles west of brest france he said it was in 
remarkably good shape elegant well preserved 
before the battle british prime minister winston churchill had 
left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit 
with a ringing threeword command sink the bismarck 
of the bismarcks 2200man crew only about 115 survived 
british ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of 
german sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might 
have been a german uboat german vessels later rescued only five 
more survivors 
the story has been recounted in books songs and a movie 
the sinking occurred only eight days after the bismarck left 
gdynia poland for her first operation if unstopped it could have 
posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut 
british morale at a time when england stood virtually alone against 
combined german sea and air power 
the british sent the warship hood after the bismarck but within 
five days of going to sea the bismarck had sunk the hood in a 
threeminute engagement with the loss of all but three of the 
vessels crew of 1419 
the hood was a symbol of british sea power and its loss stunned 
the british public and the war government and made sinking the 
bismarck a mission of crucial importance 
ballard said under laws of the sea the bismarck remains the 
property of the german people 
the sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same 
remotecontrolled robot that ballard used four years ago to find the 
wreck of the titanic the british passenger liner that sank in 1912 
after striking an iceberg

seven texas women filed a 100 million lawsuit 
thursday against state farm insurance co one of the nations 
largest insurance firms alleging its hiring practices for years 
have discriminated against women and minorities 
their classaction lawsuit accuses state farm of reserving for 
white men the jobs of sales agents claims adjusters and 
underwriters 
this is a very valuable job and is a job that historically was 
passed on by nepotism and cronyism in what generally is described as 
a good old boys network said guy saperstein an oakland calif 
attorney who won a similar lawsuit against state farm in that state 
last year 
this case is like that case its brought on behalf of all 
women and we think its representative of what happened to women in 
texas there were a lot of tactics used to discourage women he 
said 
he alleged women were told they would need a large investment to 
become an agent that night work could be dangerous and that the 
long hours could disrupt their family life 
none of those statements is true he said whats amazing 
about the texas case is meeting these women and how it took me back 
to california their stories are almost identical to what i heard in 
california 
the texas case stems from complaints filed by the women in 1980 
with the us equal employment opportunity commission 
jim stahly a spokesman for state farm based in bloomington 
ill said he knew little of the lawsuit but insisted the company 
had been cooperating with the eeoc 
in fact all along the way weve asked the eeoc to identify 
those individuals who believed they had been discriminated against 
to correct any injustices there may have been but the eeoc has not 
provided us with the names he said 
he said the companys 895 agents in its texas region included 126 
women and 125 minorities 
plaintiff judith grube of austin said she applied for a state 
farm job in 1982 after working as a secretary for a state farm agent 
but was told she did not have a college degree and did not fulfill a 
minimum net worth requirement 
she now works for farmers insurance co and described herself as 
an awardwinning agent who has generated more business than any 
other female agent in the company

the soviet union on thursday strengthened its ties 
with iran agreeing to exchange delegations of moslem religious 
leaders and indicating it would send weaponry to its islamic 
neighbor 
the agreement with iran came as the soviet union struggles with a 
resurgence of islamic fundamentalism and conflicts between its 
christians and 50 million moslems 
the agreement was part of a broad declaration signed by president 
mikhail s gorbachev and iranian parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani whose visit to the soviet union has defrosted a decade 
of icy relations 
it implies future soviet weapons sales to iran by promising the 
superpowers cooperation in strengthening the defense capacity 
of its southern neighbor at the same time the document commits 
both nations to strive to rid the world of aggression 
rafsanjani later sidestepped questions about arms deals he said 
only that iran was trying to be selfsufficient in arms but has some 
technical requirements that we would like to see met by various 
sources 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii told the 
house foreign affairs committee that us policy toward iran would 
be guided by developments in the country and not by its 
relationship with the soviet union 
the soviet union was iraqs major weapons supplier during the 
eightyear iraniraq war but even then the soviets arranged for 
the sale of arms to iran through third countries 
during a state dinner wednesday rafsanjani invited gorbachev to 
visit iran if gorbachev accepts he would be the first leader of a 
major power to visit tehran since the islamic revolution in 1979 
the declaration says both nations will strive for a broad 
acquaintance with each others life culture convictions customs 
and traditions it specifically called for the governments to 
exchange delegations of religious leaders 
the soviet union has been troubled in the past 1 years by unrest 
among its more than 100 ethnic groups especially the 50 million 
moslems on its southern borders 
moslem azerbaijanis fought with christian armenians resulting in 
more than 90 deaths last year and in recent weeks 100 people have 
been killed in the primarily moslem central asian republics in 
rioting prompted by ethnic and economic problems 
an official from one of those republics uzbekistan attributed 
the violence to a group trying to create a panislamic front 
aimed at hysteria and the ouster of the european population soviet 
reports occasionally mention iranian flags and photographs of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini being carried by demonstrators 
rafsanjani asked about the central asian clashes at a news 
conference thursday said his country would not interfere with 
soviet internal affairs 
however he added we consider mr gorbachev has a long way to 
come in providing freedoms and peoples participation in the 
democratic process he did not elaborate 
rafsanjani originally expected to leave thursday traveled to 
leningrad instead and was reportedly planning to stop in azerbaijan 
on his way home iran has a consulate in the republics capital 
which tehran radio called the moslem city of baku in announcing 
the changed itinerary 
at the news conference rafsanjani emphasized that the talks with 
gorbachev had gone well 
the optimism that we had before the meetings has been totally 
justified rafsanjani said 
on other issues rafsanjani 
accused the united states of unspecified plots and 
conspiracies against iran when asked about the possibility that 
relations would improve after the death of khomeini irans 
spiritual leader 
said khomeinis order stands for the killing of salman rushdie 
the british author of the novel the satanic verses which many 
moslems consider blasphemous khomeinis judgment was based on 
islamic law and this is not the kind of prescription that can be 
reversed there is no one in iran who could reverse it 
said afghans must be free to resolve their differences without 
outside interference after the withdrawal of soviet soldiers from 
their country more than four months ago 
gorbachev and rafsanjani agreed to cooperate in several areas 
including atomic energy space and gas processing 
rafsanjani suggested a sovietiranian space voyage and gorbachev 
ordered his deputies to begin working out the details 
rafsanjani emphasized in remarks distributed by tass on wednesday 
that several months before his death on june 3 khomeini called for 
better relations with the soviet union tass said gorbachev and 
khomeini exchanged messages in february and since then their 
foreign ministers have met four times

panicked families crowded the airport in a central 
asian desert town where four people were killed in ethnic violence 
official media reported thursday 
the communist party newspaper pravda said that although the town 
of novy uzen was quiet on wednesday its airport is packed with 
families trying to flee 
pravda also said the disturbances had spread to settlements about 
40 miles away in the kazakhstan republic about 500 people 
demonstrated in zhetibai and two people were hurt in munaishi the 
newspaper said 
it said ethnic kazakhs in novy uzen demanded sunday that all 
members of caucasus ethnic groups be evicted within a week more 
than onethird of novy uzens 56000 residents are from the caucasus 
the demand was accompanied by threats pravda said without 
elaborating 
the government newspaper izvestia called the demand 
anticonstitutional and said it could not be met 
the violence began friday during a fight at a dance and more 
than 50 police officers and soldiers were injured in rioting over 
the next four days 
hundreds of interior ministry soldiers were sent to the town and 
authorites imposed a 9 pmto6 am curfew 
officials on thursday tightened their control over novy uzens 
water sewer and electrical systems as well as food stores and a 
bread factory all targets of rioters who want to be able to 
dictate their own conditions to the authorities izvestia said 
ethnic kazakhs say the caucasus settlers dominate the oil 
industry jobs on which the town depends and receive preferential 
treatment in housing and other benefits 
the settlers also have set up private businesses that sell 
supplies in the isolated desert town for exorbitant prices izvestia 
said 
corrupt party and government workers in novy uzen also 
contributed to widespread discontent by getting involved in dirty 
deals the official news agency tass quoted top kazakhstan 
officials as saying 
in alma ata the republics capital an ethnic kazakh was named 
the regions new party chief to replace gennady kolbin an ethnic 
russian he left the post to become chairman of the peoples control 
committee which monitors government ministries tass reported 
the appointment of kolbin as party chief in 1986 touched off 
widespread rioting in alma ata that left hundreds injured and at 
least two dead 
the new party chief nursultan nazarbayev has been premier of 
kazakhstan since 1984 the 49yearold nazarbayev was the first 
soviet official to admit the 1986 unrest was ethnically motivated 
and not hooliganism as press reports claimed 
the former metal worker backs greater economic independence for 
the republic of more than 16 million tass said 
the unrest in novy uzen was the third outbreak of ethnic rioting 
in soviet central asia in the past six weeks 
in the worst of the violence native uzbeks attacked the meskhi 
turk minority in the fergana valley of eastern uzbekistan and about 
100 people were killed most of the victims were meskhi turks who 
were forcibly resettled in the valley in 1944 by the late dictator 
josef stalin 
the fergana region has quieted down and police there have been 
detaining people for inciting unlawful actions tass said

the new us official for 
african affairs said thursday he expects pretoria to make 
interesting proposals after the september general elections and 
hopes blacks will be ready to respond 
herman cohen assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
said he will talk to south african government officials and leaders 
of the outlawed african national congress during a trip to the 
region in july 
he spoke from washington in a special us information service 
hookup with four south african cities 
cohen repeatedly mentioned the new government of south 
africa apparently referring to the fact that national party 
leader fw de klerk is expected to replace retiring pw botha as 
president after september parliamentary elections they exclude 
voting by the 28 million black majority 
the national party which has ruled south africa for 41 years is 
virtually certain to remain in power 
cohen said he will visit lusaka zambia and tell exiled leaders 
of the anc south africas biggest guerrilla organization im 
expecting the new south african government to be coming up with some 
interesting proposals if the new government proposed a dialogue 
will you be ready 
if pretoria lifts a fouryear state of emergency cohen said 
there has to be a reciprocal element that political activity would 
be nonviolent 
he said this will be one of the major topics when albertina 
sisulu copresident of the banned united democratic front meets 
president bush next week mrs sisulu is prohibited from speaking in 
public or leaving her home at night without permission the passport 
allowing her to visit bush is the first granted her and is valid for 
only 30 days 
cohen said a visit to washington by de klerk still is the 
subject of diplomatic discussions 
he gave an overview of the bush administrations africa policy 
noting it still is under review 
you will see probably a more activist role of the united states 
on the issue of internal constitutional change in south africa what 
wed like to do is be more active in promoting a dialogue between 
the government and the black leadership i think we could be a 
catalyst 
he said the reagan administration had concentrated on un 
resolution 435 bringing independence to namibia and the withdrawal 
of cuban troops from angola settled by a transition plan now under 
way 
the next priority of our policy is trying to promote settlement 
in south africa itself cohen said the successful completion of 
435 could lead to more peacemaking mozambique and angola where 
rebels are fighting marxist governments are ready for peacemaking 
efforts 
he said the united states helped develop an african summit to 
resolve the angolan civil war that began thursday in zaire we may 
have a breakthrough cohen said 
he also saw a greater effort at multilateral diplomacy in 
southern africa coordinating with former colonizers portugal the 
united kingdom and west germany and greater cohesion in the 
us congress 
we welcome south africas new diplomatic effort in southern 
africa it has changed from a policy of destabilization to one of 
cooperation cohen said 
sanctions have had a very major impact on development of new 
thinking in south africa he said but bush wants to concentrate 
on dialogue 
but you cannot even begin that without the release of black 
leaders and the lifting of the emergency so nonviolent political 
activity can take place 
if progress on these lines is not made within two years of the 
new government it would be difficult for the us to hold back 
forces demanding increased pressure and it would be difficult for 
western europe and japan as well

a federal judge has rejected a request by 
former national security adviser john poindexter for access to 
classified documents in the irancontra case 
us district court judge harold greene also said poindexter must 
narrow his other requests for material 
the ruling follows statements last week by independent counsel 
lawrence walsh that prosecutors would abandon substantial portions 
of the indictment against poindexter

false statements to congress in connection with lt col oliver 
norths activities on behalf of the contras and a november 1985 arms 
shipment to iran 
walsh plans to retain portions of the indictment alleging that 
poindexter conspired with north and others in the obstructions and 
false statements he said he would seek dismissal of theft and wire 
fraud charges against poindexter pertaining to the diversion of iran 
arms sale proceeds 
poindexter should reformulate and limit his demands greene 
said in a fourpage order signed wednesday and made public thursday 
the judge rejected a wideranging request for classified 
documents that poindexter filed june 12 four days before walsh 
announced his intention to reduce the scope of the indictment 
an 64page request for material filed may 15 demanded that the 
government give poindexter all documents created between dec 1 
1981 and the present referring to us support for the contras 
poindexter also demanded notebooks diaries and other documents 
relating to former president reagan vice president bush cia 
director william casey and former secretary of state george shultz 
as well as all material tending to establish that reagan or bush 
directed the national security council staff to ensure that the

people without medical insurance not only are less 
likely to get into hospitals than insured patients they also get 
less treatment once theyre there a new study of boston hospital 
patients has found 
but the finding doesnt necessarily mean the uninsured get worse 
care because doctors may keep insured patients in the hospital 
longer than necessary and may give them more treatment than they 
need researchers said 
previous studies have revealed that the poor minorities and 
people without health insurance have less chance of getting medical 
care than others 
but there has been a feeling that once you get into the system 
everybody is treated the same said joel weissman a healthpolicy 
specialist at harvard school of public health and a coauthor of the 
new study what were seeing is that even after you get into the 
hospital these patterns persist 
weissman and dr arnold m epstein also of harvard examined the 
treatment of more than 65000 patients at 52 hospitals in the boston 
area during 1983 
they found that uninsured patients on average underwent fewer 
procedures and were discharged earlier than patients covered by blue 
cross the uninsured also were discharged earlier than medicaid 
patients the study said 
though the differences were not great they should serve as a 
red flag to spur further investigation weissman said in a 
telephone interview thursday 
more studies will be necessary to determine if the bostonarea 
trends reflect those in the rest of the nation said weissman who 
added that harvard is currently working to update the 1983 findings 
the study also found that people with different types of medical 
problems tended to end up at different types of hospitals with the 
major teaching hospitals and public hospitals taking the brunt of 
the tough cases among the uninsured 
although we lacked data on income and housing situation the 
results are consistent with the popular view of the urban public 
hospital as the provider of last resort for persons with multiple 
problems at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale the researchers 
said 
after correcting statistically for differences in severity of 
illness and other factors the researchers found that uninsured 
patients stayed in the hospital half a day less than blue cross 
patients 536 compared with 579 days 
the uninsured underwent about 7 percent fewer procedures 
operations or tests per stay than blue cross patients 116 vs 
125 respectively the researchers said 
the effects we found occurred in all types of hospitals 
including major teaching and public hospitals institutions 
commonly considered to be relatively blind to payment source the 
researchers reported in fridays journal of the american medical 
association 
though the results suggest that hospitals or physicians tailor 
peoples medical care according to ability to pay or that patients 
do so themselves to avoid high bills it doesnt necessarily mean 
the uninsured are getting inferior care the researchers said 
we know for example that lengths of stay have been decreasing 
nationwide during the last decade but so far there is little 
evidence that the quality of care has been reduced they said 
longer stays and more procedures among insured patients in the 
boston area may represent overuse of medical resources they said 
further research is warranted to clarify whether lower 
utilization represents inadequate care and whether alternative 
financial and organization arrangements can remedy the situation 
the researchers said

the crippled soviet ocean liner maxim gorky 
reached a remote archipelago for repairs thursday two days after 
its bow was ripped open when it hit an iceberg while on a cruise 
the ship reached coles bay on svalbard the largest of the 
spitzbergen archipelago said jan klyver an administrative official 
for the norwegian islands the secluded bay has no wharf or 
facilities but offers shelter from wind and waves he said 
the 630foot maxim gorky was kept afloat with pumps after a 
20foot gash was ripped in its bow and it took on 18000 tons of 
water during a midnight sun cruise in the norwegian sea 
all of the 575 passengers and 378 crew were rescued the 
passengers and some crew were brought to shelter at spitzbergen and 
flown home from there 
soviet spokesman andrei romanov told the norwegian news agency 
ntb the maxim gorky anchored in the bay with 184 crew aboard 
temporary repairs were being made there to allow the ship to sail to 
bremerhaven west germany its port of embarkation 
he did not estimate how long repairs would take soviet news 
reports said the ship would be back in service in three weeks 
the soviet newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said thursday the ship 
may have rammed a metal object frozen in the ice or that a large old 
piece of ice unexpectedly surfaced 
norwegian maritime experts said the maxim gorky was sailing too 
fast for conditions in an area clogged with drifting ice up to 20 
feet thick 
sigurn kleiven commander of the norwegian coast guard vessel 
senja which rescued passengers dimissed claims the soviet crew was 
drunk during the accident or rescue a norwegian doctor aboard the 
senja said wednesday that soviet sailors were intoxicated 
there was absolutely no drunkenness on the part of the soviet 
crew involved in the rescue kleiven was quoted as saying in the 
daily newspaper aftenposten he did say however that some waiters 
service personnel and passengers had been drinking 
some passengers spent seven hours in open boats among the ice 
floes waiting to be taken to safety and were given alcohol by the 
crew 
drinking alcohol during exposure to cold is a bad 
combination said mads gilbert the norwegian doctor

a prominent israeli history professor was 
stabbed to death in jerusalem on thursday and police said they were 
investigating whether the killing was a terrorist attack 
in the occupied west bank israeli troops shot a palestinian man 
to death and detained 30 others during a raid on the village of 
silwad an army spokesman said 
soldiers also shot and wounded four palestinian youths in clashes 
with stonethrowers in the occupied gaza strip arab hospital 
officials said 
the body of hebrew university professor menachem stern was found 
by schoolchildren in a park near israels parliament building 
police spokesman uzi sandori said 
stern 64 was stabbed several times in the chest sandori said 
he said robbery was ruled out as a motive because a watch and money 
were found on sterns body 
asked whether investigators believed terrorists were to blame 
sandori said this direction is also being checked 
israel television reported police have questioned 70 people 
mostly arabs and have detained two of the arabs 
army radio said israels shin bet secret service was called in to 
investigate 
stern a winner of israels top prize for academic excellence 
also lectured at harvard and oxford universities 
jewish academics said he was considered the worlds leading 
expert on the history of the jews during the second temple period 
166 bc to ad 70 when jews in the land of israel were ruled by 
greek and roman conquerors 
during this time the jews rebuilt their ancient temple in 
jerusalem for the second time and established their second 
independent commonwealth 
professor daniel schwartz an associate of sterns said he was a 
dedicated academician who was not involved in anything political 
he said stern was aware there were some dangers involved 
walking around jerusalem and that his wife was concerned about the 
park path he often took to work because it was out of sight 
the death of the arab in silwad raised to 528 the number of 
palestinians killed in the 18month uprising against israeli rule 
of the occupied west bank and gaza strip twentythree israelis also 
have died in the violence 
the army spokesmans office said 22yearold abdel raouf mohammed 
hamad was fatally shot after he refused to obey an order to stop 
when troops raided the community 12 miles north of jerusalem 
it was the latest in a series of searchandarrest missions to 
capture palestinian activists 
the arabs detained during the raid were suspected of stoning or 
firebombing cars of jewish settlers on nearby highways the army 
said 
palestinians in nearby villages said thursday they received 
unsigned warning notes from settlers threatening retaliatory action 
against any attacks 
we are going to be forced to take harsh measures against all 
those who are behind the disturbances said the fliers printed in 
arabic and strewn on village streets 
jewish settlers have been blamed for a series of attacks on 
palestinians in recent weeks the latest incident occured on tuesday 
after the funeral of an americanborn jewish settler frederick 
steven rosenfeld who allegedly was stabbed to death by palestinians

gun on arab laborers on a street near tel aviv wounding two the

so many people are obeying a new recycling 
law that newspapers were piled to the ceiling and trucks had to wait 
in line to drop trash at the local recycling center the city 
finally closed the center 
the national temple recycling center the main one in the city 
was inundated with newspapers cans and plastics after the city 
expanded its mandatory curbside pickup program which began this 
spring from 49000 households to 97000 in northwestern 
philadelphia 
the response amazed recycling officials who thought it would 
take much longer to educate people about the ordinance requiring 
them to sort recyclables and leave them at curbside 
previous experiences led us to expect about 30 percent 
participation said tom klein of the philadelphia recycling 
office instead unofficial surveys place it at close to 90 percent 
in the new recycling zone 
were planners and we try to do a good job of anticipation 
he said we just werent ready for that response 
neither was the recycling center almost within days the amount 
of recycled materials received at the plant jumped from 12 tons a 
day to 35 tons 
newspapers reached the ceiling bottles and cans gathered in 
mounds a fencedin area outside the plant once a parking lot 
became a storage area lines of recycling trucks waited to drop 
their cargo 
on june 16 the citys department of licenses and inspections 
closed the plant because of dangerous unhealthy conditions 
since then the backlog has eased except for newspapers they are 
a special problem because there is a newspaper glut on the 
recycling market said mjenzi traylor head of the plant its 
costing us 15 to 17 to bail a ton he said and for the most 
part were getting 5 or less per ton 
a recycling center in nearby bucks county has volunteered to take 
some of the excess but traylor said that is only a temporary 
solution 
the officials plan to meet monday to discuss ways of alleviating 
the situation were in a fortunate position because we have a 
number of major users of recycled paper here in the community 
said klein 
klein said the problems will not affect plans to expand the 
mandatory recycling program into the northeastern part of the city 
july 24 
he said the city has contracted with a separate recycling 
company waste management to handle the additional 45000 
households 
though the recycling is mandatory although klein said his office 
will not push the issue for the time being were having problems 
with 90 percent compliance he said why would we push to get it 
to 100 percent

lowpower testing of the reactor at the 
seabrook nuclear power plant was halted thursday because of a 
problem with a steam valve operators said 
the reactor was running at 3 percent of maximum power at the 
engineers shut it down said spokesman ron sher 
the valve remained open longer than it should have drawing too 
much steam away from the plants steam generators sher said 
under our strict operating procedures control room operators 
manually shut down the reactor 
he said the engineers went to work to correct the problem so the 
reactor could be restarted 
he said the valve was on the nonnuclear side of the plant hot 
pressurized contaminated water from the reactor flows through a 
heat exchanger and back to the reactor on the nonnuclear side 
water flows into the heat exchanger picks up heat from the nuclear 
side and becomes steam to drive the turbines that spin the plants 
generators 
sher said the valve directs steam that normally would drive the 
plants turbines back to a steam condenser instead he said the 
steam bypasses the turbines during lowpower testing 
because it stayed open more steam condensed to water thus 
cooling the system too quickly 
sher said the problem wasnt considered serious enough to warrant 
notifications to state and federal regulatory officials but nuclear 
regulatory commission observers were in the control room at the time 
sher said the valve one of about 6000 in the plant is not 
associated with three other valves that malfunctioned earlier this 
month delaying the start of the tests 
the reason we do tests is to ensure that all plant systems are 
working as designed the lowpower testing of the reactor in the 
past nine days has gone very well and this is the first 
interruption weve had in the schedule he said 
seabrook officials won regulatory permission to conduct the tests 
despite long opposition from massachusetts and antinuclear 
activists who argue nearby beaches and communities could never be 
safely evacuated in the event of an accident 
the plant has not yet won a commercial operating license but 
utility officials predict they will be selling seabrook power by the 
end of the year

britain has signed an agreement with the united 
states to help develop a new airlaunched nuclear missile a defense 
ministry spokesman said thursday 
the spokesman who refused to be identified said the agreement 
for a us feasibility study on updating one of britains key 
strategic weapons a sensitive issue with the soviet union was 
signed dec 1 but not announced at the time 
officials acknowledged the agreement after janes defense weekly 
reported it it said the american company martin marietta corp is 
investigating with british aerospace plc the possibility of 
developing a new tactical airtosurface missile 
the missile with a range of 250370 miles and fired from tornado 
bombers would replace britains aging we177 freefall nuclear bomb 
the spokesman said the us agreement did not mean that the 
british were abandoning a possible deal with france 
we have not signed a similar memorandum of understanding with 
the french but both american and french systems remain open as 
options for consideration he said 
however the anglofrench project appeared virtually certain of 
being abandoned it involved developing a longerrange version of 
frances asmp nuclear airtosurface missiles 
negotiations began about two years ago there has been no sign of 
progress and defense ministry sources have said in recent months 
that the french system is unsuitable for british bombers 
the strategic importance of airlaunched nuclear weapons has 
increased following the 1987 agreement between the united states and 
the soviet union to withdraw all their mediumrange landbased 
nuclear weapons from europe 
the soviet union has complained that updating airlaunched 
missiles violates the spirit of the 1987 agreement 
janes an authoritative magazine said a firm decision on 
developing with us companies a new weapon for britain was expected 
in 1992 
the plan is likely to attract criticism from the opposition 
united kingdom labor party the soviet union and others who consider 
its development inopportune in the present eastwest climate 
janes said 
the magazine said boeing aerospace co was competing with martin 
marietta for the british contract 
boeing has proposed a variation of its short range attack missile 
ii being developed for the us air force martin marietta has 
signed an agreement to investigate adapting its supersonic 
lowaltitude target being developed for the us navy janes said

tehran radio indicated thursday the 
british high courts decision allowing moslems to challenge 
britains blasphemy laws may help ease tension between the countries 
over the satanic verses 
in the first iranian reaction to the high court ruling monday 
the official radio said the move could perhaps be considered as a 
step aimed at correcting previous stances 
also on thursday iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
said in moscow the death sentence imposed on british author salman 
rushdie for writing the satanic verses still is in force 
despite the death of ayatollah ruholla khomeini 
the sentence issued by khomeini was based on islamic law and 
this is not the kind of prescription that can be reversed there 
is no one in iran who could reverse it ransanjani told a news 
conference after two days of talks with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the death sentence issued feb 14 sent rushdie into hiding and 
led to a break in relations between britain and iran 
in britain the moslem action group had sought to prosecute 
rushdie but a court refused to issue summonses on grounds britains 
law of blasphemy applies only to christians 
on monday britains high court granted abdal choudhury a 
spokesman for the moslem action group permission to challenge the 
lower courts decision 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said it seems that in view 
of the fact that everyone has conceded that the book is insulting 
and in view of the harm that has been done to that countrys 
reputation and political standing due to its irrational support for 
the satanic verses londons conservative government now finds it 
appropriate to revise its policies 
many moslems consider the satanic verses blasphemous british 
officials also have conceded that the book contained material that 
could be offensive but said this was no excuse for khomeini to 
incite murder

senators criticized the bush administration on 
thursday for failing to advocate harsh sanctions against foreign 
companies that spread chemical and biological weapons 
you dont have a policy position sen paul sarbanes dmd 
said in response to testimony from reginald bartholomew 
undersecretary of state for security assistance bartholomew 
appeared before the banking committees subcommittee on 
international finance 
bartholomew told the subcommittee the administration would 
support some sanctions with the president having the authority to 
say when they would be used 
but he said he opposed sanctions for past actions and said the 
use of us sanctions outside the united states would violate 
international law joan mcentee undersecretary of commerce for 
export administration said power to impose additional sanctions is 
not needed 
sen john heinz rpa accused the administration of having a 
double standard pointing out that the actions bush has taken 
against china for the killing of demonstrators are not based on 
international law 
what your are saying is that if a commercial party is involved 
they deserve to be treated better than the butchers of beijing he 
said if thats your position its very hard for us to accept 
it 
heinz is coauthor with sen robert dolerkan the senate 
minority leader of a bill that calls for curbing exports to the 
united states from companies that help countries get chemical or 
biological weapons 
he insisted on the need for congress to prod the administration 
to take action on trade matters 
the record is that when weve taken strong action weve gotten 
results heinz said when weve done nothing nothing happened 
toshiba is one example 
and ive got to tell you in my judgment it took the 
legislative equivalent of half a dozen atomic bombs to wake the 
west german government up on the imhausen sale first time they 
looked at it what did they say huh it couldnt happen here 
have you got any examples that say keeping this stuff quiet and 
doing nothing succeeds 
in the toshiba case a subsidiary of the japanese company sold the 
soviet union machines that could have been useful in protecting 
soviet submarines from detection by us forces a law approved by 
former president reagan curbed sales in this country by both the 
subsidiary and the parent company 
the imhausen firm is accused of helping libya build a plant to 
make poison gas the west german government has acted against the 
company 
senator you may be right in those specific cases 
bartholomew replied 
but if we here in the united states pass a law which 
automatically without discretion mandates sanctions where the 
operations of foreign companies are concerned we are concerned that 
the reaction of foreign governments will be that it is their 
business to police their companies it is their cooperation that we 
want 
sen timothy e wirth dcolo called the answers the worst he 
had heard in 15 years of experience in congress 
i get the impression you dont feel the sense of urgency all 
over the country he said 
bartholomew replied that the question was getting at least the 
priority in the bush administration that it is getting in the senate

the sudanese journalists union on 
thursday accused security authorities of violating press freedom by 
detaining six journalists and shutting down two newspapers an 
independent newspaper reported 
the daily alusbua also reported that one of the detained 
journalists had relayed an offer from prime minister sadek mahdi for 
ousted president gaafar nimeiri to end his exile in egypt and return 
home as a civilian 
alusbua said newspaper editor sidahmed khalifa met with mahdi 
before traveling to egypt to interview nimeiri and suggested the 
former military dictator be allowed home it said mahdi agreed a 
statement the president denies 
in cairo nimeiri said khalifa had relayed a verbal offer from 
mahdi to return to sudan and work and talk and criticize the 
political situation nimeiri said he had welcomed mahdis 
invitation but would have preferred it in writing 
mahdi denied he granted khalifa permission to invite nimeiri 
back he told the constituent assembly sudans parliament that he 
told khalifa he would hold the editor responsible if the interview 
with nimeiri was against the national interests of the government 
the alleged invitation reportedly was delivered several weeks 
before the military command disclosed sunday an abortive coup 
attempt by nimeiri supporters nimeiri says the report was 
fabricated to distract sudanese from the countrys myriad problems 
four journalists have been arrested and one newspaper closed down 
in connection with the reported coup attempt 
yusuf shanbali secretarygeneral of the sudanese journalists 
union said the government should use the courts not detentions and 
indefinite bans to prosecute journalists accused of misconduct 
we appreciate the critical circumstances but this does not 
justify trangressing the freedom of the press shanbali said 
the union rejects any breach of the freedom of the press 
press freedom did not exist here during nimeiris 16 years in 
power since his defense minister overthrew him in 1985 however 
the government has rid itself of all media organs except the 
national news agency and official radio and tv stations 
the first significant media restriction under the current 
civilian government came in spring when the army banned reports of 
military actions in the south where rebels fighting for more 
autonomy had captured key towns 
one newspaper the biweekly alrai apparently was singled out 
for ignoring the embargo on military news it was shut down in 
february and its editor mohammed medani tawfik was arrested 
after sundays coup plot announcement security authorities 
arrested editorinchief khalifa and closed his triweekly alwattan 
which had published a series of interviews with nimeiri 
also detained this week were salah mattar a journalist with the 
independent daily alkhartoum and three other reporters from 
alwattan and alrai

congress was told thursday that outofstaters 
are trashing ohio leaving buckeyes truly enraged about having 
tons of garbage heaped on them by their neighboring states 
an ohio official saying we could become the next new jersey in 
just a few years urged congress to slap a 40aton fee on 
longhaul garbage to discourage interstate trafficking in trash 
we simply do not have adequate disposal capacity to become the 
east coasts dumping ground richard sahli chairman of the ohio 
solid waste management advisory council told a house subcommittee 
donald deieso assistant commissioner of the new jersey 
department of environmental protection said we understand 
completely the concerns of states gaining garbage since new 
jersey had been a dump for new york and pennsylvania he suggested 
congress order every state to become selfsufficient 
ohio last year took in 24 million tons of outofstate waste 
double what came in the previous year nearly 20 percent of the 
waste disposed of in ohio is generated elsewhere and the heap is 
growing sahli told the transportation and hazardous materials 
subcommittee 
landfills are filling up or being closed because of pollution 
problems sahli said 
we in ohio have a homegrown crisis on our hands he said 
the importing of wastes has truly enraged the citizens of ohio 
were the dumping ground agreed rep thomas luken dohio 
chairman of the subcommittee 
witnesses said ohio isnt alone 
the natural resources defense council said 15000 landfills have 
closed over the past 10 years leaving about 5000 nationwide all 
of floridas landfills must close within 10 years because of threats 
to groundwater the environmental group added 
paul templet secretary of the louisiana department of 
environmental quality said that state is down to 40 landfills 
compared with 800 in operation in 1980 
solid waste management in louisiana has reached crisis 
proportions said templet who asked the subcommittee to consider 
a national recycling program and strict landfill guidelines 
rep bill richardson dnm said his state has been 
victimized by the lack of federal policy on solid waste 
states like mine are virtually unprotected he told the panel 
richardson asked the panel to consider his bill giving states the 
right to reject the interstate transfer of solid waste 
rep paul kanjorski dpa said he was introducing legislation 
to treat trash the same way the government treats lowlevel 
radioactive waste his bill would force states to develop regional 
compacts to deal with the garbage problem collectively 
the ohio official asked the panel to tax garbage sent long 
distances and then use the money to encourage recycling and to 
increase environmental protection agency funding for developing 
better ways of handling solid waste 
such a tax would act as an incentive to states to take care of 
their own waste disposal needs and not create devastating economic 
dislocation and potential environmental problems in communities 
located hundreds of miles away he said

a woman accused of shopping around at 
nurseries for a baby to steal was convicted thursday of killing a 
couple she had stalked for days snatching their 9dayold son and 
trying to pass him off as her own 
jurors who found joyce lynch guilty on all counts meet friday to 
begin deciding whether she should be executed by lethal injection or 
sentenced to life in prison without probation or parole 
mrs lynch 36 had accused her husband richard of killing 
beverly and joseph gibson jr on christmas eve 1987 drugging her 
and duping her into believing that she had given birth lynch 27 
faces a trial in september 
both were charged with two counts of murder two counts of felony 
murder one count of conspiracy and one count each of possession of 
a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony burglary and 
unlawful imprisonment 
the state contends the lynches shot the gibsons and took 
9dayold matthew gibson because mrs lynch could no longer have 
children 
prosecutors accused them of shopping around at nurseries 
until they stumbled upon matthew gibson 
they hunted the gibsons down stalked them for at least a week 
and murdered them to get that child deputy attorney general 
william nicholas said during closing arguments wednesday in kent

claimed her husband duped her into believing she was pregnant and 
told her she had given birth to matthew while she was asleep

drugged she thought it was a dream when she awakened there was a 
baby

daughter rebecca and 1yearold son john gregory

steps to fight the guerrillas 
it is too early to talk about final victory najib told 
members of the 22member supreme defense council and military 
commanders from afghanistans 28 provinces we should think in 
terms of how to get rid of the imposed war and put an end to it 
western journalists were invited to attend the inauguration of

and diplomats say it was called to plan a new strategy against the 
rebels 
najib used the occasion to renew attacks on pakistan which

too little is known about the spotted owl to 
justify closing off vast portions of the ancient forests of the 
northwest to logging the head of the us forest service said 
thursday 
i dont think we ought to penalize the people of the northwest 
throw people out of work close down towns until a biological 
decision can be made properly f dale robertson chief of the 
forest service said as two house subcommittees wrapped up two days 
of joint hearings 
robertson said his agency has begun a fiveyear study of the owl 
which is thought to nest only in the oldgrowth forests of 
washington state oregon and northern california 
he said there was insufficient scientific on the owl to justify a 
50 percent reduction in the timber harvest from the national forests 
of the northwest this year 
a federal judge in seattle has enjoined the agency from offering 
162 timber sales planned during the current fiscal year in those 
forests involving 14 billion board feet 
robertson said that represents roughly 25 percent of the timber 
sale program scheduled this year and said the injunction might be 
expanded so it would eventually affect sales involving 25 billion 
board feet or half of the sales planned in the region 
the injunction was sought by environmentalists who want to have 
the owl protected as a threatened or endangered species as part of 
their campaign to halt logging in the oldgrowth forests of the 
northwest the timber industry has claimed such protection would 
create an economic catastrophe for dozens of onemill towns in the 
region 
the us fish and wildlife service has proposed the owl for 
listing as a threatened species but it will take between 18 months 
and two years before a final decision is made 
the hearings were held by the national parks and public lands 
subcommittee of the house interior committee and the forests family 
farms and energy subcommittee of the house agriculture committee 
robertson said that 60 percent of the timber available for 
harvest in western oregon and washington was oldgrowth much of it 
prime habitat for the spotted owl 
robertson faced harsh criticism from oregon democratic rep peter 
defazio who charged the forest service had done little since the 
injunction was issued four months ago to soften its impact on the 
region 
are you trying to precipitate a crisis in the hope that 
congress will bail you out defazio asked adding that the agency 
has yet to appeal the injunction and took two months before it 
responded to a letter he wrote asking if there were alternative 
sales that could be offered quickly

datas ii the smallest of the crs for computer reservation system 
ventures 
we feel that justice is wrong berry said we really were 
surprised we felt that this partnership was giving the government 
what it wanted in terms of taking the reservation systems out of 
the ownership of individual airlines making it an autonomous 
company 
said robert l crandall chairman and president of american 
while the decision clearly means that we cannot create a joint 
venture with another domestic airline that sponsors a competing crs 
we will continue to offer partnership interests in sabre to domestic 
airlines which do not sponsor a competing crs to foreign airlines 
and to other interested companies 
the computer systems provide uptothe minute information on 
video screens about schedules fares seat availability hotels car 
rentals and package vacations they allow users to make reservations 
and issue tickets in seconds and are the primary channel for the 
distribution of tickets 
the systems give airlines the practically instantaneous data on 
seat sales that lets the carriers quickly change prices blackout 
dates advance purchase requirements and other conditions that form 
their yield management strategies 
americans sabre had 445 million in fee revenues and 
approximately 41 percent of the national market in 1988 the justice 
department said deltas 7yearold datas ii is the youngest system 
with about 68 million in revenues and approximately 7 percent of 
the market 
the three other systems are joint operations of united and usair 
twa and northwest and eastern and continental 
in 1986 travel agents paid about 287 million in fees to the 
systems and airlines paid 600 million the department said 
thornburgh said the lawsuit would allege that the joint venture 
would violate the clayton and the sherman acts because it likely 
would substantially lessen competition both in the sale of services 
to travel agents and in the provision of scheduled airline passenger 
service 
travel agents using a particular crs tend to sell a 
disproportionately high number of tickets on that crs owners 
airline said judy l whalley acting assistant attorney general 
in the antitrust division 
since 1986 airlines have been forbidden to favor their own 
flights in the computer display listings 
berry said his company and american intended to sell up to 50 
percent of the merged system to other airlines and already had 
received expressions of interest from alaska southwest lufthansa 
and more than a dozen other carriers 
last week we became aware that justice felt it had a problem 
with this partnership berry said we attempted to resolve it 
there was really nothing we could do

secretary of state james a baker iii appealed 
to members of congress on thursday to back the measured response of 
the bush administration to abuses of human rights in china and the 
house responded with a unanimous show of support 
but senate democratic leader george j mitchell of maine called 
for a more forceful renunciation of the executions being carried out 
despite an appeal by president bush to chinese leaders to show 
clemency 
mitchell in a floor speech said he understood the delicate 
situation in which the president finds himself and the majority 
leader said i support the stated desire to maintain if possible 
some relationship with the chinese government 
but mitchell said i ask i urge the president to condemn 
these acts personally and in the strongest possible terms to give 
voice to the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the american 
people 
bush meanwhile told a luncheon in new york city were all 
very concerned about developments in china later white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the president against mitchells 
charges 
we feel the administration has spoken out loudly strongly and 
without reservation on this issue fitzwater said weve spoken 
out forcefully more than any other country in the world our words 
speak for themselves theres no need to repeat different words 
every day of the week 
asked specifically to react to the latest wave of executions 
fitzwater said theres a great sense of sadness and 
disappointment that world opinion has not had an influence on the 
actions of the chinese 
twentyseven people reportedly have been executed in china 
thousands have been arrested as authorities extend their crackdown 
on advocates of a more liberal communist system 
baker testifying before the house foreign affairs committee 
said the united states was first among the countries around the 
world to respond to the assault on students june 34 in tiananmen 
square 
what we have done is to take carefully targeted actions without 
being inflammatory in our rhetoric and preserving options for the 
future he said 
that approach baker said doesnt necessarily extend to 
others 
but while he recognized congress might want to take a different 
stance baker said in the past when we have not spoken with one 
voice in the conduct of our foreign policy weve almost always 
failed 
therefore baker urged congress to bank its fire and recognize 
that the us relationship with the peoples republic of china 
carefully cultivated over the past 15 years had other 
considerations besides human rights 
i think we should act and speak in one voice and act in a 
coordinated way to address this very very difficult foreign policy 
problem he said 
the house later voted 4160 for a nonbinding resolution 
condemning the murderous crackdown and brutal repression of the 
prodemocracy movement and supporting bushs call for clemency for 
demonstrators 
this is an issue on which there is no disagreement in this 
house or among the american people said the measures sponsor 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo it is essential now for us 
to tell the chinese government that there can be no business as 
usual as long as they continue brutal repression of their own 
people 
before the vote house speaker thomas s foley dwash told 
reporters i would like to see the congress and the president 
stand together on these issues and i do not favor actions that 
arent taken in consultation with the administration 
foley added that the stand that has been taken is very clear 
and said additional sanctions could lead to a complete breach in 
uschina relations while having no positive effect 
that will not accomplish anything that i can see for the 
benefit of the democracy movement in china or for the individual 
rights of chinese students and i think we ought to keep some 
concern about the maintenance of the relationship 
bushs initial response to the shootings in tiananmen square was 
to suspend us military transactions and contacts with china then 
as the suppression continued he withheld us support for 
international loans to beijing and prohibited visits by senior 
adinistration officials 
i believe we have made it abundantly clear both what we said 
and in our actions that while they may be able to clear the square 
they wont be able to clear their conscience baker said of the 
chinese leaders 
mitchell citing fresh news reports that seven more rioters 
had been put to death said bush was more reticent than other world 
figures in denouncing the chinese government 
the senator said the leaders of britain australia new zealand 
france and japan had made statements more forceful than bush who 
deplored the attack in tiananman square and said he admired the 
protesters 
i ask him not to refuse to answer questions about these 
matters mitchell said but to step forward voluntarily to speak 
out i urge the president to assume the proper role as the 
spokesman for the american people as the leader of the free world 
to condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms 
baker said his view had been misunderstood as protective only of 
us economic and commercial ties with the worlds most populous 
nation 
actually he said us policy must consider geopolitical ties 
there are countervailing considerations he said 
baker was confronted by calls from members of the committee for 
the administration to go beyond the sanctions imposed against china 
to stronger measures and more consistent denunciation of arrests and 
executions 
rep stephen j solarz dny said he and other lawmakers were 
planning to propose a package of sanctions against china tougher 
than bushs suspension of military and diplomatic visits and us 
arms transactions 
solarz who met this week with chinese ambassador han xu did not 
elaborate 
rep benjamin a gilman rny urged baker to keep in mind 
neville chamberlain the preworld war ii prime minister of britain 
whom many historians accuse of pursuing a failed policy of 
appeasement toward adolf hitler 
rep john miller rwash said he was exhilarated by the 
administrations splendid performance but he advised baker to 
denounce the executions with an outrage that the chinese and the 
people of the world would hear 
two senior members of the committee reps william s broomfield 
rmich and lee h hamilton dind supported the administrations 
approach 
broomfield said the president was doing his job properly and 
hamilton told baker i think you have handled the china problem 
very well 
vice president dan quayle meanwhile said the united states 
would respond appropriately if china halts repressive actions that 
are souring its relations with the west 
in a speech to an asian policy conference sponsored by the 
heritage foundation a conservative research organization quayle 
said the united states has a duty to denounce the brutal 
suppression of popular and peaceful demonstrations in china to 
condemn the orwellian inversion of truth about the slaying of 
civilian demonstrators in beijing

the supreme court added thursday to a string of 
defeats for civil rights forces with a decision that gives cities 
new protection against certain lawsuits accusing them of racial bias 
and other violations 
voting 54 the justices used the case of a former dallas high 
school football coach to narrow the scope of a centuryold civil 
rights law the coach said he was transferred to another school 
because he is white 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said the 1866 
law can be used to sue a city only if it can be proved the alleged 
violation of civil rights was part of an official municipal policy 
it is not enough to show that a city employee acting in an 
official capacity violated someones rights she said 
once those officials who have the power to make official policy 
on a particular issue have been identified it is for the jury to 
determine whether their decisions have caused the deprivation of 
rights at issue by policies which affirmatively command that it 
occur she said 
the high court previously limited a civil rights law enacted in 
1871 a statute also known as the ku klux klan act in the same 
way 
thursdays ruling is particularly significant because of the 
potential bigmoney damages the 1866 law provides for winners of 
such suits 
the ruling is the latest in a series of defeats handed civil 
rights plaintiffs this year by a newly solidified conservative 
majority on the court 
in a dissenting opinion justice william j brennan said the 
latest decision is astonishing because the court did not allow 
procivil rights forces to present their side fully 
it is not only unfair to decide the case on this basis he 
said it is unwise 
the court ruled against norman jett longtime coach and athletic 
director at south oak cliff high school in dallas he sued the 
dallas independent school district and others 
a federal jury awarded jett 850000 in damages reduced by a 
federal trial judge to about 563000 a federal appeals court 
overturned the award 
the supreme court said thursday that jett could get a new trial 
to determine whether he can recover any money from the school 
district 
but the decision makes his case considerably more difficult to 
prove 
oconnor said a federal appeals court could grant jett a new 
trial against the city only if it determines that the school 
superintendent who ordered him transferred had policymaking 
authority granted by texas law in the area of employee transfers 
jett had coached the south oak cliff football team since 1962 
when in the spring of 1983 he was transferred to another city high 
school 
jett had been named head coach and athletic director at the 
school in 1970 the year the racial composition at south oak cliff 
changed from predominantly white to predominantly black 
frederick todd south oak cliffs black principal who held that 
job since 1975 was also sued by jett for replacing him with a black 
coach 
according to court records the relationship between todd and 
jett grew more tense after south oak cliff lost to plano in the 
state high school championship in november 1982 
jett said todd believed that the only way for south oak cliff to 
compete was to hire a black coach who in turn would recruit black 
players 
jett said that school officials violated his dueprocess 
freespeech and equalprotection rights 
brennan was joined in dissent by justices thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
joining oconnor were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy

women who once knocked on the doors of 
allmale clubs to try to crack the good old boys network formed 
their own informal grapevine thursday to boost members of their sex 
members of the association of good old girls agog promise never 
to make decisions in a locker room in a bar or on the golf course 
its fun and its serious at the same time said denise 
elliott who helped found the group 
fifteen women gathered amidst exhibits on feminist history at the 
michigan womens historical center and hall of fame for the first 
agog meeting 
they raised their right hands and shouting agog they 
pledged to function as an informal network of women helping other 
women climb to the top in their business or profession just as men 
have done by swapping information over drinks or lunch 
rachael e moreno a cofounder of the association said the 
women are trying to copy the good old boy network rather than 
dismantle it because they know it works 
boys begin training to join the network when they are youngsters 
by taking part in sports that teach cooperation and teamwork she 
said 
as adults men holding top positions socialize with each other 
and learn about job openings business opportunities and promotion 
possibilities she said 
thats the topic of their social interaction and because there 
are so few women in similar positions its very difficult for women 
to have access to those same pieces of information she said 
any man or woman who is willing to help women get ahead is a 
member in good standing of agog said moreno who dreamed up the 
name because she liked the meaning of agog intense excitement 
moreno an associate superintendent of genesee intermediate 
school district said women already are giving each other a helping 
hand up the corporate level 
from whatever position i hold or whatever organization i belong 
to i make sure women have the opportunity to participate to be 
promoted to have some visibility and most of all to learn from real 
experiences learn about leadership she said 
but she said the good old girls network needs the extra 
visibility that a semiserious organization like agog can give it 
i dont believe that we have the numbers yet because it takes 
women in almost every organization agency and industry in order to 
establish that kind of comprehensive network she said 
the group which includes women in real estate higher education 
and politics has a copyright on its name and a logo three female 
stick figures with hands joined they plan to offer information to 
women around the country who want to form their own chapters

plans to attempt an override of gov mario 
cuomos latest veto of legislation to restore the death penalty in 
new york state were scrapped thursday because of a key senators 
illness 
new york governors have vetoed death penalty bills every year 
since 1977 
state senate majority leader ralph marino said the override vote 
which had been expected tuesday was being postponed indefinitely 
because of new cancer surgery for state sen james donovan 
donovan issued a statement saying he would enter memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york city on monday for surgery 
wednesday 
the bills chief sponsor state sen dale volker had said 
earlier that without donovans support he had almost no chance of 
winning the override test in the senate 
donovan 65 who underwent surgery in early may for colon cancer 
went to new york city on wednesday for tests at sloankettering 
a consistent death penalty supporter in the past donovan stunned 
his colleagues last week when he said his bout with cancer had 
caused him to have second thoughts about the death penalty 
on monday donovan had returned to albany for the first time 
since his may surgery and cuomo sent a state helicopter to donovans 
home to pick him up for a lengthy lunch at the executive mansion 
emerging from that lunch donovan said he still wasnt certain 
how he would vote on the override attempt 
but he added if you were standing where i am and your life was 
in danger you would have some second thoughts 
for the past four years the republicancontrolled state senate 
has successfully voted to override cuomos death penalty vetoes but 
the effort has repeatedly fallen short in the democraticcontrolled 
assembly 
this year death penalty supporters felt they were within one 
vote of winning in the assembly before problems began appearing in 
the senate 
in february state sen israel ruiz was convicted of a federal 
felony that eventually cost him his seat the democrat had voted for 
the death penalty in recent years 
with ruiz gone volker could only count on 41 votes for an 
override the exact number needed in the 61member senate and that 
assumed that donovan would vote for the death penalty 
new yorks electric chair hasnt been used since 1963

leading politburo reformers saying the 
communist party is sharply divided prepared for a crucial meeting 
friday at which some seek the ouster of centrist party chief karoly 
grosz 
politburo member imre pozsgay considered a reformist challenger 
to grosz told the state news agency mti on thursday that the 
central committee meeting will be advised to keep on grosz until a 
party congress this fall 
but he said fridays session may not be able to arrive at 
lasting solutions on personnel or policy 
in these rapidly changing times there can be unexpected 
factors and questions may arise concerning the party leaders and 
makeup of the politburo pozsgay said 
his remarks follow weeks of increasingly open struggle between 
reformers and more orthodox communists grosz has been party general 
secretary for only 13 months and seems to have lost the center 
ground he sought between the two factions 
poszgay and other reformers meanwhile have backed new reform 
circles inside the party and outside a movement for a democratic 
hungary in anticipation of a possible party split 
politburo member reszoe nyers told thursdays nepszabadsag party 
daily that he does not expect a formal split friday 
but he admitted that personal cooperation in top party 
echelons has sunk to a minimum 
the party is undoubtedly in crisis because of a lack of 
clarification in the concepts of internal trends nyers said 
there is no determined core in the party capable of integration 
he added blaming extreme views for the lack of unity 
three regional reform groups this week openly called for groszs 
ouster at fridays meeting 
western analysts following hungarys rapid embrace of democratic 
reforms over the past year say that replacing grosz before president 
bushs visit next month could damage the image of stability hungary 
seeks in the west 
budapest is looking to the bush visit to cement efforts to gain 
badly needed western aid to restructure the stagnating economy and 
help pay off a 17billion foreign debt 
but a weekly in western gyoer city this week quotes a local party 
reformer as saying grosz should go now because he is a reformer in 
word and not in deed 
influential party reformists in the southern areas of csongrad 
county and szeged city issued separate calls for grosz replacement 
the power struggle comes as the party is negotiating with 
opposition groups over a timetable and regulations for multiparty 
elections to be held by next summer

two inmates at the jb gates 
correctional unit used their skills to get out of prison for four 
hours thursday and attend a wineandcheese reception 
their only tools were pencils and felttip pens 
inmates robert dubois and dan simmonds were special guests at the 
formal opening of an art gallerys threeweek exhibition of 32 
drawings and paintings by connecticut inmates 
prison officials including gates warden dennis t guay and some 
of the families of the inmateartists also attended the reception at 
the vangarde gallery 
this is just the thing he might need to get him going in the 
right direction again said dubois mother janice canning of 
wallingford who greeted her 22yearold son with a big hug hes 
certainly got the talent 
sticking to a vow she had made not to visit her son in prison if 
he got in trouble again canning had not seen him since he was 
sentenced last october to 18 months for robbery 
the works on display range from an oil painting of a barnyard 
scene and a colored pencil drawing of a tearful boy holding a fluffy 
white dog to surrealistic portrayals of prison life and frightening 
renderings of skulls and bones blood and death 
the inmates who will get to keep all the proceeds have priced 
the paintings and drawings anywhere from 25 to 4000 for a copy 
of a rembrandt the show opened saturday and two drawings had sold 
in the first five days 
one of simmonds works a stylized drawing of a dog was the 
second to be sold the price was 100 
i wasnt too sure on my work i didnt know i had the artistic 
talent i was content just having my work be good enough to be 
entered in an art gallery said simmonds 30 who is serving time 
for narcotics possession and is due for release this october 
simmonds said drawing has become a whole new way of relief for 
me it lets me channel my feelings 
inmates like dubois and simmonds have been taking art classes as 
part of the 5yearold arts in correction program run by the 
private nonprofit connecticut prison association said allyson 
holtz the programs coordinator and one of the inmates art 
teachers 
nine professional artists hired by the organization have been 
going into nine prisons across the state to provide 12week courses 
on such subjects as drawing creative writing dance and music 
it gives us a very therapeutic activity that reduces idle time 
which benefits inmates and staff alike said doug kulmacz 
director of volunteer services for the department of correction 
which helps fund the program 
this is the second year an exhibition of inmates work has been 
staged at a private gallery but the first that any inmates 
attended holtz said

the government thursday ordered tighter 
screening of cassette recorders laptop computers and other 
electronic devices on some international flights but rejected calls 
to ban all such items from airliners 
relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the december 
bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland had called for the ban 
after investigators said plastic explosives concealed in a radio 
cassette player destroyed the plane 
transportation secretary samuel skinner announcing the measures 
indicated a ban would unduly inconvenience passengers and would not 
likely be imposed by other nations 
skinner said the federal aviation administration measures would 
take effect immediately and would include more than just turning 
on and off the equipment he said inspectors would go through a 
series of checks including possibly opening the devices 
skinner said he expected several other countries to announce 
similar increased screening 
british authorities are continuing their investigation into who 
planted the bomb on the pan am flight 
plastic explosives cannot be detected by ordinary xray 
screening and the transporation department has ordered us 
airlines to begin installing equipment that can detect plastic 
explosives in luggage at airports throughout the world officials 
acknowledge it could take two years or more to finish the job 
the new order applies only to us flights originating in europe 
and the middle east it will not affect nonus airlines us 
domestic flights flights from the united states to europe or the 
middle east or flights to and from other countries 
skinner said the step was the result of consultation with top 
transportation officials of other countries officials agree he 
said that increased screening is the most acceptable and 
effective method of dealing with the danger 
it is my firm belief that the option we have selected provides 
the proper balance between passenger safety and convenience at this 
time skinner said in a speech to an air freight group 
the faa said in a news release that additional time may be 
required at airport screening points because of the procedures some 
airlines already conduct such screening 
if electronic devices are not needed on a particular trip 
passengers should consider leaving them behind the faa said 
the step is the lastest in several security measures taken by the 
faa since the pan am bombing including xray or physical 
examination of all checked baggage random checks of carryon bags 
and mandatory fines for airline passengers who try to carry weapons 
past screening points

the pentagon official in charge of testing new 
weapons said thursday he is confident the b2 bomber set to be 
flown in a few weeks will perform as anticipated 
i dont see any indications the b2 cant do what it intends to 
do john e krings director of the defense departments 
operational test and evaluation office told reporters 
however krings who is leaving at the end of the month refused 
to discuss whether he thought the b2 the socalled stealth was 
worth the money a question raised by some members of congress 
krings said politicians and defense analysts will have to decide 
if theyre willing to pay for the bomber 
each b2 bomber is expected to cost over 500 million and there 
are plans to build 132 of them northrop corp is building the plane 
at its palmdale calif plant 
the plane described as resembling a flying wing without 
conventional fuselage is designed to penetrate soviet borders 
without being detected by radar 
the plane has no sharp angles and relies on the use of 
radarabsorbing coatings on its surface officials have said 
krings said the b2 has not been operationally tested in the 
field yet but individual systems were tried out along the way the 
air force says the b2 will not be deployed before 1991 
meantime krings defended the record of his office which has 
been criticized by some lawmakers who say it has failed to test 
weapons adequately and is too cozy with defense contracting firms 
krings said his office had succeeded in forcing the services to 
improve the weapons before they are deployed 
the list that didnt go into production because of our 
arguments there were many but they are sometimes hard to find 
he said for instance some contractors have delayed testing in 
order not to fail he said 
they say we are delaying because we dont want to fail the 
test he said as an example he cited the testing of cellular 
radios that were postponed for about four months

female veterans often miss out on benefits for 
which they qualify because they have a low opinion of their service 
records witnesses told a house subcommittee thursday 
they dont see themselves as veterans said retired rear adm 
frances sheabuckley chairwoman of the advisory committee on women 
veterans for the department of veterans affairs they feel that 
only men are veterans they say things like i only served two 
years i didnt go overseas 
women can get all the benefits available to male veterans as long 
as they have spent one year in service said dr susan mather chief 
of womens programs for the department of veterans affairs one 
estimate says women make up 4 percent of all veterans 
among those benefits are extensive health care opportunities 
educational assistance and housing loans 
rep lane evans dill chairman of the veterans affairs 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations called the hearing as 
a followup to the first hearing on the subject two years ago 
we want to learn what progress has been made during the last 
two years in realizing the equitable provision of benefits and 
services to women veterans said evans 
linda caldwell a military nurse who is chairwoman of the 
advisory commission on women veterans in new jersey told of a 
veterans hospital in her state is ill equipped to give women even 
basic service 
caldwell said lyons veterans hospital had only mens pajamas no 
personal sanitary supplies and no gynecological clinic for 
outpatients 
she said by contrast the east orange va hospital provides women 
those basic medical needs 
not all va hospitals are created equal in terms of facilities 
supplies or services provided veterans said caldwell 
mather said that in the last six or seven years the attitude of 
the government toward female veterans has improved though it may 
not have filtered down to every level 
caldwell shared sheabuckleys opinion about getting women to 
come forward as veterans 
in particular certain vietnam era women veterans speak of 
being ridiculed by family and friends upon their return to the 
united states caldwell said 
she said they dont act proud of their service or use it to gain 
benefits rightfully theirs 
when pressed for details they often reply id rather forget 
that part of my life she said 
she said world war ii veterans are most vocal about their needs 
primarily nursing care since they are now among the aging population 
the 1980 census the first to ask women if they were veterans 
counted 113 million women had served in the armed forces that was 
31 percent of the veteran population female veterans now are 
believed to comprise about 4 percent of the veteran population said

paralyzed by mechanical breakdowns and safety problems 
the earlier white house announcement said stello was chosen to be 
assistant secretary for nuclear energy replacing theodore j 
garrish the press office said thursday it had no explanation for 
the mistake 
no one has been nominated yet to replace garrish according to 
the energy department 
macomber who graduated from yale in 1950 two years behind bush

cannell said the restraints on the networks encourage 
competition and without them several popular programs such as all 
in the family and the cosby show may never have been aired 
we are forced to live in an oligopoly with three dominant 
corporations he said but at least we can go from one to the

nearly three months after it caused the 
nations worst oil spill the damaged tanker exxon valdez will be 
towed out of prince william sound on friday for a 25 million repair 
job in san diego authorities said 
the coast guard said the 987foot vessel will leave the shelter 
of outside bay on the southwest side of naked island in the heart of 
the sound during the morning weather permitting 
the exxon valdez has been undergoing temporary repairs at outside 
bay since about two weeks after it ran aground at bligh reef on 
march 24 ripping its hull and spilling nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil drawn from wells on alaskas north slope 
eight of the vessels 13 tanks were penetrated by the reef and 
divers reported finding rocks as large as small cars in the cargo 
hold but the tanks have been cleaned to the point that small 
schools of herring and salmon have been reported living in them the 
hull also has been steamcleaned 
divers drilled numerous holes along many cracks in the hull and 
plated over them to keep the cracks from spreading one crack was 
said to run through the hull until about midship the cracks had to 
be immobilized with plates out of concern that rough seas could 
break the vessel in half 
several of the vessels tanks remain unsealed exxon spokesman 
joe tucker said coast guard and salvage officials said air pressure 
in the tanks would keep seawater at maneageable levels 
the tanker will be towed by two tugs and accompanied by a 
salvage vessel and a third tug but tucker said the tankers engines 
are in working order and will be be used at the skippers discretion 
since the spill oil has soiled more than 700 miles of alaskas 
southern coastline some of the oil has flushed out of the sound and 
traveled with gulf of alaska currents some 400 miles to kodiak 
island and the alaska peninsula 
workers have recovered more than 26000 birds killed by the oil 
although biologists say the figure probably represents 10 percent or 
less of the overall toll other casualties have included more than 
50 eagles and nearly 800 sea otters 
the spill forced closure of numerous herring and salmon fisheries 
and severely curtailed others 
exxon has more than 9000 people backed up by 800 boats and a 
small air force working to clean up the spill exxon said this week 
it already has spent more than 200 million on the job and the 
state has billed exxon more than 12 million for oilspill expenses 
under a procedure established two weeks after the spill the 
state sends its bills to exxon which pays most of the suppliers and 
contractors directly and reimburses the state for outofpocket 
costs said michael nizich administrative services director for 
gov steve cowpers office 
batches of invoices have been sent almost daily to exxon some 
of them were pretty hefty in size nizich said 
a coast guard officer will be on board the exxon valdez until it 
leaves prince william sound about 60 miles from naked island and 
again when the vessel nears san diego where the ship was built 
tucker said seven exxon officers and four salvage experts would 
be on board throughout the voyage expected to take about 20 days 
at about 6 mph 
one worker was killed during the cleanup and there have numerous 
injuries in boat and plane accidents as well as from falls on 
oilslickened beaches 
the former captain of the exxon valdez joseph hazelwood has 
been charged with six criminal counts arising from the spill among 
other things the state alleges he was drunk at the time 
hazelwood has pleaded innocent to all charges court officials 
say it is unlikely his trial will take place until fall or early 
winter

the united states can regain the lead in 
developing magnetically levitated trains with a 300 mph potential 
but if it doesnt act soon japan or west germany will dominate the 
field according to a report released thursday 
maglev will be an important transportation mode by the year 
2000 and decisions made in the next five years will determine which 
country gets the patents and leads the industry said an advisory 
committee to the senate committee on environment and public works 
because of the overseas competition evolving in this 
technology americas window of opportunity is already beginning to 
close the committee wrote 
now is the chance for the united states to leapfrog the 
competition by creating the second generation of maglev trains 
using superconducting electromagnets according to the committee 
it did not mean the new hightemperature superconductors but 
rather the wellunderstood extremely low temperature technology 
used over the past 10 years or so for medical imaging devices 
particle accelerators and other devices in hightech firms around 
the world 
the advisory group prepared the study at the request of new york 
sen daniel p moynihan secondranking democrat on the committee 
and sponsor of legislation authorizing the department of 
transportation to develop such trains 
the report recommends that the us government allocate 750 
million over six years to develop test and demonstrate several 
maglev prototypes 
james powell and gordon danby of the brookhaven national 
laboratory in new york codevelopers of maglev trains outlined 
the pluses at a news conference 
among them they are faster than cars or conventional railroads 
they consume less energy than automobiles or airplanes they pollute 
less they can run in any weather and they experience little wear 
maglev trains run on a cushion of air above a guideway 
suspended by magnets on the train and in the guideway whose like 
poles repel each other a moving magnetic field in the guideway 
attracts a magnet on the train of opposite polarity pulling the 
train at high speed 
current magnets hold the train about threeeighths of an inch off 
the rails superconducting models could offer higher stability with 
a sixinch elevation 
the united states pioneered maglev transportation in the 1960s 
and 1970s but went only as far as building prototypes and scale 
models said the report the effort was abandoned in 1975 for lack 
of federal funds but was picked up and carried on in a spirit of 
raging incrementalism by the japanese 
that america walked away from this effort more than a decade 
ago is demonstrative of the commercial technology lapses our country 
is prone to stumble into characterized most visibly by the 
forfeiting of billiondollar markets in consumer electronics and 
dynamic random access memory semiconductors two american 
inventions commercially exploited by japan the report said 
we see many benefits we dont see any serious drawbacks 
powell said 
at present the japanese are testing a fullscale 325 mph 
vehicle west germany has tested a similar 256 mph system

sen strom thurmond urged robert b fiske jr 
to withdraw from consideration as deputy attorney general to avoid a 
divisive debate in the senate the south carolina republicans 
office said thursday 
thurmond top republican on the senate judiciary committee made 
the appeal to fiske at a meeting with other senators that was 
convened by senate minority leader bob dole of kansas on wednesday 
senator thurmond is very concerned that a divisive protracted 
debate about this nomination would not be in anybodys best 
interests said christopher simpson the senators press 
secretary thurmond told fiske that conservative opponents of his 
nomination might wage a filibuster to block confirmation 
thurmond is among 14 gop senators who signed a letter last week 
urging president bush not to nominate fiske they contend that as a 
chairman of the american bar associations judicial screening panel 
fiske used ideological criteria to thwart several of president 
reagans judicial nominees 
eighteen moderate or liberal republicans meanwhile sent letters 
to bush this week urging him to nominate fiske a prominent wall 
street lawyer who was once us attorney in new york 
the gop surfaced following a report that bush inadvertently 
plugged fiske for the position during a gathering of us attorneys 
at the white house last friday 
noting that a number of former us attorneys held key jobs in 
his administration bush said we hope to see yet another bob 
fiske of new york joining our ranks here soon 
the washington post in thursdays editions quoted anonymous 
white house sources as accusing someone from the justice department 
of slipping the remark into bushs speech 
david runkel thornburghs chief spokesman disputed the report 
saying i just dont think it happened the way it was described 
but a white house source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said presidential aides were flabbergasted when they heard about 
bushs remarks because the issue of whether to nominate fiske is 
still under debate there 
the source said that the remark about fiske was not part of the 
speech draft after it had been cleared thursday night 
any change in the speech would have had to be cleared by an 
elaborate approval process in the white house the source said 
the post reported that the remark was given for insertion to the 
card writer who digests speeches onto index cards for delivery 
by the president 
during the meeting with fiske thurmond did not identify the 
senators who might mount a filibuster nor did he threaten himself to 
wage one simpson said 
sen gordon humphrey rnh another opponent of fiske who 
attended the meeting said that he had not heard any word of support 
for fiske from the white house 
based on our concerns the white house so far has declined to 
make such a nomination humphrey said it is the justice 
department which is lobbying for this candidate i havent heard boo 
from the white house 
humphrey said fiske was accompanied to the meeting by carol 
crawford the new assistant attorney general for legislative affairs 
crawford told the senators that fiske would have no role in 
selecting nominees for the federal bench humphrey said 
others attending the meeting included sens john danforth rmo 
and alfonse damato rny both supporters of fiske humphrey said 
runkel said fiske is replying to the senators concerns i 
still believe that he is going to be nominated and confirmed

democrats and republicans rushed to old glorys 
defense thursday as the senate passed a resolution condemning the 
supreme court decision giving first amendment protection to those 
who desecrate the american flag 
in addition to the resolution urging the high court to reconsider 
wednesdays decision a variety of bills aimed at circumventing the 
ruling were tossed into legislative hoppers 
congress has believed that the act of desecrating the flag is 
clearly not speech as protected by the first amendment said the 
senate resolution cosponsored by majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine and minority leader bob dole rkan 
the resolution which passed 973 voiced alarm that the ruling 
may invalidate federal law and statutes in 48 states prohibiting 
destruction of the flag 
sens edward m kennedy of massachusetts and howard metzenbaum of 
ohio both democrats and gordon humphrey of new hampshire a 
republican voted against the resolution 
kennedy said the supreme court has the last word on the meaning 
of the constitution and that the senate shouldnt go on record 
criticizing the supreme court for carrying out its duty 
humphrey said that while he didnt like anyone burning or 
defacing the flag he asked what defines desecration 
this seems to me to be an exercise in silliness and a little 
bit of hypocrisy he said it strikes me as intellectually 
dishonest 
the high court in a 54 vote threw out the conviction of 
gregory joey johnson who was sentenced to a year in jail and 
fined 2000 for burning the flag in texas 
the court said the flag burning at a demonstration in dallas 
during the 1984 republican national convention was a form of 
expression protected by the constitutions guarantee of freedom of 
speech 
the decision was greeted with virtually universal outrage on 
capitol hill 
shame on these judges said rep dan burton rind shame 
on you shame on you 
we must stand for america the flag the flag america 
america for us bellowed sen strom thurmond rsc 
the first amendment guarantees everyone the freedom to speak 
but it guarantees no one an audience for his words said mitchell 
a former federal judge i do not believe that americans have to 
see the flag that symbolizes their freedom to speak devalued and 
cheapened in the cause of preserving that freedom 
the act of flag burning is not meant to convey any political 
idea said rep robert dornan rcalif who was among those 
introducing legislation to amend the constitution to prohibit 
flagdesecration it is an act that is solely meant to provoke and 
offend 
with this decision the court cloaks the most offensive 
behavior as political expression said rep owen pickett dva 
who introduced a resolution aimed at nullifying the court decision 
rep doug applegate dohio shouted on the floor of the house 
im mad as hell weve witnessed the greatest travesty in the 
annals of jurisprudence when the supreme court allowed the 
destruction of the greatest of american symbols what in gods name 
is going on 
rep les aucoin dore said he was deeply offended by the 
ruling 
the reagan court has given us constitutional protection for 
the burning of old glory he said this liberal democrat says 
for shame 
sen sam nunn dga said he was disappointed with the ruling 
in my view the american flag represents the preeminent symbol 
of our republic and all for which it stands he said

the nations chemical manufacturers said 
thursday they have abandoned their previous opposition and now 
support new legislation to control airborne toxic chemicals 
we intend to be a constructive player in the legislative 
process robert c forney a du pont co executive told the house 
energy and commerce environment subcommittee on behalf of the 
chemical manufacturers association 
forney said the chemical industrys trade group previously 
believed new legislation was unnecessary but has now concluded the 
environmental protection agency cannot adequately regulate air 
emissions under the existing law 
but forney and other industry witnesses clashed with rep henry 
a waxman dcalif the subcommittee chairman over the need for 
provisions designed to prevent accidental chemical releases 
forney said a great deal has been done by industry to prevent 
accidents and we dont believe additional legislation is 
required 
i find it difficult to understand that position waxman said 
citing environmental protection agency figures showing there were 
more than 4700 accidential releases between 1980 and 1987 the 120 
most serious releases killed 145 people injured more than 5000 
and caused nearly 250000 to evacuate their homes waxman said 
gerald v poje of the national wildlife federation said it is 
essential that any legislation include provisions to deal with 
chemical accidents such as the disaster in bhopal india in 1984 in 
that case more than 3000 people died when the rupture of a storage 
tank unleased deadly methyl isocyanate 
industrial facilities and communities are unprepared to 
understand and respond to the consequences of chemical accidents 
he said testifying for the national clean air coalition 
representing environmental groups 
one house bill supported by waxman and environmental groups 
would require epa to develop a list of substances most likely to 
endanger the public through accidental releases to the air and issue 
regulations to prevent such releases 
the epa has recently disclosed that some 27 billion pounds of 
toxic substances go into the air each year but the agency only 
regulates only seven of more than 200 chemicals that are released 
according to the agency some 360 million pounds involve 
suspected carcinogens contributing to between 1500 and 3000 fatal 
cancers each year chemical emissions also are factors in 
respiratory disease and birth defects 
a number of legislative proposals including a clean air package 
unveiled this month by president bush would force industry to use 
the best available technology to reduce emissions the proposals 
would regulate either the chemicals themselves or set limits for 
industrial categories such as steel mills or pulp and paper 
industry witnesses told the subcommittee however many of the 
solutions proposed so far would be too harsh and should be changed 
improvement can be made by adopting provisions for 
reasonable technology instead of the best available said terry f

petroleum institute the trade group for the oil industry 
the controls he said should be placed only on those sources 
found to be significant emitters of toxic air pollutants

several witnesses who object to smoking urged 
congress on thursday to extend and expand a nosmoking policy on 
short airline flights but the tobacco industry insisted that health 
research doesnt justify a ban 
more than two dozen witnesses submitted testimony at a house 
public works and transportation aviation subcommittee hearing on 
several bills that would either make the temporary ban permanent or 
expand it to cover all flights smoking is outlawed on domestic 
flights of less than two hours but the rule is to lapse in april 
1990 unless congress acts 
witnesses ranged from a flight attendant who said her health was 
ruined serving smoking passengers to an indoor air expert who said 
there are worse health hazards including infectious disease in 
an airliner cabin than smoke 
opponents including tobacco interests and some lawmakers urged 
that congress await the results of a transportation department study 
of the air aboard airliners before enacting any new law the study 
is expected to be completed before the ban is lifted 
only a total ban on airline smoking will adequately protect the 
health and safety of airline passengers and flight crews said 
rep richard j durbin dill who is sponsoring legislation that 
would give congress a choice of making the ban permanent or 
expanding it to cover all commercial flights 
it is our job to esnure that those especially sensitive to 
cigarette smoke are free of having it foisted upon them in the 
confines of an airplane cabin said rep robert g torricelli 
dnj 
reps lindsay thomas rga and tom delay rtexas however 
echoed the tobacco industrys stand that no legislation should be 
passed before the airliner air quality study is completed 
i hope we will find a solution to this problem which will 
protect the rights of both those who choose to smoke and those who 
have decided not to do so said thomas 
representatives of several antismoking groups the american 
medical association the american association for respiratory care 
and the association of flight attendants called for a permanent ban 
of smoking on all flights saying smoking poses a proven health 
hazard to nonsmoking passengers and crew as well as to smokers 
flight attendant cathy gilbertsilva said working on flights 
where smoking was allowed severely affected her health she 
complained of worsening sinus infections bronchial problems 
laryngitis scratchy throat and blocked ears 
a total ban will not cure me but i know i will not get worse 
and i can continue in the job i have grown to love without fear for 
my health she said 
charles o whitley of the tobacco institute said a permanent ban 
would unjustly abandon any effort to accommodate smokers 
he said studies show that a nonsmoking passenger would have to 
make eight continuous new yorktotokyo roundtrip flights before 
being exposed to the nicotine equivalent of a single cigarette 
gray robinson president of a company that specializes in 
fighting indoor air pollution acva atlantic inc said an airline 
passenger is more likely to get sick from bacteria fungi and 
viruses floating in the poorly ventilated air tan from cigarette 
smoke 
he said there is no scientific data to justify a smoking ban but 
took no position on the legislation 
ironically there has been no evidence of excessive levels of 
carbon monoxide airborne particulates or nicotine all of which 
have been linked to tobacco smoke as a source robinson said 
for 60 cents per passenger ventilation can be increased to 
healthy levels on a boeing 747 robinson said 
he recommended that the committee pass legislation requiring 
improved ventilation and filtration of air on planes with regular 
inspections and monitoring of air quality levels

a house subcommittee approved an amendment in 
closed session thursday seeking to save the v22 osprey aircraft by 
pumping 351 million of research and development funds into the 
program house members said 
the amendment was approved 117 by the armed services research 
and development subcommittee according to reps curt weldon rpa 
and thomas foglietta dpa 
sponsored by weldon and foglietta the amendment was backed 
despite opposition by the subcommittee chairman rep ron dellums 
dcalif and by rep william dickinson rala the panels ranking 
republican according to weldon press aide doug ritter 
defense secretary dick cheney in overseeing cuts in the fiscal 
1990 budget promised by president bush announced in april that he 
was scuttling the v22 program as too expensive 
the v22 described by the marine corps as its most important 
weapons program is a revolutionary aircraft designed to take off 
like a helicopter and fly like a plane 
weldon said the amendment would pull 351 million from research 
and development money initially earmarked for the b2 bomber he 
said he would soon introduce an amendment in the full committee to 
switch accounts replenishing the b2 research funds by taking 
the money from b2 procurement 
on tuesday sen john glenn dohio urged cheney to suspend 
production of the b2 because the aircraft has yet to undergo flight 
testing the radarevading aircraft is the most expensive plane in 
history 
weldon made no predictions on whether his amendment would survive 
in the full committee 
this is one battle in a continuing series of what is going to 
be a prolonged effort its the first recorded effort to oppose the 
secretary on the v22 weldon said 
the two contracting partners developing the v22 are the boeing 
helicopter co in pennsylvania and bell helicopter textron inc in 
texas

an assailant in a pickup truck 
shot an elderly us nun in the head while she rode in another truck 
with two other nuns a witness and authorities said thursday 
sister mary mackey 73 was in serious condition with a bullet 
wound behind the left eye us ambassador william walker said she 
was conscious when he visited her at policlinica hospital at midday 
thursday 
the attack brought to mind one of the civil wars most well known 
cases of human rights abuses the 1980 murders of four us 
churchwomen by national guard troops provoked a temporary suspension 
of us aid to the central american nation 
but the motive in wednesday evenings attack was not immediately 
known and a robbery attempt was cited as one possibility 
the shooting occurred 10 miles south of the capital outside 
zaragoza where sister mackey a registered nurse worked at a home 
for orphans of the 9yearold war between the government and leftist 
guerrillas 
extreme rightists and some armed forces officers consider nuns 
priests and other churchpeople who work in poor communities 
sympathizers of the guerrillas 
walker promised that the embassy will impress upon the salvadoran 
government the need to find those responsible for the attack 
embassy spokesman barry jacobs said 
jacobs said the embassy will provide any assistance requested 
including medical evacuation he said sister mackey probably will be 
flown in coming days to houston headquarters of her order the 
sisters of charity of the incarnate word 
corporal asencio mejia of the zaragoza civil defense which is in 
charge of the preliminary investigation said the assailants and 
their vehicle had not been found 
sister ana maria brangan who was driving the pickup carrying 
sister mackey and another nun said she and her companions were 
approaching zaragoza from the capital when a yellow pickup carrying 
at least six men four of them in the bed pulled alongside 
they stayed alongside and pulled closer and i didnt 
understand what was going on then i heard a noise and thought they 
had bumped us i didnt realize it was a bullet she told 
reporters at the hospital 
the single shot broke the mazdas passenger side window and 
entered sister mackeys skull 
the rev ken myers founder of the orphanage said doctors told 
him she probably will lose her left eye 
myers said the attack probably was not political and could have 
been part of a robbery attempt he said the attackers apparently 
were not members of the armed forces 
there were at least six men in the truck and only one weapon 
he said they may have been thieves maybe they were drunk 
sister brangan said she and her two companions had stopped at the 
bank before heading for zaragoza but did not make a withdrawal she 
said the other nun in the mazda sister juana flores saw a man 
standing in the back of the yellow pickup fire the single pistol 
shot 
sister brangan said she pulled to the shoulder and stopped and 
the yellow pickup stopped ahead of her vehicle when she started 
again the attackers took off 
myers 48 said neither he nor the sisters have been directly 
threatened but there are frequent insinuations they are leftist 
sympathizers 
that kind of thing happens all the time because of the kind of 
work we do the orphanage bringing in medicine a clinic for poor 
people he said 
sister mackey is a native of county clare ireland and a 
naturalized us citizen who has worked in central america since 
1963 and in el salvador since 1983 according to myers 
myers founded the orphanage where sister mackey works the oscar 
arnulfo romero community the same year the four churchwomen were 
killed it is named after the salvadoran archbishop murdered by an 
extreme rightist gunman while saying mass in march 1980 
the orphanage is home to about 200 children left without family 
by the civil war 
in the 1980 case five national guardsmen were convicted of 
murder and sentenced in 1984 to 30 years in prison 
they had intercepted the vehicle carrying the three nuns and a 
lay worker who worked with refugees taken them to a secluded spot 
and killed them with bullets fired into the head two of the four 
women were raped

democratic lawmakers thursday urged defense 
secretary dick cheney to reject any agreement with south korea that 
would require the united states to maintain troops in that nation at 
current levels 
some of us on the committee think that no such assurance should 
be given sen bennett johnston dla told cheney who testified 
before the senate appropriations defense subcommittee 
on the contrary negotiations ought to begin for a phased 
withdrawal from south korea johnston said 
members of the panel cited a recent letter that south korean 
defense minister lee sanghoon sent to cheney asking the united 
states to promise not to withdraw the more than 43000 us troops 
stationed there 
the minister told south koreas national assembly defense 
committee that he would ask the united states to sign a joint 
communique with that commitment when he travels here next month 
johnston and three other democrats dale bumpers of arkansas 
jim sasser of tennessee and patrick leahy of vermont wrote to 
cheney urging him to reject any preconditions for a us troop 
withdrawal 
the senators said cheneys meeting next month with the korean 
official would be an ideal opportunity to begin discussions on 
reducing our military presence in korea 
the united states spends 26 billion a year to maintain its 
troops in south korea 
bumpers said at the hearing that south koreas gross national 
product is seven times that of north korea its population is twice 
that of north korea and it only spends 5 percent of its gnp on 
defense 
i have become increasingly convinced that debate ought to begin 
about our presence in korea he said 
cheney said the united states has no plans to reduce the us 
commitment to korea but that cuts in troop levels are possible 
just as there is a proposal to reduce our troop level in europe 
sen carl levin dmich a member of the senate armed services 
committee called last month for a reduction of the south koreabased 
forces to 10000

ferdinand marcos stole gold us aid and 
japanese war reparations took kickbacks and used an international 
network of cronies and banks in looting the philippines of 5 
billion newly filed documents allege 
the documents filed in us district court here contain the most 
detailed charges yet against the deposed philippine leader and his 
wife imelda said plaintiffs attorney ronald l olsen 
but marcos attorney john bartko said thursday the filing which 
amended a 3yearold lawsuit by the philippine government seeking 
50 billion in damages from the marcoses was just a rehash of old 
allegations 
he characterized wednesdays action as a publicity stunt at a 
time when marcos is near death marcos was in very critical and 
unstable condition thursday at st francis medical center in 
honolulu 
it doesnt make any sense to include old material at a time 
like this bartko said everybody knows marcos is likely to die 
in the near future 
marcos president of the philippines from 1965 to 1986 and his 
wife plundered property and money by diverting foreign economic 
assistance to which the philippine government was entitled and 
extorting soliciting and accepting bribes kickbacks illicit 
gratuities and commissions in exchange for favors the amended 
lawsuit said 
during that time marcos claimed average aftertax earnings of 
about 50000 a year 
programs tapped by the marcoses included the us economic 
support fund japanese war reparations and japans overseas economic 
cooperation fund the lawsuit said 
the lawsuit also claims the marcoses 
received more than 53 million in kickbacks on contracts with 
at least seven japanese companies 
in 1973 diverted to their personal use 800000 troy ounces of 
gold from philippine central bank reserves 
converted to their personal use more than 27 million from the 
philippine national bank and bought more than 52 million pesos worth 
of items at philippine dutyfree shops thus avoiding substantial 
taxes 
the lawsuit said that the couple either by themselves or through 
others help maintained 58 bank accounts in los angeles beverly 
hills calif san francisco and new york to shelter their gains 
according to the lawsuit the accounts were rarely in the name of 
the marcoses who operated behind nominees and surrogates or 
through multiple layers of offshore and onshore entities organized 
principally in the netherlands antilles panama the cayman islands 
hong kong and the united states 
the marcoses have been hit with more than 40 lawsuits including 
a criminal lawsuit filed by the us government in new york and 
several cases in the philippines 
bartko contends there is only one significant lawsuit the one in 
new york and hopefully it will be decided on the evidence he 
said 
the nine defendants in the los angeles case include the marcoses 
saudi arabian millionaire adnan khashoggi now living in 
switzerland and roberto d benedicto a marcos associate who is a 
fugitive from federal charges in new york stemming from many of the 
same allegations outlined in this lawsuit 
other defendants are the california overseas bank in los angeles 
and the redwood bank in san francisco which were allegedly 
controlled by marcos and his associates and three offshore 
companies krodos properties nv of the netherlands antilles al 
djebel corp of the cayman islands and lei investments ltd of the 
channel islands

the prosecution said thursday that a 
us soldier who admits giving military secrets to east germany 
handed communist officials information on how the army would respond 
to an attack 
a court martial is hearing the case of spec 4 michael a peri 
22 of laguna niguel calif who changed his plea from not guilty 
to guilty of espionage in a surprise move at wednesdays opening 
session 
peri left the 11th armored cavalry regiment in fulda late on feb 
20 taking with him two computer discs containing classified 
information and a laptop computer he was found to be missing the 
next day he returned voluntarily to his unit on march 4 
peri told the court on wednesday he went to east germany because 
he had problems at work and was frustrated with his job 
i was never really sure what i was going to do at all he was 
quoted as saying by the militarys unofficial stars and stripes 
newspaper i really didnt have a plan everything had been 
wrong i wasnt enjoying myself i wanted to start over somewhere 
else 
peri could receive a maximum sentence of life in prison on the 
expionage charge he faces lesser charges of absent without leave 
and wrongfully appropriating government property 
chief prosecutor maj michael graham on thursday sketched this 
sequence of events in connection with peris absence 
late on feb 20 peri went to the regiments intelligence office 
where he worked and removed a laptop computer and two floppy discs 
containing classified information on the units general defense 
plans 
the plans dealt with how the 11th armored cavalry a frontline 
defense unit would react in case of an attack from the soviet bloc 
the same day peri drove a military vehicle about 60 miles to a 
spot near the east german border he abandoned the vehicle when it 
got stuck in a wooded area walked to a border fence and climbed 
over it carrying computer and discs 
graham said peri wandered around in east germany for about two 
hours then went to a communist border guard tower and turned 
himself over to the east germans later handing over computer and 
discs to unidentified east german officials in east berlin 
the prosecutor said analysis later showed the computer had been 
accessed and set up to print out material meaning the east 
germans had copied the information 
graham then went into detail on exchanges between us and east 
german officials after peris abandoned vehicle was found on feb 24 
he said the east germans informed the us embassy in east berlin 
on march 3 that they had released peri to travel to a country of 
his choice and that on the same day the east germans returned 
the computer and discs to peri who traveled by train to salzburg 
austria 
he stayed in one of the most expensive hotels in salzburg on 
the night of march 3 and the next day began traveling by train for 
his home unit in fulda where he was later arrested the prosecutor 
said 
peri sat quietly during the session occasionally whispering to 
his chief defense counsel maj william d stokes 
his parents fred and winnie peri and sister desiree from 
orange county calif were also present and sat listening quietly 
the court martial proceedings are slated to continue friday with 
testimony from peris military associates and medical experts who 
have examined him

to alabama 
scattered showers and thunderstorms fell mainly from the gulf 
coast to the middle atlantic coast and southern sections of the 
great lakes region 
flood or flash flood watches remained in effect for sections of 
alabama tennessee georgia north carolina virginia west 
virginia maryland pennsylvania and new york state 
in tennessee gov ned mcwherter requested federal disaster aid 
for rhea county where 400000 in damage to flooded homes and 
businesses was reported numerous recreation areas in the state were 
under water 
the tennessee valley authority was hindered during the rain 
because it did not have its vast reservoir system drawn down not 
surprising since this is the wettest june since tva was created 56 
years ago 
average june rainfall across the river valley has been 755 
inches through thursday morning compared to a normal average of 
just under 3 inches for the entire month tva said so far this year

the end of the month in a normal year 
in alabama floods have caused at least 2 million in damage to 
crops and homes officials said thursday 
however the rain has helped replenish alabamas groundwater 
supplies depleted by two straight years of drought 
over most of the state the water levels have completely 
recovered from the drought we had last summer said james d 
moore director of the water division of the geological survey of 
alabama in tuscaloosa 
unofficial reports indicated 6 to nearly 7 inches of rain fell 
thursday morning on eastern montgomery county in parched 
southwestern iowa 
the old ground sucked that up like you wouldnt believe it 
hadnt seen it in a while and it took advantage of it said 
montgomery county sheriff marvin meggison 
reports of a dousing in western iowa apparently convinced 
commodity traders that severely dry conditions there were easing 
and corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply lower on the 
chicago board of trade 
along the licking river in central ohio two families were 
evacuated at newark when the water reached its 17foot flood stage 
at utica about 10 miles north of newark firefighters and 
volunteers piled up sandbags on the south side of the city in an 
attempt to hold back the river authorities said 
storms also raised several rivers in southeastern michigan above 
flood stage thursday authorities said 
in addition a number of arriving and departing morning flights 
at detroit metropolitan airport were delayed by dense fog air 
traffic manager jerry linton said 
elsewhere there were showers over eastern colorado the texas 
panhandle western oklahoma and western and central kansas

the bush administration is continuing to seek 
increased aid to noncommunist rebels in cambodia vice president 
dan quayle said thursday asking congressional critics not to be 
paralyzed by a memory of vietnam 
the united states wants a transitional government in cambodia 
with a key role by opposition leaders prince norodom sihanouk 
the former ruler of the country and son sann quayle said in 
remarks to the conservative heritage foundation 
state department officials have acknowledged slim chances of 
getting new aid through congress where some members are concerned 
that the aid could fall into the hands of the communist khmer rouge 
but the vice president said that beefing up aid to the 
noncommunist forces to try to influence what will happen after the 
impending departure of the occupying vietnamese would reduce the 
chances of the khmer rouge returning top power 
by doing nothing we would increase the likelihood of continued 
civil war and the potential for a return to power by the murderous 
khmer rouge quayle said 
the unacknowledged but alltootangible presence in the debate 
over cambodia is the ghost of vietnam but my friends it is now 
time to lay this ghost to rest he said 
no great nation can long afford to be paralyzed by a memory we 
must not permit the noncommunist resistance in cambodia to 
becoemthe last casualty of the vietnam war 
on the other hand the vice president said we have learned 
that america cannot fight others battles for them 
the khmer rouge gained notoriety for the brutality of their 
regime from 1973 to 1978 when more than 1 million people died under 
leader pol pot 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said that it would be a 
fact of life that the khmer rouge the strongest of the current 
insurgent groups would have a role in a future cambodian government 
rep stephen solarz dny is pushing an effort in congress to 
boost military aid for the noncommunists from the current 7 
million a year to as much as 30 million

the leader of greeces conservative party 
demanded thursday that andreas papandreou resign as the interim 
premier because of a new banking scandal the latest to occur under 
papandreous socialist government 
papandeou later was admitted to a hospital and doctors said he 
had an infection of the respiratory system papandreou 70 who 
underwent triple bypass heart surgery in september was reported in 
excellent condition after he entered the general state hospital 
doctors said the prime minister would spend the night at the 
hospital but that his illness does not prevent execution of his 
duties 
constantine mitsotakis whose new democracy party has until 
friday to form a coalition said papandreou was responsible and 
guilty in the scandal involving the stateowned greek mortgage 
bank and the atlantic bank of new york a subsidiary of the 
statecontrolled national bank of greece 
us officials allege the mortgage bank operated illegally in the 
united states and helped people avoid taxes and get around bank 
reporting laws it is accused of laundering at least 700 million 
us attorney andrew maloney announced in new york on wednesday 
that 13 employees and executives of the mortgage bank had been 
arrested there were no allegations of wrongdoing against us banks 
these usurpers of power who shame greece and rob the greek 
people must leave immediately its vital that a new government 
is formed now mitsotakis told a news conference 
new democracy emerged the winner of sundays general elections 
with 145 seats in the 300seat unicameral parliament but fell short 
of an absolute majority necessary to form a government 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement or pasok won 125 
seats failing to win a third consecutive fouryear term 
the coalition of the left and progress an alliance of the greek 
communist party and the small eurocommunist left won 28 seats 
on tuesday president christos sartzetakis gave mitsotakis three 
days to form a government if he fails the other two major parties 
will have a chance to form a coalition 
if there is no government by july 3 parliament will be dissolved 
and a caretaker government will be formed by the president to 
prepare for new elections 
mitsotakis said a caretaker government should be formed 
immediately and that elections should be held no later than 
september because papandreou will do his utmost to cover up 
the mortgage bank scandal 
the scandal gave papandeous political opponents new ammunition 
since it took place during his socialist administrations tenure in 
office ranking executives in statecontrolled institutions are 
traditionally appointed by the government in power at the time 
the new scandal surfaced one day after parliament was asked to 
lift the immunity of two former pasok ministers accused of 
involvement in a scandal involving the bank of crete 
former justice minister agamemnon koutsogiorgas allegedly 
received 2 million from fugitive banker george koskotas for passing 
a law that blocked an investigation at his troubled bank 
former public order minister george petsos is charged with 
receiving gifts and money from the banker 
koutsogiorgas wife aliki was allegedly involved in the payoff 
by depositing the 2 million in a joint account with her husband at 
a swiss bank 
koskotas who is held in the united states pending a hearing on 
an extradition request was charged with offering the bribe his 
lawyer yannis mantzouranis a former secretary to papandreous 
cabinet was charged with complicity for arranging the payoff

new regulations to protect the public from 
contaminated drinking water may prevent 90000 cases of waterborne 
diseases every year but will mean higher water bills for millions of 
americans the environmental protection agency said thursday 
the agency announced final regulations that will require nearly 
10000 providers of drinking water serving an estimated 150 million 
people to comply with strict filtration requirements to rid the 
water of diseasecausing germs 
the regulations which apply to communities where drinking water 
comes from surface sources such as rivers and streams are aimed at 
reducing the risk of illness from a variety of microscopic organisms 
such as viruses bacteria and protozoa 
the new regulations require that these public water systems use 
disinfectants of prescribed performance and those not meeting 
certain strict purity standards must be treated by filtration if 
not states must devise another way to eliminate the germs such as 
additional chemicals 
maximum concentrations are established for some microorganisms 
and treatment techniques are required for others 
the rules also specify that treatment plant operators meet state 
qualifications and they set up new monitoring and reporting 
requirements 
the agency has estimated that tens of thousands of people become 
ill yearly from such contamination epa estimated the more stringent 
water purification procedures are likely to prevent annually about 
90000 illnesses including diarrhea nausea vomiting and stomach 
upsets 
these rules are a major step forward in providing maximum 
protection for our nations drinkingwater supplies said epa 
administrator william k reilly 
but epa said the new requirements also will be expensive with 
expected initial capital costs at about 3 billion and operational 
costs of about 500 million a year 
the agency said the additional costs are expected to be passed 
onto customers but the increase in household water bills is likely 
to vary widely depending on the size of the public water system and 
whether the system already has some filtration equipment 
according to epa estimates in rural areas where water systems 
serve fewer than 500 customers and where no filtration is now used 
household water bills could increase from 30 to 50 a month in 
urban areas with more customers to bear the cost the increase is 
likely to be about 6 a month perhaps much less if some filtration 
equipment already is being used 
about onethird of the nearly 10000 water systems subject to the 
tighter requirements currently have no filtration system the agency 
said 
those systems serve more than 21 million people including 
residents of major cities such as boston new york city newark 
nj san francisco and seattle 
some other cities not filtering their drinking water are 
portland maine syracuse and utica ny scranton bethlehem and 
wilkesbarre pa greenville sc reno and sparks nev tacoma 
wash and portland ore 
local authorities have four years in which to install new 
equipment said epa spokesman david ryan

a jury was selected thursday in the trial 
of two former aides to ptl founder jim bakker after a day that 
included such questions as whether they recognized jaguar cartier 
and other luxury brand names 
david taggart 32 and his older brother and housemate james 
35 are accused of not paying 494000 in income taxes from 1983 to 
1987 they also are charged with using more than 11 million of ptl 
money to pay personal bills including 55000 in purchases from the 
cartier jewelry store in new york 
a jury of eight women and four men was selected to hear the 
taggarts trial which is scheduled to begin july 5 and is expected 
to take about a month four alternate jurors also were picked 
the taggarts trial will be a prelude to the august trial of 
bakker and richard dortch the two former ptl leaders are accused of 
diverting more than 4 million in ptl money for their own benefit 
david taggart went to work at ptl in 1978 when he was 21 as an 
administrative assistant to the television ministrys music 
director the young piano player soon became bakkers most trusted 
aide and perhaps ptls second most powerful executive 
david taggart according to ptl records drew more than 620000 
in pay in the 15 months ending march 1987 the same month bakker 
resigned in a sex and money scandal james taggart then ptls 
interior decorator received nearly 300000 during that period 
us district judge robert potter asked some potential jurors if 
they regularly contributed to a church or a religious organization 
he also asked if they were familiar with certain brand names such as 
gucci jaguar cartier and mercedes benz he then asked if they buy 
most of their clothing and jewelry in discount stores or expensive 
shops and if they normally pay with cash credit cards or checks 
it was not known whether any prospective jurors were excluded on 
the basis of their answers to the questions 
the taggarts wardrobes included mink coats designer clothes and 
expensive jewelry they bought a 660000 condominium on new yorks 
fifth avenue and a 317000 twostory stucco house in southeast 
charlotte 
for christmas in 1986 they gave each other black jaguar cars 
worth 87765 
federal prosecutors are trying to prove the taggarts conspired to 
defraud the irs by using ptl credit cards to get cash advances 
ranging from 5000 to 25000 and then using the money to pay 
personal bills 
the taggarts also are accused of using blank ptl checks to pay 
off their american express bills one check was for 50000 another 
for 45000 the indictment said

a man whose 10yearold daughter accused him of 
sexually abusing her and whose exwife went to prison to keep her 
hidden was awarded legal custody of the child touching off a 
protest by angry women thursday 
the ruling by a probate judge granted joint physical custody of 
nicole lalonde to stephen and virginia lalonde effective july 9 
the girl will be with her father four days a week and with her 
mother the rest of the time 
but stephen lalonde won sole legal custody giving him the power 
to determine such matters as where nicole attends school and her 
daytoday care 
about 50 women gathered outside the statehouse on thursday 
afternoon to protest wednesdays decision many work at rape crisis 
centers while others were victims of rape or incest said dede 
ketover a rally organizer 
im here because the judge put out a very clear message that 
tells kids if youve been molested dont talk about it because no 
ones going to believe you and that tells mothers that if youre 
going to fight for your kids youre going to lose ketover said 
the courts cant protect these kids 
the system has failed nicole kim morrison a counselor at 
the boston area rape crisis center said earlier they have left 
open the possibility of sexual abuse after all this trauma nicole 
has gotten nowhere 
but suffolk county probate judge mary fitzpatrick ruled the 
evidence did not prove that lalonde sexually abused and threatened 
nicole 
the judge describing nicole as intelligent and eager to please 
her parents noted that the child vacillated in her story and 
recanted more than once 
under these circumstances the court cannot simply take the 
childs word as the truth since the court would be in the untenable 
position of having to arbitrarily select one of the childs versions 
over another ms fitzpatrick said 
at the same time the fact tha nicole has wavered in her 
allegations does not automatically preclude the veracity of those 
allegations she said 
the judge also ordered that nicole continue receiving 
psychotherapy 
ms lalondes attorney beth herr said the decision would be 
appealed she said her client was very concerned about her 
daughters welfare and safety 
lalonde was elated by the ruling said his attorney peter 
digangi 
the lalondes began fighting over their daughters custody in a 
closed trial that began may 1988 in boston before fitzpatrick 
ms lalonde and her daughter claimed the child had been abused by 
lalonde who denied the accusation 
the lalondes divorced in 1983 three years later ms lalonde 
accused her exhusband of abusing their child during visits another 
probate judge ruled the charges were unfounded 
rather than see stephen lalonde gain custody mother and child 
fled the state in june 1986 and settled in florida in march 1987 
ms lalonde returned to massachusetts alone 
after ms lalonde refused to say where nicole was a judge 
ordered her imprisoned until she revealed the childs location she 
spent six months in state prison 
ms lalonde was freed only after a baby sitter in durham nc 
tipped police that the child was being sheltered by an underground 
network of women 
nicole was brought back to the state in october 1987 and was 
placed by the state with a foster family 
ms fitzpatrick said wednesday that the child still faces 
considerable difficulties 
nicole will in all likelihood spend her forseeable future in 
therapy attempting to understand her traumatic past and make some 
sort of peace with parents who cannot cooperate the judge said

a court issued manslaughter summonses thursday for 
a shipping company three of its former directors and four seamen 
over the 1987 zeebrugge ferry disaster in which 193 people died 
a corporate manslaughter conviction can carry an unlimited fine 
while the seven men face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment 
the decision to prosecute p and o european ferries was believed 
by experts to be unprecedented it capped more than two years of 
court and police proceedings a public inquiry that blamed the ship 
owners and an inquest that returned a verdict of unlawful killing 
there was no immediate comment from the ferry company or the men 
summoned 
the herald of free enterprise a carandpassenger ferry 
capsized outside the belgian port of zeebrugge in march 1987 
lawyers have disclosed that about twothirds of the families 
affected by the disaster have accepted a compensation package from p 
and o from 7700 to the sixfigure range depending on the 
familys circumstances and the contribution the victim made to the 
familys income 
published reports have estimated the final payout will be at 
least 6 million and as much as 23 million 
an unidentified family that lost its breadwinner father was 
granted 294000 in a test case compensation settlement in the high 
court in january 1988 
facing prosecution are the ships captain david lewry first 
officer leslie sabel senior master john kirby and boatswain mark 
stanley 
also summoned were jeffrey develine wallace ayres and john 
alcindore directors of owner townsend car ferries ltd which is 
now called p and o european ferries the corporate manslaughter 
charge is against p and o european ferries 
the men summoned must appear before magistrates aug 1 the trial 
is expected to begin next year 
its a pretty untested part of the law said a spokeswoman 
for the crown prosecution service which obtained the summonses at 
bow street magistrates court in london 
the spokeswoman commenting on condition of anonymity said that 
except for a couple of cases in the 1920s the state had never 
brought a charge of this sort against a company 
its a complicated question because it is absolutely 
unprecedented for this sort of case to go ahead said michael 
zander professor of law at the london school of economics 
maurice de rohan head of an association of families of the 
disaster victims welcomed the move as did the opposition labor 
partys transport spokesman john prescott 
it makes clear to all directors of companies that they have 
corporate responsibility to see that the highest levels of safety 
pertain in their areas of operation and they dont just blame the 
workers he said 
the ship with an estimated 543 people aboard capsized because its 
bow doors were open letting in water that destabilized it a public 
inquiry concluded 
stanley who allegedly left the doors open was directly blamed 
while lewry and sabel were accused of serious negligence 
of townsend car ferries ltd the inquiry report said from top 
to bottom the body corporate was affected by the disease of 
sloppiness and guilt rested with all concerned in management 
an inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing and 
police conducted a lengthy investigation 
last year in an action brought by the families a court ruled 
that companies could be prosecuted for manslaughter

the fear of malpractice lawsuits is leading some 
doctors to turn away highrisk patients a new gallup poll shows 
fourteen percent of the 1004 doctors surveyed nationwide said 
they had denied service to as many as 10 highrisk patients in the 
past year because of such fears while 4 percent said theyd refused 
to treat more than 10 
more than threefourths of the doctors polled 76 percent said 
they didnt turn away any patients for fear of litigation 
however 35 percent said there are forms of medicine they dont 
practice despite being qualified because of high liability 
insurance costs 
thirtynine percent of those surveyed said they believe indigent 
patients are more likely than other patients to sue for malpractice 
but 22 percent said poor patients are less likely to sue 
in a separate survey of public opinion 48 percent of 1500 
adults polled said they believe people who sue physicians for 
malpractice are just looking for an easy way to make money 
the results of the two surveys are published in fridays american 
medical news the weekly newspaper of the chicagobased american 
medical association 
dr james h sammons ama executive vice president said the 
results were troubling 
i believe it is a critical comment on the state of our legal 
system that even one patient would not receive care because 
physicians feared being sued sammons told the publication 
all of these factors declining highrisk patients limiting 
their type of practice and believing indigent patients are more 
likely to sue affect the publics ability to receive medical care 
he said 
an even more damning indictment of our legal system is that 
almost half of the public surveyed believe that people are just 
looking for an easy way to make money he said 
the gallup organization conducted both polls 
in the physicians poll the 1004 us doctors were chosen at 
random and contacted by telephone from jan 19 through feb 8 the 
margin of error was 35 percentage points meaning answers could 
vary by 35 percentage points either way 
the public poll involved telephone interviews of 1500 randomly 
selected us residents aged 18 and above during the last week of 
january and the first week of february the margin of error was 25 
percentage points 
the question about denying service to highrisk patients did not 
define highrisk 
dr kathleen nolan of the hastings center a medicalethics think 
tank near new york city said some doctors might consider the term 
to mean likely to sue but most would probably define it as 
medically risky such as a case of a diabetic pregnant woman with 
high blood pressure 
in many such cases it may be best for the patient if the doctor 
refers the case to another physician because of possible 
complications the pediatrician and ethicist said

president jose eduardo dos santos of 
marxist angola and rebel leader jonas savimbi shook hands thursday 
and agreed to end 14 years of civil war reports said 
the accord came at the end of an african summit on angola 
attended by 14 african heads of state 
it provides for a ceasefire in angola to start at midnight 
friday 7 pm friday edt according to zairian officials quoted by 
the french news agency agence francepresse 
the meeting between dos santos and savimbi was their first since 
the civil war began in 1975 savimbi heads the usbacked national 
union for the total independence of angola known as unita 
the reconciliation follows a usbrokered regional peace accord 
signed in new york in december under which south africa agreed to 
grant independence to namibia and halt aid to savimbis rebels in 
exchange for the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops backing dos 
santos government 
angola cuba and south africa signed the accord the rebels are 
not party to the agreement 
thursdays peace announcement was called the declaration of 
gbadolite after the town in northern zaire where the summit was 
held it is the hometown of president mobutu sese soko of zaire and 
lies 700 miles northeast of kinshasa the capital 
a commission headed by mobutu is to be established to bring about 
national reconciliation in angola 
the historic handshake followed five hours of delay during which 
hard talks took place zairian officials were quoted as saying 
president moussa traore of mali head of the organization of 
african unity which held the summit was quoted as saying in a 
closing speech that a new page had been turned in african history 
this brotherly handshake between dr jonas savimbi and 
president dos santos symbolizes the end of civil war in angola 
which will open up a new era devoted to economic and social 
development 
reports said a snag developed until savimbi agreed to remain in 
his bush headquarters until elections expected to be held in two 
years 
earlier he had refused to go into exile in the united states 
we can now give angola hope for peace unity and development 
zambias president kenneth kaunda said according to the official 
portuguese news agency lusa 
in washington 19 members of congress on wednesday urged dos 
santos to negotiate wtih the rebels as the only means to end the 
tragic civil war in angola 
kaunda said savimbi promised at the meeting to abide by a 
previous agreement to remain out of peace negotiations according to 
lusa 
that agreement broke a deadlock and brought angolas government 
to the conference table 
savimbi agreed in may he would not demand a role in any 
transitional government on condition democratic elections are held 
within two years 
major obstacles included dos santos insistence on maintaining 
oneparty rule while offering the rebels some positions in his 
administration 
the government offered rebels an amnesty and clemency but the 
guerrillas replied that the offer suggested their war was criminal 
and so was unacceptable 
savimbi garners most of his support from the rural southern area 
toward namibia the ovimbundu tribe the biggest in angola and the 
ovambo dos santos power base is around northern luanda but his 
followers are more diverse coming from several smaller tribes 
dos santos arrived ready to reconcile before leaving luanda 
earlier thursday he commuted death sentences of 50 rebels condemned 
for high treason and terrorism between 198187 angolas official 
angop news agency reported on wednesday it said the government 
released 700 rebel prisoners who accepted an amnesty 
savimbis guerrillas armed by south africa and the united 
states have been fighting to share power with luandas cubanbacked 
government since angolan independence 
washington continues to arm the rebels and may have encouraged 
the rebels to negotiate 
herman cohen assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
said from washington on thursday that the united states helped 
develop the zaire summit 
we may have a breakthrough cohen forecast earlier thursday 
angola is twice the size of texas with 481354 square miles but 
has only 8 million people most of them live in tribal villages and 
rural areas nearly all the portuguese fled in 1975 leaving angola 
more than 90 percent illiterate and badly in need of capital and 
skilled workers 
oil fields in the angolan enclave of cabinda supply more than 90 
percent of the nations export earnings angola also has diamonds 
minerals and rich agricultural land but the civil war has seriously 
disrupted the economy

amnesty international said thursday more than 100 
people in chad have been arrested since an attempted coup in april 
and may face torture and illegal execution 
the human rights group said the detainees seem to have been 
arrested arbitrarily because of their ethnic origin and their family 
connections with other government opponents 
an amnesty statement said all detainees were of the zaghawa 
ethnic group which comes from the northeast portion of the former 
french colony and that the chad government has disclosed nothing 
about them 
amnesty international has received reports of both torture and 
extrajudicial executions of suspected government opponents at 
secret detention centers in ndjamena the capital the statement 
said 
amnesty said it is therefore concerned both that these 
detainees may be subjected to torture and that their lives may be in 
danger 
it named six of them all brothers of sidik fadoul former head 
of military police in a coalition that governed chad from 1979 to 
1982 
it said fadoul was arrested in 1988 when he returned voluntarily 
to chad having been personally assured by president hissene habre 
that he would not be persecuted 
it identified the brothers as professor zakaria fadoul head of 
the linguistics department at the university of chad saleh fadoul 
a bank employee mahamat fadoul a radio chad journalist mahamat 
den fadoul a driver and ali and yacoub fadoul both merchants 
the coup leaders reportedly plotted a takeover after the habres 
anakaza tribe attempted to secure key government administrative and 
military posts the coup plotters hoped to maintain the hadjarai and 
zakawa tribes in the government sources said 
according to chad authorities the coup attempt was made on april 
1 and was led by interior minister ibrahim mahamat itno armed 
forces chief hassan djamous and his predecessor idriss debi 
france and the united states consider chad strategic because of 
its position between libya and zaire and between nigeria and sudan 
france has sent troops to chad twice since 1983 to head off libyan 
incursions 
habre has been president since 1982 when he ousted a 
libyanbacked government led by goukouni oueddei 
chad gained its independence from france in 1960

the wall street journal the nations first 
national newspaper and a fixture in corporate america began life 
100 years ago as a 2cent broadsheet handdelivered in lower 
manhattans business district to a few hundred readers 
as it celebrates its centennial with a special edition friday 
the journal can boast a readership of 2 million making it the 
nations largest newspaper and a reputation as the daily diary of 
capitalism 
its given us a common language with regard to how we look at 
everything from markets to international trade observed everette 
dennis director of the gannett center for media studies in new york 
but even as the paper has grown and adjusted to the modern world 
adding graphics and extra feature sections its virtual monopoly 
on financial news eroded in recent years 
a series of birthday bashes held this week cannot obscure the 
challenges the paper faces as it heads into its second century 
circulation has slipped advertising revenue is down and new 
competition has emerged for both readers and ad dollars 
it still is by far the strongest and most profitable newspaper 
franchise in the country said john morton a media industry 
analyst with lynch jones amp ryan in washington but its not as 
strong and not as profitable as it used to be 
advertising linage peaked in 1983 and has fallen by 75 percent 
since according to the journals figures circulation hit a high of 
21 million at the end of 1983 but since then dropped to about 195 
million 
also in the last few years the new york times launched a 
national edition usa today had its nationwide rollout and most 
metropolitan newspapers beefed up their business coverage as did 
the broadcast networks and cable television 
most of the ad decline stemmed from advertising cutbacks by banks 
and financial institutions the journals biggest source of ads 
said kenneth burenga general manager of the journal and its parent 
dow jones amp co inc 
financial advertising began to slip long before the stock market 
crash of october 1987 due to wall street mergers that reduced the 
number of investment houses burenga said 
circulation was crimped by a reduction in the number of middle 
managers and executives the papers prime readers in the wave of 
mergers takeovers and corporate restructurings of the 1980s 
burenga said 
the journal struck back by adding a third section last fall and 
starting special columns on real estate media marketing law 
technology and other topics it also upgraded its coverage of the 
arts 
some have questioned whether this expansion has weakened the 
journals focus norman pearlstine the journals managing editor 
disagrees 
weve always felt that while we are a business newspaper that 
our readers have interests in more than just business he said 
pearlstine views the broader coverage as another step in the 
journals evolution from a paper serving wall street traders to a 
national daily 
the journal began on july 8 1889 as a fourpage afternoon 
paper the first edition included brief reports on the new york 
boston and philadelphia stock exchanges and numerous items on 
railroad companies then a major force in american business 
much of the shape of todays journal is the work of the late 
bernard barney kilgore the newspapers legendary former 
managing editor who began his 38year journal career in 1929 
under kilgore the paper launched its trademark frontpage 
feature stories called leaders and its indepth reports along 
with stories about trends and issues shaping the business world and 
society 
kilgore stressed that business stories need not be written in the 
arcane language of business dont write banking stories for 
bankers he told reporters write for the banks customers 
the journal is unusual in many ways although it has run an 
occasional photograph it prefers to illustrate stories with 
drawings and it is one of the few big papers to eschew the color 
explosion 
its frontpage design of six vertical columns is virtually cast 
in stone notable exceptions were on oct 20 1987 the day after 
the black monday stock market crash and the day after the japanese 
attacked pearl harbor 
pearlstine says highlights of his 20 years at the paper include 
the two pulitzer prizes the journal won last year increasing to 13 
the number of pulitzers it has been awarded 
the nadir he said was the scandal involving former journal 
reporter r foster winans who was sentenced to 18 months in prison 
in 1985 for securities fraud 
winans was convicted of tipping stock traders to the contents of 
the wall street column he wrote for the paper before it appeared in 
print in exchange winans received a share of any profit they made 
from marketaffecting news 
pearlstine credited the journals thorough coverage of the 
scandal for restoring the papers credibility 
journal executives and industry analysts say the journals 
circulation and advertising setbacks are temporary 
theyve had these kinds of problems before and once the 
advertising economy gets through these things the journal will once 
more prosper said morton

the solidarity citizens committee which 
ran the unions campaign for the new parliament decided thursday 
not to disband now that elections are over patching a dispute that 
threated to split the opposition 
solidarity leader lech walesa and the unions national executive 
commission advocated closing the local citizens committee so that 
activists nationwide could concentrate on rebuilding the solidarity 
trade union itself 
but activists strongly disagreed and after a daylong debtate 
passed two vaguely worded resolutions that solidarity national 
spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said meant local groups could continue 
to exist for now 
about 120 members of the national citizens committee set up in 
december by walesa to advise the union on political social and 
economic issues gathered in a warsaw university auditorium for the 
debate 
during the debate walesa defended a weekend resolution by the 
unions executive commission to concentrate efforts on rebuilding 
the east blocs first independent trade union which regained legal 
status april 17 
union organizing took a back seat during the election campaign 
but the final resolution thanked the local citizens committees 
which helped solidarity to its overwhelming election victory and 
said they should help prepare for free municipal elections a 
solidarity goal 
the executives resolution to dissolve the local committees 
should not be treated as something that should be implemented 
immediately onyszkiewicz said todays resolution says one 
should approach their transformation with flexibility he said 
the citizens committee is of the opinion that the main task at 
the present moment is expanding and strengthening the solidarity 
trade union and farmers solidarity as guarantors of democratic 
reforms in our country it said 
a 14member commission was appointed to present proposals on the 
future of the national citizens committee by sept 10 
walesa appeared concerned the continued existence of the 
committees would drain strength from rebuilding the union 
today if we get divided into two we weaken the most 
important stream and the most important stream today is the broad 
stream of working people he said 
a top adviser to walesa who opposed disbanding the committees 
tried to downplay conflict 
first of all we want to say in the current situation that we 
maintain unity that we are able to maintain it and that there is no 
conflict between the citizens committee and the bodies of the 
union said bronislaw geremek 
the weekend decision was greeted with anger from members of the 
local committees flush with their electoral triumph which saw 
solidarity win 99 of of 100 seats in the freely contested senate in 
june 4 and june 18 elections solidarity also won all seats 
available to it in the lower house the sejm 
critics said the decision was to prevent the committees in each 
of polands 49 provinces from becoming parallel possibly rival 
organizations to solidarity 
the dispute reflected contradictions within solidarity over 
whether it is ultimately a trade union or a political movement and 
whether it will be led by workers or intellectuals 
walesa has said solidarity should be mainly a union with 
politics eventually shifted to newly emerging political groups 
but solidarity nevertheless has a broad following among 
nonworkers students intellectuals and professionals who are 
more interested in pressing communist authorities for democratic 
political changes

unsuccessfully for the release of the four pending an appeal

frederick p doolittle 28 and constance z jackson 38 all of los 
angeles were convicted of firstdegree manslaughter may 12 in the 
death of dayna broussard 
dayna endured hundreds of blows for stealing food from another

slapped dropped on the floor shoved bitten spit upon and hung 
out a window 
jackson who beat five other ecclesia children with an electrical 
cord was convicted june 5 of five counts each of seconddegree 
assault and firstdegree criminal mistreatment 
clackamas county circuit judge john lowe sentenced jackson to 10 
years in prison to be served after the manslaughter sentence on 
that conviction she will be eligible for parole in seven years

since none had criminal records but prosecutor alfred j french iii 
urged the maximum penalty for all four 
chambers who got the stiffest penalty of the four will be 
eligible for parole in 10 years 
the 50 or more blows dealt by chambers were mainly to blame for 
the girls death lowe said 
chambers described dayna during the trial as a strongwilled 
strongbodied worldclass athlete lowe recalled but she was 
not yet a worldclass athlete she was an 8yearold girl 
jackson was convicted of striking and biting dayna

brinson and doolittle who held the girl down will each have to 
serve 40 months before being eligible for parole 
no human being could have participated without asking hasnt 
this gone far enough lowe said of the two 
defense attorney ron thom said the sentences will be appealed

im walking a tightrope he explained to the court 
when i dont show any emotion im inhuman broussard said 
when i do express my feelings people think im faking i would 
like to assure you my daughters loss is serious to me 
he declined to comment after the sentencing 
broussard 35 formed ecclesia in los angeles tough watts area 
to steer ghetto children away from drugs and crime and toward 
rigorous athletic training

doesnt have any sense 
broussard was in los angeles at the time of the beating at a 
farmhouse east of portland he has denied all along that dayna was 
beaten saying that children in the group were spanked as part of 
the groups strict disciplinary policy

state protective custody after daynas death they are living with

president bush issued a strong personal dissent 
thursday to the supreme court decision overturning flagdesecration 
laws declaring that flag burning is wrong dead wrong 
bush who made the flag a major issue in his 1988 campaign 
commented as he unveiled a nationwide volunteer program and asked 
congress to appropriate 100 million for it over the next four years 
meanwhile presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the 
administrations response to the crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in china 
we feel the administration has spoken out loudly strongly and 
without reservation on this issue fitzwater said weve spoken 
out forcefully more than any other country in the world 
the president also met with homeless youths in a center near 
times square where one young woman told him the minimum wage was so 
low that it was more profitable to sell drugs 
its hard to get good jobs a 20yearold covenant house 
resident identified only as monique said suggesting that it was 
more profitable to sell drugs working in mcdonalds at the 
minimum wage it just doesnt pay 
bush vetoed a bill that would have raised the minimum wage from 
335 an hour to 455 saying that figure was too high 
in a speech to new york business and community leaders bush 
departed from his prepared text on the volunteerism program to 
comment on wednesdays 54 supreme court ruling 
he stopped short of directly criticizing the court saying he 
understood the legal basis of the decision 
but i have to give you my personal emotional response bush 
said flag burning is wrong dead wrong 
he was applauded vigorously by the luncheon crowd of about 1000 
when he concluded the flag of the united states is very very 
special 
bush frequently symbolically wrapped himself in the flag during 
last years campaign even giving a speech outside a new jersey flag 
factory 
he repeatedly attacked his democratic opponent massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis for having vetoed a school pledge of 
allegiance law 
the courts decision restricts the power of states to punish 
those who burn or otherwise desecrate an american flag 
bush borrowed from another campaign theme his thousand points 
of light in continuing to trumpet the theme of volunteerism he 
has heralded all week 
he announced that he would serve as honorary chairman of a 
points of light foundation to oversee volunteer efforts and 
that new jersey gov tom kean would head the foundations advisory 
committee 
bush said he would ask congress for 25 million a year over the 
next four years to support the nonprofit independent organization 
which will solicit matching funds from the private sector 
kean who said bush had asked him to head the committee wednesday 
night said specific uses for the funding had not been decided 
this is what i mean when i talk of a thousand points of light 
that vast galaxy of people and institutions working together to 
solve problems in their own back yard bush said 
he first used the points of light phrase at last summers 
republican convention 
the president called on all individuals businesses and 
institutions to join in the volunteer effort saying corporations 
should set up literacy programs to make sure each employee can read 
and that restaurants and grocery stores should distribute surplus 
food to soup kitchens and local shelters 
in remarks at a new york state republican dinner bush turned to 
politics saying that new york voters in particular minority and 
ethnic voters are shifting from automatic loyalty to the other 
party and voting republican more and more often 
we are justly proud of how far weve come as a party so far 
that we now have a good chance of winning the mayors office in new 
york city the most powerful local office in america 
former us attorney rudolph giuliani is a leading candidate in 
the republican effort to oust incumbent democratic mayor ed koch 
at a 100th anniversary celebration for the wall street journal 
bush praised the publication 
in a changing world that offers 64 channels of cable 
television the six columns of the wall street journal are as 
familiar as the morning coffee at our breakfast tables he said 
he called the journal one of americas most trusted 
publications but joked that not every article was a pulitzer 
prize winner in 1967 a front page story on china predicted the 
communist government wouldnt last the year 
the president said he actually likes because you dont carry 
doonesbury the comic strip that frequently lampoons bush the 
journal carries no comic strips 
he also returned to his main theme of the day of volunteerism 
noting that some of the nations top corporate executives were in 
the audience 
it is my request i believe your obligation to donate the 
services of the talented and the enterprising within your ranks 
many are doing this now everyone should do this

a fuel truck spill forced president bush to 
change his route out of new york city thursday night 
air force one flew from newark international airport in new 
jersey to john f kennedy airport in queens borough of new york 
because of concerns by security officials about the accident near 
the newark airport white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters 
bush delayed the departure of his motorcade from a banquet in 
downtown manhattan to let secret service escorts and new york city 
police chart a new course to the kennedy airport 
there has been an accident involving two fuel trucks near the 
newark airport fitzwater told reporters outside the building 
where the president and mrs bush had attended the 100th anniversary 
dinner of the wall street journal 
fitzwater said he was not sure what the trucks carried but 
whatever they are they are considered toxic especially when 
considered mixed 
for those reasons we have been advised to move air force one 
and the press plane to another location he added 
bush had flown to newark on air force one thursday morning to 
visit a shelter for runaway youth and to call for a crusade to spur 
volunteerism in a speech before a civic group

members of a radical group set an 
american flag afire thursday a day after the us supreme court 
affirmed their right to do so 
outside the university of california at berkeley members of a 
group called the revolutionary communist youth brigade called the 
burning of the national banner a celebration and referred to the 
flag and the united states in profane terms 
elsewhere however congressmen and new yorks mayor decried the 
high courts ruling that burning the flag was protected by the right 
to free speech in alabama military veterans reacted with shock and 
dismay 
the high court on wednesday ruled 54 in favor of gregory 
joey johnson who torched the flag during a protest at the 1984 
republican convention in dallas he appealed a oneyear sentence and 
a 2000 fine 
the decision of the supreme court knocked down antiflag 
desecration laws in 48 states 
in washington dc sen pete wilson introduced a joint 
resolution that proposed a constitutional amendment to protect the 
dignity of the us flag 
the bill of rights whose first article protects freedom of 
speech should not imply the right to desecrate the flag said 
wilson a republican from california 
new yorks mayor edward koch also said that the constitution 
should be amended to prohibit such political expression 
we were shocked that the law of the country now is that you can 
burn a flag with impunity he said 
in montgomery ala gordon shewmake state adjutant 
quartermaster of the veterans of foreign wars said he didnt 
understand why anyone would want to burn the flag 
people have died for that piece of cloth he said if they 
dont like our flag they can go live under another flag and i dont 
think theyd like that at all 
shewmake a 23year air force veteran said he was proud to see 
the american flag while serving overseas during the occupation of 
japan after world war ii and in korea and vietnam 
but a spokesman for the american civil liberties union of alabama 
said the decision correctly interpreted the first amendment 
guarantee of free speech 
martin mccaffrey vice president of the state civil liberties 
union board of directors said the decision was not an issue of 
patriotism but of civil rights 
the same first amendment that protects your right to wave the 
flag protects your right to burn the flag mccaffrey said

the senate thursday night approved a compromise 
bill to remove the remaining wellhead price controls from natural 
gas 
the housesenate compromise was cleared in the senate by a voice 
vote the house must take final action on the bill before it can be 
sent to president bush who is expected to sign it 
the legislation is designed to remove all federal price controls 
on natural gas by jan 1 1993 it is not expected to affect retail 
prices much because most gas under controls already is selling below 
the official ceilings 
the senates action came two days after house and senate 
negotiators agreed that gas from wells drilled after the date of 
enactment of the bil would be deregulated on may 15 1991 all other 
gas not already decontrolled would be freed from the federal 
ceilings when sales contracts are renegotiated or jan 1 1993 
whichever comes first 
about twothirds of the nations natural gas was freed from 
controls in 1978

a congressman said thursday that death 
squads possibly hired by drug traffickers are hunting down members 
of the governing liberal party 
rep jorge infante leal said in a communique sent to liberal 
leaders that more than 100 members were killed in the eastern plains 
in the last year 
the defense ministry confirmed his statements the ministry said 
previously that guerrillas of the colombian revolutionary armed 
forces are targeting liberal party members 
the guerrillas may be taking revenge for rightwing death squads 
killing more than 800 members of colombias biggest leftist party 
the patriotic union in four years 
but el tiempo newspaper quoted the congressman as saying he is 
not entirely convinced that guerrillas are behind the killings of 
liberal party members 
infante leal said the gunmen could be hired by drug traffickers 
who are killing liberals because a liberal faction has sought an 
alliance with the patriotic union 
drug runners have been at war with guerrillas here for years 
because of rebel attempts to kidnap drug traffickers or members of 
their families and hold them for ransom 
also drug traffickers resent guerrilla demands of payment of a 
socalled revolution tax in areas where traffickers raise coca 
plants for producing cocaine or where the traffickers have ranches 
national police have said 
the liberal party members have been killed in guaviare meta and 
vichada states areas where coca bushes are grown in abundance and 
where the colombian revolutionary armed forces have an estimated 
5000 guerrillas

a leader of east germanys communist party one of 
the most rigid in the soviet bloc on thursday defended chinas 
official version of the crackdown on prodemocracy activists 
joachim herrmann a member of the partys policymaking 
politburo also denounced democratic reform in hungary and backed 
the berlin wall 
herrmann who also serves as secretary of the partys central 
committee made his comments in a politburo report he read to a 
central committee meeting on foreign policy 
speaking about the violent suppression of student demonstrators 
in china herrmann said east germany has published all official 
chinese statements with the purpose of denying western horror 
stories and to present objective information 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources say the death 
toll in the june 34 crackdown may have been as high as 3000 the 
chinese governments most recent report says 100 soldiers and 100 
civilians died most east germans are able to watch west german 
television 
herrmann whose speech was distributed by the governmentrun news 
agency adn said the peaceful student demonstrations in beijing 
were intended to be used for a counterrevolutionary overthrow of 
peoples power in china 
the politburo makes all key decisions in east germany and its 
report expresses the views of the countrys aging leaders led by 
erich honecker head of the party 
the party has strongly resisted sovietstyle economic and 
political reforms and herrmanns speech reaffirmed the countrys 
leading hardline position in the soviet bloc 
the politburo report said east germany will remain true to its 
own policies and made no hints at any reforms 
hungarys communist party and opposition groups have agreed to 
hold multiparty elections by next summer last week hundreds of 
thousands of hungarians turned out for an emotional reburial of imre 
nagy the communist leader executed after leading a revolt crushed 
by soviet troops in 1956 
under the flag of renewing socialism forces are at work that 
strive for the removal of socialism in this connection the 
developments in hungary fill us with great concern herrmann said 
he accused western leaders whom he did not identify of stepping 
up ideological and economic pressure on communist countries in an 
attempt to make them reject communism and turn to capitalism 
herrmann said the berlin wall will continue to protect east 
germany from economic plundering from the penetration of criminal 
elements and from drug smuggling 
he said the berlin wall will remain as long as the reasons that 
led to its construction remain east germany claims it built the 
wall to prevent a possible attack or infiltration from the west 
however western governments agree that east germany built the 
wall at soviet insistence to stop the massive flow of refugees from 
east to west 
president bush in a speech during a visit to west germany this 
month challenged east germany to tear down the berlin wall 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev noted that nothing is 
eternal and that the wall was not a great problem in eastwest 
relations but he did not call for its removal when he visited west 
germany last week

a 23yearold suspect in the slayings of 
his parents and two other relatives was shot and killed by state 
police thursday after he opened fire ending a sixhour standoff 
authorities said 
eben mcdowell 23 of stamford was killed around 5 pm at a 
schoharie county farm where hed fled after his father mother 
brother and grandfather were killed wednesday in neighboring 
delaware county officials said 
the four were shot to death at the grandfathers cabin in woods 
just outside stamford about 50 miles southwest of albany said 
delaware county sheriff paul peterson 
the grandfather charles klepetar 78 was found shot in his bed 
attorney robert h mcdowell 59 and his 22yearold son daniel were 
found at the edge of a pond near the cabin and his wife elizabeth 
48 was found in the pond peterson said she had apparently been 
trying to flee 
the bodies were discovered thursday morning by a social worker 
whod found a note eben mcdowell left on the front door of his 
fathers stamford law office said peterson 
the note on the office door of the law office was written in 
third person to make it look like his father did it peterson said 
a police helicopter tracked eben mcdowell to a pond a few miles 
north of the crime scene and a halfmile away from the familys home 
police cornered mcdowell there around 11 am and had been 
trying to persuade him to surrender when he started shooting 
peterson said 
people who knew the suspect said he had a history of getting into 
trouble 
he got into his share of trouble as a kid just as any kid 
would but in the last few years he really went bad said fred 
hyatt who employed mcdowell three years ago at a stamford lumber 
yard 
the slayings shocked residents of this town of less than 2000 
people 
i couldnt believe it when i heard about it i was just sick 
said diner owner john deleo i just cant figure it out they were 
beautiful people 
robert mcdowell was involved in many community affairs while

a former babysitter testified thursday that actor 
william hurt referred to the mother of his son as his wife while 
having lunch with the child in a pizza parlor in the summer of 1985 
linda patrick who said she had met hurt for the first time 
testified on the fourth day of a trial to determine whether the 
actor had a commonlaw marriage in south carolina with former 
ballerina sandra jennings 
how do you like working with my wife she quoted hurt as 
asking about jennings mother of hurts son alexander now 6 
the babysitter said that occasionally when she went for walks 
with the boy people would come up and say how is mrs hurt 
that comment was stricken from the record because it was not given 
in response to a question 
jennings 32 bases her claim of a commonlaw marriage on four 
weeks she spent with hurt in beaufort sc from dec 9 1982 when 
he learned he was divorced from actress mary beth hurt to jan 10 
1983 when hurt and jennings left the state hurt was filming the 
big chill there at the time 
jennings now seeks to have the court declare that she and hurt 
are married so she can get a divorce and a share of his assets 
estimated by her lawyer a richard golub to be about 10 million 
patrick was another of several witnesses who have testified that 
hurt called jennings his wife but no one has said he made such a 
reference during the fourweek period in south carolina on which 
jennings claim is based 
south carolina recognizes commonlaw marriages new york does not 
the trial continues on monday when it is expected to conclude

free speech advocates are hailing a supreme 
court ruling in a texas flagburning case they say fortifies and 
expands constitutional protection for political dissent 
but conservatives and veterans groups expressed anger and sadness 
the justices by a 54 vote wednesday said burning the american 
flag as a form of political protest is protected by the 
constitutions free speech guarantees 
the court said texas authorities violated a protesters rights 
when they prosecuted him under a state law barring desecration or 
destruction of the flag the justices upheld a lower court ruling 
that overturned the protesters conviction oneyear prison term and 
2000 fine 
professor martin redish of northwestern university said the 
ruling means the government cannot censor a viewpoint based on its 
offensiveness 
but hf sparky gierke national commander of the american 
legion said as a veteran my first reaction to the decision is 
one of anger then my anger turns to extreme sadness this is a sad 
day for the united states of america

house republicans are seeking to turn a 
liability into an asset with the case of donald e lukens the ohio 
gop lawmaker convicted on charges involving sex with a 16yearold 
girl 
the republican conference on wednesday made a preemptive strike 
voting to force an ethics investigation of their colleague before 
democrats could do the same or the ethics committee did so on its 
own 
now they are looking to democrats to spotlight some of their own 
colleagues as ethics violators 
i think its an appropriate kind of step to suggest that the 
other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of tough thing 
that is involved in what our conference did said rep robert 
walker rpa a member of the gop leadership

a little company on a steamy bayou marine 
shale processors raked in millions using what it said was a 
revolutionary process to turn toxic waste into glassy black rubble 
it sold for construction projects 
last year it handled wastes from more than 2500 companies in 48 
states 
meanwhile residents of st mary parish accuse the company of 
cancercausing pollution state environmental officials have levied 
over 5 million in fines and last month halted sale of its black 
aggregate sen john breaux dla held hearings on marine 
shale last year and two federal grand juries reportedly have studied 
it 
this month the company laid off nearly a fourth of its 400 
employees 
competitors who call the process a sham say the end is near 
but jack kent marine shales fierytempered president vows he 
wont shut down without a long and costly fight anybody with 
halfway brains would know this is a much better process to handle 
this material than any other method in the country today or in 
the world today he said 
as far as were concerned marine shale is on death row its 
just a matter of hooking up the juice said richard fortuna of the 
hazardous waste treatment council a washingtonbased lobbying group 
for rollins environmental services and other waste handlers whose 
prices were undercut 
marine shale began burning hazardous waste in its 275foot long 
kiln in 1985 charging up to 300 per 55gallon drum to take toxic 
materials from those who produce them kent says thats about half 
what others charged it sold its aggregate as fill for roadbeds and 
boat slips for 1 a ton 
msp gross revenues for the first quarter 1989 are the highest 
ever boasts a flier in the office kent said that translates to 
roughly 22 million 
profit ordinarily would run 15 percent he said but millions in 
legal fees are making a healthy dent and business has dropped off 
50 percent he said since the may 26 order banning sale of marine 
shale aggregate 
the hazardous waste treatment council says the huge 
computermonitored kiln is nothing more than a glorified 
incinerator fortuna said marine shale skirted environmental laws by 
calling itself a recycler instead of a disposer 
marine shale countered that it was operating under some of the 
nations strictest air and water permits stricter than those for a 
rollins incinerator at baton rouge louisiana department of 
environmental quality officials backed that claim though the agency 
has accused the company of frequently violating the permits and is 
trying to have them revoked 
the state has complained of sloppy storage violation of air 
quality standards and refusal to move an allegedly dangerous storage 
barge off bayou bouef alongside the plant marine shale has complied 
with some deq orders and has appealed others including one revoking 
its permits because it allegedly treated waste from a foreign 
country canada in violation of state law 
company vice president and general counsel george eldredge has 
repeatedly accused deq of delaying administrative hearings on 
orders some dating to 1986 kent is eager to get deq hearings over 
with so he can take matters to court miriam price of st mary 
parish is just as eager as kent but for different reasons i see 
a long road ahead for those of us who would like to see marine shale 
closed and were looking to deq to do the job 
mrs price claims a personal stake her granddaughter nicole 
price is one of six children afflicted with a rare form of cancer 
malignant neuroblastoma 
the mother of one child who died from the disease has filed suit 
against marine shale blaming it for the cancer mrs price points 
out that all six were diagnosed after the company began operations 
nonetheless she said i cannot accuse them i have no proof 
a louisiana state university study of the neuroblastoma cases 
notes that the cancer is usually thought to originate before birth 
and that three of the stricken children were born before marine 
shale began operating 
in almost four years of study the environmental protection 
agency has yet to say whether marine shale has done anything wrong 
or if it should be allowed to keep operating we really cant make 
additional comments on marine shale because of the legal 
complexities of the case said spokesman roger meacham 
more than a year ago the epa did say marine shales aggregate 
posed no imminent or substantial endangerment to the public health 
or environment 
the state halted sales because of evidence that rain especially 
acid rain could cause lead and other metals to dissolve out of the 
material in higher amounts than the epa allows said deq attorney 
elizabeth megginson 
megginson cited tests revealing lead levels of 55 parts per 
million to 15 ppm vs an epa standard of 5 ppm eldredge however 
said standards that apply to marine shales product allow up to 5 
ppm 
kent said he would not immediately fight the deq order in court 
but would hold up shipments of the aggregate and try to work out an 
agreement with state officials to test the product and ensure its 
safety 
as marine shales appeals drag on its giant kiln resembling an 
elongated cement mixer continues to turn and aggregate continues to 
tumble out 
wastes poured into the kiln are heated to 2000 degrees for 2 
hours while vapors from the process run through two giant buildings 
lined with scores of filters and rise into the air through a 
smokestack 140 feet high 
whats left is a brownishgray powder if tests show toxic 
materials were eliminated the process is over the powder also can 
be used in roadbuilding and has been used to soak up liquid waste 
if toxic metals like lead or barium are found in the powder they 
dont burn it is blown into furnaces melted and cooled to form 
the gemlike chunks kent calls black gold 
meanwhile marine shale continues negotiating with deq over the 
complicated issues surrounding its process if that fails eldredge 
said it wont be decided until it gets to the louisiana supreme 
court

americans have learned to use debt like never 
before but it doesnt necessarily follow that they are creating an 
economic problem in doing so 
that assumption that consumer debt is dangerously high is 
often made after a casual glance at lending figures that among 
other things show the debttoincome ratio at skyhigh levels 
compared to a few years ago 
a decade ago for example analysts worried when the ratio 
reached 155 meaning that consumer debt was 155 percent of 
disposable income when it topped 16 percent a few years later they 
warned that a recession was due 
true to the forecast the economy fell into the brief recession 
of 1980 and then into a much deeper recession that lasted from july 
1981 to november 1982 that brought the ratio back under 15 
now and for the past several years the ratio is back over 15 
and 16 and 17 and 18 numbers that had never been seen before and 
which werent even foreseen a decade ago 
theories abound lenders have lowered their standards 
deregulation has made lenders more aggressive in seeking customers 
prices have risen faster than many incomes and stable employment 
has created a sense of security 
some critics believe that the sense of security from stable jobs 
is a false one credit evaluation systems they point out rarely 
deal explicitly with the question of how long employment might last 
they judge by the past not future 
other observers however suggest the explanation is in the 
credit figures themselves rather than in consumer behavior what 
seems to be a problem of too much borrowing they say may be 
statistical rather than economic 
here are some numbers to digest 
revolving credit accounts for about 30 percent of consumer 
installment credit rising from 14 billion in 1975 to 185 billion 
now a gain of 1200 percent 
total installment credit grew from 160 billion in 1975 to 666 
billion over the same period 
much of this credit is in the form of money owed to retailers 
but a growing amount of it is in bank credit card balances in 10 
years the latter have risen from less than 50 percent of revolving 
credit to almost twothirds 
however the story told by these figures provided by economist 
william dunkelberg is not what it appears to be 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of business and 
management calls attention to a fact often overlooked that more 
than half these bank balances 25 percent for retail cards are 
repaid each month at no interest 
in effect these balances which keep the ratios at record high 
levels are not debt in the minds of consumers but convenient 
substitutes for the use of cash and checks in making transactions 
dunkelberg estimates conservatively he says that 75 billion of 
these cash and check substitute balances are not debt in the 
traditional sense remove them he says and the debttoincome 
ratio drops all the way down to 165 
while that percentage is nearly three points lower than the 
latest official figures it still appears high in fact it is about 
as high as the rate that prevailed just before the 19811982 
recession 
still dunkelberg suggests the ratio might not have the same 
significance now as it had back then several lending and borrowing 
changes tend to put a new and different interpretation on the 
figures 
important among these changes is a sharp rise in the share of 
consumer credit accounted for by consumers in the top 20 percent of 
the income tables many of whom have sufficient assets to support 
debt 
the behavior of these upperincome folks may have changed 
dunkelberg suggests because of such things as taxdeductible 
second mortgage lines of credit and the proliferation of credit 
cards 
as he analyzes the scene the high debttoincome ratio may not 
be evidence of individuals taking on greater risk as much as it is a 
sign that more people are using debt for convenience or other 
reasons

joanne woodward herself a beneficiary of the 
teachings of the group theatre narrates a homage to the handful of 
pioneers who changed the face of modern american theater in the 
season opener of pbs american masters on monday 
theatergoers take innovation and risktaking for granted 
nowadays but when cheryl crawford lee strasberg and harold clurman 
founded the group theatre in 1931 broadway was awash in polite 
drawingroom comedies and stodgy mainstream drama 
all three had worked at the theatre guild crawford as a casting 
director clurman as a play reader and strasberg as a stage manager 
and sometime actor but they felt no emotional connection to the 
works there amid the troubled times following the crash on wall 
street they joined together in a common belief that the theater 
should be more of an outlet for societal reflection and formed a 
repertory company that would produce american plays on broadway 
the 90minute documentary broadway dreamers the legacy of the 
group theatre includes woodwards interviews over a fiveyear 
period with as many of the original members and associates as 
possible including crawford also included are archival interviews 
with the late clurman and strasberg 
the group theatre lasted only a decade but its impact is still 
felt in american theater and film today the teachers it launched 
handed down a then groundbreaking philosophy of craft combined with 
creativity group members stella adler strasberg sanford meisner 
woodwards teacher and robert lewis numbered among their students 
marlon brando james dean robert de niro al pacino meryl streep 
paul newman warren beatty gregory peck ellen burstyn shelley 
winters playwright david mamet and directors sydney pollack and 
peter bogdanovich 
woodward also talks to many actors playwrights and directors who 
began their careers with the group theatre interspersed with the 
interviews is footage from a 1987 williamstown mass stage tribute 
to the group theatre appearing to perform readings are woodward 
newman winters burstyn and james naughton among others 
two other actors pay homage to former teachers who were part of 
the group theatre in subsequent american masters programs 
on july 3 meryl streep narrates harold clurman a life of 
theatre the documentary includes neverbeforeseen footage of 
stage performances and interviews with students and associates of 
clurman including julie harris arthur miller strasberg elia 
kazan karl malden and roy scheider who reads from clurmans 
lectures 
then on july 10 frank langella narrates stella adler awake 
and dream it includes a lengthy interview with adler whose 
students included brando de niro beatty and candice bergen

guitarist steve morse cant escape his past but 
he says the devotion fans have to his old band the dregs hasnt 
stifled his creativity or kept him from looking to the future 
wherever morse plays these days people want to hear the old 
songs he wrote and performed with the dregs an eclectic 
instrumental group that never had anything approaching a hit record 
but garnered an intensely loyal though relatively small 
following 
the band originally called the dixie dregs was formed in 1977 
and broke up in 1983 leaving behind six albums and memories of 
frenzied stimulating concerts the continuing interest in the old 
material is no problem for the 35yearold morse 
what allows me and my family to eat is the fact that people do 
come back he said in an interview during a short break from a 
monthlong club tour to promote his latest solo album high 
tension wires for mca records 
its like one guy a baker in a neighborhood of a big city 
doing his job the best he can he gets a following and as long as 
he does the job people will come back 
im more like that neighborhood baker than nabisco but the 
repeat business gives me confidence there will be a tomorrow 
morses latest music is like the dregs a wide mix of styles he 
incorporates rock jazz classical celtic and country and fuses 
them into a sound that somehow manages to be both manic and sweetly 
lyrical 
theres also a bit more acoustic guitar than before from the 
fivetime winner of guitar player magazines best overall 
readers poll category 
though morse is joined by some of his former bandmates on the 
album which contains a remake of the dregs leprechaun 
promenade recorded during a brief 1988 reunion his touring trio 
includes new sidemen van romaine on drums and dave larou on bass 
morse said he was excited about the new band which hit the road 
after only three days of rehearsal he likes the freedom of playing 
in front of an audience and relishes the contrast from the more 
methodical approach he takes in the studio 
playing live is the ultimate expression when you improvise 
its stream of consciousness he said playing live is like 
driving a race car you have to react quickly and hope youre 
right 
the live show includes songs from the dregs days numbers from 
his two previous steve morse band albums and about three selections 
from the new record 
the band does not play many of the quieter songs on stage we 
try to keep the energy level up morse said 
since the breakup of the dregs morse also has played with the 
group kansas and sat in with the reformed lynyrd skynyrd those 
projects gave him another outlet for his guitar playing that of 
sideman instead of bandleader 
part of the reason i did the thing with kansas was to 
completely experience the opposite of leading a band he said 
in manageable doses its fun its less pressure just playing 
guitar parts and showing up for gigs alive thats a lot less 
pressure 
morse also is an accomplished pilot who flies his groups 
airplane from date to date he also holds clinics for young 
guitarists in almost every town in which he performs 
he said the guitarists coming up now are approaching the 
instrument differently than when he started out but their goals 
have not changed 
the emphasis now is more on technique and i dont mean 
moronic technique than on writing he said theres more 
emphasis on twohanded playing and on whammybar playing 
but i guess the motivating factor is the same as 10 20 years 
ago the kids want to play and make good music come out of their 
guitars 
morse also sees a resurgence in interest in instrumental rock 
music and he finds that gratifying 
but it would make me feel better if it had happened when we 
were doing it he said

will an economically integrated europe scheduled 
for 1992 cooperate in world trade for the benefit of everyone or 
fight to maintain a privileged position for itself 
on either side of the atlantic the almost automatic answer varies 
little why of course europe will pursue an open trade policy 
doesnt everyone know that free trade trade without artificial 
barriers benefits everyone 
the automatic response and the eagerness to assure however may 
be only a veneer covering vast uncertainties an economically 
unified europe could be an amiable giant or if provoked a muscled 
bully protecting his turf 
in the abstract every important trading nation professes an 
almost theological belief in free trade but each also is aware of 
the benefits however temporary of limiting the flow of foreign 
goods into its markets 
which course will europe take 
by the end of 1992 members of the european economic community 
plan to remove almost all barriers to each others trade investment 
and movement of labor creating a common market of 320 million 
people 
obviously they wouldnt do so if they didnt believe in mutual 
benefits for each other instead of a dozen relatively weak markets 
for goods the united market would be an economic entity comparable 
to the united states 
having achieved that will they then seek to protect their 
free market from others will they restrict japanese and 
american access or will they express their faith in open 
competition by leaving their market doors ajar 
while the latter seems the most likely route the underlying 
uncertainty is aroused again and again by incidents that isolated 
from the bigger picture seem of far less importance 
this week in geneva for example some european trade negotiators 
felt the united states had violated the spirit of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade by threatening trade sanctions 
against brazil india and japan 
those sanctions have not been imposed and there is some question 
about whether uncle sam really intends to do anything at all about 
what he perceives to be unfair trade practices by these nations 
the mere threat however was sufficient to raise tempers and 
in trade talks whenever tempers rise the threat of retaliation soon 
follows 
a simple french television commercial now two years old but 
still replayed in the minds of wary americans and japanese also 
demonstrates how close those uncertainties are to the surface 
the commercial sponsored by the french government showed a 
skinny boxer faced down by a huge american football player and a 
massive and menacing japanese sumo wrester 
the fate of the skinny french boxer seemed bleak but he did not 
run no need to because soon he was surrounded by 11 other boxers 
who helped rout the huge american football player and the massive 
japanese wrestler 
in short scratch a freetrader on either side of the atlantic or 
anywhere else in the world and you might find a protectionist 
the latter might bury their sympathies for the sake of public 
decorum but seldom do they bury them so deep that they cannot be 
aroused and resurrected immediately

shocked at its extent churches are grappling 
with a newly recognized problem in their own domain sexual 
harassment of women particularly female clergy 
concern about it has risen as increasing numbers of women have 
entered the ordained ministry traditionally a profession of males 
and largely limited to them until modern times 
the trouble however has surfaced among lay women as well as 
clergywomen 
it has turned up in every setting of the church declared the 
board of directors of the united church of christs coordinating 
center for women in church and society after reviewing reports 
about it 
one of the centers research projects found that of 138 women 
clergy surveyed 45 percent of them said they had been sexually 
harassed in the workplace that is in church precincts 
its a startling figure said marilyn breitling of st louis 
the centers executive director the harassment was not identified 
by type but no matter how you define it thats an inordinately 
high number 
we were shocked 
however there has been little or no awareness of the problem 
until recently she said but it now is drawing increased attention 
in major protestant denominations most of which now ordain women 
it was very very hidden and people did not talk about it but 
now theyre beginning to talk about it in a straightforward way and 
seek ways to deal with it she said in a telephone interview 
especially in church you expect to be treated with respect and 
dignity she said for church colleagues to intimidate take 
advantage harass or molest is just unconscionable 
unfortunately those kind of things are happening harassment 
is occuring even in the church the church needs to speak to that 
problem in its own life just as it speaks to things in the culture 
at large 
among lay women the centers survey found 20 percent of them 
reported incidents of sexual harassment within the church less than 
half the proportion of women clergy doing so 
the 17millionmember united church through its antecedant 
congregationalism merged in 1957 with the evangelical and reformed 
church pioneered womens ordination beginning in the l850s 
sixteen percent of the denominations 10000 clergy are women 
other protestant bodies including presbyterians lutherans 
united methodists episcopalians and others have begun ordaining 
women only since the 1950s more than 20000 women now are among 
us clergy 
sexual harassment has aroused concern in several denominations 
the presbyterian church usa last week called for development of a 
churchwide policy on sexual misbehavior in the church household 
in most denominations all of us are very much concerned about 
the issue said ann dubois a louisville ky presbyterian 
specialist on women in church employment 
a special study about it is under way in the northeast 
its no respecter of denominations mrs breitling said 
its a very common experience its also one weve avoided dealing 
with but the issue is coming to the fore in most every 
denomination 
the united methodist church at its l986 governing conference said 
sexual harassment has been documented in congregations agencies 
seminaries and other institutions one limited survey found one in 
eight united methodist women reported being sexually harassed in 
church environs 
the denomination called for grievance procedures for victims and 
penalties for offenders it also launched a denominationwide study 
on the extent of church sexual harassment 
the united churchs womens center proposes a resolution for the 
denominations general synod june 29july 4 saying women 
volunteers seminarians pastors and lay employees report varied 
experiences of sexual harassment 
that is a disappointing fact in an institution that is based on 
values of equality and respect for all persons the measure says 
it calls for gathering of more data and developing guidelines about 
the matter 
the resolution identifies two types of sexual harassment one 
being the imposition of unwelcome sexual activity suggestion or 
behavior in a relationship of unequal power 
that refers to such situations as between pastor and associate 
minister or intern or between clergywomen and members of the church 
board of trustees when superiors manipulate women into demoralizing 
affairs 
a second type of harassment cited is the creation of a hostile 
intimidating atmosphere in the workplace that offends or disturbs 
women personnel even if there is no direct damage to victims 
even if its seemingly harmless inuendo it can be offensive 
and create an unpleasant work situation ms breitling said 
there are a lot of variations and complex relationship questions 
while open friendly hugs or pats between mutually respecting 
associates are not considered in the harassment category she said 
objectionable activity generally is distinguishable by victims 
as one woman put it ive been hugged and ive been groped 
and i know the difference

ordained by her own church if her church accepts her we will give

brooklyns roman catholic bishop francis j

deter crime and often is an act of revenge that appeals to our 
baser instincts 
in a pastoral letter he said if legislative efforts to restore 
the death penalty in new york state succeed it will only make us 
all partners in the continuing downward spiral of the dehumanization 
of all human life 
he called capital punishment a violent solution that will 
keep us from attacking the real problems at the core of the growing 
violence in our streets 
he urged the governor and mayor to call a summit conference 
on the basic problems crime drugs poverty lack of education

when it comes to shakespeare hamlet is still 
very much the thing 
in recent months britains two large governmentsubsidized 
theaters have tackled the prince of denmark and two other london 
plays are now on using hamlet as a central character 
it remains one of the worlds favorite plays and hamlets 
celebrated soliloquy has become universal whether in chinese si 
hai shi huo swedish att vara eller icke vara or english 
to be or not to be 
in paris patrice chereaus production recently swept the moliere 
awards the french equivalent of broadways tony britain has 
averaged eight major hamlet productions every year for the past 
three years new yorks public theater presented it in 1986 with 
kevin kline as the prince 
women have played him too notably the great french actress 
sarah bernhardt a century ago dame judith andersonand more recently 
diane venora at the public in 1982 
laurence olivier called it the best play ever written and 
his 1948 film portrayal was the only shakespeare work ever to win 
academy awards for best film and best actor 
others have tried to shape it to the times the great 
18thcentury actor david garrick hated the graveyard scene i 
swore he said that i would not leave the stage till i had 
rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act 
the victorians left out hamlets lapses into vernacular along 
with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect 
prince nowadays producers are more apt to drop the subplot 
involving the agents and friends of hamlets rosencrantz and 
guildenstern a trend which in itself inspired a whole 
muchapplauded play by british dramatist tom stoppard about two 
characters who find they do not exist outside the play 
in 1987 swedish director ingmar bergmans acclaimed production 
with his royal dramatic theater of stockholm had a weeklong run in 
britain and in september russian director yuri lyubimov will stage 
hamlet with a british company at the leicester haymarket theater 
drawn from scandinavian legend hamlet is about a prince who 
comes home from university to discover that his father has been 
murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the 
queen he has widowed 
setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of denmark hamlet 
plunges into a jungle of intrigue thwarted passion and switched 
poisons he emerges triumphant only to complete the tragedy by 
dying in a sword fight 
at its most basic hamlet is a rattling good revenge yarn but it 
is also that rare play whose significance can continually be 
reshaped to meet a societys preconceptions thus audiences over 
the ages have seen hamlet as marxist capitalist pacifist 
militarist aristocrat populist freudian obsessive and man of 
action 
this troubles some actors including jonathan pryce who derides 
what he calls the hamlet industry they wonder whether the 
plays appeal is also its weakness whether by applying to 
everything and everyone hamlet risks being about nothing in 
particular 
is hamlet really such a difficult part to get right asks 
lynne truss in the listener magazine the answer seems to be that 
on the contrary it is awfully hard to get it wrong since any 
interpretation seems to be valid 
in recent years londoners have been treated to roger rees dry 
intensely cerebral hamlet at the royal shakespeare company peter 
stormares manic military hamlet for ingmar bergman and now daniel 
daylewis highly emotional and impetuous hamlet at the national 
richard eyres production continues the nationals tradition of 
doing a hamlet near the start of each artistic directors 
tenure daylewis best known for the films the unbearable 
lightness of being my beautiful laundrette and a room with 
a view has inherited a part played in 1963 by peter otoole and 
in 1976 by albert finney 
also on show are iris murdochs the black prince adapted 
from her 1973 novel and the revival of anton chekhovs 1887 
ivanov with alan bates as a penniless landowner who sees 
himself as a failed hamlet figure 
murdoch 69 first encountered hamlet as a school text when she 
was 15 she an insane passion for the work similar to that of 
bradley pearson the sardonic tax inspector of the black prince 
who comes alive when thinking or speaking of hamlet 
i became absolutely entranced by it and by shakespeare 
generally she recalled in an interview hes very good on 
politics and power a great source of inspiration to novelists 
from garrick and henry irving through john barrymore olivier and 
john gielgud to todays acting generation hamlet remains the hurdle 
every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity and 
they rarely agree on whether hamlet is an easy role or a difficult 
one 
its quite easy because its such an accommodating part which 
adapts itself to the personality of the actor argues michael 
pennington who played the role in 1980 at stratford 
but mark rylance who plays hamlet in the royal shakespeare 
companys current stratford production disagrees 
i find it utterly enigmatic as soon as one locates the role 
it changes the 29yearold actor said in an interview the 
challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine 
and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part a lot 
of people cop out of that 
eyre 46 first directed hamlet in an acclaimed london 
production in 1980 then returned to the play intrigued by its 
elasticity 
i came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing 
up the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over 
the novel and films too he said 
its about a man trying to accommodate to come to terms with 
a completely alien political and social world when he starts off 
hamlet is everyman but for the fact that hes a prince 
this panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the 
same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up not 
wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of 
realpolitik

in act iii scene 1 of shakespeares hamlet 
the tormented prince contemplates life and death brooding over his 
uncles usurpation of the throne and hasty marriage with his widowed 
mother he ponders whether or not he should kill the usurper or 
himself 
hamlet reveals his thoughts to the audience but not to the other 
characters in what is regarded as one of the most important 
passages in drama 
just about every school child has at one point or another 
memorized hamlets soliloquy and actors throughout the world 
explore its meaning in almost every language including chinese 
si hai shi huo and swedish att vara eller icke vara

to be or not to be that is the question 
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
or to take arms against a sea of troubles 
and by opposing end them to die to sleep 
no more and by a sleep to say we end 
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks 
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation 
devoutly to be wished to die to sleep 
to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub 
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil 
must give us pause theres the respect 
that makes calamity of so long life 
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time 
the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely 
the pangs of disprized love the laws delay 
the insolence of office and the spurns 
that patient merit of the unworthy takes 
when he himself might his quietus make 
with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear 
to grunt and sweat under a weary life 
but that the dread of something after death 
the undiscovered country from whose bourn 
no traveler returns puzzles the will 
and makes us rather bear those ills we have 
than fly to others that we know not of 
thus conscience does make cowards of us all 
and thus the native hue of resolution 
is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought 
and enterprise of great pith and moment 
with this regard their currents turn awry 
and lose the name of action

a quiet revolution is taking root behind 
the soft whir of sewing machines where bangladeshi women are finding 
alternatives to poverty early marriage and frequent childbirth 
in this underfed overpopulated disasterprone nation the 
garment industry has established itself as a success story both 
economically and socially 
nahar was 12 years old when her family arranged her marriage to a 
bicyclerickshaw puller who she said beat her by the age of 16 
she was a deserted wife with an infant son 
traditionally the only respectable options for a poor village 
girl like nahar would have been remarriage or becoming a maid the 
other possibilities in bangladeshs limited female labor market were 
husking rice pounding bricks and stones into gravel at construction 
sites or prostitution 
instead a few months after nahars husband cast her out in 1985 
a relative offered her a job in the fledgling garment industry 
today at the age of 20 she is a sewing machine operator at yk 
garments on elephant road in the center of dhaka and sends half her 
monthly salary of 900 takas about 28 home to her mother in the 
village to take care of her 5yearold son her annual salary of 
336 is more than double the countrys per capita annual income of 
160 
i feel im the happiest woman on earth she said no one 
beats me anymore almost every night im independent and i earn my 
own money 
like many bangladeshis she goes only by her first name nahar 
and does not use her last 
such independence is still rare for most bangladeshi women but 
it is a beginning and it is growing 
about 300000 women work in bangladeshs clothing factories 
making up 90 percent of the industrys work force the number of 
exportoriented clothing factories swelled from four in 1979 to 722 
in 1988 according to government statistics 
export earnings shot up from 500000 in 1979 to 450 million in 
1988 and now bring in 35 percent of the nations foreign exchange 
today bangladesh is the fifthlargest exporter of readymade 
clothing to the united states after hong kong south korea taiwan 
and china according to the us embassy 
but the garment industry could help in another problem area 
population growth if more women choose to work and marry later 
thereby reducing their childbearing years 
bangladesh is the worlds most densely populated land after the 
citystates of hong kong and singapore if its birth rate is not 
checked its population of 110 million will double within 35 years 
according to unicef 86 percent of the population already lives 
below the poverty level 
ayesha khatoon daughter of a landless peasant in bangladeshs 
northern rangpur district was 11 when she fled to dhaka in 1984 
because her parents planned to marry her off to a 16yearold boy 
i did not want the marriage she said the job at the 
garment factory has saved my life otherwise i would have ended up 
either being a maid at a rich mans house or who knows in a 
brothel 
ayesha and three of her coworkers at meghna garments industry 
ltd share a oneroom tinroofed apartment that in itself is a 
social breakthrough in a country where single women are expected to 
live with their families 
one of her roommates 25yearold khodeza said she left her 
husband two years ago because he insisted they have a fifth child 
the first four were girls and he wanted a son 
one night i thought and thought suddenly i decided that i 
cant take it anymore i must leave for a life of my own khodeza 
said 
the garment women have achieved a great social revolution in 
our conservative moslem society said sufia kamal a womens 
rights activist and leading poet they have done what many of us 
educated women have failed to achieve so far although the women are 
taking the jobs out of necessity they are also silently fighting 
against the social taboos

david maier believes he lost his arm in the service of his 
country his country until now has disagreed 
the arm a casualty of cancer not combat was amputated at the 
shoulder seven years after maiers discharge from the navy 
but the vietnam veteran now 46 and living in bay village ohio 
puts the blame for his cancer on agent orange the toxic herbicide 
us troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast asia he is 
convinced it was awash in the coffeecolored mekong river water 
pumped aboard his ship for showers 
like more than 34000 other vietnam veterans who believe they 
have become ill because of agent orange maier applied for 
government disability benefits and like all but five of those 
applicants he was denied 
now maier hopes his claim will be reconsidered thanks to a 
federal judges ruling in san francisco last month that found the 
government failed to give agent orange claimants the benefit of the 
doubt 
to the surprise of many veterans the bush administration decided 
not to appeal instead veterans secretary edward derwinski 
announced that the department of veterans affairs the new name for 
the veterans administration would rewrite its rules for granting 
disability 
derwinskis decision could open the door to claims from hundreds 
of thousands of vietnam veterans 
although 34000 have applied for disability on the basis of agent 
orange exposure about 250000 veterans are listed in a registry of 
those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide many never 
applied because they believed they didnt stand a chance of getting 
disability 
officials for some veterans organizations say theyre cautiously 
optimistic that the va has changed its attitude along with its name 
it is our feeling at this point that secretary derwinski really 
does want to see some change said barry kasinitz a spokesman for 
vietnam veterans of america the group that brought the lawsuit in 
san francisco 
others remain skeptical their attitude reflecting the deep 
bitterness that many vietnam veterans feel toward a government that 
they believe used and abandoned them 
well believe it when we see it said james sparrow the 
executive director of vietnam veterans agent orange victims an 
advocacy group based in stamford conn 
its my feeling that theyll probably do as little as they 
can said sandra hosty an attorney for swords to plowshares a 
san francisco group that provides counseling and representation for 
veterans seeking benefits 
still ms hosty added i would love to be surprised i would 
love to be wrong 
agent orange named for the orangestriped drums in which it was 
stored was developed for the military in the early 1940s it was a 
5050 mixture of two powerful herbicides 24d and 245t 
in vietnam us troops sprayed agent orange from the air to 
strip away the enemys jungle cover and deplete its crops it worked 
devastatingly well 
the herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin which is 
present in 245t was found to be the most carcinogenic substance 
ever tested on laboratory animals 
veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the 
herbicide may cause serious disorders including nonhodgkins 
lymphoma softtissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as pct 
the va on the other hand has maintained that agent orange has 
been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans a severe 
skin rash called chloracne and the government has insisted that 
veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that 
they got the rash from agent orange a burden that has been 
impossible for most to meet 
however in what some veterans see as a partial admission of 
responsibility the va has provided free medical care to anyone who 
believes he or she became ill because of agent orange 
under derwinskis new orders the department of veterans affairs 
has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits 
starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a 
significant statistical association exists between agent orange 
and a disease 
a scientific advisory committee is to review the proposed changes 
at a june 26 meeting after which they will be published in the 
federal register derwinski will make a final decision on the 
changes probably in october 
once new guidelines are in place the vas advisory committee 
will reconsider whether links exist between agent orange and 
diseases that veterans believe it has caused again a final 
decision will be up to derwinski 
the stakes are high as the makers of agent orange can attest 
after veterans filed a lawsuit against them seven chemical 
companies settled out of court for 180 million in 1984 
derwinski has said cost is irrelevant to the vas stance 
disability benefits which are independent of medical benefits or 
social security currently range from 73 a month for a veteran who 
is 10 percent disabled to 1468 a month for a veteran who is 100 
percent disabled 
if just 30000 veterans were found to be 10 percent disabled the 
cost to the government would be more than 26 million a year 
for that reason alone some veterans advocates say they doubt 
the va will adopt sweeping changes 
the va would literally be opening the doors to tens of 
thousands of claims said sparrow i just dont see how they 
could do it 
fred juarbe director of the national veterans service program 
for the veterans of foreign wars commended derwinski for taking a 
step in the right direction 
still juarbe said i think the bottom line is were still 
going to require legislation given the way the va has ruled in 
the past were not confident that we can rely on the department of 
veterans affairs to carry out this policy 
one such piece of legislation was introduced in congress earlier 
this month a bill by sens john kerry dmass alan cranston 
dcalif and tom daschle dsd would provide disability benefits 
for veterans who have nonhodgkins lymphoma or softtissue sarcoma 
two of the diseases associated with agent orange 
it is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most 
connection between agent orange and certain illnesses and time to 
begin helping vietnam veterans said kerry a former navy 
lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the mekong delta 
george claxton a former army sergeant who was along with maier 
one of the original plaintiffs in the san francisco lawsuit against 
the va said he is optimistic about prospects for change 
i just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated 
with justice and compassion said claxton 46 of lansing mich 
who believes his exposure to agent orange caused bleeding colitis 
and a nervous disorder 
however he added personally i dont ever expect to be paid 
back for what agent orange did to me you pay a heavy price for 
war

a leading actress has broken one barrier 
for women on turkeys maledominated political stage by getting 
elected mayor of sisli a borough of istanbul where fancy 
residential and shopping areas are ringed by slums 
fatma girik 46 believes in personal contact her 550000member 
constituency and in daily personal inspection of public works rather 
than relying on reports of her staff 
women make better mayors she recently told a turkish newspaper 
i see sisli as my own home and i can communicate much better 
with women who deal with daytoday problems she was quoted as 
saying 
once a month she opens up city hall to constituents who have 
problems 
whitebearded men clutching worry beads young mothers carrying 
wailing babies widows without pensions people from the underclass 
come to share their problems with miss girik 
at one recent meeting a young woman just graduated from high 
school said she was looking for a job 
dont we have anything at the switchboard or someplace miss 
girik asked her staff 
not at the moment she was told that angered her 
why did she go to school if she cannot even earn a living do 
something she ordered the staff 
grandad she pleaded with another supplicant dont keep 
coming here everyday i promise you your water will be connected 
soon 
political experts say it is too early to tell whether miss 
giriks way of doing things putting pressure on bureaucracy and 
stretching rules in favor of common people will succeed in 
istanbul turkeys largest city with an overall population of 7 
million 
she won the mayoralty in march when her social democrat populist 
party swept turkeys urban centers 
during the campaign the ruling motherland party candidates 
attacked her as unsuitable on grounds that she lacked experience and 
because of her 25yearold commonlaw marriage to film director 
memduh un 
i am running for mayor of sisli not for the imam of the sisli 
mosque she shot back at opponents referring to the moslem 
religious leader 
born in istanbul to a middleclass family in which the father was 
a seaman she quit school after the eighth grade and a few years 
later made her way into the movie world in istanbuls yesilcam 
district mainly on the strength of her looks 
she turned out to be a good actress a natural born one says 
movie critic erman sener 
she has made 300 movies since starting her film career in 1958 
and many are potboilers typical of the turkish movie industry but 
in the past two decades she has specialized in the portrayal of 
anatolian peasant women heroines played by miss girik fight for 
their rights and their families against difficult odds and often 
prevail 
attempting to overcome turkeys social and economic problems may 
be more difficult in real life 
i have no time for books for movies anymore she said i 
am on my feet all day long and hit the bed exhausted

the chairman of the democratic national 
committee has invited the chairman of the republican national 
committee to negotiate a truce on negative campaigning 
nobody should hold their breath waiting 
each side is too busy calling the other names for there to be 
real bargaining about campaign standards 
democrat ronald h brown said he wants to talk about it 
republican lee atwater says maybe if the democrats will deal on 
some other topics too 
atwater said the democrats should approve campaign reforms 
president bush is proposing and also should make a fair play 
agreement on congressional redistricting that will follow the 1990 
census he has said the republicans were ruthlessly 
gerrymandered by democrats in the last reapportionment and cant 
let it happen again 
brown wants a good behavior meeting before anything else is put 
on the table the national parties have agreed on campaign standards 
before and brown says he is willing to take up other topics 
including reapportionment in separate meetings later 
but this feud is likely to go on between two strong active 
firstyear national party chairmen 
atwaters tough guy tactics have just received a vote of 
confidence plus from his natioal committee members some seemed to 
want him tougher the committee adopted a resolution commending 
atwater for the aggressive tactics it said have made him the 
target of unremitting attacks by democrats 
president bush the boss who counts repudiated a national 
committee slur against house speaker thomas s foley but absolved 
atwater 
brown insists that bush himself should be held responsible for 
republican excesses and says atwater should resign or be fired he 
thinks gop tactics and perhaps atwater personally will become issues 
among voters working to democratic advantage 
but the signs so far point the other way 
whatever resentment there may be it isnt rubbing off on bush 
his job approval rating is up to 73 percent in a washington postabc 
news june poll matching ronald reagans top rating atwater is 
willing and happy to serve as a political target diverting fire 
away from the white house despite the demands of brown and other 
democrats that bush be held accountable 
so far to the frustration of the democrats the twotrack gop 
course is succeeding brown said the president cant take the 
bipartisan high road while others do the dirty work of political 
infighting 
but that is whats happening 
the flash point in all of this was a republican national 
committee memo comparing foleys voting record with that of rep 
barney frank who is gay the gop memo said foley had come out of 
the liberal closet bush said it was disgusting atwater apologized 
and a committee publicist resigned 
foley is willing to let it go at that he says that republicans 
who want a return to the war path of abusive politics are not a 
majority and should not be an obstacle to bipartisanship 
the most partisan aspects of any party are probably its 
national committee in this case the republican national 
committee he said on nbcs meet the press the president of the 
united states is the leader of the republican party hes spoken out 
time and time again in support of a bipartisan effort hes wanting 
actually working to get that kind of bipartisanship in the 
congress and were reciprocating 
brown meanwhile was contending that bushs political troops 
are out of control he said atwater has taken politics to the 
lowest level of my lifetime 
thanks to the lee atwaters of the world national politics is 
looking more and more like the coastline of valdez alaska brown 
said make no mistake they want the political oil spill of 
negative campaigning to spread across america 
the democratic chairman demanded that bush step out front and 
take the republican political lead 
not likely thats atwaters assignment

back when television was in diapers milton berle 
was in a dress it was a kinder world then despite his wardrobe he 
became known as mr television 
fortyone years after the debut of texaco star theater berle 
wears suits for his rare tv appearances he smokes big cigars 
cuban jobs the size of cucumbers and he has a million memories and 
monologues gleaned from a career stretching from vaudeville to video 
berle didnt anticipate such success when he moved from the 
movies remember sun valley serenade to the small screen on 
june 8 1948 
the power nobody knew the power of television i didnt i 
swear i didnt said the man known to millions as uncle miltie 
when he was televisions undisputed king holding millions of 
americans hostage in their living rooms each tuesday night 
the texaco show of 40 years ago there were no laugh machines 
if the joke bombed you died recalled berle in town to pitch 
milton berle the second time around a threetape video 
collection of texaco clips 
thats why i used to say leave a 9 oclock wakeup call for 
the audience or heres another one you may not care for but 
thats all gone unfortunate 
while berle was televisions first major star time called him 
a strange new phenomenon modesty and the chance for a cheap 
joke prevents him from claiming he was the one behind its creation 
i didnt start it all berle said in an interview 
pause remove cigar punchline 
it had to be invented first 
dadumdum 
uncle miltie at 80 may wear thick pancake makeup and pitch 
underwear on television but he still has a keen mind and an 
incredible recall of names dates and places 
an hourlong chat with berle includes tales of his days and 
nights in the havana madrid 51st between seventh and broadway 
daves blue room right on 52nd street and the 500 club in 
atlantic city owned by a guy named damato 
and he can drop some names elvis presley frank sinatra jerry 
lewis danny thomas walter huston tallulah bankhead basil 
rathbone berles worked with them all he also remembers working 
with a guy named dino crosetti from steubenville ohio 
i said dinos a good name but theres got to be an easier 
name something like dean kramer or dean morton or dean martin 
said berle thats how he got the name 
martin and lewis were later guests on texaco star theater 
which dominated all competition in the late 1940s and early 50s an 
estimated 90 percent of americas sets were tuned to uncle miltie 
when he was on 
berle began his career at age 5 starting out in a silent movie 
dubbed tillies punctured romance even then he worked with the 
big names the film starred charlie chaplin 
by age 12 berle was on broadway he appeared in more than 50 
silent films he did vaudeville he played the catskills and then 
after 35 years in the business berle went video 
he later went on to other variety shows appearing on the kraft 
music hall in the late 50s and serving as host for the milton 
berle show in the 60s he never gave up live performing after 
years of playing in las vegas he now plays twice a year in atlantic 
city and lake tahoe 
last year he starred with fellow veterans danny thomas and sid 
caesar in a madefortelevision flick called side by side his 
current tv spots are as a pitchman for underwear in which he 
confesses at my age ive done just about everything in my bvds 
hes also written a couple of books a selftitled 1974 
autobiography and bs i love you a collection of jokes and 
gags picked up during his long association with the friars club 
i get interviews where people say milton thats a helluva 
risk you took i said it was but it wasnt not with the acts i 
had i used to book the best acts available berle recalled 
and i told em dont worry about the cameras theyll catch 
you 
today berle doesnt watch much tv debates sports 2020 
and 60 minutes and oneil whats that mcneillehrer so i 
dont watch 
but with television marking its 50th anniversary berles role in 
the medium has again been spolighted along with his dresswearing 
antics the berle legacy includes a reputation as a jokesnatcher 
the thief of bad gags the great columnist walter winchell once 
called him berle maintains he started this himself as a publicity 
scam 
and the dresses 
too long a story on that said berle glancing quickly at two 
female publicists in the room ill tell you alone 
berle is winding down when hes asked about the first night of 
texaco who was on the show he pauses removes his wellchewed 
stogie and looks straight ahead going back 41 years in 15 seconds 
june 8 1948 said uncle miltie pausing again sophie 
tucker and a dance team they were wonderful dont know if you 
ever saw them the zoneys a brothersister team didnt speak to 
each other fought like cats and dogs a great harmonica artist 
stan fisher and bandleader is everybody happy ted lewis 
berle remembers all the guests he also remembers the immediate 
overwhelming reaction his show produced 
the next day i walked out of my house on 88th street took a 
cab to the friars for lunch i decided to walk the last few blocks 
i walked a couple of blocks and the people were all following me 
the great entertainer said 
i never knew so many people saw the show that night it was the 
next day thats how quickly the instantaneous value of that 
was very remarkable 
one show

nearly 13 years ago the sinister cackle of young 
johnny rotten kicked off anarchy in the uk and the brief 
remarkable history of the sex pistols 
all were trying to do is destroy everything the singer 
boasted at the time and the punk band made music that lived up to 
his words 
such songs as holidays in the sun pretty vacant and 
god save the queen were an enraged response to the complacent 
mainstream rock of the mid1970s and opened the way for the clash 
gang of four and elvis costello 
the sex pistols made just one album before breaking up rotten 
quickly distanced himself from his old band reverting to his 
original name john lydon and forming public image ltd which had 
a danceable sound that drew upon a wide variety of music 
public image ltd has been more durable if less exciting than 
the sex pistols and has just released 9 its ninth album the 
current lineup consists of lydon guitarist ish 
folk culture irish folk music does relate very much to bulgarian 
which relates to turkey which relates to the arab all the way 
around going into morocco back up through spain again marvelous 
the sex pistols 
it got very very stale and i had to call it quits it was the 
pistols then its public image now i always offer an alternative 
the film sid and nancy which depicted the life of sex 
pistols bassist sid vicious 
to be misrepresented so badly was a great disappointment 
director alex cox never communicated with any of the pistols not 
even the manager at that time none of us so how on earth can you 
present that film as a semidocumentary 
it was like fantasy island gone wrong how can you use 
someone like joe strummer and iggy pop as research what do they 
know about the workings of the pistols nothing you might as well 
have asked liberace and probably would have achieved better 
results 
performing drunk 
i put that down to inexperience not having respect for myself 
going on stage drunk is a tragedy i did do that a few times because 
i was so bloody nervous the end result was a shambles 
apologies folks for those bad old days but there werent too 
many of them 
nonviolence 
if you want to destroy a government its very easy just lay 
down your tools all at once the country will collapse overnight 
the minute you have to kill people for a cause you have no 
cause you immediately show you have no respect for human life 
theres no real need for it we can change this planet gandhi 
proved that 
failure 
before every gig im absolutely terrified completely i want 
every show to be the ultimate once im on then im fine you know 
home run but that buildup bloody dreadful 
music video 
ive had some wonderful fantasies in my life i envisioned 
myself as operating this video company i realized after three weeks 
i loathed video i cannot stand it i dont like watching it these 
are polaroids theyre trivial i dont like fiddling about with 
cameras 
lyrics 
people dont actually listen to the songs theyre dancing to 
i had to listen to every single word used i just liked 
language its our major achievement as a species 
songwriting 
on a lot of my songs i just sit down and write it line after 
line after line i keep running the ideas through my head and 
finally the best way of doing it just occurs to me quite naturally 
his public image bandmates 
if you cant get on with people theres no point i dont care 
about looks i care about personality some sense of musical 
innovation im not interested in some sort of manufactured pop or 
set organized musical things that bores me 
phil donahues hair 
you cant tell me thats not a wig you can see it on the back 
of his head most wig manufacturers are pretty sophisticated but 
phil isnt 
imitators 
dont imitate me dont ever imitate me that would not be a 
form of flattery at all that would be worse than being in a heavy 
metal band

what lynn tylczak wants to put in household 
products would make you gag 
literally 
the 33yearold mother of two has launched a campaign to add the 
worlds bitterest substance the guinness book of world records 
says it is to garden sprays antifreeze window cleaner and other 
poisons the goal is to make them so bitter children will 
immediately spit them out 
i figured i should taste it to tell people how bad it is 
tylczak said it really made my mouth feel like a place where old 
spiders go to die i went around for weeks spitting i looked like i 
played major league baseball my mom thought id taken up chewing 
tobacco 
her crusade began feb 6 when she heard on the radio that the 
compound known as denatonium benzoate generally sold under the 
trademark bitrex is put into poisonous materials in great britain 
bittering compounds also are used in west germany and are required 
by law in antifreeze in australia and pesticide in japan in the 
united states a few products such as bold and solo liquid 
detergents and sterno fuel contain it 
the freelance writer took her 5yearold son and 3monthold 
daughter to the oregon state university library to find out more it 
was three weeks before she found an article on the substance 
discovered 30 years ago by mcfarlansmith ltd of britain and used 
generally to denature alcohol 
i tried writing manufacturers and got no good response and i 
got nothing from the politicians she said they sent me form 
letters saying thank you for the input dont forget to vote for me 
in the next election i thought im going to have to demonstrate 
that people care about this 
i wrote to about 20 of the big newspapers then i wrote to 
consumer groups magazines health magazines insurance magazines 
the people i thought would pick it up 
tylczak and about 20 albanyarea women formed project poison 
proof which has gotten thousands of letters of support i call it 
a leverage blackmail opportunity i can take pictures of me with the 
letters and send them to the manufacturers now im not just lynn 
tylczak causing trouble im lynn tylczak with the force of xnumber 
of people causing trouble 
the national safety council has called on manufacturers to use 
bitrex in all appropriate products us rep charles schumer 
dny called tylczak to say he would introduce a bill to require a 
bittering compound in all poisonous liquid consumer products 
it is really kicking interest up to a new level said 
mitchell tracy of henley chemicals inc in montvale nj the us 
distributor of bitrex 
tylczak said the bittering compound would cost less than a 
halfcent per pint and would augment the use of childproof 
containers sixtyfive percent of childproof containers sent to the 
american association of poison control centers failed to withstand 
childrens attempts to open them she said 
but most manufacturers dont want to draw attention to the 
dangerousness of their products and say theres no demand for the 
bittering agent she said 
bitrex has been used in solo since 1981 and in bold since 1985 
because for some unknown reason children seem more susceptible to 
drnking those products said procter amp gamble inc spokeswoman 
jennifer bailey 
it isnt used in other products because there has been no serious 
problem bailey said our safety record with our detergents is 
pristine 
if consumer demand is strong enough procter amp gamble will study 
the matter further she said on the other hand we dont want 
people to let down their guard about proper storage and usage of 
these products just because we put a bitrexsafe concept across the 
front of them 
detergents include substances that make people who swallow them 
vomit she said adding that such household goods arent as big a 
danger as poisons such as antifreeze and herbicides 
chevron corp which manufactures the ortho line of herbicides 
and pesticides does not use the bittering agent the primary 
reason that we didnt end up using it is that all of our lawn and 
garden products are already in childresistant containers said 
spokeswoman sherri zippay 
the company considered using bitrex in snail and slug bait to 
protect pets zippay said but snails wouldnt eat it then 
either 
tylczak doesnt want this to be a personal crusade shes 
uncomfortable with the individual attention shes been getting 
i didnt do anything any other mother wouldnt have done i was 
just the first person that saw it it takes one spark to start a 
forest fire i was just the spark once the fire started it doesnt 
matter who got the thing going 
each year i take up one cause because every year theres at 
least one thing that aggravates me and i follow it through until 
its taken care of last year it was property taxes the tax judge 
did agree with me finally 
still tylczak doesnt accept the title of consumer activist 
im just an angry mother

in research that could provide new materials for 
highstrength cables bulletproof vests and sutures scientists have 
turned to one of the most delicatelooking fibers in nature silk 
spun by spiders 
researchers want to learn more about the gossamer threads because 
they offer an apparently unique combination of great stretchability 
and strength 
some day scientists hope spider genes will be customized to 
produce silks with characteristics most needed for various uses 
maybe even clothing 
spiders themselves customize their silk a spider may produce 
half a dozen kinds for a variety of jobs each silk coming from a 
different gland several kinds are used in webs another called 
dragline silk is what spiders use to dangle from the ceiling still 
another is used to make a cocoon for eggs 
in contrast silkworms spin only one kind of silk said david 
kaplan of the us army natick research development and engineering 
center in natick mass 
some spider silk is nearly as strong as kevlar a synthetic fiber 
used in bulletproof vests said randy lewis head of the molecular 
biology department at the university of wyoming in laramie to snap 
a dangling 12inch piece of dragline silk for example it is 
estimated that one would have to hang another piece of silk from it 
approximately 10000 miles long 
much of the work so far has focused on the dragline silk of the 
golden orbweaver found in florida and central and south america 
the spider is named for its yellowish webs which can be up to six 
feet wide 
kaplan stephen lombardi and wayne muller have determined the 
detailed chemical makeup of the dragline silk and are using that 
information to seek the gene that directs production of the silk 
lewis whose work is supported by the federal office of naval 
research believes he has found the gene he is now determining its 
chemical details 
finding a silk gene is important because researchers can then 
insert it in bacteria or some other organism that can churn out the 
protein that makes up the silk far faster than spiders do that will 
allow further study of the protein to find out why it is so 
stretchable and why it has other properties of interest 
knowing the gene should also allow scientists to alter it someday 
so that the resulting silk will perform better in particular 
applications 
one possibility is lightweight but strong fiberglasslike 
materials which might be useful for aircraft skin helmets and 
other applications kaplan said 
another potential use is sutures lewis said spider silk appears 
not to provoke an immunesystem reaction from the body and it 
contracts when moist which could keep stitches snug during the 
healing process 
still another possibility if it can be produced cheaply enough 
is clothing apart from being as supple as regular silk and more 
elastic spider silk has an incredible sheen to it almost a 
metallic sheen that suggests motherofpearl lewis said

a broken filling loose crown or painful 
chipped or fractured tooth sends most people running to their 
dentist but what do you do if youre on vacation without nearby 
dental care 
no homemade remedy can ever substitute for the professional 
attention of a qualified dentist said dentist brooks morgan in 
a pinch though when you have no alternative these helpful hints 
might come in handy 
for a broken filling rub the cavity with clove oil dont fill 
it with candle wax or chewing gum 
a bonding compound able to hold a loose crown in place for a day 
can be made by mixing petroleum jelly and flour 
take aspirin acetaminophen or another aspirin substitute for 
toothaches if you have swelling as well as pain rinse your mouth 
regularly with salt water apply an ice pack or even a cold can of 
soda dont apply aspirin directly to the tooth because it can 
permanently damage the nerve 
rinse your mouth with warm water if you chip or break a tooth 
dont try to file the tooth and dont use glue to try to save it 
use wet gauze immediately to wrap a tooth that has been knocked 
out get to a dentist quickly and it might be saved

anemia the loss of red blood cells that 
can kill people who suffer malaria is largely caused by the bodys 
attempt to defend itself against the infectious disease research on 
mice suggests 
the lawrence berkeley laboratory study indicates overstimulation 
of part of the immune system also is partly responsible for other 
malaria symptoms like death of kidney tissue clogging of blood 
vessels in the brain and eventual suppression of the immune system 
the discovery could lead to better understanding of malaria and a 
new treatment against it use of antibodies against the tumor 
necrosis factor or tnf that helps cause the anemia and other 
symptoms researchers said 
at least 100 million new cases of malaria are reported annually 
and about 15 million victims die each year the disease which 
destroys vital red blood cells is caused by a parasite called 
plasmodium the female anopheles mosquito carries the parasite in 
its saliva 
tnf is produced in the body to hel defend against disease and 
promote healing and is being used as an experimental anticancer 
therapy but paul silverman kathleen miller and other lawrence 
berkeley scientists showed that anemia in malaria can be mostly 
reversed by giving infected mice an antibody against tnf 
the study also suggests tnf may play a role in causing chronic 
anemia seen in patients with other infectious diseases and certain 
cancers silverman said 
malariacausing parasites also destroy red blood cells but 
previous studies found that such destruction alone fails to explain 
the severity and extent of anemia in malaria patients earlier 
studies also found that another immune system chemical 
interleukin1 plays a role in causing anemia in those patients 
the studies may explain why giving infected mice antibodies 
against tnf failed to completely reverse the loss of red blood

nasa plans to help crews prepare for flat 
tires and other problems landing the space shuttle by having an 
astronaut fly an armorplated aircraft to test shuttle landing gear 
during next years tests the convair cv990 jet will touch down 
on its own landing gear at 225 mph then lower shuttle landing gear 
mounted between its main tires said nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato 
at edwards air force base 
we intend to do a whole series of tests and use different 
pressures in the shuttle tire taking the pressure down to where we 
actually destroy the tire lovato said because the convairs 
landing gear will support the plane there is no danger to veteran 
shuttle astronaut c gordon fullerton who will fly it she added 
the test landings will be conducted on paved and dry lakebed 
runways at edwards on paved runways at kennedy space center fla 
and on unpaved landing strips at white sands space harbor nm 
the national aeronautics and space administration said in a 
statement that the tests will give engineers information on what 
to expect should an orbiter experience a flat tire or other 
anomalies on landing and will provide data to help in developing 
crew procedures for various landing conditions and situations 
the agency required all space shuttles to land at edwards since 
april 1985 when discovery blew a tire and sustained brake damage 
landing on a paved runway at kennedy space center the shuttle 
swerved down the runway but was never out of control and the 
astronauts emerged safely landing gear and brakes have been 
modified and nasa continues to test them during shuttle landings at 
edwards 
to prepare the cv990 for the 1990 test landings well armor 
plate the belly of the airplane so that if theres debris kicked up 
it wont damage the bottom of the aircraft lovato said 
nasa will test brakes and nose gear steering along with the main 
and nose landing gear wheel and tire assemblies

the national black womens health project is no 
clinic its a place where women tell what ails them and hugs are 
the order of the day 
from a rambling treeshaded mansion in southwest atlanta dozens 
of ladies set about healing bodies by healing attitudes heightening 
health awareness for a nation of women who often pay a heavy 
physical price just living every day 
if you are living in a house where you are being abused 
sexually physically emotionally that is whats on the front of 
your mind you couldnt get too excited about your health said 
executive director byllye avery 
black women are twice as likely as whites to die of diabetes 
three times as likely to die of cervical cancer and 18 times as 
likely to have organ damage due to hypertension the project says 
in addition 75 percent of female aids victims are black and nearly 
half of all black women are mothers by age 20 
black women also are three times as likely to be molested or 
raped and four times as likely to be murdered avery said the 
projects main goal is to break the conspiracy of silence 
surrounding womens health 
with shared experiences newsletters and films the project works 
in the hope that education will pull black women away from social 
evils that inhibit efforts to seek birth control and better 
nutrition 
every month the project stages programs on topics such as 
mothers too early too long which gathered four generations of 
teen mothers to discuss how pregnancy affected their lives black 
amp female what is the reality about social issues that affect 
black women and sisterreach which dealt with womens health 
issues in belize a tiny central american nation 
the project also operates a wellness center providing tutorial 
and literacy programs out of an atlanta housing project 
we create a safe space where sisters can say whatever they need 
to say avery said where sisters have someone listen to them 
and also have someone struggle with them 
and the women come they laugh and talk they bring their 
daughters 
the teenagers deal with such topics as growing up is scary 
and what is a real man putting their thoughts in a newsletter 
what we stress is coming together and taking the risk to start 
talking openly with each other about the realities of our lives 
avery said its through that analysis that women then learn what 
to do about certain parts of their health it helps break down the 
alienation and isolation that black women feel 
the project was launched at spelman college in june 1983 during 
a conference on black womens health issues planners expected 200 
to 300 women nearly 2000 showed up 
we knew then there was a need among the sisters to organize 
around health avery said before us nobody even knew the words 
black womens health issues we coined the term and put it out 
there 
now the project functions in 22 states from pennsylvania to 
california with about 2000 active members its annual meeting is 
slated this month in dahlonega regional retreats already have been 
held in new york and marin county calif and another is in the 
works for september in atlanta 
what we ask each woman to do is not try to change the world 
avery said just try to change herself

a us official has rejected criticism from 
negotiators in world trade talks that us policy undermined efforts 
to liberalize international trade 
delegates at a special meeting of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade condemned provisions in the 1988 us trade act 
which call for penalties against countries deemed to be especially 
protectionist 
arthur dunkel directorgeneral of the 96nation organization 
issued an appeal wednesday that governments should not take action 
outside gatts international trade rules as unilateral measures had 
been tried before and failed the spokesman said 
deputy us trade representative rufus yerxa told the special 
closed session of the gatt council that the united states would 
not apologize for actions taken in trying to pursue its trade 
objectives and said the bush administration was committed to the 
current fouryear round of global tradefreeing talks according to 
a partial text of his speech released to journalists 
but eec ambassador tran vanthinh warned in the closed meeting of 
the possible sinking of the gatt because of an error of us 
judgment a gatt spokesman said 
last month the us administration singled out japan brazil and 
india for priority action under the socalled 301 section of its 
trade act because of alleged serious violations against fair trade 
the three countries face 100 percent tariffs on selected exports 
to the united states if they do not remove the offending barriers to 
us goods within 18 months 
yerxa told the meeting wednesday that the united states had taken 
no action under the new procedure other than to identify trade 
liberalizing priorities in areas which are significant barriers 
to world trade 
arguing that the united states was remarkably open in the 
face of a huge trade deficit he said that 60 percent of all third 
world exports of manufactured goods go to the united states twice 
as many as the european economic community and five times as many as 
japan received 
brazilian ambassador rubens ricupero said the us action 
undermines and puts in jeopardy the whole uruguay round and 
has already wasted and ruined the precious capital of goodwill 
built up during the talks 
indian representative bal krishan zutshi said the implementation 
of the 301 provisions would emasculate the multilateral trading 
system 
japanese ambassador joshio hatano cited us disregard of the 
system within the gatt for settling trade disputes 
to be judge jury and executioner at the same time is not 
acceptable he told the meeting 
copies of the texts from the brazilian japanese and indian were 
made available to journalists 
the gatt spokesman said that dunkel told the meeting that gatt 
had been established in 1948 after unilateralism and bilateralism 
had been tried and failed 
dunkel told the meeting if the drafters of the founding agreement 
were still alive they would have asked in despair do world 
economic relations have to go through the same cycle again can the 
present generation of trade policy makers not learn from the 
experiences of a previous one the spokesman said

the civil aviation authority has lifted its 
grounding order on 12 boeing 737400 jets operated by british 
airlines as long as modifications are made to cut the engines power 
the planes were grounded nine days ago after two incidents in 
which 737400s were forced to make emergency landings because fan 
blades broke in their cfm 563c engines 
the engines are manufactured by cfm international a joint 
venture between snecma of france and general electric co of the 
united states 
britains caa said wednesday it was imposing power cuts that 
effectively lower the engines thrust to that of a previous 
generation of the make 
airlines were also ordered to replace the engines fan blades and 
discs regular visual inspections of fan blades and the front face 
of the engine discs will also be required the caa said 
the spokesman speaking anonymously said airlines were already 
making the modifications and some 737400s could be back in 
operation on thursday 
the grounding order was made after fan blades broke on a danair 
jet at gatwick airport on june 9 and on a british midland airways 
aircraft at heathrow airport on june 11 
fan blade problems were also thought to have contributed to the 
engine failure which led to the crash in january of a british 
midland 737400 near east midlands airport in leicestershire 
killing 47 
the civil aviation authority had originally said it did not 
believe that lowering the engines power would solve the problem 
but a caa spokesman said the agency had been convinced by tests 
showing the fan blade failure occurred at a certain level of thrust 
we are putting the clock back to the previous standard and we 
are satisfied that restores the necessary safety margin he said 
british airlines using 737400s said they had managed to keep 
flying on schedule by using spare aircraft or borrowing 
replacements in addition to british midland and danair 737400s 
are operated by novair air europe and air ukleisure

though the savings and loan bailout bill now in 
congress will go far toward eliminating the likelihood of another 
sampl debacle dozens more thrifts will fail before the measure become 
law says the chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
institutions will have to be closed people will lose their 
jobs defaulting borrowers will be sued l william seidman said 
wednesday in a speech to financial journalists in new york 
large amounts of property will be sold in difficult markets 
and of course the taxpayers will bear the burden through future 
taxes he said 
the fdic has taken control of 223 savings and loans in the last 
few months at the request of the bush administration 
we expect that number to increase to almost 300 by the time the 
president signs the sampl bill seidman said 
seidman said he expects president bush will sign the new bailout 
bill by august the measure is aimed at correcting the mistakes of 
the last decade he said 
however one thing that has yet to be addressed is the industrys 
interestrate mismatching where sampls essentially borrow short but 
lend long in fixedrate mortgages and where the cost of loaning 
money is higher than the interest paid on savings 
bills already passed in the house and senate require stronger 
capital for sampls based on standards used for banks they also call 
for factual accounting rather than the illfated smoke and 
mirrors of the past seidman said 
in addition they call for double supervision of sampls with the 
fdic serving as the backup supervisor for the industry and for 
creation of a comprehensive vehicle called the resolution trust 
corp to handle insolvent sampls 
he said the fdic may play a role in operating the rtc which he 
said may have to handle about 400 billion in assets from failed 
institutions 
to give you a view of the size of the job the fdic in its 
entire existence has dealt with about 160 billion in assets he 
said 
seidman also said that banks are continuing to fail at a high 
rate so far this year 96 banks have failed or required government 
assistance about the same number as in 1988 
the fdic expects 150 to 180 bank failures in 1989 down from last 
years postdepression record of 221 seidman said the prediction 
he said was based on a decline in the number of problem banks 
to 1282 now compared with a high of 1624 in june 1987 
but seidman predicted there would be a dramatic drop in the 
amount of bank assets and deposits handled by the fdic 
we anticipate handling about 10 billion of assets in 1989 or 
about 12 percent of what we handled last year he said 
seidman reiterated that the sampl rescue will be the costliest 
financial bailout in us history more than the marshall plan 
chrysler new york city and penn central bailouts all combined and 
by a mile 
in fact it will probably cost every man woman and child in 
the us about 1000 each he said

the federal reserve board has taken took a step 
that could result in the further erosion of the 56yearold barrier 
between commercial banking and the securities business 
the fed asked wednesday for public comment on a proposal to 
permit subsidiaries of bank holding companies to double the amount 
of securities business they conduct 
since the 1933 passage of the glasssteagall act which was 
enacted after the 1929 stock market crash rippled into a banking 
crisis banks have been prohibited from being principally 
engaged in underwriting securities 
the fed has interpreted that clause as allowing holding company 
subsidiaries to engage in securities underwriting up to 5 percent of 
their revenue the agency is considering doubling the loophole to 10 
percent and asked for comment on that by july 20 
both moves are likely to displease leaders of the house and 
senate banking committees which view changes in the glasssteagall 
act as requiring congressional not regulatory action 
congressional banking leaders have promised to begin considering 
glasssteagall reform soon after congress enacts president bushs 
savings and loan bailout 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee strongly protested a fed decision in january that added 
corporate bond underwriting to the list of securities activities 
open to banks 
this week jp morgan amp co became the first bank given final 
permission to start exercising that power 
the fed also has said that early next year it will begin 
considering opening corporate stock underwriting to banks

h robert heller citing financial hardships in 
living on his 82500ayear government salary says he will resign 
as one of the seven members of the federal reserve board 
an expert in international economics heller said wednesday he 
would return to california to become an executive vice president of 
visa international the giant credit card company 
in a meeting with reporters he refused to disclose his exact 
salary at visa saying only that it would be a pretty sizable 
increase that would represent a multiple of his government pay 
heller specifically cited congress rejection earlier this year 
of a proposed federal pay raise as one factor in his decision to 
leave under the proposal which would have boosted congressional 
salaries as well as those of top officials the pay of a federal 
reserve governor would have risen to 125000 
his resignation will give president bush his first opportunity to 
appoint someone to the federal reserve board the other six members 
including chairman alan greenspan were appointed by former 
president reagan 
economists said it was unlikely hellers surprise departure would 
affect policy at the central bank 
heller generally espoused supplyside monetary views emphasizing 
economic growth appearing at times to be at odds with the tough 
antiinflation leanings of former chairman paul volcker 
bush who early in the year complained that the central bank was 
risking a recession by a tootight money policy was likely to 
appoint a replacement very close to hellers philosophy analysts 
predicted 
i would expect the appointment will be someone who is at least 
as dovish on inflation as heller was said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
the replacement by law must come from a federal reserve regional 
bank district not now represented on the board heller came from the 
san francisco region which will now be vacant other regions not 
now represented on the board are philadelphia cleveland atlanta 
st louis and minneapolis 
heller joined the board in august 1986 and his replacement will 
fill a term that lasts until jan 31 1996 
in his resignation letter heller said he was leaving for 
personal considerations he told reporters he had taken a 
significant pay cut to join the government and that with two 
children approaching college age he found that financially it 
gets tougher and tougher 
before joining the federal reserve heller served as a senior 
vice president and director of international economic research for 
bank of america in san francisco 
heller who was born in germany and is a naturalized american 
citizen said the visa job offered him the chance to return to san 
francisco and to use his international experience in dealing with 
visas operations in 185 countries 
heller 49 was generally recognized as the international expert 
on the board and several economists said they expected that bush 
would take that and ideological considerations into consideration 
when choosing a replacement 
i think the white house would want somebody willing to 
ensure that economic growth is maintained at some expense on the 
inflation front said samuel kahan of kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago

a house democrat has proposed raising the 
minimum wage to 425 by next year but his attempt at breaking an 
impasse between congress and president bush contains provisions the 
white house has insisted it wont accept 
rep austin j murphy dpa introduced a revised minimumwage 
bill wednesday a week after bush vetoed legislation that would have 
raised the wage from 335 an hour to 455 by 1991 
the house last week was unable to override the veto bushs first 
murphy chairman of the house subcommittee with jurisdiction over 
the minimum wage proposed raising the hourly minimum wage to 380 
on oct 1 and to 425 a year later 
his final target matches that of bush although the minimum wage 
would not reach 425 an hour until january 1992 under the 
presidents proposal 
murphys proposal gave no ground on the issue on which the 
majority democrats in congress and bush have their greatest 
difference whether employers should be allowed to pay newly hired 
workers a subminimum wage for an initial training period 
bush has said he will not support any increase in the minimum 
wage unless congress also establishes a new subminimum wage 
employers could pay all new workers for up to six months 
democrats intially resisted any attempts to establish a 
subminimum wage but eventually included in the measure bush vetoed 
a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to workers with fewer 
than 60 days work experience 
murphy included the same 60day provision in his bill 
i reject the presidents call for a sixmonth training wage 
mainly because it is excessive and unfair murphy said in a 
statement 
sen edward m kennedy dmass has reintroduced legislation in 
the senate identical to the measure bush vetoed but has indicated a 
willingness to discuss a compromise with the white house 
administration officials have said bushs proposal is the only 
acceptable one

an eastern airlines attorney says the carriers move 
to end its contract with striking pilots and cut wages is a matter 
of economics but the pilots union says it reflects managements 
antilabor attitude 
the albatross around easterns neck is not labor costs but an 
inept and rapacious management the air line pilots association 
said in a statement late wednesday 
eastern on wednesday asked the us bankruptcy court in new york 
to terminate the contract its pilots had been working under before 
the machinists union in march led a massive work stoppage that 
crippled the airline 
the miamibased carrier also is seeking approval for a permanent 
increase in the number of hours a pilot may work each month and 
about 50 million in temporary wage and benefit concessions 
this is not a unionbusting tactic said eastern attorney 
harvey miller this is an economic problem 
eastern officials said the new conditions are supported by pilots 
who have continued to fly during the strike and are similar to cuts 
taken by management and other nonunion employees during the 
3monthold strike 
the pilots union said easterns actions came as no surprise 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo is following basically 
the same pattern of harsh treatment for workers that he established 
when he took continental airlines into bankruptcy and abrogated its 
labor contracts there in 1983 alpas statement said 
lorenzo abrogated union contracts with employees of continental 
like eastern a texas air subsidiary after he put continental into 
bankruptcy protection the carrier based in houston is now 
nonunion 
but the pilots union said wednesday it expects lorenzo to have a 
much more difficult time doing the same with eastern because 
congress tightened the bankruptcy laws after the continental episode 
to make it harder for companies to cancel contracts through 
bankruptcy reorganization now a company must show it is negotiating 
in good faith 
miller said eastern sought termination of the pilots contract 
which expired a year ago in order to move ahead with rebuilding 
plans because the union had balked at negotiating a new contract 
eastern had about 3600 pilots before the strike but plans to 
rebuild into a smaller carrier with about 1700 pilots 
under section 1113 of the us bankruptcy code the court has 14 
to 21 days to schedule a hearing and 30 days to rule on easterns 
request 
eastern is seeking to cut the pilots pay by 10 percent for six 
months 5 percent for the next six months and to delay vacations 
until next year wage and pensionplan concessions would be restored 
by half on jan 31 1990 and in full by august 1990 
the airline also is asking for permanent work rule changes the 
airline wants to be able to schedule pilots to fly 68 hours a month 
in 1990 and 60 hours a month thereafter compared with the 
prestrike 46 hours federal regulations allow a pilot to fly an 
average of 85 hours a month with a maximum of 100 hours 
the machinists went on strike march 4 after federal mediation 
failed the pilots contract is still open to negotiation and 
normally would have to go through federal mediation but miller said 
the airline can seek to end the contract because the company is in 
chapter 11

the strongest united auto workers 
dissident movement in 40 years has lost a seat on the unions 
executive board but the uaws leadership may be hearing more from 
the new directions group 
jerry tucker of st louis was defeated for reelection wednesday 
as director of uaw region 5 in eight southcentral states losing to 
roy wyse of the kansas city area 
tucker and new directions have criticized uaw president owen 
bieber for allegedly stifling dissent within the uaw and losing 
sight of the 1 millionmember unions roots by making to cooperative 
labor agreements with automakers 
bieber and members of his administration caucus have denied the 
charges but the new directions effort has gained widespread 
rankandfile support and is the most serious challenge to the uaws 
leadership since the mid1940s when walter reuther was solidifying 
control of the thenfledgling union 
after the regional director election one new directions member 
asked bieber to set aside the entire vote and hold another election 
within two months 
that brought catcalls and mild obscenities from wyse supporters 
bieber ruled the motion out of order 
on his way out of the caucus victor reuther brother of walter 
reuther and a backer of tuckers efforts said a similar motion 
could be brought before the convention today 
tucker had little to say immediately after the loss other than 
that he had not decided about whether he would take the election 
challenge to court tucker was chosen director of region 5 in a 
federally supervised election sept 1 1988 after he challenged an 
earlier election in court he lost that contest by an extremely 
narrow margin 
wyse appointed by bieber as an assistant director in region 5 
three years ago said after his election that union members saw 
through the new directions movement they saw they had questions but 
no answers 
i think its the beginning of the end for the new directions 
movement he said 
wyse said he would try to reconcile the two camps in his huge 
region but he added it will take a while there are some scars 
out there that need to be healed 
that was evident in the packed hotel room where the caucus was 
held both sides wore jackets with their candidates names on the 
back tuckers forces in blue and wyses in white 
earlier wednesday the administration caucuss slate of top union 
officers was elected to threeyear terms without opposition 
bieber won his third term as the unions president incumbent 
secretarytreasurer bill casstevens was elected to a full term after 
succeeding the late raymond majerus who died jan 14 1988 
delegates also elected four vice presidents two incumbents and 
two to succeed the retiring donald ephlin and marc stepp 
bieber will assign responsibilities to his new vice presidents 
its expected that stephen yokich will move from the unions ford 
department to head the general motors department succeeding ephlin 
newly elected vice president ernie lofton will succeed yokich and 
stan marshall also elected as vice president wednesday will follow 
stepp as director of the chrysler department 
vice president odessa kommer the unions most senior vice 
president having been elected first in 1974 probably will keep many 
of her responsibilities including oversight of the unions 
relations with a number of automotive supplier companies

paramount communications inc has gone to court 
to block time incs proposed 14 billion buyout of warner 
communications inc 
but a cable operator that is 82 percentowned by time said 
paramount is running into opposition from local officials over its 
own plans to acquire the operators cable franchises in connection 
with a hostile 107 billion bid for time 
meanwhile paramount asked the new york stock exchange to 
investigate times bid for warner on the ground that the companies 
may have violated exchange rules the exchange said it would comply 
with the request 
those were among the developments wednesday in what is shaping up 
as a fiercely contested takeover battle that could produce one of 
the worlds largest communications companies no matter who wins 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange time rose 
475 a share to 15725 on wednesday after losing 19 in the 
previous three sessions 
warner fell 1 a share to 5850 while paramount lost 12 cents a 
share to 5925 
paramount filed a 49page amendment to an earlier suit in 
delaware chancery court on wednesday in which it said time acted 
improperly in rejecting paramounts buyout offer and launching its 
own takeover bid for warner 
the complaint said the offer for warner amounts to a 
multibillion dollar abuse of times stockholders for the purpose of 
protecting the secure and prosperous future of time and warner 
management 
paramount also asked that the court nullify results of the 
upcoming election of four time board members times chairman and 
chief executive j richard munro and its president nicholas j 
nicholas jr are nominees 
paramount said the pending election is a sham because no opposing 
candidates have been nominated 
in response to the amended complaint time said in a statement 
that paramounts allegations were without merit 
time said it would respond to the complaint in the proper forum 
delaware chancery court and demonstrate clearly its position and 
the merits of its case 
in its amendment to the suit paramount also claimed that a stock 
swap recently completed between time and warner violated nyse rules 
that require shareholder approval for such a transaction 
if the big board finds that time or warner had violated its 
rules it could bar the merged company from trading its shares on 
the exchange 
a hearing on paramounts suit is set for july 11 
paramount an entertainment and publishing concern launched a 
175 a share tender offer for times stock on june 6 only 2 weeks 
before time and warner shareholders originally were to vote on a 
merger of the companies 
time a leading magazine and book publisher and cable programmer 
and operator rejected paramounts offer friday saying it was 
inadequate and highly conditional and that securing regulatory 
approvals for cable system transfers alone would take a year or more 
time also said it had revised its merger agreement with warner to 
provide a 70ashare buyout of the movie record and cable concern 
while shareholder approval was needed for the original merger 
times shareholders are not being asked to vote on the acquisition 
of warners stock 
meanwhile the cable operator american television and 
communications corp said wednesday local opposition is growing to 
paramounts plans for acquiring cable franchises associated with 
time 
atc based in stamford conn has said paramounts acquisition 
of time is illegal because the change in control would place atc in 
violation of many of its cable franchise agreements 
it said officials from the states of kansas and hawaii and 16 
cities including indianapolis denver kansas city mo and 
charlotte nc have complained to federal officials that 
paramounts takeover plan abrogates the local right of prior 
approval for cable franchise ownership in their areas 
atc also said that paramount has indicated in a court filing in 
connecticut that it wont meet the july 5 deadline set in its tender 
offer for time 
asked for a response paramount said it intends to extend the 
expiration date of its tender offer until after the delaware court 
decision 
paramount also said it expects to get cable franchise approval 
where required by state and local law in an orderly and 
expeditious way 
in its amended complaint in the delaware court paramount argues 
that times management launched a massive campaign to block the 
paramount offer before times board made its public statement on 
the merits of the offer 
the complaint said that before the board acted time wrote to at 
least 22 state attorneys general urging them to oppose any action 
by paramount to get quick approval of its offer 
paramount said time failed in moving the date of its annual 
meeting to june 30 from june 23 to adjust the may 1 record date for 
eligibility to vote even though the company acknowledged that a 
large number of shares have since changed hands it also noted the 
meeting will not deal with any aspect of the timewarner merger plan 
but only election of directors who are unopposed 
the boards action make one thing clear time is being run 
solely for the benefit of its management the suit said

had been confirmed koyama said 
the market took the central bank action as showing its 
intention to eventually push the dollar below the 140 yen mark he 
said 
koyama said it still was too early to determine the market trend 
thats why many investors have been avoiding major moves and 
just making position adjustments he added

as automakers adopt inflatable air bags as a means 
of meeting tighter requirements for safety restraints chrysler 
corp says it will install driversside air bags on all its 1990 
cars 
about 1 million chrysler cars will have the devices in the coming 
model year the no 3 automaker said wednesday 
general motors corp said driversside air bags will be standard 
on 15 of its 1990 car lines or about 500000 cars ford motor co 
said it will install them on nine major lines an expected 1 million 
cars 
part of it is meeting the passive restraint requirements 
chrysler spokesman ben dunn said adding that company surveys show 
safety is a top concern among customers 
in addition to air bags dunn said chrysler is equipping 17 of 
its usbuilt 1990 models with rearseat lap and shoulder belts 
rather than just lap belts the automaker also will offer antilock 
braking systems on 26 of its more than 30 car and truck lines in 
1990 he said 
starting in 1990 federal regulations require frontseat passive 
restraints in cars comprising either manual safety belts 
supplemented by driversside air bags or passive belt systems gm 
spokeswoman toni simonetti said 
passive restraints dont require an action such as buckling a 
seat belt passive belt systems are partly anchored to the car door 
so the belt wraps around the occupant when the door is closed 
by 1993 air bag protection or passive belts will be required for 
front seat passengers as well as drivers simonetti said 
passengerside air bags are in the works but are harder to 
design she and dunn said 
the driver is in a fixed position plus you have a natural home 
for the air bag in the steering wheel assembly dunn said on 
the passenger side you have to engineer it to travel a greater 
distance and you dont know what position the passenger might be 
in

the walt disney co has adopted a poison 
pill antitakeover defense but says it does not know of any 
prospective bids for the company 
the plan adopted by disneys board of directors and announced 
wednesday would entitle present stockholders to buy new stock at 
half price in the event of a hostile takeover attempt such plans 
dilute the holdings of a potential buyer making a buyout without 
management consent prohibitively expensive 
the plan is similar to those adopted at many american 
corporations in recent years and has been under consideration at 
disney for several months said spokesman tom deegan 
it was not as a result of anything that has happened in the 
last several weeks deegan said he was referring to the threeway 
buyout battle among paramount communications time inc and warner 
communications inc and to a trend toward consolidation of media 
giants 
while we are not aware of any effort to acquire control of the 
company the stockholder rights plan represents a sound and 
reasonable means of safeguarding the interests of all 
stockholders disney said in a news release

the us economy grew at an annual rate of 44 
percent in the first three months of the year slightly better than 
previously believed the government reported today 
however the commerce department said more than half the growth 
in the gross national product came from a rebound from last summers 
drought a onetime boost that is more of a reflection of the 
governments accounting methods than a measurement of the real 
economy 
discounting the bookkeeping entry to return expected farm 
production this year to its predrought levels growth actually 
slowed dramatically in the januarymarch quarter 
the nonfarm economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 19 
percent compared with a 35 percent rate in the final three months 
of 1988 
this slowdown is in line with many economists expectations 
private analysts predict the us economy will slow dramatically 
this year under the impact of an antiinflation campaign waged by 
the federal reserve the central bank in march 1988 began to drive 
interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demand 
the new gnp report contained some good news on the inflation 
front as a gnp price index rose at an annual rate of 46 percent 
down from a preliminary estimate of 5 percent a month ago 
the increase in the gnp price index that measures a fixed 
marketbasket of goods was up only slightly from a 42 percent 
increase in the fourth quarter of 1988 the government said the 
downward revision came from slower price increases for farm products 
and industrial supplies than earlier estimated 
many analysts are predicting that overall growth will slow this 
year to what is known as a growth recession a period when the 
economy keeps expanding but at such a sluggish pace that 
unemployment rises 
some economists believe that is already occurring after falling 
to a 15year low in march the unemployment rate has risen to 52 
percent with job growth dropping in may to its slowest pace in 
three years 
while the expectation of slower growth this year is virtually 
universal there is still a hot debate over whether the slowdown 
will worsen into a recession ending the record sixyear peacetime 
economic recovery 
the federal reserve sent signals last week that it has begun 
lowering interest rates slightly optimists are hoping that move 
will occur in time to revive important sectors of the economy such 
as housing and auto sales that have been hurt by rising interest 
rates 
the effect of the economic slowdown was evident in a companion 
report released today that showed the aftertax profits of american 
corporations fell by 11 percent in the first three months of 1989 
it was the first setback for corporate profits since a 25 
percent decline in the first quarter of 1987 
the primary reason for the slight upward revision in the overall 
44 percent gnp figure was a better performance in trade than 
previously believed 
the us trade deficit as measured by the gnp narrowed by 195 
billion in the first quarter as exports shot up by 15 percent and 
imports fell by 05 percent it was the first quarterly trade 
improvement since the spring of 1988 
in other areas of the economy consumer spending rose at a 
lackluster annual rate of 13 percent in the first quarter 
reflecting sluggish auto sales and weak demand in many other retail 
areas 
housing construction which has been hard hit by the feds 
antiinflation campaign dropped by 46 percent in the first 
quarter the poorest performance in a year 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at an annual level of 4077 trillion in the first quarter 
the latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by the 
blue chip economic indicators newsletter put the consensus growth 
forecast this year at 27 percent down slightly from the previous 
month and significantly below the administrations projection of 32 
percent 
if the private economists are proven correct that would spell 
bad news for the administrations hopes of meeting the grammrudman 
deficit reduction target of 100 billion next year without a tax 
increase 
even with the effects of the drought last year the gnp expanded 
at a fouryear high of 39 percent that rapid pace helped to drive 
unemployment down sharply 
many economists believe the unemployment rate will rise steadily 
this year and into 1990 hitting 57 percent a year from now 
we are looking for the slowdown that started in the first 
quarter of the year to continue for the rest of 1989 said cynthia 
latta an economist with data resources inc 
in its own assessment of the economy the fed on wednesday said 
there were indications that growth was slowing and inflationary 
pressures were easing in response to the antiinflation campaign 
launched by the central bank in march 1988 
economic growth for most of the nation continues to advance 
but a number of federal reserve districts note ebbing rates of 
expansion the fed said in a survey conducted by the feds 12 
regional banks

the united steelworkers said it reached a 
tentative contract settlement early today with inland steel 
industries inc 
the agreement would cover four years beginning aug 1 according 
to jack parton the unions chief negotiator with inland 
parton said details would be withheld until the union can explain 
the contract to its 12000 members at the nations fourthlargest 
steel producer 
the accord was announced as other union bargainers and officials 
at national steel corp recoiled from the rankandfiles surprise 
rejection of a tentative 50month contract agreement 
usw members at bethlehem steel corp overwhelmingly accepted 
terms similar to the national settlement 
national told its 7000 employees in a letter sent wednesday the 
offer is the best they can expect from a company that trails the 
major producers in profits per ton customers are already pulling 
orders the company said 
nationals contract expires july 31 and no further bargaining 
sessions are scheduled united steelworkers negotiator buddy davis 
who continues to recommend the offer said strike plans are being 
prepared 
the agreement you turned down would have increased your hourly 
compensation counting inflation by 657 per hour by 1993 
national vice president richard p coffee said in an open letter to 
usw members 
it would have cost national steel 953 million more a year for 
represented employees alone by the end of the contract thats 75 
million more than we made in 1988 and 1988 was the most profitable 
year for national steel since 1979 he said 
national rebutted complaints that usw members got more money in 
the early stages of their 50month contract with bethelehem steel 
corp 
they gave up more in 1986 and they are catching up to you 
now coffee said 
like the bethlehem agreement ratified recently by union members 
the national offer would have restored past concessions and raised 
hourly wages by 150 over the contract term

dominos pizza inc the subject of 
criticism for a series of fatal traffic accidents involving its 
delivery drivers has told its stores to fire or reassign drivers 
who are under the age of 18 a spokesman said thursday 
dominos spokesman ron hingst said federal law prohibited the 
comapny from hiring drivers younger than 18 but in some cases 
people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering pizzas 
companyowned stores were being told that employees under 18 who 
drive should be fired or given other jobs hingst said the move 
will affect about 300 employees at dominos companyowned stores 
about onethird of the dominos 5000 stores nationally he said 
the remaining twothirds of the stores are franchises which were 
being urged to make the same move hingst said 
the companys directive led to confusion at a miami fla 
dominos store that gave pink slips to all its under18 employees on 
wednesday those under 18 who dont drive were rehired later that 
day the company stated 
there was some miscommunication on our part hingst said 
dominos has acknowledged 20 fatal accidents in the last year 
involving its drivers but denies the companys 29yearold promise 
to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a telephone order encourages 
employees reckless driving 
a 17yearold dominos driver jesse colson was killed earlier 
this month when his small pickup truck skidded on a rainslicked 
indiana road and hit a utility pole 
his mother has claimed he was speeding and that dominos 
guarantee was an invitation to break the law 
dominos has stated it knows of 20 fatalities involving dominos 
drivers pedestrians and others last year but that accidents were 
bound to happen with such a large fleet believed to be about 75000 
to 80000 drivers 
hingst said the directive on drivers under 18 was a reminder to 
follow the guidelines

the senate today defeated a white housebacked 
childcare plan offered by republicans as an alternative to a 
broader program sponsored by the chambers democratic leadership 
the gop plan defeated on a 5644 vote relied almost exclusively 
on tax credits an approach democrats said would not address the 
need for more childcare openings and improved quality of services 
the senate then immediately took up the democratic leadership 
plan which combines direct subsidies to help parents and states pay 
for child care with a taxrelief package similar to that proposed by 
the republicans 
the leadership plan was expected to win approval but under an 
agreement between the parties would still be subject to amendments 
a final vote was not expected until friday 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said president 
bush had refused to discuss a compromise on child care forcing the 
partisan showdown 
weve expressed an interest in talking to the white house all 
along mitchell told reporters before the senate convened the 
president and his aides have adamantly refused 
todays votes came a week after the start of debate dominated by 
floor speeches by coauthors of the revised act for better child 
care sens christopher dodd dconn and orrin hatch rutah 
defending it against republican attack 
the doddhatch bill would authorize 175 billion for fiscal 1990 
to help parents and states pay for child care 
seventy percent of the money would help parents pay for child 
care while the remaining 30 percent would be available to the 
states for programs designed to improve the availability and quality 
of care 
the revised abc bill in the form of an amendment offered by 
mitchell includes two tax changes one would provide up to a 500 
credit to lowincome families to pay for childrens health insurance 
the other would make the existing dependent care tax credit 
refundable to lowincome families some of whom otherwise do not 
benefit from the provision because they have no federal tax 
liability to which to apply the credit 
in promoting their alternative republican senators have argued 
that the abc bills subsidy provisions would result in state 
bureaucracies that would limit parental choice in child care a 
position dodd and hatch have vigorously contested 
we have a decidedly different approach to what is a real 
problem said sen dan coats rind the word choice is the 
critical distinction 
sen pete wilson rcalif said the doddhatch plan would give 
to government the decision as to what kind of child care shall be 
provided 
the gop package would also make the dependent care credit 
refundable its other major provision would expand the existing 
earned income tax credit to provide addition tax relief to 
lowincome families with children under age 5 
hatch calling that inadequate said wednesday the expanded 
credit would provide 750 to a poor family with two eligible 
children while child care for the two would cost about 6000 a year 
also he said using the gop tax credits alone likely will not 
solve childcare problems because parents would not be required to 
spend the money on child care 
democrats have also attacked the gop plan for cutting off 
eligibility for the expanded credits at age 4 saying children twice 
that age and more need child care the doddhatch bill allows 
payments for children up to age 13

texas investor robert bass has talked with 
integrated resources inc about investing in the financially 
troubled real estate and insurance concern in exchange for a 
controlling stake a source said thursday 
integrated is meeting with several interested parties including 
bass about receiving a large capital infusion after the company 
last week announced plans to refinance 955 million in shortterm 
debt the source who asked not be identified said 
the wall street journal reported thursday that a bassled group 
could be willing to pump as much as 200 million into integrated 
conditional on integrated stock and bond holders accepting a 
restructuring 
integrated had announced it would put up almost all of its 78 
billion in assets and sharply cut back operations after defaulting 
on oustanding bonds and commercial paper because of a cash shortage 
the bass group would emerge with much of the equity while the 
companys common stock would be diluted the journal said 
bondholders would have the security of of a new investor 
an integrated spokesman david caouette declined to comment on 
the newspaper report 
after a delayed opening on the new york stock exchange 
integrated was up 75 cents a share at 475 in midafternoon 
trading the companys stock has plunged from 15 last week and 40 
in 1986 
bass whose widespread holdings include the american savings 
bank bell amp howell and various media cable television and real 
estate properties is believed to be interested in integrateds 
network of financial consultants who sell a wide variety of 
investments ranging from insurance to real estate 
the new yorkbased concern has 35 subsidiaries and 750000 
investor accounts 
the journal said bass believes he would be able to calm the 
concerns of integrated resources bankers long enough to allow the 
company to develop its financial products 
bass does not think the companys real estate problems are so 
great and he also believes the companys newer products like 
insurance and leveraged buyout fund investments are sound the paper 
reported 
under its proposed restructuring integrated would replace 955 
million in shortterm debt with secured borrowings the company also 
said it would cut back its operations substantially 
the company which has 11 billion in capital also said it 
would concentrate on its core businesses of money management and 
mutual funds variable insurance products and limited partnerships 
its debt to be restructured includes outstanding shortterm bank 
debt domestic and european commercial paper and notes outstanding 
under loansale programs 
about 50 banks are providing shortterm loans to integrated and 
the company said it has about 50 to 75 holders of commercial paper 
and notes under loansale programs

avon products inc thursday said it has 
permanently stopped using animals in its product safety tests 
becoming the first major cosmetics maker to do so 
animal rights activists praised avon and said they hoped avons 
decision would encourage other companies to completely halt animal 
testing 
the beauty products company said it will rely on alternative 
nonanimal methods harmless tests on people and an extensive 
computerized data base containing information on the safety of 
ingredients that previously have been examined 
james e preston avons chairman and chief executive officer 
said the company has been working since the early 1980s to reduce 
the number of animals used in evaluating its beauty products and to 
find other means 
this marks the successful conclusion of that program preston 
said he had said months ago that the company intended to make the 
temporary ban permanent 
susan rich coordinator of a campaign to abolish animal testing 
organized by people for the ethical treatment of animals welcomed 
avons decision 
its wonderful news its historic news said rich avon 
made a compassionate and progressive decision we hope it encourages 
other companies to follow suit 
peta which had made avon the focus of an international campaign 
said that it now will target revlon inc gillette co and cosmair 
inc 
before deciding to permanently stop animal testing a practice 
avon had temporarily discontinued earlier this year avon had its 
new procedures reviewed by private scientists specializing in eye 
care skin care and poisons 
the food and drug administration was told of avons new 
procedures the federal agency is responsible for monitoring the 
safety of cosmetics but its approval is not required for testing 
procedures 
no us law specifically requires cosmetics to be tested on 
animals fda officials have said in the past that as a matter of 
practicality companies wouldnt use tests that government 
authorities considered inadequate 
preston said in a news release that until a broader range of 
nonanimal tests are available some suppliers to the cosmetics 
industry might have to continue to do some animal testing as 
formulas containing new raw ingredients are developed 
last year preston said avon approved 95 percent of its formulas 
through analysis using its data base which is the foundation of its 
new evaluation procedures 
numerous companies in the cosmetics chemical and pharmaceutical 
industries for years have been exploring ways that dont involve 
animals to ensure that new products work as intended and that 
consumers arent harmed by them 
avon is among many companies that donate money to fund research 
into possible replacements for traditional animal tests avon said 
thursday that the company will continue to fund research 
researchers around the country have been experimenting with cell 
cultures bacteria living tissue in test tubes and computer 
simulations plus other potential testing methods 
in february avon announced it was no longer using the draize eye 
irritation test which has been widely used by industries for more 
than 50 years the company replaced the draize test which uses 
rabbits with a testtube evaluation process developed by the 
national testing corp of palm springs calif 
avon one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of cosmetics 
in the world disbanded its own animaltesting operation last summer 
and has said it hasnt asked independent laboratories to conduct 
tests on animals since midmarch of this year 
other beauty products companies also have announced temporary 
suspensions or reductions in the use of animal tests

pleaded innocent thursday to charges he assisted the securities 
fraud schemes of ivan f boesky the jailed stock speculator he is 
accused of plotting to kill 
mulheren 39 of rumson nj was arraigned before a federal 
magistrate in manhattan on a 42count indictment handed up last week 
mulheren was charged with manipulating the price of gulf amp 
western inc common stock at boeskys request and arranging a series 
of sham stock transactions to help boesky companies evade taxes and 
circumvent securities laws 
last month mulheren pleaded innocent in new jersey to state 
weapons possession charges in connection with an alleged plot on 
boeskys life mulheren was arrested in february 1988 near his home 
with a loaded semiautomatic rifle that local authorities alleged he 
planned to use against boesky 
he previously had been charged in federal court with threatening 
a witness stemming from the new jersey case and was freed on 20 
million bond federal officials have never identified the alleged 
target but new jersey police have said it was boesky 
prosecutors said the federal charge of threatening a witness 
would be dropped in favor of the state weapons possession charges 
at a bail hearing on the securities case us district judge 
miriam goldman cedarbaum denied defense attorney thomas puccios 
request to reduce his bond 
puccio argued that mulheren poses no danger to the community and 
that the bond was unreasonably high 
but because the defense had not shown the bond caused mulheren 
hardship cedarbaum said i am not persuaded that i should reduce 
the bail that is in place today 
mulheren was charged with conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud and keeping fraudulent records if convicted he faces a 
maximum five years in prison and 250000 in fines on each count

the united states came in for renewed criticism at 
world trade talks thursday for threatening unilateral action against 
countries accused of blocking us exports 
at a closed meeting of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade the united states was also criticized for refusing to accept 
a ruling against us patent law but won praise for agreeing to 
ease restrictions on imports of sugar a gatt official said on 
condition of anonymity 
at the meeting the european economic community and norway both 
accepted gatt rulings that they should allow freer access to imports 
of fruit the official said 
the gatt council meeting also received a formal bid for 
membership from venezuela the only sizable latin american country 
not in the 96nation trade group and heard an announcement by 
austria that it would slash import taxes on nearly 2000 products 
the official said 
brazilian ambassador rubens ricupero told the closed session that 
the us threat to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on some 
brazilian goods places under threat the entire brazilian export 
sector according to a text of his speech released to journalists 
indian delegate bal krishan zutshi said it would be extremely 
difficult to yield to us demands for direct talks about the 
trade barriers under threat of unilateral retaliation 
a us deputy trade representative rufus yerxa told the meeting 
us action was justified and added the bush administration was 
prepared to pursue its grievances within the gatt multilateral 
system of rules according to the gatt official who was present at 
the meeting 
under a controversial section of its 1988 trade act the united 
states last month announced priority action against brazil for 
import quotas against india for restrictions on foreign investment 
and against japan for refusing to buy us superconductors and 
satellites 
it has said the three countries must agree to negotiations and 
remove the offending barriers within 18 months or face retaliatory 
tariffs 
more than 20 countries have criticized us policy at gatt 
meetings wednesday and thursday the official said 
the united states was also criticized by several negotiators for 
refusing to accept a gatt dispute panel ruling against us patent 
law the official said 
in a case raised by the eec the panel found that the united 
states dealt more harshly with foreign products challenged with 
infringing us patents than with homeproduced goods similarly 
challenged 
yerxa said he saw no existing means of reconciling the adoption 
of the report with us political and commercial interests 
according to the gatt official 
the united states has now blocked adoption of the report at five 
council meetings 
however yerxa said the united states accepted the findings of a 
report that its quota on sugar imports violated free trade rules and 
said the bush administration would be considering how to ease the 
restrictions 
the eec for its part said it accepted a dispute panel ruling that 
it must reform its controls on imports of dessert apples following 
complaints from both the united states and chile 
norway agreed to adopt a judgment that it should not restrict 
imports of apples and pears into the country the official said 
venezuelas application to join the gatt is significant because 
it also belongs to the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
cartel which has the opposite aims of gatt in that it seeks to 
control oil trade and prices 
there are now 10 countries including china waiting to join gatt

im sure there would be all kinds of options for them to 
consider if they showed an interest in moving to atlanta berry

frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp has 
done little to refute speculation recently that the airline may move 
theres a good physical facility here he said earlier this

british conglomerate hanson trust plc made a 48 
billion buyout offer thursday for consolidated gold fields plc 
going after the mining giant that two months ago escaped a hostile 
takeover attempt by another suitor 
gold fields quickly advised shareholders not to accept the bid 
but indicated it was willing to talk with hanson which owns 
businesses operations ranging from brewing to brickmaking in britain 
and the united states 
hanson offered 1430 pounds a share about 2229 at current 
exchange rates for gold fields one of the worlds biggest gold 
mining companies and owner of a 493 percent stake in newmont mining 
corp the biggest us gold miner 
hanson also said it had agreed to acquire the 299 percent stake 
in gold fields held by minorco sa the investment group that failed 
in a 546 billion hostile takeover attempt of the company 
gold fields shares jumped 170 pounds about 263 to 1423 
pounds a share about 2205 on the london stock exchange following 
news of the offer 
lord hanson chairman of the conglomerate called the offer a 
full and fair price 
but rudolph agnew chairman and chief executive of gold fields 
advised his stockholders not to sell yet saying the offer 
undervalued the companys assets however agnew also said he would 
meet with hanson to impress upon him the true worth of gold 
fields an indication he might seek a sweetened bid 
gold fields shares had fallen after a us court in april refused 
to lift an injunction blocking on antitrust grounds the takeover 
attempt by minorco which is controlled by south africas powerful 
oppenheimer mining family 
minorco had argued it would sell gold fields stakes in newmont 
and a number of other major mining operations if its takeover 
succeeded but the court sided with government concerns that the 
acquisition of gold fields sizable holdings could lessen competition 
in gold and strategic metals markets 
minorco had received acceptances of its offer from about 25 
percent of gold fields shareholders which combined with the 299 
percent it already owned would have given minorco control of gold 
fields 
unlike minorco hanson is a serious company and any approach 
from it has to be carefully considered said agnew however 
hansons opening offer completely fails to reflect the value of gold 
fields it would benefit hansons shareholders but it does not 
sufficiently benefit ours 
minorco chief executive michael edwardes said his company viewed 
the sale of its gold fields shares to hanson as a very 
satisfactory outcome minorco would receive 9152 million pounds 
143 billion from the sale of its 64 million shares 
hanson is involved in tobacco bricks electricals cement tools 
and other basic industries and made pretax profits last year of 
137 billion in the united states its subsidiaries include kidde 
inc the diversified manufacturer smith corona inc the 
typewriter maker durkee foods corp hygrade food products corp 
and scm chemicals inc 
gold fields besides its mining interests manufactures a range 
of products that analysts say complement many hanson business lines 
with little overlap 
robert haville an analyst at brokerage morgan stanley 
international in london said hansons bid for gold fields was a 
reasonably pitched intelligent offer 
gold fields shareholders would find hansons cash offer far more 
appealing than the cashandshare proposal minorco made 
institutions will consider it very attractive indeed said 
haville

house that president bush had been shot 
the dollar managed to recover some lost ground after the white 
house denial currency dealers said the rumor circulated in foreign 
exchange markets for 45 minutes to an hour

reports of sugar purchases by the soviet union whipped the sugar 
futures market into a bullish frenzy thursday with prices reaching 
an 11month high on speculation that the surprise transactions 
implied further buying down the road 
on other markets corn and soybean futures wilted as rain arrived 
in iowa coffee futures rallied and energy preciousmetals and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
sugar futures settled 50 cent to 94 cent higher on new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in 
july at 1399 a pound the markets highest level since july 25 
the rally was fueled by trade reports that the soviets had bought 
2 cargoes of refined white sugar and one cargo of raw sugar on the 
open market one cargo equals 10000 to 12000 metric tons 
the soviet union usually does its sugar buying in the fall and 
winter and had stated repeatedly earlier this year that it 
completed its sugar buying for all of 1989 
a lot of people in the business view this as the tip of the 
proverbial iceberg meaning the soviets will come in and do even 
more shopping said arthur stevenson an analyst who follows the 
sugar coffee and cocoa markets for prudentialbache securities inc 
analysts predicted new soviet purchases would total at least 
100000 metric tons and could run as high as 300000 metric tons 
some speculated the soviets were forced to enter the world market 
because of slow shipments from poland or because the russian 
sugarbeet crop was smaller than expected 
or they may simply have observed the markets sharp upward move 
over the past several weeks and decided to lay in supplies before 
prices go higher 
they look at supplyanddemand figures as much as everyone 
else said analyst kim badenhop of merrill lynch capital markets 
inc in new york 
corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of 
trade as showers drenched some of the driest croplands in iowa 
rainfall amounts varied widely in the western corn belt but one 
report of a fourinch dousing in western iowa apparently convinced 
traders that the severely dry conditions there were finally easing 
wheat settled cent to 3 cents lower with july at 398 a 
bushel corn was 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with july at 
262 a bushel oats were 5 cents to 6 cents lower with july at 
157 a bushel soybeans were 14 cents to 22 cents lower with july 
at 723 a bushel 
coffee futures rallied strongly on the coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange on buying supported by indications of tight nearterm 
supplies and by the international coffee organizations announcement 
of a 15millionbag cut in export quotas of highquality mild 
arabica coffees a bag of coffee equals 60 kilograms or about 132 
pounds 
the export cut was triggered by a drop in coffee prices 
coffee settled 1 cent to 272 cents higher with july at 11899 a 
pound 
unleaded gasoline futures climbed sharply on the new york 
mercantile exchange following an energy department report that 
refuted tuesdays american petroleum institute report showing a 
substantial rise in us stocks of gasoline the rally spilled over 
to the crudeoil and heatingoil markets 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 10 
cents higher with august at 1930 a barrel heating oil was 64 
cent to 102 cents higher with july at 4862 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 56 cent to 189 cents higher with july at

following the strong gains of the previous session silver inched up 
gold settled 140 to 160 higher with august at 37420 a troy 
ounce silver was 05 cent to 07 cent higher with july at 5303 a

a representative of the major oil companies on 
thursday attacked president bushs cleanair proposal involving 
methanolpowered cars saying it could add to public health risks 
without significantly improving air quality 
charles j dibona president of the american petroleum institute 
told a house panel the oil industry was unhappy with bushs proposal 
for requiring the use of cars powered by methanol to reduce certain 
smogcausing pollutants 
methanol fuel use is unlikely to result in significant air 
quality improvements raises serious public health concerns because 
of methanols high toxicity and will not enhance national energy 
security significantly dibona said 
the oil industry produces about 110 billion gallons of gasoline a 
year it currently does not have the capacity to produce large 
quantities of alternative fuels 
bush said his proposals announced june 12 as part of a broad 
package of measures aimed at making the air cleaner would combat 
smog in urban areas by reducing emissions of carbon monoxide while 
also limiting toxic pollutants such as benzene it would require 
that 500000 alternativefuel cars be built by 1995 
dibona told a subcommittee of the house banking finance and 
urban affairs committee that consumers will pay more per mile for 
methanol than gasoline will need to fill up more frequently because 
methanol burns less efficiently and may have more problems starting 
their cars in cold weather because methanol needs more heat to start 
burning 
under a methanol mandate consumers would have to bear these 
costs and yet not receive a significant overall improvement in air 
quality dibona said 
dibona also said limited domestic supplies of natural gas the 
cheapest source for methanol meant bushs proposal could undermine 
national security this is because the extra supplies of natural gas 
would come at least in part from the middle east thus adding to 
american dependence on an unstable region he said 
dibona also criticized bushs proposals for reducing gasolines 
volatility or its ability to evaporate into the atmosphere and for 
requiring gasoline pump controls aimed at reducing the amount of 
vapors escaping into the air

energy futures prices finished mostly higher 
thursday led by gasoline futures after a government report showed a 
drop in gasoline supplies contradicting an earlier industry figure 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude slipped a 
penny to close at 1930 a barrel after gaining 43 cents on 
wednesday other crude contracts closed narrowly higher 
among refined products the july contract for unleaded gasoline 
rose 189 cents to close at 6099 cents a gallon after a 07 cent 
decline on wednesday august unleaded gasoline gained 161 cents to 
5830 cents a gallon and september closed at 5579 cents up 143 
cents 
heating oil also advanced with the july contract settling 064 
cent higher at 4862 cents a gallon contracts for delivery later in 
the year posted higher gains 
traders said crude prices started out strong amid news of an oil 
production slowdown in the north sea due to pipeline problems 
but the markets attention turned to gasoline futures after a 
department of energy report showed that gasoline inventories 
declined last week the report contradicted an american petroleum 
institute report released on tuesday showing a rise in gasoline 
inventories 
gasoline futures prices dipped on wednesday after the api which 
represents major oil producers and refiners reported that gasoline 
stocks rose by 16 million barrels to 2211 million barrels last 
week despite an increase in demand as the summer driving season 
picks up 
but the doe report released late wednesday showed that total 
gasoline supplies were down 13 million barrels to 2187 million 
barrels 
the new numbers were surprising because usually the two reports 
are pretty close said bob baker analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc it was a factor that affected prices 
both reports showed a decline in crude and heating oil 
inventories for the week and a drop of some 30 million barrels in 
total oil supplies including crude and products from last year

roy wyse who defeated tucker in an election for director of 
region 5 said wednesday that his election was the beginning of 
the end for new directions 
but tucker countered thursday i think brother wyse will soon 
find that new directions is accelerating 
new directions has suffered a defeat on the convention floor 
every day since the uaws triennial constitutional convention opened 
sunday it made challenges to delegation members being seated then 
a resolution calling for direct election of top national officers 
and a move to restrict joint labormanagement programs on plant 
floors 
all those efforts failed but tucker and his backers remained 
optimistic about the future of their organization and its effect on 
uaw administration 
they know they have to deal with us for the next three years 
said new directions member ed tweed of local 596 in lake orion 
mich we know they will go in to factories and pay more 
attention in each local if they do that we have to get the credit 
for it

northwest oregons strawberry harvest is in 
slow motion as pickers leave the fields for the more lucrative 
cherry crop east of the cascade range 
we could use 1500 people but the berries are turning soft 
and its getting late said sue brewer agricultural field 
representative for the state employment division in hillsboro 
the crop is only half of usual and we dont even have enough 
pickers for that brewer said wednesday of the situation in 
washington county 
growers had worried earlier that too few pickers would arrive 
from mexico and elsewhere this year because of confusion over the 
new immigration law plenty of pickers showed up but many are 
leaving midharvest 
in east multnomah county grower john sester waited anxiously for 
labor for a third picking of his 30 acres of berries the first 
two pickings pay our expenses its the third picking that puts us 
into the profit side sester said 
weve been in pretty good shape up to this point we have about 
70 percent of our crop picked he said 
at the nearby scenic fruit co packing plant in gresham owner 
dean bredenkamp watched his new quickfreeze line idled for lack of 
berries the plant usually employs 350 people on two shifts during 
the seasonal peak but only one shift was working four or five hours 
randy mcallister administrative assistant at oregon cherry 
growers in the dalles said he was not surprised by the exodus of 
pickers from berry fields to the cherry orchards 
we have a big beautiful crop to pick for two or three weeks 
and the growers up in the yakima valley do too i think were doing 
ok on supply of pickers mcallister said 
besides the lure of higher earnings for workers we have some 
awfully nice housing weve spent money on it for 20 years he 
said the 7000 acres of orchards in wasco county have some of the 
largest concentrations of cherry farms in the world mcallister 
pointed out 
brewer said workers found the first picking of washington county 
strawberries worthwhile earlier this month but the unusual winter 
kill of plants resulted in poor yields in many of the second and 
third pickings discouraging pickers she explained 
some of the foreign workers who qualified for work permits under 
immigration law reform have abandoned all types of farms leaving a 
smaller labor pool she added 
people who got work permits want to get into factories or 
something else with benefits and stability you cant blame them 
she said 
immigration law allows farmers to recruit foreigners without work 
permits but there are many restrictions and a 60day lead time

the united steelworkers union said it reached a 
tentative fouryear contract settlement thursday with inland steel 
co that raises wages in each of the first three years improves 
pensions and avoids any worker concessions 
were going to recommend it and it does meet all the goals our 
members helped formulate i think theyll accept it said jack 
parton director of usw district 31 and chief negotiator with the 
nations fourthlargest steel producer 
inland originally wanted concessions including the right to 
schedule workers for a 12hour work day parton said the company 
also wanted the employees to help pay medical insurance premiums 
both demands were withdrawn by company negotiators 
incentive pay will be increased in the fourth year and the 
agreement also improves pension benefits and resolves differences 
over the status of maintenance jobs he said 
inlands workers gave no wage concessions in the 1986 
negotiations so there was no restoration of past sacrifices 
the talks began march 7 earliest among four major producers who 
shared july 31 contract expirations by a selfimposed settlement 
deadline of march 31 inland still was demanding concessions and had 
offered no wage increase parton said 
we hadnt had a raise in about eight years when inflation was 
22 percent the company made a big buck management got raises they 
deserve raises but so do we parton said 
by late may we still couldnt convince our counterparts that 
our members were entitled to share in those profits he said we 
started preparing for a strike 
the 12000 usw members at inland were hearing late in the 
bargaining that a sticking point remained over wage increases in the 
first year and their fellow union members at national steel corp 
this week surprised negotiators by rejecting a 50month offer in 
part because it offered less money up front than workers accepted 
from bethlehem steel corp 
the inland settlement came around 4 am in chicago where the 
company is based

federal investigators are looking into a charge that 
an eastern airlines pilot with a broken foot and two newly hired 
copilots flew into a difficult south american airport a newspaper 
reported thursday 
eastern union sources said the captain ron neville suffered a 
broken foot in a car accident june 15 on his way to the airport in 
asuncion paraguay despite the injury neville continued flying 
even though a broken foot could make him unqualified for duty the 
sources told the post of west palm beach fla for an article 
published thursday 
one stop on the flight was in la paz bolivia an airport 
easterns operations manual designates as one at which only the 
captain can make takeoffs and landings the airport is in the 
mountains and nearby terrain rises 8000 feet above the airport 
flying an airliner with such an injury is dangerous because foot 
pedals help steer the plane and heavy pressure is required in some 
wind conditions or if an engine fails the union sources said 
eastern officials said the claim was an effort by its striking 
unions to hurt the airline by raising doubts about its safety 
this type of manufactured alleged incident is typical of the 
safetyrelated scare tactics that the pilots union is using at 
this point eastern spokesman robin matell said 
matell said neville didnt feel he had been incapacitated after 
the auto accident after returning to miami the captain was checked 
out by easterns medical department and his private physician and 
was cleared to continue flying with a hairline fracture in his foot 
matell said 
this is not the type of thing you would even put a cast on 
matell said 
neville a resident of davie near fort lauderdale fla has an 
unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment 
the pilots union called it to our attention last weekend and 
were looking into it said federal aviation administration 
spokesman jack barker in atlanta 
the medical report is being sent to the faa but has not yet 
arrived barker said 
besides the captain the cockpit crew reportedly included two 
recent graduates of easterns pilot training program 
pilots union spokesman hank weber called la paz the most 
dangerous airport in easterns system because of the mountains he 
also said eastern has scaled back training aimed at helping new 
pilots handle south american flights because of its need to train 
them quickly 
eastern suffered a fatal crash into a bolivian mountainside five 
years ago 
the union has charged that the company moving ahead with a 
rebuilding plan relying mainly on newly hired pilots is risking 
safety by using so many inexperienced pilots

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply rose in midjune but a narrower money measure fell the 
federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 rose 48 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 30848 billion in the week ended june 12 from 
30800 billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 rose 75 billion to a seasonally 
adjusted 39708 billion from 39633 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 slipped 66 
billion to a seasonally adjusted 7695 billion from 7761 billion

and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed in february reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 
percent to 7 percent growth in m2 and 35 percent to 75 percent 
growth in m3 the fed has not set a target for m1 growth since early 
1987 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 30780 billion a 12 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 
weeks m3 averaged 39570 billion up 34 percent while m1 fell 
45 percent to an average of 7788 billion 
in other reports 
the federal reserve bank of new york said bank borrowings from 
the federal reserve system at the discount window excluding 
extended credit averaged 546 million a day in the week ended 
wednesday up from 471 million the previous week 
the federal reserve bank of st louis reported that the monetary 
base the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at 
federal reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation 
was 2899 billion in the twoweek period ended wednesday up from

10 billion annual world trade in coffee beans cut 153 million 
bags reducing the global allocation for the current year to 5534 
million bags

bean most of them latin american

organizations 130apound indicator price for arabica coffee 
the organization of 74 countries tries to keep the average price 
of the two basic coffee types arabica and robusta within a band of 
110 to 140 a pound by balancing supply with demand through quota 
adjustments at fixed prices 
despite previous quota reductions that affected only robusta 
producers the average price of both types last week dropped below 
110 a pound 
robusta coffee is the poorer and less popular type produced 
throughout most of africa and in indonesia

dominos pizza inc under fire for a 
series of fatal traffic accidents involving delivery people plans 
to stop hiring employees under 18 although current workers can stay 
a spokesman said thursday 
the decision came after florida parents complained about layoffs 
following an earlier directive to reassign or fire drivers under 18 
but dominos will recommend that its stores not hire people under 
18 for driving or nondriving jobs in the future spokesman ron 
hingst said 
the earlier move led to confusion when at least one dominos 
outlet in miami gave pink slips to all employees under 18 on 
wednesday 
dominos florida division gave instructions to discharge all 
workers under 18 but modified them later wednesday after parents 
complained to the companys regional office in pompano beach hingst 
said 
some of our people jumped the gun he said there was some 
miscommunication on our part 
hingst said it was dominos policy to comply with federal law 
prohibiting the hiring of drivers younger than 18 in some cases 
however people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering 
pizzas he said 
dominos has acknowledged 20 fatalities in the last year in 
accidents involving its drivers but denies the companys 
29yearold promise to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a 
telephone order encourages employees reckless driving 
federal child labor laws forbid hiring people under 18 for 
several hazardous occupations including drivers the law doesnt 
rule out occasional driving for younger workers however 
dominos reexamined its hiring practices after june 3 when 
deliveryman jesse colson 17 died in a onevehicle accident in 
indianapolis 
his mother has claimed he was speeding and that dominos 
guarantee was an invitation to break the law 
but hingst said the hiring directive was a reminder to follow 
the guidelines we decided to have everybody review their employees 
on individual basis 
the us labor department examined the indianapolis accident and 
would have directed regional officials to talk to dominos if a 
wider problem was suspected said a department spokesman in 
washington dc 
the departments assistant district director for michigan 
valeria sobecki said she hadnt been told to take up the question 
with dominos 
hingst said dominos has talked with the labor department about 
driver age requirements before we had all our paperwork in 
order he said 
the review will affect about 300 employees at companyowned 
dominos stores who are under 18 he said companyowned stores 
comprise about onethird of dominos 5000 stores nationwide 
the remaining twothirds of the stores are franchises hingst 
said franchise owners were being urged to make the same move 
it is highly recommended to the franchises but it isnt 
contractually binding he said 
dominos companyowned stores and franchises combined have about 
150000 employees including 70000 to 80000 delivery drivers 
hingst said

canadian real estate giant olympia amp york 
developments ltd confirmed thursday it has made a bid for sears 
tower after the wall street journal reported the company was among 
four finalists vying for the worlds tallest building 
three other parties named by the newspaper as finalists for 
sears roebuck amp cos 110story building said they could not 
comment on the report 
the bids are said to range from 800 million to 1 billion which 
would be the highest price paid for an american building the wall 
street journal said citing individuals familiar with the 
process however the bids are probably below sears expectations 
a source told the newspaper 
we have submitted a bid said peter rosenthal a spokesman in 
new york for torontobased olympia amp york the largest private 
commercial real estate developer in north america he would not 
disclose the size of the bid and declined further comment 
the three other bidders named by the journal are chicago pension 
manager jmb realty corp with developer trammell crow co of dallas 
chicago developer lasalle partners inc with prudential insurance 
co of america and boston pension adviser aldrich eastman amp waltch 
inc 
lasalle partners vice president gretchen needham said her firm 
looks at every significant real estate opportunity in the 
country but would not confirm a bid for sears tower 
all the other companies named in the journal story referred 
telephone calls to senior executives or corporate spokespersons all 
of whom were said to be unavailable and did not return calls 
sears spokesman douglas fairweather said the journal did not get 
its information from sears 
were not commenting on the process of the sale its been 
going on for a while and we expect it will go on for a while he 
said when we have a deal well announce it 
even the lowest of the reported bids would top the highest price 
ever paid for a us building 660 million paid by walter 
shorenstein in 1985 for the bank of america building in san 
francisco 
but all the reported bids are below the 12 billion to 2 
billion that realestate experts expected the building would fetch 
when sears announced last october it would sell the downtown chicago 
landmark as part of a corporate restructuring 
the japanese government has discouraged japanese bids on sears 
tower fearing an antijapan backlash if they were to be successful 
in acquiring such a prominent piece of america said john oharenko 
a managing partner in the chicago office of cushman amp wakefield 
inc a new york real estate firm that has represented japanese 
buyers in other property deals 
the sears tower sale has been overshadowed lately by the 
companys plan to move its 6000employee merchandise group out of 
the tower to a location that the company expects to announce within 
a week 
illinois hopes to retain the retail arm of sears but several 
states including north carolina and texas also are in the running 
the merchandise group occupies most of the 50 lower floors of the 
tower the problem of finding tenants for those floors which are 
considered less desirable than the upper levels is one of the 
factors holding down the price tag for the building oharenko said

valley national corp of phoenix announced 
thursday it will add 181 million to its loanloss reserves and 
expects a 90 million loss in the second quarter as a result 
valley national bank of arizona and valley utah bancorporation 
are chief subsidiaries 
valley national chairman james p simmons attributed the action 
to a deterioration in arizonas real estate market with no immediate 
sign of recovery 
given that current market conditions make the estimation 
process difficult we believe we have taken a conservative view in 
determining the amount to be added to our reserves simmons said 
banks take such steps to protect themselves against the 
possibility that loans wont be repaid the weak property market in 
the economically depressed southwest has raised the risk of mortgage 
defaults 
valley national stressed that the corporations core earnings and 
financial base remain strong it projected that a substantial amount 
of the second quarter loss should be regained by the end of the 1989
