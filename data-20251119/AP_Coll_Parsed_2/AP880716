engineers today sought the source of 
a small gas leak in a space shuttle steering engine a new problem 
nasa officials said could further delay the first shuttle flight 
since the challenger explosion 
experts were probing deep into discoverys left orbital 
maneuvering system engine pod in an effort to locate the leak but 
the leak was so tiny it was difficult to isolate and the process 
could take several days said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
launch pad workers detected an odor of nitrogen tetroxide gas 
friday while preparing discovery for its planned early september 
launch she said it was in a pod covering one of the two engines 
used to maneuver the shuttle in orbit 
nitrogen tetroxide serves as an oxidizer in the engines 
providing oxygen to ignite the fuel when the shuttle is in 
oxygenpoor space 
officials could not say whether the leak would further delay the 
launch already postponed several times since nasa set a liftoff 
date for last february malone said 
it will depend on where the leak is and how severe it is 
malone said 
officials said they believed the leak was in one of three 
places a power valve an oxidizer tank filter or a jet thruster 
if the leak is too inaccessible to be repaired on the pad 
malone said discovery might have to be returned to an assembly 
building a move officials estimated could delay the launch by 
several weeks 
when initially detected the leak rate was 15 parts per million 
considered very minor malone said the rate later dropped to 3 or 
4 ppm she said 
discovery is being readied for the first space shuttle flight 
since the challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts 2 
years ago 
elsewhere engineers at the morton thiokol plant in utah 
continue to inspect a solid fuel booster rocket damaged last week 
when a joint was mistakenly overpressurized 
a ground testfiring of the rocket has been delayed from late 
july until at least midaugust while experts consider what repairs 
have to be made 
the test the fifth fullscale firing of the redesigned rocket 
is considered essential before discovery can be committed to 
flight a faulty booster rocket joint triggered the challenger 
explosion

a judge declared a mistrial friday in 
the case of an airline pilot accused of murdering his wife and 
destroying her body with a chain saw and wood chipper 
after 17 days of deliberations a juror refused to continue or 
even to reappear in the courtroom so the case could be recessed 
until saturday superior court judge barry schaller said in 
announcing the mistrial friday night 
states attorney walter flanagan said he would decide next week 
whether to seek another trial 
twelve people took an oath to do a job and 11 were willing to 
do so and one was not flanagan said 
the jury had declared itself deadlocked about 435 pm friday 
but schaller ordered jurors to continue to try to reach a verdict 
in the trial of richard crafts which started april 4 
schaller said juror warren maskell jr of preston told him i 
am sorry but after voting eight times in at least a week with the 
same results i cannot continue to deliberate in a clear and open 
mind i am truly sorry 
a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that maskell was the lone juror who refused to 
vote for conviction 
crafts a 50yearold pilot for eastern airlines and parttime 
police officer was arrested in january 1987 and charged with the 
murder of his danishborn wife helle the arrest came after body 
parts were found by state police on the banks of the housatonic 
river in southbury 
mrs crafts a 39yearold stewardess for pan american world 
airlines and mother of three young children was last seen on nov 
18 1986 when coworkers dropped her off at the crafts newtown 
home after an overseas flight 
defense attorney j daniel sagarin said his client was 
disappointed by the outcome saying crafts wanted a verdict so he 
could go back to his children sagarin said he would seek a 
reduction in crafts bond next week crafts has been held in lieu 
of 750000 bail since his arrest 
maskell 47 suffered head injuries in a car accident on friday 
july 1 he was hospitalized briefly but he told schaller when 
court reconvened july 5 that he felt he was able to continue 
deliberations 
the judge said that while the 12member jury was sending out for 
supper friday night maskell left the jury room and refused to 
return 
the judge quoted maskell as saying im out of there and im 
not going back in there 
the judge said an effort was made to let the situation cool 
off but maskell wouldnt budge despite requests from several 
other jurors that he join them 
schaller said he decided then to have the jurors return to the 
courtroom and recess until saturday morning for one more attempt at 
deliberations but maskell refused telling a bailiff that he 
wouldnt come unless he was carried in 
at that point the judge said he asked the jurys foreman in a 
note if further deliberations would be useful and the foreman 
responded in writing yes definitely maskell responded to the 
same question in another note i do not believe so 
prosecutor flanagan said he agreed with the defense that the 
court was left with no alternative but to declare a mistrial 
earlier friday the jury sent the judge a note saying that there 
was a strong majority but that it was at an impasse and 
desired further instructions it didnt say whether the majority 
favored conviction or acquittal 
schaller told the jury that those in the minority should closely 
examine the views of the majority in an effort to reach a unanimous 
verdict 
he said a dissenting juror should consider whether his or her 
doubt is a reasonable one when it makes no impression on the other 
jurors 
the defense objected to the instructions 
prosecutors said they didnt know how crafts killed his wife 
but they presented evidence they said proved he used a chain saw 
and wood chipper to dispose of her body 
more than 100 witnesses and 650 exhibits were presented over 53 
days of the trial which was moved to new london from danbury 
because of pretrial publicity over the case

the chief negotiator of the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty and the head of the private arms 
control association say the reagan administration is trying in its 
waning months to scuttle the accord 
gerard c smith the former negotiator and spurgeon keeny jr 
head of the arms control group leveled the accusations friday as 
president reagan weighed conflicting opinions from his senior 
advisers on what to do 
the us military joint chiefs of staff urged him to hold to the 
treaty while william f burns jr head of the us arms control 
and disarmament agency recommended that he charge moscow with a 
material breach of the treaty 
the reagan administration meanwhile is awaiting a response 
from moscow on a date for a fiveyear review of the abm treaty 
considered a cornerstone of the arms control process 
at issue is the soviet phased array radar station at krasnoyarsk 
that reagan has already labeled a violation of the 1972 treaty in 
two reports to congress while the soviets deny any infraction 
even many liberal critics of the administrations arm control 
policy question the legality of the facility 
the treaty limits us and soviet defenses against ballistic 
missiles and stands in the way of reagans quest for a spacebased 
defense against soviet rockets 
keeny said that although the soviet installation is 
inconsistent with the abm treatys provisions labeling krasnoyarsk 
as a material breach would be a gross exaggeration of its military 
and legal significance and clearly is designed as a lastgasp 
effort to kill the abm treaty in the waning days of the 
administration rather than solve the problem 
former negotiator smith said having been blocked by congress 
from killing the treaty through reinterpretation it appears the 
administration is trying to find another way to kill the treaty 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that even if reagan accepted the advice of burns 
and other hard liners it did not mean he would abandon the treaty 
the chiefs recommended that reagan not charge the soviets with a 
material breach because that could lead to an unraveling of the 
treaty the official said the chiefs are convinced if that 
happens the soviets are in a better position to take advantage of a 
breakout the official said 
this puts the chiefs at odds with burns who takes a harder 
stance on the treaty than the military but would give the soviets 
time to level the facilities before the united states retaliated 
reagan is not likely to make a decision until a date for review 
is set with the soviets were still working on it the 
official said 
reagans senior advisers discussed the issue at an unpublicized 
meeting last week of the national security planning group and did 
not reach a consensus 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman declined on monday 
to discuss the options presented to reagan no decision has been 
made the spokesman said the issue is under review 
fitzwater said there are sound and valid arguments on both 
sides of the question and that reagan would make a decision 
before the review 
the treaty constrains defenses against ballistic missiles on the 
theory a potential aggressor might hold back if his country faced 
retaliatory devastation 
the treaty limits how fast and far the united states can go in 
its search for a spacebased defense against ballistic missiles 
that uses such sophisticated technology as laser beams and kinetic 
energy 
the program known formally as the strategic defense initiative 
is being carried out under what the reagan administration describes 
as a strict interpretation of the 1972 treaty a broader 
interpretation would provide more leeway while scrapping the 
treaty would remove all legal restraints

despite rumbles of discontent from jesse jackson 
michael dukakis is confidently predicting jackson will campaign 
actively for the dukakisbentsen ticket in the fall campaign 
i want him involved i want his staff people involved 
dukakis said friday in a wideranging interview in the governors 
office at the massachusetts statehouse 
jackson had shown disappointment over dukakis choice of texas 
sen lloyd bentsen for the vice presidential nomination but on 
friday he called the idea of a convention challenge to the choice a 
moot question 
ron brown jacksons convention manager said the campaign has 
no present plans to put jesse jacksons name up for vice 
president 
sitting in shirt sleeves in his office dukakis sounded upbeat 
as he looked ahead to his trip to atlanta for the democratic 
convention that will culminate a marathon campaign wednesday by 
naming him the partys presidential nominee 
i cant remember a time when weve the democrats been more 
together said dukakis 
in the interview he also 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
said he had pretty much decided on bentsen when he met with 
aides in his kitchen on monday night the discussion i had with 
folks there was not unhelpful but i was more interested in talking 
to them about how we handle it what are the mechanics of this 
denied the decision already had been made before paul brountas 
the lawyer who headed his vice presidential search met with 
jackson earlier the same day no no i didnt say that he 
said when asked if that were the case 
said thats for you to decide when asked if vice president 
george bushs appearance at the united nations on thursday to 
explain the united states position on the downing of an iranian 
airliner was more political than diplomatic im not going to 
second guess the vice president he said 
abruptly dismissed the notion that a mediator former 
president jimmy carter was suggested was needed to resolve 
differences between him and jackson we dont need mediators 
he said we talk and continue to 
said of the state budget crisis that has been a potential 
embarrassment im going to have a balanced budget by the end of 
this week the state legislature has met into the night all week 
in an effort to come up with a 400 million defecitclosing plan 
aides said dukakis expected to sign a bill hours before flying to 
atlanta on sunday 
dukakis said that he thought the democrats reflected a broad 
national consensus on such issues as trade plant closings 
health care and the environment 
i think thats the reason you just dont have these deep 
ideological divisions that you often have had in the past 
he said his staff and jacksons have very good relations and 
that he hoped to begin to bring jackson aides into the campaign 
in important responsible positions the sooner we can get on with 
that the better 
the nomineetobe acted unconcerned about the perception he had 
so far failed to put his stamp on the upcoming convention 
there are 4000 delegates who worked very hard to get elected 
to that convention he replied they make the decisions in the 
last analysis theyre going to decide who the nominees are 
theyre going to decide what kind of a platform we have and 
thats whose convention it is 
my job is go to the convention to win the nomination and to 
make sure the person ive asked to serve as my running mate gets 
the nomination to work hard with the delegates to get a good 
platform and at the same time to begin the final drive he said

a house subcommittee has asked the head of the 
national highway traffic safety administration to respond to a 
published report that she vetoed a staff recommendation for a 
federal safety standard on the rollover of sport utility vehicles 
the request was made friday in a letter to nhtsa administrator 
diane steed from reps thomas luken dohio and john dingell 
dmich 
the lawmakers asked for all internal letters notes 
memoranda studies etc connected with her decision to reject a 
petition to set safety standards for the jeeplike vehicles and 
recall those that fail to meet the standards 
the lawmakers cited a wall street journal report of may 23 which 
said that according to internal agency documents ms steed last 
summer vetoed a recommendation from four major nhtsa departments to 
establish such a standard 
a nhtsa spokesman said there was no one at the agency 
immediately available to respond to the lawmakers comments 
since 1984 nhtsas regulations have required a special label to 
be placed on all utility vehicles warning of possible rollovers 
following sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers and last april the 
agency announced it was issuing a consumer information pamphlet 
about special precautions drivers of the on and offroad vehicles 
should take 
a warning label and a pamphlet may not be enough said 
luken chairman of the house energy and commerce transportation 
subcommittee nhtsas recent report to congress showed that in 
1986 the death rate from rollovers for utility vehicles was more 
than double that for passenger cars

the us commission on civil rights is 
delaying adoption of an extensive report showing that some groups 
of asian americans tend to earn more than american whites 
several commission members said friday they want the report to 
be reviewed by experts on asian discriminatio one said the report 
could lead to more prejudice against asian americans 
the 289page report the economic status of americans of asian 
descent examines census immigration and other statistics on six 
ethnic groups chinese filipinos japanese koreans asian indians 
and vietnamese 
the report by economists on the commission staff says that 
nativeborn us citizens of japanese and korean descent earn more 
than caucasians while those with chinese heritage earn about the 
same and filipinos and indians earn less 
commission member mary frances berry expressing concern that 
the report might downplay discrimination said im trying to 
keep the job from being done on asian americans that has already 
been done on black men the commission released a report in 1986 
that showed that income gaps between black and white men had 
decreased dramatically since the 1940s 
ms berry one of three black members of the commission which 
includes no asian americans said income is not the only measure of 
discrimination and there is a danger that when other americans see 
how well asian immigrants are doing financially discrimination 
will increase 
commissioner robert a destro said the commission does not want 
to be in the position of saying to minorities see everything is 
okay you make a lot of money anyway 
six of the seven commission members voted to postpone adoption 
of the report prepared by the commission staff until at least its 
september meeting in los angeles the commission is an independent 
federal agency with half its board members appointed by the 
president and half by congress one seat on the board is vacant 
the report says there is no evidence the acrosstheboard 
discrimination that existed against asians in the 1960s exists in 
the 1980s 
adjusting for changing skills and characteristics the 
earnings gap between asian and nonhispanic white men decreased 
dramatically between 1960 and 1980 says an executive summary 
included in the report this finding suggests that the economic 
progress of asian men was aided by a decline in antiasian labor 
market discrimination 
the report however shows differences between asian men and 
women between asian americans born in the united states and recent 
immigrants and among the six ethnic groups examined 
it looks at an asian american population of 326 million making 
up about 15 percent of the us population 
it cites evidence that new immigrants from asia initially earn 
less than similar nonhispanic white immigrants but that they end 
up earning more after about 11 years in this country 
asian women both immigrants and nativeborn tend to earn more 
than white women the report said it noted that that more asian 
american women work partly because the more closely knit family 
structure with many relatives often living together allows other 
family members to take care of children 
poverty rates for usborn chinese japanese and korean 
families are lower than the general population while poverty rates 
for filipino and indian families are higher and vietnamese 
immigrant families have substantially higher levels of poverty 
according to the report 
james cunningham assistant staff director who oversaw the 
project said the data raise several questions requiring further 
research including the possibility of discrimination at higher 
levels of employment 
he said that asians are overrepresented in professional jobs 
but underrepresented in managerial positions we dont know 
whether this is by choice or because of discrimination 
cunningham said 
he said that while asians are showing overall success in many 
areas and discrimination has decreased prejudices still affect 
some asian groups 
this is by no means to say there is an asian success story 
he said

federal prison officials are being ordered to 
transfer into the general prison population two women who were held 
in an isolation unit at a kentucky institution because of their 
radical political beliefs 
us district judge barrington parker in a ruling friday said 
the designation of prisoners solely for their subversive 
statements and thoughts is the type of overreaction that the 
supreme court has repeatedly warned against 
parker barred the bureau of prisons from considering a 
prisoners past political association or personal political 
beliefs in deciding on transfers within federal prisons 
the ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the american civil 
liberties unions national prison project the center for 
constitutional rights the peoples law office and private 
attorneys challenging regulations that allowed the isolation of 
prisoners based on their political beliefs or affiliations 
it was filed on behalf of three women held in the highsecurity 
isolation unit at the federal correctional institution in 
lexington ky lawyers for the women said they had been treated so 
inhumanely that they might be permanently psychologically harmed 
parker ordered the bureau of prisons to rewrite its regulations 
and to transfer silvia baraldini and susan rosenberg alleged 
members of leftist political groups into the general prison 
population 
defendants may be concerned that the two plaintiffs will 
persuade inmates within the general prison population to share 
their political views but those fears cannot be accommodated at the 
expense of constitutional rights he wrote in his opinion 
he added the treatment of the plaintiffs has skirted 
elemental standards of human decency the exaggerated security 
small group isolation and staff harassment serve to constantly 
undermine the inmates morale 
a third prisoner represented in the lawsuit sylvia brown had 
not been placed in the isolation unit because of her political 
beliefs and was not covered by transfer order said the aclus 
alexa freeman 
adjoa aiyetoro lead counsel for the prisoners said the ruling 
was a tremendous victory 
the decision vindicates the rights of prisoners to hold 
beliefs based on conscience she said 
elizabeth sink a cooperating attorney with the center for 
constitutional rights hailed the ruling and said the isolation 
unit is an example of the human rights violations that this 
country engages in 
john c cleary who represented the bureau of prisons in the 
lawsuit declined to comment on the ruling at a hearing before 
parker last month cleary argued that the women were transferred 
into the unit because they posed a risk of external assault on 
the prison he said there was no medical evidence to support 
claims they had suffered psychological harm 
the bureau has announced plans to close the lexington unit and 
transfer prisoners to a new high security unit at marianna fla 
parker warned the bureau to be careful that conditions at the new 
unit do not lead to wanton and unnecessary inflictions of 
psychological pain 
consigning anyone to a high security unit for past political 
associations they will never shed unless forced to renounce them is 
a dangerous mission for this countrys prison system to continue 
he said 
this court is afraid that the marianna facility will 
automatically assume many of the problems haunting the lexington 
unit 
rosenberg is serving a 58year term for possessing weapons and 
explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in new jersey and 
is one of seven recently indicted in the 1983 bombing of the us 
capitol 
baraldini was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in aiding 
a 16 million brinks armored car heist in nyack ny in 1981 
that left a guard and two police officers dead rosenberg was 
linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled brinks 
robbery

more than 5000 hunters met fridays 
deadline to apply for just 235 licenses in floridas first 
alligator hunt in 25 years the lucky winners wont be allowed to 
use guns 
once an endangered species the american alligator now numbers 
about 1 million in florida and is increasingly encountering humans 
as the states people population also grows 
a 4yearold girl was killed by an alligator in may near her 
familys lakeside home in englewood in southwest florida but 
planning for the hunt had been under way long before that 
the game and fresh water fish commission gave final approval 
friday during a meeting in ocala for the trapping and killing of 
up to 3425 alligators in 20 wildlife management areas during the 
30day hunt this fall that quote assumes that not every hunter 
will get his full 15animal limit 
commission spokesman scott ball said 15000 applications were 
printed and he was surprised that only 5000 people applied 
a lot of people have been calling up in the last few days that 
have been procrastinating and kicking themselves for waiting until 
the last minute said ball they are asking about next year 
the sanctioned hunts will occur only at night and trappers will 
have to use snares harpoons spears or similar weapons to get a 
gator close enough to kill the only firearm allowed will be a 
bangstick a pole with a shotgun shell on the end that is used 
to kill a gator once it is snared and brought up to a boat said 
ball 
part of the motivation for hunting gators may be economic gator 
meat sells for about 5 a pound hide sells for about 40 a foot 
florida residents selected by lottery for the hunt will have to 
pay a 250 license fee plus a 30 tag fee for each gator they 
catch up outofstate hunters will have to pay 1000 for the 
licenses 
in addition to the license fees and tag fees those awarded 
licenses will have to go through a sixhour training course in 
early august said ball 
the targeted reptiles will have to be at least 4 feet long

anglican bishops representing 70 
million faithful worldwide face bitter divisions over ordination of 
women as priests and bishops when they open an international 
conference this weekend 
the omens are not good for the 12th lambeth conference 
inevitably it will be dominated by questions about women priests 
and women bishops said an editorial in the church of england 
independent weekly church times 
it seems that bishops advocating and bishops resisting the 
ordination of women are on a collision course the weekly said 
the threeweek meeting of the lambeth conference held every 10 
years officially opens on sunday with a service in canterbury 
cathedral and closes with another there on sunday aug 7 
anglicans are the worlds largest group of christians after the 
estimated 700 million roman catholics 
the conference which will discuss the work of the church 
relations with other christians and social questions has been 
overshadowed by the controversy over women priests already 
ordained in some of the anglican communions 27 provinces but 
rejected in others 
even more divisive is the possibility that anglicans in the us 
episcopal church will consecrate their first woman bishop this year 
bishops in many provinces have said that while they might 
tolerate women priests the prospect of a woman bishop could lead 
to severing of ties between their churches and the anglican 
communion 
each province is selfgoverning unlike the catholic church 
which is ruled centrally by the pope in the vatican but the state 
church of england is looked to for guidance and its spiritual 
head archbishop of canterbury robert runcie is the world anglican 
leader 
last week the policymaking general synod of the church of 
england voted to proceed with draft legislation to admit women to 
the priesthood rejecting runcies advice not to do so because it 
might split the church england could have its first woman priest 
by 1993 if parliament agrees 
runcie warned that womens ordination could be an added 
hindrance to unity with the roman catholic and orthodox churches 
which have allmale priesthoods 
the draft rules propose compensating clergymen with payments up 
to about 50000 if they quit the church because they feel they 
cannot work with women priests 
englands movement for the ordination of women says that about 
1000 women have been ordained most of them in the united states 
canada and new zealand opponents say the true figure is about 700 
churchmen opposed to women priests on grounds of scripture and 
tradition say while they might eventually accept them they would 
never accept a woman bishop because bishops are followers of the 
apostles of jesus christ founder of christianity who were all men 
runcie has warned that because some bishops would not tolerate 
women bishops the anglican communion might divide into a 
federation of loosely linked regional churches each with its own 
conference to replace the lambeth conference 
we have lost members because of the ordination of women and 
we still have members who are distressed about it said 
memphisbased us episcopalian bishop alex dickson of the diocese 
of west tennessee when he arrived in canterbury 
i am concerned that we remain sensitive to people who oppose 
womens ordination and that we make room for them 
the first lambeth conference was held in 1867 and attended by 76 
bishops at lambeth palace official london residence of the 
archbishop of canterbury 
runcie has personally invited each of the 577 bishops to the 
12th lambeth conference about 380 of them have said they will 
bring their wives who will hold their own conference

the soviet union and china criticized the 
united states for downing an iranian airliner over the persian 
gulf but the security council is likely to consider a compromise 
that distributes the blame 
iran failed to get security council members to condemn the 
united states friday for the july 3 attack that left 290 people 
dead and most nations said the urgent priority is to end the 
8yearold iraniraq war 
the soviet union said the us navy must withdraw from the gulf 
in favor of a un peacekeeping force 
this tragedy has demonstrated once again that the us naval 
fleet must leave the gulf without delaysaid valentine v 
lozinskiy the deputy soviet representative 
iran had asked for the security council meeting on the shooting 
down of the airbus a300 by the us navy cruiser vincennes the 
15nation security council adjourned the matter until monday after 
debating the gulf disaster for a second day on friday 
the council president for july ambassador paulo 
nogueriabatista of brazil is trying to draft a document that 
would be acceptable to everyone and save face for iran 
irans presence at the meeting was its first appearance at the 
council which it has boycotted since the beginning of the 
iraniraq war in 1980 
diplomatic sources said council members feel iran must achieve 
something at the meeting or it will continue boycotting the council 
and continue rejecting a yearold security council resolution that 
demands an immediate ceasefire 
on thursday foreign minister aliakbar velayati of iran 
condemned the united states before the council and vice president 
george bush said the vincennes acted in self defense when fired on 
the airliner 
pentagon officials said the cruisers officers thought the 
airbus a300 was an iranian f14 on an attack course 
thirteen nations spoke friday including britain china france 
italy japan west germany yugoslavia algeria and argentina 
at a news conference friday velayati said the attitude of 
the us administration is similar to a rich mans son who drives 
when hes drunk he thinks money can buy everything and that is 
not true 
the soviet speech like others was moderate and moscow sent 
only its secondranking delegate to the debate 
in 1983 the soviet union vetoed a security council resolution 
condemning it for shooting down a south korean airliner over its 
territory that disaster killed 269 people 
all speakers friday deplored the tragedy but also said that the 
most important task is to end the war through implementation of 
un resolution 598 which calls for a truce withdrawal to 
recognized borders prisoner exchange and an investigation of who 
was responsible for the war 
iraq has said it will accept the resolution if iran does but 
the iranians insist that iraq be branded the aggressor before a 
truce iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after several border 
skirmishes 
john birch deputy british representative defended a nations 
right to have its warships defend its shipping in international 
waters 
if the security councils demand for a ceasefire had been met 
birch said we should not be considering here today another 
horror born of this senseless conflict 
pierre brochand the french deputy representative said the 
international community cannot pass judgment on such a tragic 
error without the results of an inquiry we should take into 
account the conditions prevailing in the region fraught with 
insecurity because of the iraniraq war 
chinese ambassador li luye said the united states was 
responsible and the question of responsibility should not be 
ignored if repetition of such a tragedy is to be avoided 
he also opposed bigpower military involvement in the gulf 
region because it only further complicates the situation and may 
further exacerbate the conflict 
we appeal to iran and iraq to cooperate in ernest with the 
secretarygeneral and the council in good faith on the basis of 
598 he said

a lebanese magazine says the us navys 
missile attack on an iranian jetliner derailed hostage talks 
between the united states and iran 
ashshiraa said friday that talks between negotiatiors for the 
two countries had been held in a european country and covered 
many details 
the report said a number of american hostages were to be 
released in south beirut in return for a public change in the 
american political stand on the gulf war in favor of iran 
it said the talks in europe broke down after the navy shot down 
the iran air jetliner july 3 killing all 290 people on board the 
united states said its forces mistook the plane for a jet fighter 
the report carried no further details of the alleged talks and 
cited no sources 
ashshiraa gained international fame in 1986 when it broke the 
story of secret us arms sales to iran to win release of american 
hostages but the magazines recent reports on the 18 foreign 
captives held in lebanon have not been accurate 
in a separate report the magazine said members of a west german 
delegation held talks in christian east beirut with representatives 
of a proiranian group holding west german hostage rudolf cordes 
the german delegation has returned home after the talks 
reached a dead end the report said the magazine did not report 
the cause of the impasse 
cordes 53 a businessman with hoechst ag a west german 
chemical firm was kidnapped jan 17 1987 in moslem west beirut 
the proiranian holy warriors for freedom claimed responsibility 
for his abduction

here are some comments from the presidential 
campaign trail 
 
michael dukakis ruling out jesse jacksons notion to have 
former president jimmy carter play play peacemaker in their 
preconvention disagreements we dont need mediators 
 
jimmy carter saying he thinks dukakis and jackson can work out 
their differences on their own without his help i dont think 
they need any mediation i think what is needed is to just have a 
better means of communication between one another 
 
walter mondale former democratic presidential candidate 
warning against heightened tensions between dukakis and jackson 
we always have rising tensions about this time its inherent 
but i believe this is a year where democrats understand these 
fights if theyre carried on too far become too personalized 
they set poison down into the roots that can be difficult to deal 
with 
 
jesse jackson preaching accommodation rather than discord we 
simply cannot win without each other we can only win with each 
other it is in our distinct advantage to find common ground 
 
bob dole saying the wide gap that exists between the outlook of 
dukakis and his vice presidential running mate will not occur on 
the republican ticket youre going to find only shades of 
difference in our philosophy not this chasm you find between 
dukakis on the one hand and lloyd bentsen on the other

los angeles drug gangs are spreading 
cocaine and violence in cities nationwide and may become a new form 
of organized crime unless they are stopped soon the los angeles 
county district attorney warns 
this isnt organized crime as we understand that today but i 
think its the genesis of a new form of organized crime involved in 
drug trafficking district attorney ira reiner said friday 
if we dont stamp it out throughout the country now while it 
is still manageable we can come back 10 years from now and talk 
about the fullblown problem of organized crime because that is 
what it will be he said 
reiner was among about 50 law officers from 11 midwest and 
western cities who attended a twoday conference to develop a 
national strategy to fight the spread of los angeles drug gangs 
members of 25 los angeles street gang sets or factions have 
been reported dealing drugs in more than 45 cities authorities 
said 
the gangs are spreading to mediumsized cities because of 
increased pressure from police in southern california and declining 
drug prices in that area where cocaine is abundant 
its fair to say that these gangs are trying to take over the 
retail distribution of cocaine in many parts of the country said 
frank storey agent in charge of the kansas city fbi office 
their major objective is to open up new markets and increase 
revenue in their operations 
authorities say members of two prominent rival drug gangs from 
los angeles the crips and the bloods have infiltrated cities from 
alaska to washington dc selling cocaine and its powerful 
derivative crack 
last year 387 people died in gangrelated violence in los 
angeles about half of them innocent bystanders more than 110 
people have died in the city so far this year including a san 
diego state university student who police say was gunned down for 
wearing a red shirt red is the color of the bloods and the crips 
wear bluecolored clothing 
participants in the seminar discussed development of a national 
computerized data bank to keep track of the movements of 
gangrelated drug dealers storey said 
larry kramer commander of the los angeles police department 
said authorities also agreed to try prosecuting gang members on 
federal charges more often 
the federal penalties are enhanced and much more severe 
kramer said there is quite frankly much more certainty of a 
protracted penalty through the federal system i think youll 
see more prosecutions federally 
los angeles county sheriffs lt charles brantley who directs a 
gangfighting force known as operation safe streets said he 
advised fellow law officers to act quickly to crack down on los 
angeles druggang members infiltrating their communities 
of course everyone knows that in los angeles weve reached 
the point where were really fighting a hard battle brantley 
said but in some of these cities that only have 50 or 60 gang 
members nows the time to stop it get in there and take care of 
it get the support of city councils the courts the district 
attorneys and stop it now before it gets bad

vietnam could begin allowing political 
prisoners to emigrate to the united states in the next several 
months vietnams official news agency said today 
the vietnam news agency quoted a statement by us and 
vietnamese negotiators as saying that the two nations reached 
preliminary agreement on releasing prisoners from socalled 
reeducation camps 
the joint statement said that while further talks are needed 
both sides are hopeful that the processing of released detainees 
can begin within the next several months the news agency said 
the agency monitored in bangkok said the statement was issued 
friday after two days of talks in hanoi between teams led by 
vietnams deputy foreign minister tran quang co and robert l 
funseth us senior deputy assistant secretary of state for 
refugee programs 
the statement said funseth reaffirmed president reagans 1984 
commitment to welcome for resettlement former detainees and their 
families who had close ties with the united states or its ally the 
south vietnamese government 
co in turn reaffirmed vietnams policy to let these people 
emigrate it said 
vietnam had demanded that the united states guarantee that the 
former prisoners would not be allowed to conduct antivietnamese 
activities once they were resettled vietnam has accused us 
authorities of helping vietnamese emigres seeking to overthrow the 
communist government 
the vietnamese side reaffirmed that vietnam will not encourage 
them to engage in antius activities the news agency said 
the united states ended its combat role in the vietnam war in 
1973 in 1975 south vietnam fell to the communist forces of north 
vietnam and the two vietnams were reunited under a communist 
government 
the statement said the us team declared that the released 
reeducation center detainees coming to the united states would be 
subject to all us laws including those affecting the activities 
of us residents toward other countries 
the joint statement said the two sides discussed ways of 
speeding the processing of applications of former prisoners a 
limited number of former prisoners have gone to the united states 
through the united nationssponsored orderly departure program 
under which vietnamese refugees and migrants leave their homeland 
on regular flights 
the north vietnamese communists established the huge network of 
reeducation camps which usually combined manual labor with 
ideological study after defeating south vietnam in april 1975 
the us state department estimates that about 900000 former 
us government employees or south vietnamese officials have spent 
time in the camps which the human rights group amnesty 
international has condemned but vietnam has called lenient 
punishment for war criminals 
the united states renewed it interest in the prisoners after 
nguyen van linh the pragmatic communist party chief urged 
national reconciliation and freed hundreds of former south 
vietnamese officials in september 1987 and february this year 
vice minister of information phan quang said on feb 11 that 
only 150 former officials remained held

to undermine the government 
the interior ministry announced friday night the suspension of 
the radio program el despertar the awakening for

ordering out nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven 
embassy colleagues 
tunnermann reluctantly bowed to the order and departed on 
friday five minutes ahead of the deadline imposed by the state 
department 
in managua foreign minister miguel descoto issued a statement 
saying tunnermann would remain as nicaraguas ambassador to the 
organization of american states in washington until this

rejecting jackie pressers choice of an heir 
the teamsters are returning power to one of its veteran old 
guard east coast leaders at a time when the union is under siege 
both from without and within 
the teamsters 17member executive board on friday elected 
william j mccarthy 69 of boston to succeed the late presser as 
president of the 16millionmember union 
mccarthy who has headed the teamsters operations in new 
england for the past two decades beat out secretarytreasurer 
weldon mathis 62 of atlanta by a 98 vote said several sources 
presser who died a week ago after being incapacitated most of 
the past 18 months with cancer had named mathis in 1985 to the 
unions no 2 post and appointed him interim president in may just 
before presser was to undergo brain surgery 
the struggle for the top post was the most contentious and most 
open in the unions 85year history 
behind mccarthys successful challenge was veteran teamster 
power broker joseph trerotola of new york at 70 the unions 
longeststanding vice president and head of its 15state eastern 
conference since 1969 
the presser forces lined up behind mathis and the trerotola 
forces lined up with mccarthy said one source who like the 
others would talk about the wrangling for power only on the 
condition of anonymity 
mathis remains the unions secretarytreasurer 
the turnover at the top of the nations largest union occurs 
just two weeks after the justice department filed suit to seize 
control of its affairs claiming the entire teamsters leadership 
has been corrupted by organized crime figures 
mccarthys election also reflects widescale disenchantment with 
the recently negotiated national master freight agreement the 
unions biggest contract covering 200000 teamsters in the 
interstate trucking industry 
the threeyear accord negotiated under mathis leadership during 
pressers absence was rejected by 64 percent of the rankandfile 
members casting ballots in a ratification vote last spring 
however under the teamsters constitution it takes a 
twothirds membership vote to nullify an accord once it is 
initialed by the unions negotiators 
mccarthy breaking from past teamster traditions to keep 
disputes within the unions hierarchy behind closed doors actively 
campaigned against the freight accord 
upon his election friday he indicated he will try to reopen the 
trucking industry contract for new negotiations 
i dont know what i can do but i plan to do everything i can 
to improve on it and get the wishes of our membership he said 
mccarthy has presided over the 8000member teamsters local 25 
the charlestown section of boston for 33 years and headed the 
international unions operations in new england for two decades 
asked by a reporter friday what presser would have thought about 
his election mccarthy confirmed his reputation among leaders of 
other labor unions as being a tough bargainer and possessing a 
quick temper 
who knows maybe he would roll over in his grave he 
replied i dont know what he was thinking why dont you try to 
locate him thats a goofy question ill give you a goofy answer 
mccarthy declined to elaborate on the power struggle with mathis 
the great strength of this board is that we will argue and 
fight about an issue but when the majority vote is taken everyone 
stands behind the decision he said 
however at least two union board members objected to declaring 
the vote for mccarthy unanimous a teamster tradition when the 
mantle is passed from one president to another one source said 
both mccarthy and mathis are viewed by leaders of other unions 
as being clean with no major ties to organized crime figures 
in contrast to the ties that the government alleges that presser 
and former teamster presidents roy williams and jimmy hoffa had 
other than being listed as a defendant like all of the teamster 
vice presidents in the federal suit to take over the union 
mccarthys name surfaced only once in the 200 pages of documents 
the government filed two weeks ago to support its takeover case 
in a transcript of an fbiwiretapped conversation on may 9 
1984 convicted new york crime boss anthony salerno is quoted as 
recognizing mccarthys name as the teamsters head boss of the 
east coast 
salerno was quoted as saying in the tapped telephone 
conversation with john tronolone a reputed cleveland organized 
crime figure that mccarthy is very friendly with a man that 
salerno identified only as cass 
in view of the governments unprecedented attempt to take over 
the entire union mccarthy said friday he has a tough job ahead 
it should be condolences not congratulations he said

nicaraguan rebels 
shaken by us aid reductions and dissidents demanding more 
democracy within the contra movement are seeking to reorganize the 
nicaraguan resistance 
leaders of the contras from miami venezuela costa rica and 
other points will meet in the concorde hotel on sunday and monday 
to resolve issues that threaten to split the rebels fighting the 
leftist sandinista government 
nicaraguan ambassador danilo valle said his government was 
disturbed that the dominican government would allow groups and 
people who not more than two days ago threatened to commit 
terrorist acts and assassination attempts against sandinista 
government leaders to come here to organize themselves 
dominican foreign minister favio herrera said the meeting would 
be a private affair and the government would not permit the 
contra leaders to issue extemporaneous declarations beyond those 
strictly related to the private character of the meeting that might 
affect the cordial relationship maintained with the nicaraguan 
government 
the nicaraguan resistance groups several different 
antisandinista forces following the dissolution of the umbrella 
organization national union of opposition over a year ago 
adolfo calero heads the conservatives azucena ferrey the 
christian democrats adolfo robledo the social democrats aristides 
sanchez the liberals and alfredo salazar the southern opposition 
col enrique bermudez heads the labor agrarian and business 
sectors as well as the miskito indians and pedro joaquin chamorro 
represents the independent sector 
according to the organizations bylaws each group can send 
seven delegates to the meeting 
the five members of the organizations directorate are expected 
to be either replaced or ratified in their positions 
the five are calero salazar ferrey sanchez and chamorro 
dissident contra commanders backed by calero and chamorro have 
demanded the removal of bermudez as military chief they accuse the 
former national guard colonel of being inefficient corrupt and too 
close to supporters of anastasio somoza the rightwing dictator 
ousted by the sandinistas in 1979 
the dissidents have been booted out of honduras and lost their 
commands since then calero and chamorro have rarely been seen with 
sanchez cesar and ferrey 
the possibility of renewed aid surfaced thursday after the 
sandinistas violently broke up a nonviolent demonstration in 
managua closed a catholic radio station and the opposition 
newspaper la prensa arrested 40 opposition leaders and expelled 
us ambassador richard melton 
in a show of bipartisan unity the us senate approved thursday 
a nonbinding resolution warning nicaraguas government that 
military aid to the contras could resume unless it reverses what it 
described as dramatic new steps in brutality against its own 
citizens 
in what some senators called a carrot and stick policy 
adopted on a 914 vote the senate also said it was ready to extend 
us economic aid to nicaragua if the sandinistas fully comply with 
commitments made a year ago and proceed to permit the 
establishment of a democratic system 
the contras normally once had six directors one of the seats 
has been empty since alfonso robelo quit and moved permanently to 
central america 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity say calero whose 
brother mario was just indicted in fort lauderdale fla for 
illegally supplying mercenaries to the contras may also resign or 
be voted out of his post and it is possible chamorro would go with 
him 
the dissidents have proposed as a compromise that bermudez be 
bumped up to the empty directors seat getting him out of the 
military command without humiliating him but the directors have 
never endorsed that idea

soviet and chinese pressure on north 
korea will help prevent terrorist attacks on the 1988 olympics 
us secretary of state george p shultz said today 
i think everybody will be exerting their influence in a 
positive way i feel that the olympics will go off in good style 
he told newsmen shortly before landing in the south korean capital 
en route from beijing 
he said the south koreans were also doing such a fine job in 
putting into place all the measures that deter any kinds of 
disturbances 
but on the eve of shultzs arrival the united nations command 
accused north korea of trying to undermine the games 
your attempts to contrive an atmosphere of danger on the 
korean peninsula in a transparent attempt to undermine the 
upcoming seoul olympics will not succeed said us rear adm 
william t pendley chief unc delegate to the military armistice 
commission 
arriving for his seventh stop on a ninecountry asian and 
pacific visit shultz was driven straight from the airport to the 
olympic village and olympic park 
he toured the living quarters at the olympic village which will 
house up to 15000 athletes and officials during the sept 17 to 
oct 2 event he also was driven through one of two major sports 
complexes studded with futuristic stadiums and outdoor sculptures 
the electronic scoreboard flashed a welcome message when shultz 
and his party entered the main 10000seat swimming stadium 
olympic security is one of the key issues shultz is expected to 
discuss when he meets president roh taewoo foreign minister choi 
kwangsoo and other south korean government and opposition leaders 
also scheduled for discussion are south koreas recent 
initiatives at reconciliation with north korea uskorean trade 
problems and americas continuing military role in south korea 
he called president rohs recent proposal to ease tensions with 
north korea as a very important step 
its too bad the north koreans brushed it off it may well be 
that they will take a second look shultz told reporters 
he said the united states would have to carefully assess north 
korean actions in light of seouls initiatives shultz said 
usnorth korean relations had been moving in a positive direction 
until the destruction of a south korean passenger airliner nov 29 
near burma with the deaths of all 115 people aboard 
north korea denied all involvement in the alleged bombing 
in remarks to reporters before arriving in seoul shultz said 
that in preparing for the olympiad the south koreans were alert to 
the placement of surfacetoair missiles within range of seoul and 
the recent introduction of an advanced soviet warplane in north 
korea 
the soviet union according to washington last year provided 
north korea with sam5 missiles and more recently a small number of 
advanced mig29 jets 
but shultz also stressed that moscow has flatly said the 
north koreans would not interfere with the olympic games which 
they are boycotting after failing to become cohosts of the event 
shultz said he had received similar assurances from the chinese 
who like the soviets will be competing in the olympics 
during his trip to seoul shultz may run into some criticism in 
discussing ussouth korean trade relations 
the united states has urged economically booming south korea to 
liberalize its regulations on some usimports to offset a trade 
deficit running at about 10 billion

from forks to frying pans the diversity of 
weapons wielded by the citys murderers could fill dozens of agatha 
christie mystery books 
the weapon of choice in chicago for doing in a neighbor 
relative or worst enemy remains the firearm says the 1987 murder 
analysis report a compendium of statistics about murder in the 
windy city compiled by the police department 
but last year people in chicago were killed with an almost 
atoz arsenal of weapons from an ashtray in one case to wooden 
boards in five slayings the report shows 
one person was murdered with an axe another was killed with an 
electric fan and a third was apparently burned to death with hot 
grease says the report which lists the type of weapon and the 
number of cases in which it was used without elaborating on the 
circumstances 
they say necessity is the mother of invention said chicago 
police officer patrick camden of the departments news affairs 
office people grab whatevers handy i guess 
thats usually the case says stuart kaminsky who is something 
of an expert on the art of murder as the author of 21 murder 
mysteries 
it sounds like these might be exotic murders done by some 
fiendishly clever criminal says kaminsky who lives in suburban 
evanston and has written such mysteries as the toby peters and 
inspector rostnikov series 
but it seems to me that in most of these cases when exotic 
weapons were used they were probably domestic cases where people 
grabbed what was handy when the emotions of the moment took over 
he said in a telephone interview friday night 
camden noted that the report though depicting a diversity of 
dastardly deeds contains some good news the number of homicides 
in chicago dropped from 744 in 1986 to 691 in 1987 
in the nations thirdlargest city 374 people were killed last 
year with firearms 175 were killed by cutting or slashing 
implements and 142 lives were ended with other weapons the report 
found 
the most widely used firearm was the 38caliber revolver 
employed in 126 shooting deaths the report said murderers used 
semiautomatic pistols to kill 76 people and shotguns to blast away 
20 others 
under the cutting and slashing category one person was murdered 
with a bayonet one with a saber and one with a screwdriver two 
people died at the hands of forkwielding killers three were 
stabbed to death with a carving knife and two with a boning knife 
a simple kitchen knife was the mostused weapon in this 
category involved in 88 murders followed by a pocket knife used 
in 29 slayings the report said 
in the other category 10 people were beaten to death with 
baseball bats one with a hammer three with bricks one with a 
rake and another with a shovel most beating deaths 54 were 
committed with the most accessible weapons the hands fists or 
feet the report shows 
the report notes that matches were used in two killings but 
camden says in those cases a lighted match was tossed on a person 
soaked with gasoline 
while these appear to be creative i think truly creative 
killers are rare kaminsky said i think the more clever the 
killer the less likely he is to use an exotic weapon because that 
draws more attention making it more likely the person will get 
caught

three white lawmen accused of beating to 
death a black jail inmate arrested for drunken driving have been 
acquitted on charges they violated his civil rights but face a new 
trial on murder charges 
the state district court jurys verdicts friday drew angry 
reactions from the black community in this east texas town 
if theres justice for all in a free society then it seems 
like theres justice for whites only in this society said will 
smith a preacher from the church of christ the message is to me 
that as black folks we better be careful 
suspended hemphill police chief thomas ladner 41 and sabine 
county deputies james bo hyde 35 and bill horton 58 were 
charged in the death of loyal garner jr a truck driver who was 
jailed in hemphill christmas night 
the three now face murder charges in tyler about 65 miles 
northwest of here where garner died in a hospital two days after 
he was jailed defense attorney paul buchanan said he would file 
pretrial motions today contending the upcoming trial places the men 
in double jeopardy that trial is to begin monday 
in february an inquest jury in tyler ruled that garner died of 
head injuries a pathologist had testified that garner suffered 
severe brain hemorrhaging after apparently being struck on the head 
at least twice 
corrine garner the victims wife said she was disappointed by 
the verdicts handed down after 11 hours of deliberations by a jury 
that included a black woman 
i guess well have to go to tyler she said referring to 
the murder charges 
garners mother sarah said im not worried its not what 
im going to get i turn it over to god its what gods going to 
get im going to keep on hoping 
conviction by the district court jury of violating garners 
civil rights could have meant a maximum life sentence for each of 
the lawmen 
it was the right result said john seale ladners attorney 
this was the most hardfought case ive ever been involved in 
the lawmen refused to talk to reporters friday as did the 
jurors 
special prosecutor john hannah said he would take the case to 
the us justice department and urge them to file indictments of 
conspiracy to violate garners civil rights 
this could sound like sour grapes from the losing side but i 
do have a right to seek justice elsewhere the results were 
unfair hannah said 
garner 34 of florien la and two others were arrested on 
suspicion of drunken driving christmas night just outside hemphill 
he allegedly was beaten unconscious that night in the county jail 
the lawmen took the stand during the twoweek trial and denied 
they struck the fatal blows 
prosecutors relied on testimony by alton maxie who was arrested 
and jailed along with his brother johnnie maxie and garner that 
ladner hit garner with a night stick on the head at least four 
times 
when ladner hit him loyal put his hand over his head alton 
maxie testified ladner caught him around the neck and pushed him 
out the door i heard loyal say i just wanted to call my 
wife they brought him back in and sat him up and just let him 
slide down the wall 
ladner acknowledged hitting garner once but said it was a 
glancing blow because garner threw up his arms to defend himself 
the chief said he did not know how garner received blows to both 
sides and the top of his head 
horton said garner was asked if he needed medical attention 
he said he didnt want to go anywhere with us or something 
like that horton testified 
maxie said he heard more beating sounds after the officers took 
garner out of the jails drunk tank

the federal government has successfully 
prosecuted only two cases of workplace safety violations over the 
past eight years despite tens of thousands of deaths on the job 
every year a new study says 
there are at least 100 good criminal cases every year where 
deaths have occurred and where employers knowingly and willfully 
violated federal regulations said joseph kinney executive 
director of the national safe workplace institute a yearold 
nonprofit group in chicago that conducted the study 
an estimated 60700 workers die on the job each year the 
institute said 
while the us justice department has had only two successful 
prosecutions since 1980 california successfully prosecuted 112 
cases in that time under that states operation of a federally 
funded safety program the institute found california has since 
dropped its program and supporters are seeking its reinstatement 
justice department spokesman patrick korten defended the federal 
system 
when we get a criminal case that has prosecutorial merit we 
prosecute it he said friday 
it is often more appropriate to file and to prosecute such 
cases in state court where you have a wider variety of laws that 
apply 
kinney said 50000 of the estimated 60700 workplace deaths each 
year were from disease most often cancer 
but there are 10000 traumatic deaths each year and 
another 18 million injuries and 60000 or those result in 
permanent disability he added 
people think of these kinds of things as being part of our 
labor past kinney said but this is our present 
the federal occupational safety and health administration is 
empowered to seek criminal sanctions against employers in 28 states 
who violate workplace safety standards that agency also is charged 
with monitoring programs in the remaining 22 states which choose 
to operate federally funded workplacesafety programs themselves 
california stopped administering its program in july 1987 when 
republican gov george deukmejian vetoed state funds used to 
supplement the operation labor groups have filed lawsuits and put 
an initiative on the november ballot seeking reinstatement of the 
program 
the study noted that after osha cites an employer for safety 
violations the case is reviewed by seven different offices before 
the justice department will bring it to trial 
instead of trying to determine how justice can be done 
theyre trying to disqualify these cases there isnt even one 
fulltime staff member assigned to these cases kinney said 
but osha spokesman frank white said the agencys civil penalties 
can be effective as an example he pointed to a 42 million fine 
against bath iron works in maine for safety and health violations 
we think its not the best use of our resources to chase 
corporate outlaws white said 
the study concluded that the federal governments reluctance to 
bring criminal prosecution has discouraged state and local 
prosecutors from pursuing safety violators

the wife of jailed black 
leader nelson mandela says she wants to focus attention on other 
victims of apartheid and has spurned a government offer to visit 
her husband on his 70th birthday 
winnie mandela decided to spend the day at home on monday rather 
than accept the offer of a sixhour visit with her husband who has 
been jailed for 26 years said family lawyer ismail ayob 
she has taken this decision as both she and mr mandela have 
never sought any special privileges for themselves he said 
friday 
the visit would have been the longest reunion with mandela 
leader of the outlawed african national congress since he was 
jailed in 1962 for leaving south africa illegally and inciting 
unrest 
while serving a fiveyear term mandela was sentenced to life in 
prison in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the 
government 
the government confirmed the cancellation of the visit 
ayob said the mandelas decision was meant to focus attention 
on the tens of thousands of mothers sisters and daughters and to 
the fathers brothers and sons who have never had the privilege of 
spending the day with their loved ones who remain in incarceration 
for their opposition to apartheid 
the government meanwhile has been cracking down on various 
events scheduled to honor mandela on his birthday 
activists in cape town said 11 blacks organizing a sports 
festval to commemorate mandelas birthday were arrested friday 
raising to about 25 the number of people detained in the area in 
connection with the planned birthday celebrations 
the government also has banned a huge charity concert planned 
for sunday near soweto johannesburgs main black township the 
action was denounced as silly vindictive and spiteful by helen 
suzman a parliament member for the antiapartheid progressive 
federal party 
organizers in cape town said they would go ahead with a concert 
on sunday planned for an indoor hall to avoid restrictions on 
outdoor gatherings but an indoor concert planned in durban also 
has been banned by police 
sports events are not covered by the restrictions the cape town 
activists said they did not know why police had detained the 
organizers of a sports festival scheduled for today in guguletu a 
black township 
the western cape teachers union said its posters promoting a 
mandela tribute friday night had been covered by stickers saying 
cancelled hundreds of anonymous pamphlets criticizing mandela 
appeared overnight in the mixedrace township of athlone 
under security regulations organizers of all outdoor events 
except sports activities and funerals must obtain permission from 
authorities 
huge celebrations are also planned in london and amsterdam this 
weekend to commemorate mandelas birthday 
numerous foreign governments meanwhile issued messages friday 
in honor of mandelas birthday 
among those calling for mandelas release were west german 
chancellor helmut kohl british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
and canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
foreign ministers of denmark finland iceland norway and 
sweden sent a message to mandela on friday saying they would press 
for his release 
the italian government in pretoria said it imported a copy of 
bernardo bertoluccis film the last emperor because mandela 
wanted to see it the prison service said it had not been informed 
of any plans to deliver the film to pollsmoor

a woman who was raped inside her home by an 
intruder while police searched outside and left says the city 
knowingly operated a flawed 911 telephone emergency system that 
resulted in the attack 
the woman and her husband made the charge in a lawsuit filed 
against the city friday in allegheny county common pleas court 
their names were not disclosed 
the lawsuit contends the city failed to adequately screen and 
train employees for its 911 communications center and failed to 
correct procedures so deficient that the continued maintenance of 
them was outrageous and shocking to the conscience 
the womans attorney jan swensen said the city advised 
residents to dial 911 for emergency help and then failed to provide 
that help 
city public safety director glenn cannon and city solicitor dan 
pellegrini declined to comment on the lawsuit 
after an investigation cannon ordered 911 operators to pass on 
detailed information about emergency calls and to question police 
about how they resolve calls before officers are permitted to leave 
the scene 
cannon also reprimanded five police officers and three 911 
workers for failing to respond properly 
the woman told police she dialed 911 at about 1115 pm on feb 
2 after she heard someone trying to break into her secondstory 
apartment in the citys point breeze neighborhood 
while she was talking to the 911 operator officials said a man 
with a knife burst into the room and tore the telephone cord from 
the wall the 911 operator thought the woman had hung up officials 
said 
when the intruder saw police walking around the house and heard 
them knocking on her door he threatened the woman and said he had 
nothing further to lose and that he might as well rape her the 
woman said 
police searched outside for several minutes and left 
authorities said they didnt break down the womans door because 
911 operators failed to tell them that the woman reported the 
breakin herself and that the call abruptly broke off authorities 
said 
police have made no arrests in the attack

would face no harm if they returned

languages

nicaraguas ambassador to the united states 
who left washington just minutes before a state department deadline 
for his departure called his expulsion arbitrary and illegal 
carlos tunnermann left washington on a commercial flight five 
minutes before the expulsion order took effect at 530 pm edt 
friday 
about a dozen police officers were at the airlines gate at 
national airport to make sure tunnerman got on the plane two 
police cars followed the jet out to the runway and waited for it to 
depart 
he spent friday night in mexico city and was expected to leave 
today for managua 
at an airport news conference here tunnermann said his 
government was right to expel us ambassador richard melton but 
he said the reagan administration which expelled him in 
retaliation had no basis for expelling nicaraguan diplomats 
if we expelled melton we had reasons to do so because melton 
was interfering in internal affairs of nicaragua in the spirit 
of destabilizing our government he said 
he said melton attended meetings where participants discussed 
replacing the nicaraguan government 
my work was absolutely diplomatic we do not question the 
decision of the united states even though it was unjustified but 
in the case of melton we were right he said 
nicaragua expelled melton and seven other us embassy officials 
on monday a day later the reagan administration gave tunnermann 
and seven other embassy officials 72 hours to leave the country 
the administration also described the action as retaliatory but 
said tunnermann and the military attache maj pedro sampson had 
abused their privilege of residence 
tunnermann called that a very vague charge 
for tunnermann it was an unhappy ending to his 3year stay in 
washington in the somewhat lonesome role as the sandinista 
governments chief defender in washington 
tunnermann served both as ambassador to the united states and to 
the organization of american states and he maintained throughout 
that the united states had no right to expel him citing guarantees 
contained in the oas charter 
shortly before leaving on his flight to mexico city he took a 
parting shot at the administration insisting that the us action 
threatened the independence of the oas and saying his government 
would seek recourse through oas legal channels 
in mexico he said the united states should have given the oas a 
list of the alleged abuses but did not 
today its nicaragua tomorrow another country he said 
this is the height of arbitrariness 
nicaraguas expulsions of us diplomats came the same day the 
government closed a roman catholic radio station and an opposition 
newspaper and one day after government troops violently suppressed 
an antigovernment demonstration 
us house and senate condemnation of sandinista leaders for the 
crackdown on the opposition has revived the possibility that 
congress could approve new military aid for the usbacked rebels 
known as contras 
a temporary ceasefire with the rebels has been in effect since 
march 21 but talks to extend it into a permanent agreement 
collapsed in june each side accuses the other of violating the 
truce 
in managua foreign minister miguel descoto issued a statement 
saying tunnermann would remain as nicaraguas ambassador to the oas 
until this controversy can be elucidated 
tunnermann repeatedly challenged us officials to present 
evidence of the wrongdoing he and sampson were alleged to have 
engaged in the administration has said it was under no obligation 
to provide details 
tunnermans wife rosa said she and the couples seven 
children will remain in the washington area where they have a home 
in a fashionable section of suburban maryland

a federal judge has ruled that a sunken 17th 
century spanish galleon found a year ago belongs to the state of 
florida not the two men who have claimed it and up to 500000 in 
booty 
under fridays ruling peter leo and dominic addario of jupiter 
would have to surrender the treasure including 2500 gold and 
silver coins a large silver bar dated 1652 a small gold bar and 
several cannons 
the treasure worth 300000 to 500000 will remain in the 
hands of a conservator while the ruling is appealed us district 
judge stanley marcus banned any other salvagers from taking 
artifacts from the wreck in jupiter inlet 
the two men who have incorporated under the name jupiter wreck 
inc discovered the sunken galleon last summer buried in the sand 
about 100 yards off the inlets beach 
last august the state department of natural resources sought an 
injuction to stop them from exploiting the galleon the department 
said the wreck belonged to the state and the men needed a license 
to remove anything 
leo 33 and addario 39 represented by attorney david horan 
who also worked for key west treasure hunter mel fisher in a score 
of similar actions countered by seeking an injuction barring the 
state from interfering with them but marcus ruled against them 
horan said marcus decision contradicted previous rulings by 
chief us district judge james lawrence king in a fisher case and 
that he would appeal it to the 11th circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta

thousands of tourists began their summer holidays 
by camping at british airports as the aftereffects of a greek air 
traffic controllers strike wreaked havoc on already busy summer 
flight schedules 
on friday the average delay in flights from britain to the 
mediterranean was six hours with some flights delayed up to 48 
hours at manchesters airport in north england and up to 24 hours 
at londons gatwick airport 
director keith mack of the civil aviation authority said he 
expected the congestion at british airports to worsen this summer 
with possible further job action by air traffic controllers in 
spain and france 
and it wont be any better next year unless improvements are 
made in europes outdated air traffic control system he said 
with the kinds of traffic levels weve been experiencing its 
going to be several years before we have a system which can deal 
with that sort of increase he said in a british broadcasting 
corp television interview 
mack said that the improved british economy rainy summer 
weather and a the proliferation of cheap holiday tours were also to 
blame for the extended delays 
suddenly people had more money to spend on holidays abroad and 
they all wanted to head for the sun he said 
the number of travelers passing through british airports 
increased by 30 percent from 1981 to 1987 during the same period 
londons heathrow and gatwick airports rose to become the two 
busiest in europe 
at gatwick which handles most of britains charter flights 
spokesman dave hurst said most travelers were well behaved despite 
the long delays 
theyve taken the phlegmatic brit approach and realize the 
airport staff are not to blame he said 
up to 4000 travelers camped out in gatwick each night in the 
past week they consumed daily 10000 pints of beer 20000 cups of 
tea and coffee 6000 sandwiches and 10000 breakfasts according 
to gatwicks catering manager peter ransome 
hurst said gatwick brought in extra cleaning staff extended 
restaurant hours and employed magicians clowns and jugglers to 
entertain children 
manchesters ringway airport began turning people away friday 
saying it had reached full capacity passengers at luton airport 
north of london began returning home after flights were delayed 
indefinitely 
flights from britain to southern europe now must get permission 
from seven different air traffic control towers this multinational 
system is likely to grow more cumbersome as the number of european 
flights is expected to double by the year 2000 
outdated air traffic control facilities were also cited as the 
cause of a series of nearcollisions involving british planes 
flying south in february 
to deal with these problems transport ministers of the 
12nation european economic community met in june and agreed to set 
up an emergency telephone link between europes five busiest air 
centers london frankfurt paris rome and madrid and a crisis 
center coordinating all west european air traffic during the four 
or five busiest weekends of the summer 
the greek air traffic controllers strike ended wednesday but 
french controllers are threatening job action monday in a dispute 
over pay conditions and pensions 
spanish controllers have staged flow control actions 
limiting the number of flights which can land in spain and have 
also threatened work stoppages to protest bad conditions

lettermans wife will undergo psychiatric treatment before a judge 
considers for the third time whether she is competent to face 
charges that she broke into the tv talk show hosts home and stole 
his car 
superior court judge james bingham on friday ordered 36yearold 
margaret ray of no known address to return to court oct 14 for 
reconsideration of his second finding that she is incompetent to 
stand trial 
bingham ordered the woman to undergo six months of psychiatric 
treatment in the state hospital where she has been a patient for

the judge ruled last month that although ray could understand 
the charges she was unable to assist in her defense she has been 
held in lieu of 25000 bail and treated at fairfield hills 
hospital 
bingham allowed another psychiatric examination after ray 
objected to the first report by a doctor who found she was 
delusional

told bingham on friday that he also believed ray couldnt assist in 
her defense 
fogle testified that ray would be helped by six months of 
psychotherapy and lithium treatments 
police allege that ray broke into lettermans new canaan home in 
may while he was out of town and lived there for several days 
before stealing his car 
she was arrested may 22 at a lincoln tunnel toll booth in

couldnt pay the 3 toll 
ray told police she was lettermans wife and the boy was the nbc 
talkshow hosts son

asked police to drop the charges that afternoon she allegedly 
again broke into lettermans house ray faces two counts of 
seconddegree burglary and one count of firstdegree larceny

a frenchman killed aboard a greek cruise 
ship during an attack by gunmen was himself a terrorist the greek 
government said but people who knew him denied the allegation 
sources also said an arab passenger was arrested for possible 
involvement in the bloody assault on stunned passengers sunbathing 
on the city of poros cruise ship 
nine people were killed and 98 were wounded in mondays attack 
when men fired automatic weapons and hurled hand grenades at 
tourists when the ship was about 16 miles off the greek coast in 
the aegean sea 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said friday 
that an arab man was being interrogated at police headquarters in 
central athens about possible involvement in the attack they 
declined to give details 
claims of responsibility have been attributed to three groups 
but none of the claims could be authenticated 
one claim came in a letter purportedly sent by the jewish 
defense league to the greek embassy in the netherlands the 
staterun athens news agency reported today 
the letter claims the jewish extremist group staged the massacre 
to protest greeces support of the palestine liberation 
organization the agency said leaders of the group could not 
immediately be reached for comment 
in lebanon on wednesday a previously unknown group calling 
itself the organization of the martyrs of the popular revolution in 
palestine claimed responsbility 
earlier the islamic jihad organization purportedly claimed 
responsbility in a telephone call to a french radio station from 
cairo 
the greek government statement identified the slain frenchman as 
roland vigneron 23 and said he was involved in the attack 
the statement also said the government had not ruled out that 
another man identified as a terrorist mohammed zozad was among 
the dead 
it said police confirmed that the massacre was linked to a car 
bomb explosion that killed two men near the ships home dock about 
six hours before the attack the two were in the car when the bomb 
apparently went off by mistake 
both actions were carried out by the same terrorist group 
the statement said 
the government statement said eight witnesses identified 
vigneron as one of the terrorists it said he died of injuries at 
tzanneion hospital in piraeus a port near athens where the 
injured were rushed after the attack 
in paris french television said a frenchman named laurent 
vigneron died in the attack 
greek authorities spell foreign names phonetically in greek 
script because they are unfamiliar with the latin alphabet they 
apparently confused roland with laurent 
laurent vignerons parents confirmed he died of wounds at 
tzanneion hospital 
reached by telephone in mehunsuryevre in central france 
christine audejean the mother of laurent vignerons girlfriend 
said she could not believe he was a terrorist she said her 
daughter annie accompanied vigneron on the cruise and is now 
missing 
weve known laurent for two years hes a very sweet boy very 
calm they were lovers leaving on a honeymoon they were going to 
get engaged the following week she said 
she said both were engineering students in france 
mrs audejean said vigneron was probably mistaken for a 
terrorist because he had dark hair and complexion 
the french foreign ministry said friday it was not aware of any 
evidence of vignerons involvement and asked greek authorities to 
provide an explanation 
police speculated that guns grenades and explosives inside the 
car that exploded were intended for hijacking the ship they said 
the terrorists may have been seeking freedom for mohammed rashid a 
palestinian jailed in greece for entering the country with a forged 
syrian passport 
rashid is wanted in the united states on murder charges and is 
accused of planting a bomb on a pan am jumbo jet in 1982 that 
killed one person and injured 15 
the city of poros was on a oneday trip through the saronic gulf 
when terrorists struck 
initial accounts said the attackers fled in a waiting speedboat 
later the gunmen were said to have jumped overboard and then 
rescued with other passengers

a ghoulish case in which prosecutors 
presented body fragments as evidence that an airline pilot murdered 
his wife and used a wood chipper to dispose of her corpse ended in 
a mistrial after a holdout juror refused to deliberate any longer 
juror warren maskell jr of preston adamantly refused to discuss 
the case of defendant richard crafts any further friday evening 
after 17 days of deliberations he also refused to heed a judges 
order to return to the courtroom so the case could be recessed 
until today 
a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said maskell was 
the lone juror who refused to vote for conviction 
superior court judge barry schaller who declared the mistrial 
friday night said maskell informed him i am sorry but after 
voting eight times in at least a week with the same results i 
cannot continue to deliberate in a clear and open mind i am truly 
sorry 
twelve people took an oath to do a job and 11 were willing to 
do so and one was not said the prosecutor states attorney 
walter flanagan 
the prosecutor said he was not ready to discuss whether he would 
retry crafts 50 of newtown for the alleged murder by unknown 
means of his danishborn wife helle he previously had indicated 
he would if necessary seek a second trial 
defense attorney j daniel sagarin said his client was 
disappointed by the outcome saying crafts wanted a verdict so he 
could go back to his children 
crafts a pilot for eastern airlines and parttime police 
officer was arrested jan 13 1987 after body fragments 
including splintered pieces of human bone and a partial tooth were 
found by state police 
mrs crafts a 39yearold stewardess was last seen nov 18 
1986 
the case was believed to be the first murder prosecution in the 
state without a body and lawyers said the deliberations were the 
longest by a connecticut jury in a criminal case in recent memory 
the jury declared itself deadlocked friday afternoon but 
schaller instructed jurors to continue deliberating 
the judge said maskell left the jury room and refused to return 
schaller quoted maskell as saying im out of there and im not 
going back in there 
escorted by sheriffs deputies maskell left the courthouse 
before the other jurors his son said late friday his father would 
have a comment in a couple days 
prosecutors said they didnt know how crafts allegedly killed 
his wife but they presented evidence they said showed he used a 
chain saw and wood chipper to dispose of her body 
more than 100 witnesses and 650 exhibits were presented over 53 
days of the trial which was moved to this southeastern connecticut 
city from western connecticut because of pretrial publicity 
much of the states case was based on circumstantial evidence 
crafts was the last person to see his wife alive and she had 
planned to start divorce proceedings after a private detective she 
hired found evidence of his marital infidelity 
the state conceded that its experts could only say with 
certainty that one body part a partial crowned tooth belonged 
to mrs crafts 
crafts told the jury he believed his wife was still alive

before 6 am said cmdr kendell pease spokesman for the onsite 
inspection agency set up under the treaty 
the treaty was signed last december by president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at their washington summit 
contacted on his car telephone en route to washingtons dulles 
airport with a second team traveling to longhorn army depot in 
marshall texas pease said the operations was moving like 
clockwork

making their site selection known at 6 am pease said 
were ready and were making it work he said

the us embassy said today it will resume the 
processing of thousands of soviets seeking refugee status in 
america but stranded in the soviet union because of a lack of state 
department funds 
many of the prospective refugees or their relatives in the 
united states will now be asked to help pay their way to america 
the embassy said 
the us missions action announced in a statement will begin 
monday it follows criticism in washington of the state 
departments decision to delay the emigration of soviets granted 
refugee status because of a surge in their numbers and a shortage 
of money 
that decision has left hundreds of soviets in limbo they had 
sold their homes quit their jobs and traveled to moscow in the 
expectation of receiving quick permission to leave for the united 
states 
on friday a group of 23 us senators and nine house of 
representatives members called for revoking the suspension of 
refugee processing begun july 1 which us diplomats in moscow say 
has frozen the applications of about 3400 people 
in a letter the senators told president reagan this decision 
sends a terrible signal to those seeking freedom all over the 
world and could give the soviets the opportunity to claim that it 
is america and not the soviet union which is impeding emigration 
last month the embassy gave permission to a record 2063 
soviets 94 percent of them armenians to emigrate to the united 
states that was more than in all of fiscal year 1987 which ended 
sept 30 
us ambassador jack matlock told reporters last week that 
processing of the refugees was scheduled to resume on oct 1 the 
beginning of the 1989 fiscal year when more funds would become 
available 
but the saturday statement said that starting monday the 
embassy will interview immediately the approximately 400 applicants 
who came to moscow in the initial few days after july 1 so they can 
proceed to rome for entry processing to the us 
the mission said it would work with the other 3000 soviets to 
seek every possible means to facilitate their timely departure for 
the united states

coming under intense scrutiny 
the 27yearold edmonton oilers star is regarded as a national 
treasure a mr clean who acts as ambassadorwithoutportfolio for 
the sport he loves he makes an estimated 25 million annually 
given his squeaky clean stature its not surprising his 
edmonton marriage to an actress from missouri who posed for the 
march 1987 issue of playboy magazine has set the nation abuzz 
what i cant figure out is why he chose to marry a playboy 
bunny when he could have the pick of the crop complained one 
letter to the edmonton sun 
but wedding guest gordie howe a hockey hall of famer described 
the bride as ok if you like them young and beautiful and the 
toronto star heralded the royal wedding of a canadian prince and 
his starlet lady 
canadians have learned all about miss jones former flings with 
tennis pro vitas gerulaitis and actor bruce willis while gretzkys 
former girlfriend vickie moss was tracked down in los angeles for 
comment 
rumors got so out of hand that gretzky intervened to assure 
reporters he did not pay more than 200000 for miss jones 
threecarat wedding ring honeymoon plans do not include lear jets 
and private yachts and guests will drink canadian champagne not 
dom perignon 
we want it to be as firstclass as possible but it is not a 
milliondollar wedding like everyone says were from sensible 
families said gretzky who didnt deny buying his bride a 
207500 rolls royce as a wedding gift 
miss jones 27 is from bridgeton mo and has appeared in the 
films american anthem the flamingo kid a chorus line 
and police academy 5 
to accommodate the 700 guests the roman catholic church waived 
its rules to permit the anglican groom and methodist bride to wed 
in st josephs basilica the citys largest church 
miss jones flew in from los angeles with her 40000 wedding 
gown her sister jeannette is her maid of honor while former 
edmonton oiler goalie ed mio is best man 
the couple met in 1982 when gretzky was a guest on the tv disco 
show dance fever where miss jones was a dancer

national hockey league in 1979

committee of the soviet parliament will meet this week it was 
believed the topic of discussion would be the dispute involving

becoming more tense with the approach of july 18 the day when a 
meeting of the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr is 
to be held the news agency reported 
armenians make up more than threequarters of nagornokarabakhs 
160000 residents they have said the presidium session will be 
crucial to their decision on whether to continue a general strike 
and street rallies pressing their demands for the regions 
annexation 
tass said a general strike continued and food was in short 
supply in nagornokarabakh 
the delawaresized region has been part of mostly moslem 
azerbaijan since 1923 armenians are mostly christian

demand but azerbaijani lawmakers refused to give their consent

democrats on the verge of nominating michael 
dukakis for president see themselves picking a dependable but dull 
fellow who has done well at his current job but lacks some 
experience he would need for the new one 
a handful of them suggest that the 5foot8inch governor of 
massachusetts could use lifts in his shoes 
results of an associated press survey of delegates to the 
democratic national convention found that while many give dukakis 
credit for his performance as governor a roughly equal number are 
concerned about his lack of experience in national and 
international affairs 
i suspect they the republicans will make much of foreign 
policy issues but ive never seen an election decided by foreign 
policy issues said william winpisinger a delegate from maryland 
and president of the machinists union 
what happens at home is what counts and hes got a good 
record on that winpisinger said 
more than 1900 delegates about 46 percent of the 4161 total 
responded to the opinion survey and 583 gave dukakis high marks 
for his record and experience as governor his skills as a manager 
and his ability to deal with economic issues 
however 553 said he is weak in the areas of foreign policy 
national issues and in dealing with congress 
one hundred cited dukakis for his honesty 
and i think thats going to be a big issue in this campaign 
the reagan administration sleaze factor said montana state 
rep dan harrington a dukakis delegate dukakis has shown hes 
above all that 
asked to name dukakis strength elana stampfer an oregon 
delegate replied his managerial skills everyone thinks thats 
boring but i think its exciting to have someone who will actually 
be able to run government well 
boring is one of the words that pops up repeatedly in 
delegates assessments of dukakis 
of those responding to the survey 288 said he was dull or 
described his personality as cold aloof humorless or arrogant 
how can i say this politely the one weakness is he is 
boring said gloria johnson a jackson delegate from maryland 
he lulls his audiences to sleep said robert williams a 
jackson delegate from oregon you start out listening to him but 
by the middle of his speech youve forgotten what hes said 
it also appears according to the delegates that being called a 
liberal is more a curse than a compliment 
seventysix classified the liberal label as a weakness while 
just three said it was a strength 
on a more personal level hes short said chris fairchild 
a dukakis delegate from michigan i really honestly think thats 
going to be trouble for him how many presidents do you know that 
were short 
becoming a nominee for president of the united states may give 
dukakis a largerthanlife stature 
when i saw him this week hed taken on an aura he didnt have 
six months ago said sue pate a dukakis delegate from texas 
so you didnt notice him being short

secretary of state george p shultz 
said saturday he is confident that pressure from the soviet union 
and china will deter north korea from staging terrorist attacks at 
the olympic games 
shultz on the seventh stop of a ninenation asian tour also 
reaffirmed washingtons commitment to the security of south korea 
i think everybody will be exerting their influence in a 
positive way i feel that the olympics will go off in good style 
shultz told reporters shortly before landing in the south korean 
capital after leaving beijing 
on the eve of shultzs arrival the united nations command 
accused north korea of trying to undermine the olympics by making 
war threats and contriving tensions 
your attempts to contrive an atmosphere of danger on the 
korean peninsula in a transparent attempt to undermine the 
upcoming seoul olympics will not succeed said us rear adm 
william t pendley chief unc delegate to the military armistice 
commission 
olympic security is one of the issues shultz is expected to 
discuss when he meets president roh taewoo and other government 
and opposition leaders this week ussouth korean trade and 
americas continuing military role in south korea also are slated 
for discussion 
shultz said that in preparing for the olympics the south 
koreans were alert to the placing of surfacetoair missiles within 
range of seoul and the recent introduction of an advanced soviet 
warplane into north korea 
according to washington the soviet union has provided north 
korea with sam5 missiles and a small number of advanced mig29 
jets 
but shultz stressed that moscow has promised that the north 
koreans would not interfere with the olympic games north korea is 
boycotting the games because its demand to be a cohost was 
rejected 
shultz said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze recently 
gave assurances to president reagan he said flatly something 
like we know the north koreans well and i can assure you that 
there will be no underline no terrorist attacks made during the 
olympics 
shultz said he had received similar assurances from the chinese 
who like the soviets will compete in the olympics 
local newspapers said shultz may propose opening a trade 
representative office in north korea on condition that the 
communist state promise not to disrupt the olympics 
the newspapers quoting unnamed government sources said south 
korea would request prior consultations in case the united states 
took such action 
shultz reaffirmed washingtons commitment to the defense of 
south korea and said ussouth korean relations are in excellent 
shape the united states has about 42000 troops in south korea 
under a mutual defense pact 
our security cooperation remains the bedrock of our 
relationship shultz said let there be no misunderstanding 
for more than 40 years americans have been prepared to commit their 
lives and their resources to the security of the republic of 
korea 
shultz may run into some criticism in discussing ussouth 
korean trade relations of course there is a certain resentment 
here for the push that we are making to open their markets he 
said but so be it well keep pushing because after all we have 
our own interests too 
he noted that south korea was americas seventhlargest trading 
partner and said economic openness such as a greater market 
access for competitive products was essential to a healthy global 
economy 
the united states has urged economically booming south korea to 
liberalize its regulations on usimports including cigarettes 
beef and agricultural commodities to offset a trade deficit of 
about 10 billion

like jesse jackson himself the 
rainbow express caravan changed often on the long trip to 
atlanta running cool and then hot long stretches of highway 
punctuated by fiery speeches in steaming churches 
as michael dukakis and top democratic officials listened for 
words of confrontation or conciliation from jackson he rolled 
southward for three days from chicago 
in a way the bus trip was a throwback to the days of candidates 
barnstorming slowly across the country instead zipping from region 
to region in jet airplanes but there was also the flavor of 1988 
with more than 100 reporters transmitting stories from the caravan 
stories that showed up within hours or even minutes in newspapers 
or on television 
friday night from his nashville stop jackson appeared live on 
abctvs nightline 
the caravan itself was a wildcard assortment of buses station 
wagons and bristling security vehicles 
at the head sat jackson mainly apart from the hustle and 
bustle he traveled with advisers and his children allowing 
reporters and photographers to join him for 10 minutes or so at a 
time occasionally waving at photographers who pulled alongside in 
cars 
his was the bestappointed bus equipped with a kitchen 
television microwave oven and staff area 
none of the buses was jammed and on one leg of the trip two 
reporters rattled around one of the buses as the only passengers 
clearly length of the caravan photographed from news helicopters 
each time it pulled from a city was important 
the caravan left few ripples as it wound its way to atlanta 
construction workers stared curiously and occasionally waved at the 
buses festooned with banners and posters as they entered each 
city small knots of bystanders gawked but the real crowds waited 
in the churches where jackson held all of his public events 
it wasnt until saturday that campaign officials moved to expand 
the caravan hoping to assemble a big motorcade to give jackson a 
hornhonking crowdpleasing entry into the conventions host city 
when announced the caravan had been billed as a sort of rolling 
juggernaut picking up steam as it headed toward the national 
nominating convention and capped with a triumphant arrival in 
atlanta with thousands of supporters picked up along the way 
all that changed the first night 
were not picking up passengers jackson said because of 
travel time were not encouraging additional passengers 
this is not atlanta for show business this is atlanta for 
serious business said jackson as he launched one of the great 
rolling media expresses 
instead jackson spent his time in a complex and subtle 
longdistance link with certain nominee dukakis a kind of dance 
that played itself out as the buses rolled from the innercity 
ghetto of chicago to the rolling hills of tennessee 
for most of the trip there were about 120 reporters 20 or 30 
assorted backers and a dozen or so delegates including tom 
moynahan an indianapolis real estate agent who also happens to be 
a delegate for dukakis 
let me make my loyalties clear up front he said adding he 
wanted to express appreciation for jackson registering new 
democratic voters an important thing for someone running for local 
office like moynahan 
moynahan gradually blended into the rolling city he doggedly 
stuck with the group fighting his way through mobs of reporters to 
register at hotels and make his way into churches to hear jackson 
speak 
his station wagon tailed the convoy and he was a required 
interview for reporters searching for a new angle 
the long deliberate procession kept the focus squarely on 
jackson just as dukakis might have been expected to be moving to 
the center of the spotlight 
at stops along the way jackson ran sort of an update service 
for reporters on his latest contacts with democratic leaders 
but there were also the stops at innercity churches in several 
cities giving jackson a chance to shine in his fiery preachers 
role before excited audiences at such times the caravan turned 
from its insular self 
in nashville thousands gathered to hear jackson in a tiny 
baptist church that seated only a couple of hundred 
as crowds pressed against the door and reporters fought their 
way through fire officials abruptly locked the doors insisting 
legal capacity had long since been exceeded 
inside the church a wall of television cameras separated 
parishioners from the pulpit and one of the bigger cheers of the 
evening came when church officials announced that television camera 
operators couldnt stand on pews and had to lower their cameras 
the crowds loyalties were clear when tennessee sen albert gore 
jr was introduced to scattered boos though he later drew cheers 
with talk of defeating reagan reaganism and bush 
when he promised to campaign throughout the fall with jackson 
for the ticket of dukakis and texas sen lloyd bentsen the man who 
got the no 2 slot jackson sought there ws silence 
when jackson said i want to win and i want you in the house 
came down

the teamsters election of a veteran old 
guard east coast leader to succeed jackie presser as its 
president exposes a major rift in the nations largest union at a 
time of its greatest peril 
whatever his faults the 61year old presser in his five years 
as the teamsters president had tried to counter an image of the 
nations largest union as an adjunct of organized crime 
he launched an aggressive public relations campaign and opened 
the union at least partially to more public view he also moved 
the teamsters back into the mainstream of the labor movement 
directing its reaffiliation with the aflcio last october after 30 
years of warfare between the two bodies 
presser died on july 9 and some see the election this past week 
of william j mccarthy 69 of boston over pressers handpicked 
heir secretarytreasurer weldon mathis as a repudiation of those 
efforts mccarthy was picked by a 98 majority among the 17 members 
of the teamsters executive board 
his victory according to several sources in the union was 
orchestrated by teamster power broker joseph trerotola of new york 
who at 70 is the most powerful vice president and head of teamsters 
operations in 15 east coast states 
the old east coast guys won over the progressives said one 
source close to the teamsters adding that the battle is likely to 
be refought at the teamsters next convention in 1991 two years 
from now youre going to start seeing people campaigning like 
crazy 
neither trerotola nor mccarthy has ever been indicted 
and mccarthy is described by other union leaders in the boston 
area as being stubborn headstrong and sometimes a maverick but 
free of ties with known mob leaders 
hes a hardnosed expletive said one official with 
another union speaking on the condition of anonymity but hes 
clean nobodys ever had any words about him and he has a great 
rapport with all of the other unions in boston 
trerotola also is described as clean but trerotola 
developed the nickname joe shrugs within the union because he 
feared dealing with corruption in some teamster locals in new york 
and new jersey according to steven brill author of a 1978 
bestselling book on the union the teamsters 
presser himself under indictment at the time of his death on 
charges of embezzlement and labor racketeering had pushed mathis 
62 of atlanta as his successor in the event of his death 
mathis and walter shea a veteran teamster bureaucrat who had 
directed the unions headquarters staff during the reigns of 
presser and his two predecessors roy williams and frank 
fitzsimmons had the closest ties of any of the unions national 
leaders with the aflcio 
both were instrumental behind the scenes in the teamsters 
decision last october to reaffiliate with the labor federation 
three decades after being expelled on charges of corruption and 
aflcio officials were known to be enthusiastic about either one of 
them succeeding presser 
according to sources within the teamsters mccarthy and 
trerotola both initially opposed rejoining the aflcio although 
mccarthy said upon his election that he intends to do everything 
possible to work as a team with the federation 
spurring mccarthys victory according to several sources was a 
belief that pressers focus on raising the unions political and 
public profile as a strategy for fighting the corruption 
allegations had backfired 
as evidence of that they cite pressers indictment in 1986 even 
though government documents indicate that fbi agents may have 
encouraged him to perpetuate a payrollpadding scheme on which the 
charges are based in their use of him as a government informant 
and despite pressers open courtship of the reagan 
administration for five years the justice department just two 
weeks ago filed a civil lawsuit seeking to impose a government 
trusteeship over the entire union 
the governments preparation of the suit had been leaked to 
reporters a year ago hints from prosecutors that other aflcio 
unions would be targeted next was a major impetus behind the 
teamsters reaffiliation last fall 
mathis had been considered a shooin for succeeding presser 
particularly after the unions constitution was rewritten in 1986 
to name him as interim president instead of trerotola if presser 
was incapacitated 
just before undergoing brain surgery in may presser passed 
those reins to mathis naming him interim president for 120 days 
however at about the same time 64 percent of the voting 
rankandfile members had just cast ballots against the national 
master freight agreement the unions largest contract negotiated 
under mathis leadership with the interstate trucking industry 
mccarthy who openly opposed the contract said friday that he 
will try to reopen it and get the wishes of our membership 
but he also indicated a reluctance to allowing the public much 
more of a view into the teamsters internal decisionmaking 
i dont think its any of your business he told reporters 
seeking the breakdown of the vote on his election i got enough 
votes to become the president

with both expectations and leverage in short 
supply the reagan administration is weighing new approaches for 
dealing with the increasingly defiant leftist government of 
nicaragua 
administration officials believe that us ability to influence 
events in nicaragua was drastically reduced following the cutoff of 
military aid to the contra rebels last february it is now groping 
for alternatives none of which appear promising 
for lack of other options the administration has been turning 
increasingly to diplomatic action for dealing with the sandinistas 
secretary of state george p shultz discussed the issue during his 
visit to central america two weeks ago and plans a return trip on 
aug 1 
but some administration officials believe that diplomatic 
pressure in the absence of military pressure will not have any 
noticeable impact on the sandinistas 
still shultz apparently believes he must continue the struggle 
no matter how long the odds he is attempting to find a way in 
which the united states and the four central american countries 
friendly to the united states guatemala el salvador honduras 
and costa rica can devise a common strategy for pushing the 
sandinistas toward democracy 
president reagan has expressed support for a new contra aid bill 
introduced by sen robert dole rkan but there appears to be 
little appetite among democrats especially in the house to take 
any action that would jeopardize the tenuous truce in place since 
march the bill calls for 271 million in humanitarian aid and 20 
million in lethal aid 
hostility toward the sandinistas has grown in the congress since 
the expulsion of eight us diplomats from managua last week and 
there is now faint hope among contra aid supporters that this and 
other nicaraguan actions may produce some defections in congress in 
support of the administration 
congressional distaste for recent nicaraguan crackdowns on press 
freedoms and civil liberties was demonstrated in lopsided votes in 
both houses this past weeks on resolutions condemning the 
sandinistas 
despite staggering economic problems reflected in a fourdigit 
inflation rate the sandinista government remains militarily strong 
and its behavior recently has fulfilled the worst fears of 
administration officials 
as officials see it the lack of military pressure on the 
sandinistas has emboldened them to shelve the tentative steps they 
had taken toward creating democracy and to move aggressively 
against the us diplomatic presence in managua 
ambassador richard melton who was expelled along with seven 
colleagues this past week believes nicaraguan authorities took 
that action as a means of intimidating opposition leaders who saw 
the us diplomatic presence in managua as a source of 
encouragement 
under meltons guidance the embassy placed high priority on 
maintaining contact with and on providing psychological support for 
the antisandinista leadership 
as a further blow to the opposition the sandinistas have shut 
down an independent newspaper and radio station and arrested more 
than 40 persons who participated in an antigovernment 
demonstration last sunday 
nicaraguan authorities maintain that the two media outlets had 
violated the law and that last sundays protest at nandaime turned 
violent at the instigation of the protestors 
according to us officials the sandinistas now feel they can 
move with impunity against their domestic enemies because the 
government has little to fear 
they believe that the sandinistas have largely written off the 
united states as a potential threat reasoning that the prospects 
for renewed contra military aid are slim this is partly because 
the administration now in its waning months and weary from 
previous battles lacks the will to continue the fight with the 
same passion as before 
but sen james sasser dtenn echoed the sentiment of many 
lawmakers when he said that recent events have enhanced the 
prospect of renewed military aid 
i still do not believe that military aid to the contras is the 
best policy he said but if the sandinistas continue to 
reaffirm that they are antidemocratic if they continue to be 
repressive if they adhere to the marxistleninist doctrine they 
will give us no alternative but to consider refunding the contras 
and with military aid

leaders of the sevennation warsaw pact 
ended their summit today by calling for a mutual eastwest 
moratorium on increases in military spending and talks before the 
end of the year on reducing conventional arms 
the communist allies also signed a statement expressing concern 
about the effects of the arms race on the environment 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev departed for moscow several 
hours after the meeting ending a sixday visit to poland other 
warsaw pact leaders also were returning home today 
in a joint communique released at the end of a twoday summit 
warsaw pact leaders said they support negotiations with nato on 
freezing and reducing military expenditures and on announcing on 
principles of reciprocity a moratorium on increasing military 
spending for one to two years 
the staterun news agency pap said the statements signed 
saturday contained important new ideas that serve to 
consolidate positive european and world tendencies in questions of 
disarmament and making them irreversible 
deputy foreign minister henryk jarosek was quoted by pap as 
saying the statement on reducing conventional arms and troops has 
great significance the countries of the warsaw pact spoke 
for starting new disarmament negotiation during 1988 he was 
quoted as saying 
jarosek said at a later news briefing that huge stockpiles of 
weapons and massive troop deployments on both sides make it 
difficult for further improvement in the international climate and 
negatively affect socioeconomic development of all states 
jerzy nowak another foreign ministry official said the summit 
talks were more open that in past warsaw pact meetings 
the style is definitely different in the sense of rejecting 
some ceremonial approaches and the repeating of long empty formulas 
which were used very often in these bodies before he said 
on friday the first day of the summit romanian leader nicolae 
ceausescu urged the other leaders to press for new talks on banning 
battlefield nuclear weapons from europe 
as gorbachev and the other east europe communist party chiefs 
conferred friday gorbachevs wife raisa traveled to the former 
nazi death camp at auschwitz and paid tearful tribute to the 4 
million people who died there during world war ii 
conference host gen wojciech jaruzelski of poland speaking at 
a dinner attended by the leaders friday said the east bloc nations 
have launched a peace offensive 
pact members have recently put forward a number of valuable 
original initiatives in the area of arms control he said 
their active character and importance were underlined today at 
this meeting 
ceausescu in a dinner toast published by the staterun news 
agency pap called for new eastwest talks on the subject of 
tactical nuclear weapons that remain outside the scope of the new 
ussoviet treaty to scrap intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
the treaty covers missiles with ranges between 300 and 3000 miles 
the treaty was a step toward disarmament but the dangerous 
course of events has not yet been radically changed toward detente 
cooperation and peace the romanian leader said 
he proposed that talks on complete removal of any 
shorterrange nuclear weapons from the european continent should be 
started as soon as possible along with planned talks this fall 
on reducing conventional forces 
jaruzelski whose toast was distributed to reporters pointed to 
proposals that gorbachev made in a speech monday to the polish 
parliament as an example of new longrange thinking 
gorbachev urged a renewed effort to break a deadlock with the 
north atlantic treaty organization over reducing conventional 
forces in europe he suggested a paneuropean conference and a 
withdrawal of some warsaw pact air forces in exchanges for the 
wests giving up plans to deploy 72 f16 fighterbombers in italy 
the proposals already have been rejected by the united states 
the leaders met in the stately council of ministers palace where 
the treaty of warsaw setting up the alliance was signed in 1955 
other leaders taking part in the summit were erich honecker of 
east germany todor zhivkov of bulgaria karoly grosz of hungary 
and milos jakes of czechoslovakia

election campaign is viewed abroad

here is some of what newspapers abroad had to say last week on 
gov michael dukakis choice of sen lloyd bentsen as his 
democratic running mate in the november presidential election 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the montreal gazette independent mr dukakis choice seems 
astute even though he now will have to bend over backward to make 
sure jesse jackson and his supporters stay on board mr bentsen 
brings quite a dowry to this marriage of convenience he gives the 
prospective democratic ticket extensive experience in washington 
something mr dukakis lacks he is a noted fundraiser he may help 
mr dukakis attract voters on the right he brings geographical 
balance to the democratic ticket and he will give george bush 
who has texan connections of his own a fight for that important 
states votes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the globe and mail of toronto national independent mr 
bentsen was the better choice for a winning ticket he reassures 
conservative democrats and liberal republicans that mr dukakis 
is not an ideological liberal and this large group of crossover 
voters is critical to mr dukakis prospects 
mr jackson is too volatile a personality to be that close to 
the presidency despite his admirable and potent campaign on the 
progressive wing of the democratic party 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
financial times independent mr bentsen brings 
indisputable qualifications if no fire to the ticket eighteen 
years a senator and never forget the man who defeated george 
bush to make it to the upper chamber he has the washington 
experience mr dukakis lacks 
the real reason why the lot has fallen on mr bentsen is 
because of where he is from texas may be a law unto itself but it 
is the third largest state of the union the democrats must carry 
it and the formidable bensen machine is likely to be more effective 
with him on the ticket his mere presence alongside mr dukakis 
is explicitly designed to tie vice president george bush a 
neotexan down to a part of the country he thought he had in his 
pocket and to a state which once rejected him at the hands of a 
man called bentsen 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the times of london independent mr dukakis may be tainted 
with massachusetts liberalism but mr bentsen gives the appearance 
of comfortable southern conservatism 
mr dukakis is accused of haste and brashness mr bentsen at 
67 has the solid values of age while mr dukakis has no 
experience of national political office mr bentsen is a skilled 
manipulator of the levers of washington power mr dukakis is 
ethnic mr bentsen is patrician 
it is clear that mr dukakis intends to rely on his running 
mate for delivering those southern democrats who voted for mr 
reagan to that end his reassuring prodefense and probusiness 
attitudes will help the fact that he is a selfmade millionaire 
from insurance will not hurt he has always been a stout defender 
of oil interests and that will stand him in good stead in oklahoma 
and louisiana where the oil industry has been badly winded by the 
price decline

excelsior of mexico city independent why choose bentsen 
in reality its a very lucid political maneuver no candidate from 
the northeast can win a presidential election in the united states 
without the support of two fundamental states texas and 
california perhaps with this step by dukakis geopolitics might 
become more favorable to the luck of the democrats or at least the 
domination of texas where bush has an undeniable weight will be 
disputed

although a conservative senator bentsen is credited with a 
strong civil rights record and although he may have ideological 
differences with the main protagonist on the democratic ticket he 
is said to be politically shrewd and competitive and he commands a 
strong political organization in texas that can be brought to bear 
in the south 
in other words he can still be an asset to governor dukakis 
in the crucial presidential campaign

the strong opposition showing in mexicos 
general election demonstrated how badly the institutional 
revolutionary party miscalculated the people it has governed for 
nearly 60 years 
the pri failed to gauge the depth of discontent brewing in a 
devastated economy and it underestimated an increasingly 
sophisticated nation 
spoiled and overconfident after years of unchallenged rule and 
landslide victories allegedly padded by fraud the pri was put 
on the spot in the july 6 elections 
mexicans used their votes to deliver a sharp kick to the party 
shins 
they gave pris presidential candidate carlos salinas de 
gortari the smallest margin of victory in party history just 
over 50 percent and forced pri to give up senate seats for the 
first time 
the pri which has never lost a presidential gubernatorial or 
senate race since it was founded in 1929 suffered unprecedented 
losses in congress although it kept control of both houses 
with four senate seats however the leftist opposition now has 
a guaranteed forum for the next six years and both the right and 
the left will have a greater voice in the lower house 
the pri although it came out of the elections bruised and 
divided is clearly still running mexico salinas takes office dec 
1 
future elections will reveal the strength shape and staying 
power of the opposition 
the pri was created by survivors of the 19101921 revolution 
who vowed to bring stability and social and economic justice to 
mexico but while mexico changed radically over the decades the 
pri didnt keep up 
after world war ii mexico entered a period of unparalleled 
development industries the recently nationalized oil fields and 
petrochemical production expanded tourism flourished the economy 
grew 5 percent to 6 percent every year from the early 1960s to 1980 
only one out of four mexicans could read and write in 1940 now 
eight out 10 are literate forty years ago almost threequarters 
of the people lived in the countryside about 60 percent are now 
city dwellers 
mexico city has become the largest metropolitan area in the 
world the city that was home to 31 million people in 1950 grew to 
nearly 20 million almost a quarter of the nations estimated 85 
million people 
sustained postwar progress and the oil boom of the 1970s 
created a growing middle class based on the american model 
the pri however remained a party of powerhungry peasants 
laborers and bureaucrats an institution run by the sons and 
grandsons of its founders 
the oil boom triggered a wild government spendingandborrowing 
spree and highlevel corruption 
when oil prices fell in 1982 the economy came unraveled 
since then the average mexicans spending power has been cut in 
half last year inflation hit a record 1592 percent 
now it takes a full days minimum wage to buy two pounds of 
meat many families go without 
the bust left a society of frustrated consumers watching with 
envy as television families in trendy clothes enjoy the latest 
products which are out of reach of most mexicans 
the public ire grew this year under an economic austerity 
program that enabled mexico to keep up payments on its 104 billion 
foreign debt but further eroded mexicans buying power 
the pri began realizing it was in trouble as the election 
approached but it underestimated how many people would vote 
against the system 
when returns began coming in stunned party insiders realized 
the pri had lost mexico city to cuauhtemoc cardenas the candidate 
of a leftist coalition who talked about social compassion 
national pride and a moratorium on debt payments 
cardenas and the rightist opposition candidate manuel j 
clouthier of the national action party or pan took almost half 
the vote even though results may have been distorted by fraud 
the election left salinas the architect of the economic 
austerity plan without a solid mandate for change 
throughout the campaign salinas insisted he wanted an honest 
victory that would give him an undisputed green light to modernize 
the party and the economy 
instead his victory was not clean enough or big enough to 
silence either the partys traditional faction or the public voices 
of economic discontent 
he has a party in shambles he has no program left he has no 
constituency all he has is a presidency and an empty one at 
that said adolfo aguilar a mexican political analyst and 
carnegie endowment fellow 
salinas will have to tread carefully among his plans to 
challenge the bloated bureaucracy the corrupt unions the blatant 
patronage system the political bosses and the privileged elite he 
has inherited 
his closest associates say privately that the outcome of the 
vote was more credible than in previous mexican elections when the 
pri won with huge majorities 
they also say the sobering result a message from the 
electorate that the old ways simply are no longer acceptable 
gives them the mandate to unleash reform within the party 
the strong opposition showing could force salinas to fashion 
economic policies with an eye to the social consequences and to 
their impact on ordinary people 
i think the oppositions fate rests on cardenas aguilar 
said he has to make people believe that the election was 
worthwhile even if he lost if cardenas fails to lead the pri 
will regain its old confidence

jesse jackson said today he hopes to 
resolve his differences with democratic presidential nomineetobe 
michael dukakis but his campaign picked up petitions needed to 
place jacksons name in nomination for vice president 
jackson campaign representatives picked up the nominating papers 
for both president the office for which jackson has campaigned 
all year and vice president the post he wanted after dukakis 
clinched the top spot a convention official confirmed today 
the official in the office of the secretary of the convention 
asking that her name not be used said the representatives picked 
up the forms friday 
jackson said later that night that he would not put his name in 
nomination for the vice presidency but left open the possibility 
someone else might 
im not putting my name into nomination but if it were to 
happen it certainly is an option that would be within the rules of 
the convention it would not be breaking precedent jackson said 
on abc news nightline 
for anyone to place his name in nomination a candidate must 
sign his approval under party rules 
we should be expected to use every rule that we can to advance 
our cause and expand our democratic party i think were going to 
have a lively convention but it should be a wholesome and healthy 
one jackson said on abc 
jacksons convention manager ron brown today declined comment 
about the vice presidential question and would not say if it was 
discussed at a latenight meeting of jacksons top advisers with 
the candidate in nashville tenn 
top staffers from the two camps were to meet after jacksons 
splashy arrival in atlanta this afternoon to discuss reaching an 
agreement 
jackson again said he is not angry at dukakis for picking texas 
sen lloyd bentsen for vice president that he wants to negotiate 
his role in the party for the fall and beyond 
that is unresolved conflictim simply saying we are not 
connected jackson said i hope within the next few days we 
will be connected because we want to winwe must have 
partnership and we must be included 
he also laid out some of his public demands of dukakis while 
saying they must be satisfied in private 
i suppose what we are looking at now is where does the 
progressive wing fit in the democratic national committeee where 
does it fit in the campaign where does it fit in that circle of 
people who will be making decisions about policy and priorities if 
we win where does it fit in transition he said 
as he nears atlanta jackson has been reaching out to party 
notables campaigning friday night in a packed nashville church 
with former rival tennessee sen albert gore jr 
we need the politics of inclusion that jesse jackson has 
preached all over this country gore said jesse jacksons 
campaign is a step toward hope 
rebuffed by dukakis in his bid to use former president jimmy 
carter as a mediator jackson said hed called new york gov mario 
cuomo who understands the steps that are now necessary 
however jackson said i have no idea what role cuomo might 
be able to play 
jackson had suggested that carter could serve as an intermediary 
between the two camps but dukakis rejected that idea earlier 
friday 
jackson simply shrugged and said no comment when asked about 
dukakis stance 
i see this tension were going through as normal and 
healthy jackson said that should be the purpose of atlanta 
to move us from battleground to common ground 
at this stage of several previous democratic conventions we 
were not even at this stage jackson said 
with the opening of the democratic national convention just days 
away jackson has made it clear throughout his trip that hes yet 
to settle his differences with dukakis but at the same time hes 
been sending signals hes willing to do so continuously hinting of 
the benefits he can bring to the democrats next fall 
matters of substance have not yet been resolved jackson 
said in fact he said stalled platform negotiations havent 
resumed after being jolted earlier in the week by the naming of 
texas sen lloyd bentsen as dukakis choice for the vice 
presidential nomination 
brown jacksons convention coordinator and chief negotiator 
with the dukakis staff told the los angeles times friday that 
jackson is insisting he be granted a partnership in the fall 
campaign that includes participation in the decisionmaking 
process 
if jacksons objectives are not met brown warned that even if 
jackson supports the democratic ticket jacksons constituency is 
not going to feel motivated to come out and vote for the ticket in 
large numbers 
i have not encouraged or discouraged anyone about what they 
should do on thursday jackson said referring to the final day 
of the convention when the vice presidential nomination is 
scheduled 
on the other hand jackson and dukakis have talked twice in 
recent days and agreed to a diplomatic initiative where top 
advisers from the two camps meet tonight

with both expectations and leverage in short 
supply the reagan administration is weighing new approaches for 
dealing with the increasingly defiant leftist government of 
nicaragua 
administration officials believe that us ability to influence 
events in nicaragua was drastically reduced following the cutoff of 
military aid to the contra rebels last february it is now groping 
for alternatives none of which appear promising 
for lack of other options the administration has been turning 
increasingly to diplomatic action for dealing with the sandinistas 
secretary of state george p shultz discussed the issue during his 
visit to central america two weeks ago and plans a return trip on 
aug 1 
but some administration officials believe that diplomatic 
pressure in the absence of military pressure will not have any 
noticeable impact on the sandinistas 
still shultz apparently believes he must continue the struggle 
no matter how long the odds he is attempting to find a way in 
which the united states and the four central american countries 
friendly to the united states guatemala el salvador honduras 
and costa rica can devise a common strategy for pushing the 
sandinistas toward democracy 
president reagan has expressed support for a new contra aid bill 
introduced by sen robert dole rkan but there appears to be 
little appetite among democrats especially in the house to take 
any action that would jeopardize the tenuous truce in place since 
march the bill calls for 271 million in humanitarian aid and 20 
million in lethal aid 
hostility toward the sandinistas has grown in the congress since 
the expulsion of eight us diplomats from managua last week and 
there is now faint hope among contra aid supporters that this and 
other nicaraguan actions may produce some defections in congress in 
support of the administration 
congressional distaste for recent nicaraguan crackdowns on press 
freedoms and civil liberties was demonstrated in lopsided votes in 
both houses this past weeks on resolutions condemning the 
sandinistas 
despite staggering economic problems reflected in a fourdigit 
inflation rate the sandinista government remains militarily strong 
and its behavior recently has fulfilled the worst fears of 
administration officials 
as officials see it the lack of military pressure on the 
sandinistas has emboldened them to shelve the tentative steps they 
had taken toward creating democracy and to move aggressively 
against the us diplomatic presence in managua 
ambassador richard melton who was expelled along with seven 
colleagues this past week believes nicaraguan authorities took 
that action as a means of intimidating opposition leaders who saw 
the us diplomatic presence in managua as a source of 
encouragement 
under meltons guidance the embassy placed high priority on 
maintaining contact with and on providing psychological support for 
the antisandinista leadership 
as a further blow to the opposition the sandinistas have shut 
down an independent newspaper and radio station and arrested more 
than 40 people who participated in an antigovernment demonstration 
last sunday 
nicaraguan authorities maintain that the two media outlets had 
violated the law and that last sundays protest at nandaime turned 
violent at the instigation of the protestors 
according to us officials the sandinistas now feel they can 
move with impunity against their domestic enemies because the 
government has little to fear 
they believe that the sandinistas have largely written off the 
united states as a threat reasoning that the prospects for renewed 
contra military aid are slim this is partly because the 
administration now in its waning months and weary from previous 
battles lacks the will to continue the fight with the same passion 
as before 
but sen james sasser dtenn echoed the sentiment of many 
lawmakers when he said that recent events have enhanced the 
prospect of renewed military aid 
i still do not believe that military aid to the contras is the 
best policy he said but if the sandinistas continue to 
reaffirm that they are antidemocratic if they continue to be 
repressive if they adhere to the marxistleninist doctrine they 
will give us no alternative but to consider refunding the contras 
and with military aid

spurred by a fatal fire in californias 
tallest building may 4 city council has voted to require 
sprinklers in about 350 highrises 
the 130 vote friday applies to older commercial and industrial 
buildings exempt from sprinkler requirements enacted in 1974 
council members also indicated they would act to require 
sprinklers in more than 100 older residential towers but said that 
measure would take time to develop because rentcontrol laws allow 
the costs of sprinklers to be passed on to tenants 
it could translate up to 150permonth rent increases said 
richard mccaughey a legislative analyst we dont want to put 
little old ladies out on the street 
the 62story first interstate bank building was having 
sprinklers installed when it caught fire one person died and 40 
were injured in the blaze that gutted 4 floors the building was 
not subject to the 1974 sprinkler ordinance under the new 
ordinance which applies to pre1974 buildings more than 75 feet 
tall or about seven stories owners would have three years to 
install sprinklers 
an automatic oneyear extension would be granted for buildings 
requiring major asbestos removal as part of the installation 
a bill in the legislature requiring sprinklers in highrises 
across the state would give owners more time to install the devices 
geoff ely executive director of the building owners and 
managers association of los angeles said he was disappointed by 
the councils action and is now pinning his hopes on the state 
legislation 
ely said his group isnt trying to stall but wants to make sure 
that when the sprinklers are installed they are quality systems put 
in by reputable contractors

pentagon investigators will be taking a close 
look at whether the uss vincennes detected radar signals emanating 
from the iran a300 airbus that it mistook for an f14 fighter and 
shot down military and industry sources say 
publicly available evidence suggests that the airbus was not 
using its weather or navigational radar which send out different 
signals than radar aboard an f14 and could easily have been 
distinguished by equipment aboard the vincennes according to 
pentagon officials 
if an f14 is using its target acquisition radar it is a very 
specific signal and one which you can easily identify pentagon 
spokesman dan howard told reporters on july 5 two days after the 
incident 
pentagon and industry sources said it would be common practice 
for either an attacking f14 or an airbus making the 175mile run 
in clear weather between bandar abbas iran and dubai in the 
united arab emirates not to turn on its radar 
the iranians know when they paint something with their 
target illumination radar that we can detect it and we can 
identify the target very specifically from that information 
howard said 
its not necessary to turn a lot of this equipment on if you 
know the location already from other sources he said you can 
wait until you actually release your ordnance 
the absence of a radar signal therefore would tell the 
vincennes officers nothing about the approaching plane but any 
radar signal originating from the iranian aircraft should have 
identified it as civilian or military 
a computer analysis of electronic data from the vincennes has 
been conducted in the united states and flown to bahrain in the 
persian gulf where a sixmember team headed by rear adm william 
m fogarty is investigating the incident 
pentagon officials have declined to discuss information 
uncovered by fogarty including whether the iranian aircraft was 
sending out radar signals 
a device known as a transponder aboard the airbus was sending 
one set of identification signals common to civilian and military 
aircraft as well as a signal unique to warplanes howard said 
and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william j 
crowe jr said that it was impossible for a ship to use its own 
radar to precisely identify an approaching aircraft a view shared 
by navy and industry officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the issue of whether the airbus was emitting radar signals is 
quite different however and the answer is not likely to be known 
publicly until the results of the fogarty investigation are 
released something that navy officials now say they do not expect 
until early or midaugust 
the vincennes and many other us warships in the gulf are 
equipped with a device known as a slq32 which can distinguish the 
signatures of radars radars that are used by commercial 
airliners are quite different from those used by military aircraft 
the exact differences are classified industry and navy sources 
said but generally military radars are far more powerful operate 
on different frequencies radiate farther and ping objects 
more frequently with radio waves than do commercial radars they 
said 
the slq32 manufactured by raytheon corp of massachusetts 
is a little like a fuzzbuster said one industry source it 
can spot a highway cop if he has his radar on but if he doesnt 
have his radar on you wont spot him 
the slq32 can be programmed to distinguish the signatures 
of various types of radar and one navy source said that even if 
the device were not programmed to make that distinction a skilled 
operator can tell the difference anyway 
howard in briefing reporters said that he did not know what 
the slq32 was saying aboard the vincennes all that stuff is 
on the tape and will presumably be examined by the inquiry 
the 80 f14s sold to iran in the 1970s by the grumman corp of 
long island ny were equipped with a radar system known as 
airborne weapons guidance 9 or awg9 a sophisticated tracking and 
targeting device manufactured by hughes aircraft corp iran is 
thought to have about 15 remaining f14s capable of flying 
the f14 does not carry additional radar systems which might 
send out signals that could be confused with those of an airliner 
according to industry officials 
the awg9 aboard the f14 includes the most powerful radar 
aboard any fighter airplane manufactured in the west sending out a 
10 kilowatt signal one knowledgeable industry source said it can 
track 24 targets at once at ranges of up to 200 miles while 
scanning for additional targets and can guide antiaircraft 
missiles to six targets simultaneously 
the a300 airbus that was shot down was equipped when it was 
sold to iran in 1982 with two radars that send out signals that 
are different from the awg9 according to an airbus spokesman the 
one radar a weather radar was made by bendix air systems inc and 
the other a navigational radar made by a manufacturer that airbus 
was not immediately able to identify

an auto safety group says it will decide 
whether to appeal a court ruling that upholds a government decision 
letting automakers put off until 1993 a requirement for passive 
safety belts on a cars passenger side if the driver is protected 
by an air bag 
essentially what the court did is put passenger occupants of 
cars equipped with driverside air bags in a position of a 
likelihood of harm when the driver will walk away from the crash 
joan claybrook head of public citizen said friday 
the national highway traffic safety administration had agreed to 
a request by the ford motor co that allows continued use of 
manual safety belts on the passenger side in cars that have 
driverside air bags 
the highway safety agency in issuing the ruling last year agreed 
with auto industry claims that more time was needed to develop air 
bag systems for frontseat passengers 
public citizen a washingtonbased public interest group 
claimed that the ruling postpones passive restraint protection for 
car passengers for four years and puts them in additional danger 
the us court of appeals on friday upheld the nhtsa decision 
throwing out public citizens suit 
jeffrey miller deputy administrator of nhtsa called the court 
decision good news for consumers because air bags will now be 
available sooner and in more cars 
miller said the decision creates an incentive for automakers to 
make driverside air bags available while working on developing 
systems that protect both drivers and frontseat passengers 
ford announced in june it will offer dual driverpassenger bags 
on lincoln continentals being introduced this fall for the 1989 
model year ford tempo and mercury topaz models have offered 
driveronly bags for several years 
chrylser corp said in may it was including driver bags as 
standard equipment in six models assembled after may 15 and would 
have them on all models by 1990 
porsche offers driverpassenger bags on one model and several 
other foreign companies offer bags to protect the driver 
an air bag is a device that inflates rapidly in an automobile 
collision protecting a drivers head and upper torso before it 
rapidly deflates 
the transportation department several years ago directed 
automakers to phase in passive restraints either air bags or 
belts that automatically wrap around a person entering a car with 
all cars to be equipped with the devices by the fall of 1989 
last years ruling which was upheld by the court friday 
postponed the requirement in the case of frontseat passengers in 
any car where the driver is protected by an air bag

republican john tower experienced at running 
against a democrat nominated simultaneously for the senate and the 
vice presidency says lloyd bentsens texas campaign threatens to 
become a bottomless pit people throw money in and a war chest 
for the democrats national ticket 
i think its going to really be a tight rope for him bentsen 
to walk says tower a former senator from texas its going to 
be pretty tricky business 
tower now an adviser to allbutcertain republican presidential 
nominee george bush says his camp has put lawyers to work on 
sifting through campaign finance regulations 
they will be quick to pounce on any violations of federal 
election law that bentsen makes as he mounts simultaneous campaigns 
for vice president and reelection to the senate tower said in an 
interview friday 
republicans worry that bentsens senate campaign could become 
a bottomless pit people throw money in and use for the 
presidential campaign he said 
before being selected by michael dukakis as his running mate 
bentsen had raised more than 5 million for his reelection bid 
more than any other senator 
he got more money from political action committees than any 
senate candidate seeking election this year 146 million by 
contrast dukakis refuses to accept pac funds 
tower had firsthand experience with a texas law that allows a 
candidate to campaign simultaneously for both offices as bentsen 
will do this fall 
tower ran against lyndon b johnson for the senate in 1960 
johnson was also running as the democratic nominee for vice 
president with john f kennedy 
johnson won both races and gave up his senate seat for the vice 
presidency a special election was called and tower won 
although johnson juggled both campaigns in 1960 tower says 
bentsen faces some knotty problems because of stricter federal 
election spending laws 
says one republican operative its a mine field he has to 
walk through anytime someone plows new ground youre bound to 
dig up a bone 
counters bentsen they tell me its been done before in 
texas 
jim boynton assistant executive director of the texas 
democratic party said bentsen is one of the most organized 
candidates youll ever run across and will now just put another 
step of organization in place 
he said republican vigilance of bentsens finances is prompted 
because they have to have some way to challenge the senator 
under texas law if bentsen were to abandon his senate race the 
democrats could not name a replacement candidate and the seat 
automatically would fall into republican hands 
it would go to his republican challenger rep beau boulter a 
twoterm congressman from amarillo who complains that bentsens 
dual candidacies are unfair and unethical 
tower sees other problems for bentsen some of the same people 
who support bentsen for senate also support bush and republican 
gov bill clements tower calls them pragmatic business types 
moreover tower said things have changed since he ran against 
lyndon johnson 
taking comfort in the 1960 analogy is taking comfort in a weak 
reed indeed he said 
texas republicans in 1960 were barely worthy of the gop name 
but today they hold the office of governor a seat in the senate 
10 in the house and dozens of posts in the legislature and control 
the courthouses in the states two largest counties dallas and 
harris tower said

imagine a brash astronaut thumbing his nose 
at the space agency and taking an old mercury spacecraft all the 
way to the moon then claiming it was a mistake and you get a 
glimmer of douglas wrong way corrigans feat 50 years ago 
my compass froze i guess i flew the wrong way corrigan 
claimed on july 18 1938 after making a forbidden new 
yorktodublin flight in a used curtissrobin monoplane on which 
hed spent 900 plus 90 for gas and oil 
he has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his 
home base of long beach calif after federal aviation authorities 
denied him permission to fly to ireland 
but corrigan now 81 and living in santa ana calif hinted in 
a telephone interview last week that his wrongway explanation may 
change after he flies again to dublin on sunday this time as an 
honored guest for three days of ceremonies commemorating his flight 
maybe this time over in dublin ill tell them another story 
well see he said thursday 
corrigans wrongway explanation sounded like pure blarney 
at the time he was made a lifetime member of the liars club but 
america and ireland loved it 
he was the overnight guest of the us ambassadors in dublin and 
london after he returned to new york by ship with his plane in a 
crate he was given a tickertape parade there was even a meeting 
with president franklin roosevelt 
a movie was turned out by rko studiosthe flying irishman 
starring corrigan as himself and there were magazine articles and 
an autobiography thats my story he estimated he grossed 
85000 from tours and speeches 
as punishment for his journey the bureau of air commerce 
forerunner of the federal aviation administration suspended 
corrigan from flying for five days those five days were served 
while he was still aboard ship on the way home 
whatever the true story corrigan had joined the ranks of his 
hero charles lindbergh and wiley post by making a solo nonstop 
singleengine crossing of the atlantic 
he also dispelled the notion that air feats were only for 
millionaires and wellfinanced aviators 
when corrigan was 20 he was a woodworker at ryan aircraft in 
san diego and helped build lindberghs spirit of st louis for the 
1927 new yorktoparis solo transatlantic flight 
corrigan got his pilots license the next year he bought a 
leather flight jacket just like lindys scraped his money together 
and studied navigation 
he bought his monoplane for 310 in 1931 and spent an 
additional 590 modifying it into a longdistance machine before 
the flight to ireland he flew from long beach to new york nonstop 
in 27 hours on july 78 
then the bureau of air commerce refused to grant permission for 
a transatlantic flight on grounds his plane loaded with 330 
gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil was 55 percent too 
heavy for a safe flight 
corrigan took off from new yorks floyd bennett field on july 
17 saying he was headed for long beach he landed at dublin 28 
hours and 13 minutes later 3150 miles from new york 
there had been a haze near the ground and when i was 500 feet 
high there was fog below the plane corrigan once said of his 
flight when i started to turn west i noticed the top compass was 
not working right due to the liquid having leaked out there 
was another compass down on the floor that i had set to fly a 
westerly course so now i turned the plane until the parallel lines 
matched and flew over the fog 
the wrong way 
he had no radio and his 1 wristwatch stopped the only modern 
instrument i had was a turnandbank indicator said corrigan 
who subsisted on fig and chocolate bars and some water during his 
flight 
i knew i wasnt in long beach when i dropped out of the 
overcast over dublin he said the place was greener and some 
of the houses had hay roofs 
corrigan will be the guest of aer lingus on sunday when the 
irish airline takes him to dublin aboard a boeing 747 
we offered him a firstclass seat but he said he would prefer 
to fly economy said aer lingus spokesman bill maxwell in dublin

michael dukakis quest for the white house has 
been a family affair from the start with his mother wife and 
children fanning out across the country on his behalf 
this week the dukakis clan comes to atlanta 
on hand at the democratic national convention when dukakis 
accepts the presidential nomination will be a team he proudly 
boasts of at virtually every campaign stop his mother euterpe 
his wife kitty her son john and their daughters andrea and 
kara 
the family has been an enormous wellspring of pride for 
michael said ira jackson a former aide to the massachusetts 
governor and a family friend for 25 years the campaign has been 
very healthy for the family and that is a fact that michael has not 
exactly been modest about lately 
joining the immediate family in atlanta will be another dukakis 
who has received a flood of media attention this year oscar 
awardwinning actress olympia dukakis the candidates cousin 
john 30 kittys son from a previous marriage began 
campaigning in 1964 for thenstate rep michael dukakis john was 6 
like his parents he graduated from brookline high school he 
tried his hand at acting but then went to work in 1985 as an 
assistant to sen john kerry dmass 
he married lisa thurmond in 1987 and they jointly ran the 
southern leg of dukakis primary campaign they are expecting a 
child 
andrea 22 is a 1987 graduate of princeton university where 
she majored in english she coordinated iowa field operations for 
her father and then headed to florida to help out there she will 
attend the convention but is taking a summer break from the 
campaign to be an intern at a new york publishing house 
kara 19 delayed beginning college for a year to help her 
fathers 1986 gubernatorial reelection bid she signed on with his 
presidential campaign in may 1987 working in the national 
headquarters and taking occasional campaign trips 
when she entered brown university in september 1987 kara 
organized a students for dukakis chapter on campus and spent school 
breaks campaigning she will return to brown in the fall 
kitty dukakis 51 a student and teacher of modern dance for 30 
years was forced off the campaign trail in june to have delicate 
spinal surgery to repair a disc condition doctors said might have 
been related to her dance career she is recovering ahead of 
schedule 
mrs dukakis presents strong contrasts with her husband who is 
more conservative in dress and demeanor but she has been at his 
side throughout his career and has made effective campaign 
appearances 
most dramatic was her disclosure last year that she had been 
addicted to amphetamines for 26 years until receiving treatment in 
1982 it has become a powerful part of her campaign antidrug 
message 
her father harry ellis dickson is associate conductor of the 
boston symphony orchestra and an occasional surrogate speaker for 
his soninlaw 
if dukakis moves to the white house his wife would be the only 
one to join him there but dukakis mother believes his family 
would set a good role model for the nation 
because he grew up in an ethnic family we kept the old values 
of discipline of respect for older people of family closeness 
said the everenergetic euterpe boukis dukakis 84 who has 
campaigned widely for her son her husband who was a general 
practitioner specializing in obstetrics and delivered 3000 babies 
in his career died in 1979 shortly after dukakis lost a bid for 
reelection 
in the governors first term in the mid1970s dukakis family 
life was the subject of jokes among oldtime statehous pols who 
made light of the governors insistence on going home for dinner 
and of stories about dukakis making sunday breakfast for the wife 
and kids 
john dukakis fondly recalls dinnertime political talk at the 
kitchen table where the governor has made many important political 
decisions over the years 
it was there that dukakis told his wife and john he would run 
for president and it was there that he huddled with his wife and 
top aides and decided to tap texas sen lloyd bentsen as his vice 
presidential running mate 
thats where he makes most of his important decisions 
political decisions said ira jackson who in addition to serving 
a stint as dukakis revenue commissioner also used to babysit his 
kids 
during three terms as governor dukakis has endeavored to keep 
his family affairs as private as possible he put off secret 
service protection for weeks out of concern over the disruptions it 
might cause them 
although the campaign has forced the dukakises apart more than 
ever before mrs dukakis believes it has had a positive impact 
when you have a close family situation my sense is that you 
tend to reach out when you are apart she said in a recent 
interview in a sense the campaign has brought us even closer

when she was young stella pretty 
sounding flute heard her elders tell of traveling many miles to the 
great red pipestone quarry to dig the soft red stone they used to 
carve their sacred pipes 
the dakota sioux woman journeyed on foot toward the quarry 
saturday with other sioux seeking return of the site from the 
government and protesting the sale of items made from the stone 
they believe represents the blood of their ancestors 
i cry because im seeing the sacred pipe at rummage sales 
said pretty sounding flute who lives in aberdeen sd they say 
its just a trinket 
the indians on saturday began the last leg of a monthlong 
450mile walk across south dakota to the quarry in this city of 
11690 eight miles from the south dakota border the quarry is now 
the pipestone national monument 
the sioux group says the sale of souvenir pipes jewelry and 
other items made of pipestone is a desecration 
other indians who make their living from the quarry contend that 
trading pipestone is a traditional practice that does not violate 
indian religion 
the controversy over the quarry stirs deep emotions in the 
indian people and involves issues of indian land rights cultural 
assimilation and religious freedom 
members of the yankton sioux tribe believe the quarry was 
illegally taken from them more than 60 years ago by the government 
the tribes council has asked the government and the pipestone 
indian shrine association a nonprofit organization that helps 
market pipestone items to give up the quarry 
the council contends that 1858 and 1892 treaties with the 
government guaranteed yankton sioux rights to the quarry 
the site was sold to the government in the late 1920s but the 
yankton sioux claim the sale was invalid congress designated the 
site a national monument in 1937 
herbert t hoover a university of south dakota history 
professor said the sale of the land legal or not should not 
affect the yankton siouxs rights to the pipestone the only major 
outcropping of its kind in the country 
the tribe may have given up the land but you have to 
understand that economically that tribe had hit rock bottom in 
the 1920s he said you can talk about legality all you want 
but you have to talk about morality too 
hoover said the government payment for the land was nearly 
329000 or about 150 to each member of the tribe 
vince halvorson superintendent of the monument said the 
national park service has no plans to relinquish the monument or 
curtail sale of pipestone items 
i think its strictly an issue between the two indian 
factions halvorson said as long as theres nothing illegal 
and its a practice thats been going on since weve been here 
well keep on doing what were doing 
the shrine association also has maintained distance from the 
dispute betty zorich the groups business manager declined 
comment on the issue 
halvorson said about 130000 people visit the monument each year 
and about 100 people including craftspeople earn a living 
directly from the quarry only indians can dig at the quarry 
chuck derby a sissetonwahpeton sioux pipemaker from pipestone 
said he does not believe selling pipes is a desecration 
our feeling is that weve been doing this kind of work for 
several generations he said we were taught by our elders to 
do this you just cant take a pipe down to the store today and 
say i want 20 worth of groceries you have to exchange the pipe 
for money to buy your groceries 
indians involved in the walk said they dont want put other 
indians out of work 
we do not want to close the quarries down said wesley hare 
jr a yankton sioux wed like to see that if they take this 
stone they use it for what it is meant for that is the basis of 
our tribes spirituality

michael dukakis intends to use the democratic 
nominating convention to launch his presidential campaign with a 
call to end the borrow and spend prosperity of the reagan years 
that he says masks great uneasiness across america about the future 
after flying to the convention in atlanta on sunday with his 
designated running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen dukakis will use 
the fourday celebration of his candidacy to dramatize his economic 
theme by going beyond the customary convention appearances to 
campaign among local residents at a factory gate and elsewhere 
that will be the central issue of this campaign an economic 
future that creates good jobs in every part of this country 
dukakis said in a preconvention interview in the governors office 
of the massachusetts statehouse 
after the convention dukakis and bentsen will leave atlanta 
together for what campaign manager susan estrich said would be a 
coasttocoast campaign trip with a first stop in texas 
that inaugural trip by the new democratic ticket will include 
a good many rallies built on the excitement which we think is 
going to come out of the convention 
dukakis was spending the hours before his departure trying to 
deal with a state budget deficit that offered republicans an 
opportunity to challenge his image as a tough manager who has 
balanced state budgets while holding the line on taxes 
the picture of the nations economy offered by dukakis will 
contrast sharply with the view put forth by vice president george 
bush his certain republican opponent 
republicans cite an unemployment rate that is half what it was 
in december 1982 and inflation and interest figures far below what 
they were in the final year of the presidency of democrat jimmy 
carter 
we can build on the stable recordsetting economic pace of 
the reaganbush years we can continue to pursue peace through 
strength or we can head down a road already traveled said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas after leading a gop 
delegation to the democrats convention city 
despite the improving economic statistics republican pollster 
richard wirthlin has said that since december 1986 his monthly 
surveys have found a majority of americans saying the country was 
headed in the wrong direction 
there is great uncertainty out there dukakis said why 
the great uncertainty 
the american people know you cant build a strong economic 
future on a credit card you cant borrow and spend borrow and 
spend and borrow and spend your way to prosperity 
as for the improving economic statistics dukakis said those 
numbers averages mask all kinds of problems 
bentsen refers to a swiss cheese economy in which the 
general prosperity is pocked by bad times 
thirtytwo percent unemployment in starr county texas was 
an example cited by dukakis 
he also blamed reagan administration antitrust policy for 
tolerating takeover artists circling all sorts of healthy 
companies all over this country as soon as they make an 
acquisition 600 or 700 people are out in the street or more 
over a trillion dollars worth of debt which our kids and grandkids 
are going to have to pay is no way to run a railroad 
estrich described the convention as a time when the 
opportunities to communicate through the media are enormous so 
well be spending plenty of time trying to take advantage of those 
opportunities because in mike dukakis we have a candidate who has 
just burst onto the national scene 
for the first time say dukakis aides the democrats are 
recruiting top talent from the world of commercial advertising to 
work with political media experts a practice common in gop 
campaigns for years 
one of the people recruited to help dukakis is ed mccabe who was 
responsible for the frank perdue slogan it takes a tough man to 
make a tender chicken

michael dukakis and jesse jackson talked about smoothing over 
their preconvention quarrels but jacksons forces picked up 
nominating petitions that could be used to challenge the selection 
of texas sen lloyd bentsen for the no 2 spot on the democratic 
presidential ticket 
as jacksons rainbow express bus caravan rolled toward 
atlanta it remained anyones guess whether his supporters would 
attempt to disrupt the convention or fall in behind the 
dukakisbentsen slate 
publicly jackson and dukakis edged away from a confrontation in 
atlanta with jackson saying he harbored no acrimony or 
hostility toward the massachusetts governor 
however jackson campaign representatives picked up the 
nominating papers both for president the position he lost to 
dukakis and for vice president the job he wanted as a consolation 
prize jackson said he would not put his name in nomination for the 
vice presidency but left open the possibility that someone else 
might 
im not putting my name into nomination but if it were to 
happen it certainly is an option that would be within the rules of 
the convention it would not be breaking precedent jackson said 
on abcs nightline 
dukakis the certain democratic presidential nominee said he 
wants jackson to be a player in party affairs i want him 
involved i want his staff people involved the massachusetts 
governor said in boston 
the wrangling between dukakis and jackson remained solidly at 
center stage just two days before the opening of the party meeting 
at the omni center 
putting the best face on developments mike mccurry the 
spokesman for the democratic national committee said 
negotiations between the two campaigns are going very very well 
and that gives us all a great deal of optimism as we prepare for 
the start of our convention 
he said paul kirk the partys chairman has been involved in 
these discussions and asked me to assure all of you things are 
going swimmingly he declined to say what was being discussed 
but said actual negotiations over platform differences have not 
resumed 
as jacksons bus caravan headed toward a welcoming ceremony in 
atlanta this afternoon dukakis went to his statehouse office in 
boston arriving at 830 am to oversee the legislatures final 
work on a fiscal 1989 budget 
were going to wrap things up dukakis said and two hours 
later the legislature did just that completing a marathon 
23hour session 
dukakis planned to study the 1175 billion budget and sign it 
in a ceremony sunday before leaving for the convention democratic 
and republican lawmakers said he would have to veto at least 150 
million in the package to bring the states budget into balance 
for his part jackson the runnerup in the primaries said his 
supporters must be integrated into the party structure 
it means our constituency must be involved in the democratic 
national committee and in state committees it means defining roles 
for those constituents in the campaign jackson said if i am 
to have responsibility in that campaign i must have a role 
commensurate with that responsibility 
dukakis and jackson agreed to have their top aides meet in 
atlanta tonight to discuss differences 
meanwhile former president jimmy carter toured the convention 
center today surrounded by the noise of hammering and sawing as 
workmen put finishing touches on camera platforms and a railing in 
front of the speakers platform 
carter played down the likelihood of convention friction 
generated by jackson 
i think he will be adequately included carter said the 
inevitability is that they will work out any differences well 
come out of here with a united party 
i think the conversations yesterday between dukakis and 
jackson and their staffs show that the problems are being worked 
out carter said 
while jackson arrives in atlanta later today dukakis has put 
off his arrival until sunday the eve of the conventions opening 
dukakis planned a quick stop in washington sunday afternoon to pick 
up bentsen a senator from texas before the two headed on to 
atlanta 
george bush certain to win the republican nomination to face 
dukakis in the general election was heading to wyoming today for a 
4day fishing trip with his pal and political mentor james a 
baker iii who is expected to give up his job as treasury secretary 
to run the bush campaign 
bush does not plan to let the democrats have the limelight 
exclusively next week the vice president will come out of 
seclusion wednesday and hit the campaign trail competing for 
attention on the final two days of the democratic convention 
differences between jackson and dukakis have dominated the 
democrats preconvention picture since dukakis announced tuesday 
that bentsen would be his running mate jackson and his supporters 
were infuriated that they learned of bentsens selection from 
reporters and not from dukakis 
however with the convention fast approaching the words of 
anger were losing their edge on friday 
we simply cannot win without each other jackson said at a 
news conference in louisville ky we can only win with each 
other it is in our distinct advantage to find common ground 
jckson whose staff had broken off negotiations with dukakis 
aides called the governor on the telephone saying later the two 
have no acrimony and hostility but only policy matters to 
resolve 
i see the tension were going through as normal and healthy 
jackson said

the arena was a bad omen for next week

reporters and camera operators 
dan lee assistant executive officer of the convention took the 
georgia native on a tour of the facility that will host the first 
national convention in his home state

seats are so tightly packed together that some people had to turn 
sideways to walk between the rows talking to reporters as he went 
carter stood at the podium where he will speak on monday night a 
wire rope ladder reaching to the ceiling dangled behind him 
the former president who spends some time now working on 
refurbishing homes for poor americans talked with the carpenters 
who are hammering together a lastminute addition to the podium a 
low walkway just off the floor 
rosalynn carter choose to stay away from the crush from the 
start 
as the tour of the floor ended the former president looked

officials who claimed he was privy to state secrets was met at 
logan international airport by family members and us political 
figures who worked for his release 
i can tell you that im infinitely grateful to mr hammer that 
brought me to you as a magician in a fairy tale charny said 
hammer who said he had appealed directly to soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev on charnys behalf said this has been a 
difficult case i feel it has been a privilege for me to assist 
i think its another example of the improving relations 
between our countries said the 89yearold chairman of 
occidental petroleum corp hammers friendly ties to the soviet 
union go back to vladimir lenin

has what is believed to be a benign tumor on his neck that must be 
removed he recently suffered a heart attack

the democratic national convention could provide 
a golden opportunity for massachusetts democrats interested in 
succeeding michael dukakis as governor 
without doubt politicians will be politicking at a 
convention rep chester g atkins chairman of the state party 
and head of the states convention delegation said when asked if 
there would be gubernatorial maneuvering this week 
if dukakis wins the presidency lt gov evelyn murphy would 
take over and would be running as the incumbent in the next regular 
election in 1990 dukakis hasnt said whether he would seek a new 
term that year if he should lose the presidential race 
atkins said lobbying this week will be very very subtle 
i think youll see quiet diplomacy said the twoterm 
congressman who until recently was himself considering running for 
governor to replace dukakis people first and foremost want to do 
what they can to get dukakis elected 
secondly this is a very very sophisticated audience youre 
dealing with theyre not unaware of all the rituals of political 
courtship and anybody who goes into the courtship ritual outside 
of the mating season wont be well received atkins said in a 
preconvention interview last week 
the mostmentioned democrats for the office will all be here for 
the convention

walruses but the noise of civilization may be driving them away 
the puffing snorting hissing mammals heave their two tons of 
bulk from the bering sea and poke their way with their huge tusks 
into the crowd each seeking a spot to rest between seven to 
10day feeding expeditions their favored places for hauling 
themselves out of the water are called haulouts 
the pacific walruses here and in lesser numbers at the six other 
islands of the walrus islands state game sanctuary are partly 
protected by the weather and the location which make this a 
difficult and expensive place to visit 
the nearest town is 33 miles by charter boat summer weather is 
characterized by wind rain and high waves that make approach by 
floatplane or small boat hazardous 
but with increased commercial bottomfishing and the prospect of 
oil exploration and development in salmonrich bristol bay all 
that isolation and privacy may fade and that has some professional 
walrus watchers concerned 
walrus are pretty sensitive to disturbance said lloyd 
lowry a marine mammal specialist with the alaska department of 
fish and game in fairbanks 
theres more than a little concern that the noise caused by 
the fishery has influenced the haulout people on the island say 
they sometimes can hear the radios on the bridges of the boats 
the game technicians on round island this summer polly hessing 
and judy brandt said they counted as many as 180 boats in the area 
during a peak fishing period in may 
although the vessels were outside the twomile limit around the 
sanctuary they made enough noise to force the women to close the 
windows in their cabin so they could sleep 
the walrus population on round island varies considerably from 
year to year 
in the mid1970s we had as many as 15000 animals there 
said ken taylor a state biologist in dillingham in the last two 
years the herd has gone down it was 4400 last year and about 
4500 now the difficult thing is there are so many reasons for the 
numbers to go up and down 
changes in the weather variations in the food chain and 
increased noise are believed to affect the number of walruses 
summering on round island 
two years does not a trend make but we are becoming 
concerned lowry said walrus are fairly traditional about 
where they haul out so are sea lions they walrus came back from 
virtually no animals in the 40s to peak counts in the late 70s 
but there are several other places they could go and we dont 
know if the herd is simply splitting up or what its doing 
while the males are piled up on beaches as far south as kodiak 
island and yakutat bay the females and their young remain with the 
pack ice north of the bering strait and into the arctic ocean 
weve got a lot of haulouts on the alaska coast that are empty 
now and i think because of boat traffic said taylor 
thirty permits a day are available for people wishing to visit 
round island access is restricted to a narrow corridor fronting a 
grassy campground 
although walruses get top billing the treeless island also 
supports nearly 450000 seabirds primarily common murres 
blacklegged kittiwakes cormorants parakeet auklets horned and 
tufted puffins and gulls red fox are unafraid of people and often 
share trails with campers 
the pacific walrus herd is believed to comprise some 234000 
animals a return to its 18th century levels after commercial 
hunting severely depleted its numbers 
taylor said the soviet union is more protective of its walrus 
herd 
on the soviet coast aircraft are held to 10000foot minimums 
and boats restricted to 16 miles he said it may be because of 
those more severe restrictions that more pacific walruses are 
hauling out there

irans oil minister appealed to 
oilproducing countries saturday to lower their output to bolster 
collapsing oil prices 
gholamreza aqazadeh singled out kuwait saudi arabia and the 
united arab emirates in chastising members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries for ignoring an agreement on 
production restraints 
oil producing countries whether members of opec or not have 
to arrive at an understanding among themselves aqazadeh said in 
an interview carried by the islamic republic news agency 
countries which place obstacles in the way of this objective 
would be responsible for the deteriorating situation on the oil 
market he said in the interview monitored in nicosia 
oil prices dropped in recent weeks to their lowest levels since 
1986 when they fell to about 8 per barrel crude oil from the 
gulf state of dubai was selling for 1240 a barrel thursday down 
from 1250 the day before 
in two meetings this year the 13 opec members failed to reach a 
consensus on new production quotas to stop prices from falling 
they agreed last month in vienna to extend current quotas until the 
end of 1988 
iran depends heavily on its oil production to finance its nearly 
8yearold war with iraq

the renomination of jim burnett as chairman of 
the national transportation safety board has bogged down in the 
senate in what burnetts supporters say is an effort to replace him 
with a democrat after the presidential elections 
burnett an outspoken former arkansas judge was renominated by 
president reagan last april 19 for a fourth term as chairman of the 
ntsb which investigates airline accidents and other aviation 
safety issues 
but the senate commerce committee has yet to schedule a hearing 
on the nomination and burnetts current twoyear term ends august 
13 should he not win senate confirmation by then the boards vice 
chairman automatically assumes the chairmanship temporarily 
theres nothing scheduled on the burnett case at least in 
the next few weeks said emelio pardo a spokesman for the 
commerce committee he said the full committee is waiting for its 
aviation subcommittee to make its views known on the nomination 
but committee sources say that relations between burnett and 
sen wendell ford dky the chairman of the aviation 
subcommittee have soured in recent months burnett publicly 
opposed legislation pushed by ford that calls for the federal 
aviation administration to be made independent of the 
transportation department 
he is not in burnetts corner and hes not alone said jim 
fleming administrative assistant to ford when asked about the 
kentucky senators views of burnett 
fleming said consideration of presidential nominations is a 
matter for the full committee and not a subcommittee 
if the senate does not act on burnett and michael dukakis wins 
the presidential election in november a democrat likely would be 
nominated for the post 
ironically many democratic members of the senate commerce 
committee came to burnetts aid two years ago when his renomination 
by the reagan administration for a time was put into doubt because 
of reported opposition from elizabeth dole who was then 
transportation secretary 
in may 1986 the white house allowed burnetts tenure as 
chairman to run out and did not renominate him until july after 
pressure from some members of congress including some of the 
senators who now are cool toward his renomination 
if not confirmed as chairman burnett is likely to remain on the 
board at least until the november election he was active in 
arkansas republican party politics and worked in several george 
bush campaigns should bush win the election he likely would 
renominate burnett next year 
burnett 40 has been a member of the ntsb since 1981 he often 
has won praise from congress for his frank assessments of aviation 
safety and criticism of the faas ability to monitor air traffic 
growth and the airlines 
in the spring of 1987 burnett attracted widespread attention by 
suggesting that the faa was allowing air traffic growth to exceed 
the capabilities of air traffic controllers he suggested the 
number of commercial flights in some section of the country be 
curtailed 
before coming to washington in 1981 burnett was a judge in van 
buren and damascus ark and a special associate justice of the 
arkansas supreme court

a legislative tradition of addressing friends and 
foes as honorable gentlemen and ladies has come under attack 
from opposition lawmakers who want their colleagues to speak 
plain english 
three leftwing members of the labor party submitted a motion in 
the house of commons on friday challenging the archaic forms of 
address and urging members to use surnames 
the motion said the use of names will be especially important 
when the 650member house of commons allows television cameras to 
film debates for the first time as part of a sixmonth experiment 
starting in october 
by tradition only the speaker of the commons is allowed to 
address members by their names the rest of the members must use 
various honorable forms of address depending on the person 
members of the same party are honorable friends opponents 
are honorable gentlemen or honorable ladies 
members of the privy council who serve as senior advisers to 
queen elizabeth ii are right honorable gentlemen or ladies 
members who are queens counselors the most senior lawyers are 
honorable and learned and those with distinguished military 
service are honorable and gallant 
john hughes one of the labor lawmakers who sponsored the 
motion said the way things are now done people watching 
television wouldnt have the faintest idea what is going on and who 
is being referred to we should call each other by our real names 
but conservative lawmakers denounced the idea as claptrap 
arguing that without such courtesies civilized debate in the 
commons would disappear 
this is one of the fascinations of the place and would appeal 
to tv viewers as it does to everyone else said conservative john 
browne 
motions in parliament almost never are debated and serve mainly 
as expressions of opinion or forms of pressure this one is likely 
to be referred to a house committee that will check how its 
traditions should be modernized for television coverage 
in the house of lords the unelected upper chamber of parliament 
whose proceedings have been televised for several years peers 
still address each other as the noble lord or noble lady

president reagan using his weekly radio 
speech for a blast at the democratic economic record charged today 
that party leaders gathering for their convention in atlanta want 
to take america back to the failed policies of the past 
sen tom harkin of iowa speaking in response for the democrats 
said its in economic matters where the reagan administration has 
left the country weakest 
reagan said before we came to washington our economy was in 
a mess he said his administration has produced the longest 
period of peacetime economic growth in american history 
we cut tax rates pared back regulations limited the growth 
of government spending and we did all this to get government out 
of the way so that individuals and enterprises had incentives to 
grow to invest to innovate to create jobs the president said 
its ironic reagan said that just as countries around 
the world are adopting the same progrowth policies our 
administration put in place so many in the democratic party want 
to go in the opposite direction 
today we face an historic opportunity a chance to remove the 
fear of the boom and bust cycle once and for all replacing it with 
consistent lowtax limitedgovernment policies he said 
reagan said he believed many rankandfile democrats would 
support this but added sadly the leaders in charge of the 
convention will want to take america back to the failed policies of 
the past 
the president urged his listeners as they watch the democratic 
convention on television next week to ask is the democratic 
party is its nominee for president going to keep taxes low and 
government growth under control or are they going to go back to 
the very policies that could wreck our economy again 
harkin in his radio response said democrats in atlanta will be 
sending out the message lets repair the damage and bring 
integrity and competence back to government 
today the greatest threat to our national security is not 
military its economic yet thats where this administration has 
left us the weakest harkin said 
he accused reagan of setting the ship of state adrift and also 
criticized vice president george bush for avoiding responsibility 
the captains been asleep at the wheel and his first mate 
doesnt seem to ever be on deck when decisions are made harkin 
said

consumer advocate ralph nader has come 
home again but the mayor wishes hed mind his own business and 
stay in washington 
you know ralph nader is not the king of winsted said mayor 
james d omeara 
the two men have battled for the past two years over a school 
that nader and his family attended 
nader led a drive to save and renovate the big red brick 
building built in 1900 omeara wanted the mary p hinsdale school 
flattened because of structural problems and replaced with a modern 
structure 
the mayor won with the backing of a majority of the voters and 
demolition began july 6 
that prompted nader to launch an investigation by his public 
interest research group into how winsted decides issues of great 
public interest 
nader said he had been planning for some time to investigate 
ways in which governments obstruct citizen participation and 
decided last month that there was no better place to start than his 
hometown 
theres a bipartisan agreement in winsted that historically 
the town has not been governed well that the planning process has 
been poor he said 
the battle to save the school was highly emotional and led to 
numerous public hearings a petition drive and a court battle 
nader and his supporters sought and lost two referendums the last 
one by a 21 margin in may 
the school was located around the corner from the nader family 
home nader 54 was a student there from 1939 to 1943 another 
graduate was david halberstam the author and journalist 
nader and his sister claire nader who is still a winsted 
resident sought to have the school protected under state and 
national historic preservation regulations but that was rejected 
because a portion of the school was torn down in 1950 when a wing 
was added 
they argued that renovation would have been cheaper than 
demolition a week before demolition began the city rejected their 
bid to rent the school for 85000 a year winsted plans a 78 
million onestory school at the site 
naders problem is that hes highly personalized this thing 
the 45yearold mayor said he ought to come up and take a 
barometer of the peoples attitudes in this town about what hes 
trying to do 
im a political elected official im a lifelong resident and 
have lived here 90 percent of my life and i think ive got a good 
feel for what people want i mean hes been gone for 37 years 
nader said his study should be ready by fall and he hopes it 
will make winsted a more progressive better place to live and 
provide lessons for other small towns 
omeara believes naders study is plain unadulterated 
nonsense 
this town has functioned for 200 years without ralph nader 
and it will continue to function the mayor said its just 
sour grapes over the fact that the voters have voted twice to 
demolish a school building that his family opposed

japanese trade with south africa appears to be 
leveling off relieving some of japans embarrassment at having 
become its largest trading partner 
before 1987 the united states did the most business with south 
africa which has been condemned internationally for the apartheid 
race policy that preserves power for the 5 million whites and 
denies the 26 million blacks a voice in national affairs 
finance ministry figures released tuesday showed twoway trade 
was down for the second consecutive month because of a sharp 
decline in imports but exports to south africa remained strong 
as other countries imposed sanctions on south africa to protest 
apartheid and saw their trade figures shrink japan let its 
companies fill the gap and has been criticized for doing so 
some japanese newspapers said trade was not really declining 
but foreign ministry spokesman yoshifumi matsuda told reporters 
thursday they should concentrate on yenbased trade figures rather 
than those expressed in dollars 
in dollars twoway trade was up 133 percent to 22 billion 
for the first six months of 1988 compared with the same 1987 
period but in yen the value dropped 3 percent to 272 billion with 
the decline starting in april 
we do expect that the new trend after april will continue as 
such matsuda said 
japan also renewed its call on south africa to release nelson 
mandela the imprisoned leader of the african national congress 
matsuda announced 
in addition he said japan has gone beyond most western 
countries in breaking diplomatic ties with south africa and 
prohibiting direct investment 
japans bilateral trade with south africa also has declined for 
the past two months when expressed in dollars the 325 million of 
trade in june was 145 percent below june 1987 the finance 
ministry reported the decline was largely attributed to imports 
which plunged 266 percent to 1581 million in june from a year 
ago 
exports continued growing though not as rapidly as six months 
ago in june japan exported 1669 million worth of goods to south 
africa 14 percent more than a year ago but for the first six 
months of this year exports soared 453 percent to 114 billion 
according to the finance ministrys customs clearance statistics 
in 1987 japans trade with south africa totaled 427 billion 
a 19 percent increase from the previous year that proved 
embarrassing 
foreign minister susuke uno asked japanese business leaders 
early this year to reduce the trade and suggested the ministry of 
international trade and industry coordinate a guideline for 
japanese companies to follow 
the powerful federation of economic organizations known as 
keidanren which consists of some 1000 major japanese 
corporations said the keidanren is not in a position to control 
its members business activities 
analysts attributed the recent decline in imports to decisions 
by several supermarket chains and department stores to stop selling 
south african products

stole his car 
norwalk superior court judge james bingham ordered margaret ray 
36 to undergo six months of psychiatric treatment in the state 
hospital where she has been a patient for the past several weeks 
new canaan police allege ray broke into lettermans home and 
lived there for several days in may before stealing his car 
authorities became suspicious and arrested ray when she and her 
3yearold son drove up to a lincoln tunnel toll booth in

said they found her eating canned pineapple and writing what she 
said were scripts for lettermans show 
the charges were reinstated and ray faces two counts of 
seconddegree burglary and one count of firstdegree larceny 
the judge ruled last month that ray wasnt competent to stand 
trial because she could understand the charges but was unable to 
assist in her defense 
fridays hearing was granted to allow time for another 
psychiatric examination of ray who objected to a first report that 
described her as delusional 
psychiatrist sander h fogle told the judge friday he believed 
ray couldnt assist an attorney in defending herself against the 
charges 
the judge scheduled another hearing oct 14 to reconsider his 
competency finding 
ray is being held and treated at the fairfield hills hospital

a federal court on friday upheld the 
governments decision that allows automakers to postpone until 1993 
a requirement for passive safety belts on a cars passenger side if 
the driver is protected by an air bag 
the national highway traffic safety administration last year 
agreed to a request by the ford motor co that allows continued 
use of manual safety belts on the passenger side in cars that have 
driverside air bags 
the ruling was challenged by public citizen a washingtonbased 
public interest group which claimed that the ruling postpones 
passive restraint protection for car passengers for four years and 
puts them in additional danger 
but the us court of appeals on friday upheld the nhtsa 
decision throwing out public citizens suit 
joan claybrook head of public citizen said no decision has 
been made on whether to appeal the ruling 
essentially what the court did is put passenger occupants of 
cars equipped with driverside air bags in a position of a 
likelihood of harm when the driver will walk away from the crash 
ms claybrook said 
jeffrey miller deputy administrator of nhtsa called the court 
decision good news for consumers because air bags will now be 
available sooner and in more cars 
the highway safety agency in issuing the ruling last year agreed 
with auto industry claims that more time was needed to develop air 
bag systems for frontseat passengers 
miller said the decision creates an incentive for automakers to 
make driverside air bags available while working on developing 
systems that protect both drivers and frontseat passengers 
an air bag is a device that inflates rapidly in an automobile 
collision protecting a drivers head and upper torso before it 
rapidly deflates 
the transportation department several years ago directed 
automakers to phase in passive restraints either air bags or 
belts that automatically wrap around a person entering a car with 
all cars to be equipped with the devices by the fall of 1989 
last years ruling which was upheld by the court friday 
postponed the requirement in the case of frontseat passengers in 
any car where the driver is protected by an air bag

communist leaders of serbia the 
nations largest republic exchanged barbed comments with their 
counterparts in two provinces friday in a clash over ethnic rights 
and governmental autonomy 
each side avowed that yugoslavias late leader josip broz tito 
would have backed its position 
serbian officials said leaders of the autonomous provinces of 
vojvodina and kosovo were exercising more autonomy than the 
constitution provides 
the provincial officials retorted that serbia was trying to 
limit their autonomy by pressing for radical constitutional changes 
they traded charges at a marathon 21hour meeting of the 
serbian central committee that ended friday 
the yugoslav constitution adopted in 1974 under tito the 
father of communist yugoslavia granted wide autonomy to the six 
often fractious republics and two provinces although it remained 
communist yugoslavia broke from the soviet bloc in 1948 
it is clear that we have to stop all attacks on the 1974 
constitution because those charges represent attacks on titos 
work said bajram gasi a central committee member from kosovo 
however danilo markovic a delegate from serbia said tito 
himself would have changed the constitution 
we cannot say that we will not change anything just because it 
was adopted when tito was alive markovic said 
the document is widely blamed for the countrys political and 
economic crisis yugoslavia is faced with europes highest rate of 
inflation at 175 percent a 21 billion foreign debt falling 
standards of living and growing labor unrest 
the serbian dispute also revolves around a longstanding ethnic 
struggle 
the serbian communist party says the present constitution 
prevents it from exercising its rights and authority in the two 
provinces it says it is kept from imposing tough measures against 
what it terms extremist ethnic albanians in kosovo 
ethnic albanians rioted there in 1981 demanding a separate 
republic at least nine people were killed and 250 injured 
according to official news reports about 30000 serbs and 
montenegrins have emigrated from kosovo since then claiming 
discrimination by ethnic albanians making up about 85 percent of 
the population 
inspired by support from serbian leaders about 700 serbs and 
montenegrins from kosovo demonstrated last saturday in novi sad 
capital of vojvodina they demanded that the two provinces reunite 
with serbia

chinesesoviet trade rose by nearly a third in 
the first half of this year over the same period last year an 
official report said friday the increase reflected improving 
relations between the two communist countries 
the xinhua news agency said china sold the soviets 670 million 
worth of goods and imported 627 million worth from january to june 
in the largely barter trade 
it said the twoway trade was up 32 percent over januaryjune 
1987 the agency predicted continued growth 
china has refused to normalize political relations with moscow 
which have been chilly since an ideological split in the 1960s 
china says the soviets must first reduce their troop presence at 
the border and persuade vietnam to withdraw its soldiers from 
cambodia 
however the two countries have steadily increased cultural 
trade and other nonpolitical exchanges during the 1980s 
xinhua said the soviets largely buy agricultural products and 
raw materials from china including corn soybeans and meat 
mechanical products from refrigerators to locomotives make up 
30 percent of chinas purchases from the soviet union with the 
rest of the purchases consisting of timber steel fertilizer and

father attended the news conference locasto the owner of a 
limousine service did not speak deferring to his lawyer 
yeley noted that the family has two other daughters ages 18 
months and 6 years and said the father is very upset on thursday

use the bathroom the flight was delayed for a halfhour as flight 
attendants knocked on the restroom door urging the woman to come 
out so the trip could begin 
the woman finally emerged and rejoined her husband and children 
investigators said flight attendants found the bathroom splattered 
with blood but sealed it off in the belief the woman had an 
extreme case of diarrhea it remained locked until after the plane 
landed 
the locastos left the airplane with other passengers and a 
cleaning crew found the infant about 20 minutes later

a jury in the second trial stemming from the 
howard beach racial attack convicted three defendants of 
misdemeanor riot charges friday but acquitted a fourth young man 
the verdict came several hours after the jury had said it was 
deadlocked prompting the government to offer a plea bargain 
granting the defendants youthful offender status and probation 
according to sources on both sides of the case 
the offer was rejected and the jury then returned a split 
verdict in which the three were acquitted of firstdegree riot a 
felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years but convicted 
of seconddegree riot punishable by up to a year in prison 
to the day i die ill know i did the right thing said 
william bollander referring to his decision to reject the plea 
bargain 
john saggese 20 who was found innocent said i prayed i 
had my hand on this the whole time displaying a small religious 
object 
saggese said he told his friends and codefendants bollander 
thomas farino and james povinelli all 18 im sorry 
it should have been the same for them he said 
all three were convicted in the dec 20 1986 attack by a white 
gang on three blacks in the howard beach section of queens felony 
riot or firstdegree riot involves tumultuous and violent 
conduct by a group of more than 10 people misdemeanor or 
seconddegree riot involves such conduct by a group of more than 
four people

gucciardo 19 of attempted murder assault and riot charges the 
jury foreman said the defendant not been positively identified

were convicted will file an appeal immediately after their sept 14 
sentencing but richard la rosa attorney for farino said well 
have to see its an expensive process 
earlier friday jurors had told the trial judge they were 
hopelessly deadlocked and unable to reach a verdict but state 
supreme court justice thomas demakos responded to the jurorss 
noontime note saying we are not at an impasse we are against a 
mountain 
this is far too an important matter for you after a trial 
of this length simply to throw in the sponge demakos admonished 
them noting that there had been five weeks of testimony 
i ask that you reason with each other and listen to reason 
he added 
the howard beach incident which new york civil rights activists 
said was a symptom of racism resulted in the death of 23yearold 
michael griffith who was struck by a car as he fled the gang of 
whites 
three young men were convicted of manslaughter in an earlier 
trial and a fourth was acquitted two other teenagers pleaded 
guilty to riot charges just prior to the second trial 
griffiths mother jean griffith said thursdays verdict is 
not justice 
nobody knows the pain of what were going through for me i 
have nothing i lost everything my son is dead said mrs 
griffith who was in court friday 
john saggese the defendants father said he shed tears of 
joy for my sons acquittal tears of sorrow for the boys who were 
convicted and for mrs griffith and her loss 
the elder saggese reiterated the defendants contention that 
howard beach is not a racist community adding were loving 
people and i wish people could see it that way

filmmaker edward dmytryk makes this grim 
prediction when i die i know the obits will read one of 
hollywoods unfriendly 10 not director of the caine mutiny 
the young lions raintree county and other films 
still vital at 79 and a teacher of film at the university of 
southern california dmytryk was in spain for a symposium on the 
hollywood blacklist at the barcelona film festival he made the 
trip from los angeles knowing that his appearance at the july 4 
panel could cause fireworks and it did 
the festival also invited directors jules dassin rififi 
never on sunday and john berry claudine thieves 
and writer walter bernstein little miss marker the 
front all three were refused employment in the hollywood 
studios during the 1950s because of alleged communist party 
membership 
dmytryk and writer ring lardner jr mash are the two 
surviving members of the unfriendly 10 who declined to testify 
about communist membership before a congressional committee and 
served prison terms for contempt of congress dmytryk emerged from 
six months imprisonment and testified about his party membership 
naming names of fellow members 
those events happened 40 years ago but the antipathies remain 
dassin berry and bernstein refused to appear on the platform with 
dmytryk he sat in the audience with his wife the former actress 
jean porter and heard himself excoriated as informer 
judas and scum by his three former comrades 
i didnt give any names that werent already known by the 
fbi dmytryk responded he told of entering the communist party 
with dreams and ideals when you finally found out that those 
dreams and ideals were all garbage you hated like hell to lose 
them 
after 90 minutes of heated exchanges dassin announced i do 
not wish to be engaged in a symposium with mr dmytryk he left 
the room accompanied by berry and bernstein the audience was 
stunned mrs dmytryk bowed her head and wept 
in his hotel room edward dmytryk glanced back at those 
turbulent days when hollywood and the nation was caught up in 
the red hunting fever he said he had joined the party in 1945 
because he thought it was active in some good causes at that time 
he was one of rkos hottest directors having made murder my 
sweet which started a whole genre of privateeye movies 
the only point of agreement among all four panelists was that no 
communist propaganda ever reached the screen the studio bosses 
were too alert to allow that but some of the hardcore party 
members tried 
my disillusionment with the party started after i had finished 
and edited cornered he recalled both adrian scott producer 
and one of the unfriendly 10 and i had taken out all of the 
communist propaganda that the scriptwriter had put in the script 
was full of manifestos and was impossible to make 
adrian and i were called on the carpet by party leaders and 
told to put the propaganda back in but the picture was already 
finished and if i had shot the original script the studio would 
have put it on the shelf or thrown it out completely 
dmytryk said he remained in the party only a few months but 
in 1948 he was among the 10 witnesses before the house committe on 
unamerican activities who cited the first amendment in refusing to 
testify 
that was a mistake later witnesses cited the fifth amendment 
and were not tried he said 
if he had left the party why didnt he testify 
i didnt want to do it before jail because they would call me 
a coward theyd say i was doing it simply to stay out of jail 
he said 
i made my first announcement that i had been a member just 
before i got out of jail that didnt satisfy the other side 
in 1951 dmytryk appeared before the committee to tell of his 
disillusionment with the party and he identified 26 people as 
communists 
i didnt feel guilty about talking he said i knew what 
would happen that they would call me a rat but i did what i 
wanted to do i have never regretted it 
the directors recanting did not immediately revive his career 
his first assignment was a quickie for which he was paid 500 then 
stanley kramer assigned him to a series of modestbudget films 
followed by the caine mutiny he became one of hollywoods 
busiest directors making broken lance spencer tracy 
soldier of fortune clark gable raintree county 
elizabeth taylor montgomery clift the young lions clift 
marlon brando and the carpetbaggers george peppard alan 
ladd 
dmytryk turned from directing to teaching 10 years ago and has 
written textbooks on filmmaking

while television cameras focused on the leaders 
filmmaker bud greenspan zeroed in on the lastplace runner in the 
5000meter final at the 1984 summer olympics 
dave moorcroft was the world recordholder at the distance but 
injuries had destroyed his chances of winning in los angeles 
as moorcroft fell farther and farther behind greenspan told his 
cameramen to focus on the british runner 
they said are you sure hes last greenspan recalled 
and i said i know just do it they thought i was crazy 
like a fox 
moorcrofts battle to avoid being lapped by the winner said 
aouita is one of the memorable moments in 16 days of glory 
greenspans sixhour documentary on the 1984 games it will be 
broadcast in onehour segments on public television beginning 
wednesday night 
the film features such wellknown athletes as gymnast mary lou 
retton track star carl lewis and diver greg louganis what makes 
it special however are the athletes and stories that were ignored 
or slighted in abcs vast coverage of the 1984 games 
im not just interested in winners greenspan said often 
the losers make a better story 
greenspan 61 has chronicled both in his career 
since forming his film company in 1967 the former sportscaster 
has written produced and directed documentaries and television 
specials on subjects ranging from the heisman trophy to the early 
days of baseball he has also written several books and recorded 19 
spokenword albums 
but his main passion is making movies about the olympics 
greenspan and his late wife cappy won emmy awards for the 
olympiad television series wilma his 1977 tv movie on the 
life of olympic champion wilma rudolph got rave reviews and high 
ratings and hes just completed his latest olympic project the 
official film of the 1988 winter olympics 
greenspans love affair with the olympics began with the 1948 
games in london 
one of the competitors that year was karoly takacs of hungaria 
a former pistol shooting champion whose right hand the one he 
shot with was shattered by a grenade in 1938 
he was so despondent he contemplated suicide greenspan 
said but in 1948 there he was in london and he won the gold 
medal in pistol shooting he had learned to shoot with his left 
hand 
thats the kind of humaninterest story that excites greenspan 
and gives his olympic shows a distinct flavor 
16 days of glory includes segments on japanese judo champion 
yasuhiro yamashita who overcame a painful leg injury to win a gold 
medal us runner henry marsh who competed in the steeplechase 
with a serious viral infection and american swimmer john moffet 
who hurt his leg while qualifying for the 100meter freestyle 
im interested in people not statistics greenspan said 
i dont care about 102 dashes and 365 batting averages im a 
storyteller i want to make a connection between the athlete and 
the audience 
16 days of glory reflects greenspans idealistic view of the 
olympics the soviet bloc boycott is mentioned only briefly as is 
the controversial mary deckerzola budd collision in the womens 
3000meter race decker fell after tripping over budds trailing 
leg as the south african runner moved in front of the american 
greenspan prefers to shine his spotlight on maricica puica the 
romanian runner whose victory was overshadowed by deckers fall 
im not naive i know about the politics and the 
controversy greenspan said but i would rather concentrate on 
the athletes and the competition thats what i do best 
it took years of research a firstrate crew and a million feet 
of film to make the 1984 olympics film 
logistically its like putting together the normandy 
invasion greenspan said you do as much preproduction as 
possible but a lot of it is never used we threw out about 80 
percent of the stuff we filmed before the games 
while greenspan awaits the tv premiere of 16 days of glory 
he is busy working on two other olympic programs a docudrama on 
the 1936 berlin games and a television special that follows 
teenage athletes as they trained for the 1988 games in south korea 
despite tight security in seoul some people are afraid the 
games could be marred by terrorism or student riots greenspan who 
just returned from the south korean capital said the fears are 
unfounded 
its safer than central park he said

more than seven months of palestinian riots and 
strikes have turned israelis hawkish but the hardline often masks 
ambivalence about the future of the occupied lands and the armys 
use of force 
israeli defensiveness stems from a belief that the occupied 
territories especially the jordan rivers west bank are uniquely 
bound to the state of israel 
lt gen dan shomron the armed forces chief of staff said the 
west bank and gaza strip were not distant battlefields like algeria 
was for the french or vietnam for the americans 
there is no debate among the soldiers they know that by and 
large this problem is inside our own house and there is no one 
who can take charge of the situation and solve it but the army 
shomron told the foreign press association in jerusalem 
some critics however fear israelis are becoming callous about 
the violence in which more than 200 palestinians have been killed 
at least 1500 wounded and 5000 jailed since dec 8 
society has been brutalized said dedi zucker parliament 
member from the liberal citizens rights movement we can see it 
in the army in the police even in the way our children talk i 
think we all have become accustomed to a higher level of violence 
on the other hand avner shaki a hawk recently elected head of 
the national religious party defends the israeli army 
are we angels is there any nation that would have been per 
capita more noble or moral than we have been taking into 
consideration all the terrorism that surrounds us 
zucker who has emerged as an outspoken critic of the 
governments iron fist approach to suppressing riots said 
initial israeli public reaction was lowkey because many remained 
unaffected 
people in tel aviv just heard about the troubles on tv at 
night he said in an interview the bulk of society succeeded 
in ignoring developments in the west bank the reason is they did 
not pay a price 
but they may be starting to pay a price and all parties agree 
the palestinian uprising has become the no 1 issue in the campaign 
for national elections nov 1 
four israelis as opposed to more than 200 palestinians had 
been killed by the end of june and the an estimated 425 soldiers 
and israeli civilians have been injured most lightly by stones 
thrown by protesters 
minister of economy gad yacoubi estimates israels losses from 
the uprising at midmay totalled 500 million most in lost tourist 
business and increased security costs 
the government increased the annual military reserve duty from 
40 to 62 days annually a decision felt in nearly every jewish 
household 
while life 60 miles from the west bank in tel aviv is largely 
untouched many more civilians walk the streets of jerusalem with 
automatic pistols clipped on their belts 
moshe weiss the interior ministry official in charge of gun 
licensing said 200000 israelis were authorized to carry firearms 
last year and the number grew by as much as 20 percent since the 
palestinian riots with many more denied permits 
there is a drift to the right said hannoch smith a leading 
israeli pollster 
he added in an interivew that polls of 1200 israelis in 
december and march indicated the number who supported israels 
harsh measures jumped from 51 percent to 74 percent 
shaki whose national religious party is an ally of prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc said at his tel aviv home 
riots had strengthened israeli resolve to keep the occupied land 
we are going to be firmer in our decision to keep in our hands 
as much as we can of judea and samaria he said using the 
biblical names for the west bank 
but polls also indicate some trends in public opinion favorable 
to the liberal labor party of foreign minister shimon peres 
smith said israelis support for labors idea of giving up land 
for peace was the highest in a decade with 48 percent in favor 41 
percent against and 11 percent undecided this was a 7 percent jump 
to the favorable side in six months he said 
polls by smith and the rival dahaf organization also found a 
majority of the public ready to talk with the palestine liberation 
organization if it recognized israel and renounced violence 
the public is saying put down the unrest by all means 
necessary and then think about negotiating said smith 
many israelis acknowledge however they have ambivalent 
feelings about the riots and strikes even liberal advocates of 
territorial compromise tend to change their views when they put on 
a military uniform or have family and friends attacked by 
stonethrowing mobs 
rafael moses a psychiatrist linked the defensive reaction to 
the holocaust the slaughter of 6 million jews by the nazis in 
world war ii 
the sensitivity of the israelis to being attacked provoked 
and criticized connects to the holocaust at times he said 
he added however that such sensitivity did not guarantee jews 
would sympathize with the plight of the palestinians 
amia leblich dean of social sciences at hebrew university in 
jerusalem said the unrest has polarized arabs and jews 
i think the arab students here for example are more 
withdrawn more segregated she said noting groups representing 
the 1200 arabs in the 18000member student body refused offers of 
public dialogue or joint academic projects 
shlomo gazit former head of military intelligence said 
israelis may seek to lessen dependency on palestinians importing 
foreign labor to replace striking laborers 
psychologically there is a very strong realization that is 
new in israel that coexistence with an arab population literally is 
not possible under the present circumtances he said

the uprisings in the west 
bank and gaza strip have spawned a new generation of palestinian 
leaders and given their people confidence to challenge israeli army 
rule 
the change is evident here in bani naim a farming town 17 miles 
south of jerusalem where the streets are blackened from tires 
burned in protest of israeli occupation 
hassan manasara 27 a leader of the towns resistance said a 
new community spirit has taken shape and that a senior israeli 
officer encountered it when he came to bani naim to urge calm 
manasara said the residents confounded the israeli by refusing 
to answer simple questions about their place of work 
when the officer asked how many people are farmers everyone 
raised his hand manasara said and when he asked how many work 
as laborers in israel everyone raised his hand 
the israeli threatened to cut off the water and everyone 
laughed 
even so bani naim has paid a heavy price residents say three 
townspeople have been killed 35 wounded and 150 arrested since 
december the town of 10000 also spent 20 days under an 
aroundtheclock curfew 
residents agreed to on austerity measures such as banning large 
wedding and graduation parties to conserve resources to support 
the families of those without work or in jail 
the town is now run by popular committees a security 
committee patrols at night to watch for israeli patrols a 
firstaid committee treats the injured a finance committee handles 
welfare 
sari nusseibah a leading palestinian intellectural said 
committees such as those in bani naim were the most hopeful sign of 
the uprising because they could be the foundation for a palestinian 
state 
but he added the new leadership was untested and suggested that 
if the committees faded away it might be more difficult to 
rally palestinians in the future 
he also said he was disappointed that palestinians had not 
developed a political strategy during the uprising 
i felt from the beginning that it is not enough to wage war 
but you have to wage peace equally strongly he said to do one 
without the other is to waste effort 
some israeli leaders contend the grassroots leaders in towns 
and villages only carry out the orders of the palestinian 
liberation organization but bani naims local leaders dispute this 
whats decided here is not from the outside there are no 
orders from outside said manasara 
much will depend on whether palestinians continue to support 
strikes and civil disobedience such as refusing to pay taxes or 
accepting israeli identity cards 
saifedin natsheh 34 owner of a stonecutting factory in the 
west bank town of hebron noted leaflets urged the development of 
arab business to lessen dependence on israel but he complained the 
palestinian selfreliance campaign was undermined by strikes and 
tax boycotts 
this month we only worked five days because of too many strike 
calls he said how am i going to pay the seven workers and 
feed my seven children with five days of work 
natsheh also said he was caught in the middle by the tax 
boycott threatened with jail by the israelis if he failed to pay 
and fearful his factory would be burned down by palestinians if he 
did 
i pay in secret he added 
before the violence erupted in december a web of economic and 
personal relations linked the 15 million palestinians to israel 
some 110000 arabs shuttled daily to jobs in israel and brought 
home 500 million to 700 million a year the west bank and gaza 
strip also became israels secondlargest market accounting for 
780 million or 11 percent of exports in 1987 
nusseibah a professor of philosphy at bir zeit university in 
the west bank said the biggest achievement of the uprising was 
recreating at least psychologically the border that divided 
israel from the west bank and gaza before the 2200 square miles of 
land was seized in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
a process of integration had been under way for the past 21 
years he said it was challenged in the uprising and for the 
first time people began to practice what they preach 
bonds of practical coexistence have been torn by the bloodshed 
and mass arrests which touched most villages and neighborhoods 
during the unrest more than 200 palestinians were killed 
according to leftwing israeli lawmaker dedi zucker arab injuries 
totalled 5132 by june and arrests had reached 17000 
the hatred that fuels the unrest is also born of humiliation 
which is intensely felt by those who have been arrested 
abdel aziz randisi a pediatrician jailed for six months without 
trial in the ketziot prison camp in israels negev desert 
complained to a reporter during a prison tour about being made to 
kneel down for roll calls and infractions of camp rules 
i would rather die than do this kneeling he said 
qassem ali a journalist from gaza who was also in the prison 
predicted such treatment of influential community leaders would 
boomerang on israel 
i think the conditions here have made the people more radical 
and created more hatred and this will be a problem he said 
in the west bank town of yatta a 21yearold student at 
bethlehem university who said he could not give his name because he 
was wanted by authorities spoke in a similar but more impassioned 
vein 
before the uprising people didnt have the will to 
demonstrate or throw a rock at a soldier he said before the 
uprising people who worked in israel were treated as slaves 
now we are human beings

each day kurt chase surveys his familys 
parched fields wondering if that days intense heat and dry winds 
will spell the difference between survival and disaster for the 
withering crops 
sometimes it looks so bad i dont know if they can stand one 
more day of it says chase who spends about 60 hours a week 
working in the fields with his father gordon 
for the chase family the biggest fear is the fear of the 
unknown 
there are so many what ifs to ask says jean chase 
gordons wife kurts mother what if it doesnt rain what if we 
cant pay the bills 
thousands of farmers across the nations midsection are asking 
themselves the same questions the worst dry spell since the dust 
bowl of the 1930s presents few certainties 
the wind gusting across the chases dairy and cashcrop farm 
sometimes blows away the sandy soil to expose seeds that should 
have germinated weeks ago 
most years the chases produce so much feed theres enough left 
over to sell after their 300 head of beef and dairy cattle are fed 
not this year the first cutting of hay was weak and the second 
almost nonexistent 
with the price of soybean meal going up the way it has been 
were not going to be able to buy any to feed the cows for 
protein gordon chase says softly nervously rubbing his 
forehead the impact of what we might be in for really didnt hit 
me until just recently 
as they sit in their living room in matching blue recliners 
the blondhaired couple look younger than their 51 years 
outside in the arid air an american flag hangs limply from a 
pole inside in the nonairconditioned house big fans turned up 
full blast ease the 90degreeplus heat 
gordon and jean met in high school they married 32 years ago 
now they sit surrounded by framed photographs of three children and 
six grandchildren by a rambling white twostory farmhouse and 
by their 1100 acres 400 their own 700 rented in the rolling 
countryside of southwest michigans barry county 
mrs chase does the bookkeeping and helps work the fields but 
moraleboosting is her main job she says if you dont keep 
yourself up nothing else matters 
last year was one of the familys most profitable as it was for 
many farmers and at the start of this season their projected 
income was the highest it had ever been 
but the cloudless skies have turned much of their hay wheat and 
soybean fields into barren lots of dust 
they have given up on most of their 350 acres of corn deciding 
to use their limited irrigation to keep 60 acres alive the rest 
will be used to feed their cattle 
since april 1 barry county has received less than six inches of 
rain barely half the normal rainfall it has gotten drier as time 
goes on the forecasters say the steady rain needed to reverse the 
impending disaster is unlikely through at least july by then it 
may be too late 
were at a critical point gordon chase says sinking back 
into his chair i dont know what were going to do if it doesnt 
rain i guess just hope that your lenders will be a little 
lenient 
for the chases this is the most trying period since they fell 
victim to the skyhigh interest rates of the late 1970s and early 
80s and almost lost more than half their farm 
six years ago they hired a financial consultant and 
restructured about four years ago kurt 28 and his wife 
dena 27 entered into partnership with the chases the family has 
since seem some good seasons 
but this year they are more than ever preoccupied with weather 
reports and crop prices they watch the ups and downs of chicago 
board of trade prices on a computer screen in their home office 
we might be better off than most but we are very very 
financially stressed mrs chase says they may end up struggling 
to cover feed seed and other operating expenses that could 
approach 100000 this year 
no amount of planning can immunize them from a drought they 
recently applied for 7300 worth of drought insurance for 500 
acres but have been told that they will probably be turned down 
because of excessive demand 
the chases often attend professional farmmanagement seminars 
we have high school educations but we learn to tap into every 
resource we can she says i think thats whats gotten us 
through some very hard times 
gordon and kurt are working overtime to produce extra milk from 
their 125 milking cows to make up for projected crop shortfalls 
farmers have got to be one of the most optimistic kinds of 
people things are always going to be better next year says 
gordon chase were fighters and will fight as long as we can 
up to the point of reality 
it really gets to us when we hear people talking about how 
brown their lawns are getting this is our life here 
mrs chase thinks of the drought as a test not only of the 
familys farming abilities but also of their faith their church 
services include special prayers for rain 
maybe this is making us all aware of our priorities she 
says we take so much for granted

its not an easy story for jean and 
gordon chase to tell a story of perceived failure never is 
for the chases and for countless farmers like them across the 
country the stories of lost land and lost dreams are memories that 
should be put to rest but each passing day of drought of intense 
heat high winds no rain brings those painful memories closer to 
the surface 
we always felt we were successful thats why it was so hard 
on us and so hard even now to talk about it mrs chase says of 
the crisis three years ago in which they nearly lost most of their 
dairy and cashcrop farm here in southwest michigan 
the crisis was 10 years in the making beginning when the chases 
tried to borrow money in 1975 to buy a 237acre farm to add to the 
160 acres they bought from mrs chases parents 10 years earlier 
because her parents had farmed only part time the chases 
consider themselves firstgeneration farmers when we started we 
didnt have 25 in our pockets mrs chase says gord just had 
the desire 
gord and jean bringing up three children had a successful 
few years in the business and found it easy to borrow money in the 
inflationary 1970s 
everything was put at such an inflated value all your 
equipment and land that the banks couldnt give you enough to 
borrow because of all your collateral says chase relighting his 
pipe and recalling the mistake that almost cost the former truck 
driver his dream of being a farmer 
but then inflation eased crop prices fell and banks quit 
lending in 1982 the chases like so many farmers were still 
saddled with highinterest debt but their income was declining 
many farmers faced bankruptcy many kept trying to borrow just to 
survive 
it just kept snowballing and suddenly we were trapped 
mrs chase says in 10 years they spent about 300000 in interest 
on about 20000 in principal on that one farm 
theres a saying chase says if you cant keep up you 
cant catch up 
when the chases tried to find private investors in 1982 to help 
them out of their hole they wound up finding a financial 
consultant instead he told us you dont need more money you 
need to manage it better mrs chase says 
acting on his advice the cost of which rose from 250 to 500 
per monthly session the chases sold 40 percent of their dairy 
herd keeping the healthiest and most profitable he also urged 
them to enter a partnership with their son and daughterinlaw 
trading some of their highinterest debt for lower interest rates 
offered the young couple 
but the land was still worth less than the debt they carried on 
it in 1985 unable to meet the repayment schedule the chases were 
advised by their consultant to give up the farm deeding it to farm 
land bank 
then under the new arrangement they leased it back parcel by 
parcel with an option to repurchase they never stopped farming 
they came up with the monthly rent were finally able to borrow at 
lower interest rates and then bought it back 
it was probably the worst year of our lives many tears were 
shed mrs chase says but if we hadnt done it we probably 
wouldnt be farming today 
the worst part of their agonizing decision to give up the farm 
was that their friends and neighbors could see their failure 
though hoping to keep the transaction private the chases found 
their land on the growing list of farms for sale published by 
federal land bank now farm credit services 
this is a community where everybody knows everybody and all 
of a sudden it became coffee shop news that our farm was for 
sale mrs chase says with tearfilled eyes recalling the 
familys sense of humiliation 
as soon as the news got out we felt surrounded by vultures 
chase says seven or eight neighbors would have done anything to 
get that land 
they say one neighbor on the farmers home administrations local 
board urged the other two members to deny the chases application 
for a lowinterest loan but the chases won an appeal at the state 
level 
theres a sense of pride when you own land that i cant 
compare to anything else mrs chase says to see that farm in 
the newspaper hurt more than i can explain 
the chases completed their repurchase of the farm last january 
before the drought hit they expected this to be their best year 
and they hoped to be debtfree in five years but now 
everythings looking different says chase 
the chases just hope to cover their 50000 annual expenses for 
seed fertilizer chemicals and fuel for irrigation the feed they 
must buy for their 300 head of cattle usually costs 35000 for the 
year but the price of the soybean meal continues to climb with 
careful planning the chases hope to have enough feed to get them 
through the fall 
they presold 30 percent of their soybean crop at 7 a bushel at 
the start of the season but what was then considered 30 percent 
may now make up their total soybean harvest and now soybeans are 
going for 10 a bushel only 60 acres of their 350acre cornfield 
looks salvageable 
the chases feel fortunate their dairy operation accounts for 60 
percent of their income but they worry that the federal government 
might go through with a cut in milk price supports next january as 
planned 
working 60hour weeks in the fields taking on the heavy job of 
moving their irrigation system to spots where it can do the most 
good the chases sometimes wonder why they bother 
gordon chase a fan of motivational tapes says hes trying to 
take the experts advice view the drought as a temporary setback 
and keep going 
its easy to say it he says but close up this is the 
real thing

the subject comes up again and again most 
recently from an examination of the latest and surprising 
employment statistics issued earlier this month 
the issue is this is the current economic expansion really 67 
months old a lifespan that puts it into the greatgrandparent age 
group or is it a lot younger than that perhaps only a couple of 
years or so 
to put it another way are we watching a continued 
uninterrupted expansion over the past 67 months or was there a 
break in the record that perhaps for methodological reasons 
wasnt officially recorded 
in short is it conceivable that we are watching a young 
expansion with room to grow rather than an old and tottering 
expansion getting ready for the sickbed are we watching the 
grandparent or its offspring 
a recession which is a break in an expansion is said to occur 
when the gross national product declines for at least two straight 
quarters there is nothing official about that definition it is 
simply the one most used 
by that definition the current expansion began late in 1982 and 
has continued since then but not everyone is willing to accept the 
definition times have changed maybe the definition should too 
could it be that the country actually went through a recession 
that just wasnt record as such according to some people who spend 
a lot of time examining such things it isnt just possible but 
probable 
to illustrate in late 1986 the economy was said to be in an 
expansion mode for the nation as a whole the gross national 
product was rising and according to the popular concept that 
meant there was no recession 
examining the breakdown of the national figures however seemed 
to present a reasonable challenge to the accepted definitions the 
breakdown showed many industries and many states doing very poorly 
and a few doing very well 
the economic numbers from states doing well mainly on the east 
and west coasts tended to hide the negative numbers produced in 
the nations midsection by manufacturing mining farming and 
oilrelated businesses 
sindlinger amp co an economic research firm that conducts 
lengthy personal finance surveys on a regular basis relegated the 
economies of no less than 31 states to what it says were recession 
levels 
things turned around after that however and early this year 
sindlingers measurements put only four states at recession levels 
oklahoma louisiana west virginia and mississippi meanwhile the 
new york economy had declined 
the employment and jobless figures suggest something roughly 
similar an initial economic advance a slowdown and then a 
renewed period of strength 
reporting to congress last week janet norwood commissioner of 
the bureau of labor statistics called attention to the phenomenon 
we have really had three distinctly different stages of 
employment growth she said 
first a strong initial rebound occurred in the first two 
years following the 19811982 recession then we had a twoyear 
period of slower more moderate expansion and finally the last 
year and a half has been a period of strong growth 
in the past 18 months she stated factory and construction jobs 
rose considerably and the serviceproducing sector continued to 
advance all major worker groups had lower jobless rates with the 
sharpest drop among adult men 
other respected analysts also have observed the inconsistency of 
the expansion edward yardeni of prudentialbache securities even 
suggests that deep recessions have been replaced by rolling 
readjustments 
the term is not an empty euphemism but refers to the tendency 
noted by many others for one section of the nation to pick up the 
economic slack of another and for certain categories of industries 
to strengthen while others weaken 
the national statistics might not show a recession or expansion 
has occurred but the residents of those areas and the workers in 
those industries do not rely on the statistics they know 
some of them will tell you that no matter what the learned folks 
say about a 67month expansion they have been through a recession 
and for many of them the economic expansion is brand new and 
probably headed for a long life

william kennedy toiled over three novels during 
two decades of literary obscurity before no 4 the 
13timesrejected ironweed brought him a pulitzer prize and 
celebrity 
so perhaps he has earned the right to ham it up a bit in 
quinns book his latest novel 
set in the mid19th century quinns book viking 1895 
is the fourth in kennedys albany cycle of novels although daniel 
quinn the protagonist travels far afield of the city the author 
long ago staked out as his turf 
the book is a pastiche of writing styles from the period 
blending journalistic reportage dickensian melodrama and celtic 
folk tales 
quinn whom we first meet as a boatmans apprentice whose 
parents died of cholera begins his peripatetic adventures when he 
rescues a beautiful girl from drowning in the icy hudson while 
albany falls around him in a cataclysm of flood and fire by books 
end he is a celebrated journalist who earned his reputation 
covering the civil war along the way he witnesses the opening of 
the saratoga racetrack the draft riots in new york the workings 
of the underground railroad and other wonders more fantasy than 
fact 
in a recent interview kennedy explained how his albany cycle 
evolved 
its a conception that goes back to the 60s thats when i 
began to think about writing a book like quinn only much larger 
than quinn that would take the whole history of the city from 
the time of the patroons those who held large estates under grants 
from dutch government in new york up to contemporary times he 
said 
it was excessively ambitious so i started chopping the 
history into pieces eventually it evolved that i was going to 
do these connected novels i didnt know how many novels so i 
didnt want to say trilogy or quintet or anything like that so 
i just called it a cycle and this is another in the cycle 
he was asked if albany has become his yoknapatawpha county the 
fictional mississippi setting of so many of william faulkners 
works 
i would say so its a place where i can spread out and write 
about anything in american history and make it relevant to that 
particular part of the country but also to the country at large 
he said because albany is in a very real sense a microcosm of 
the whole country 
kennedy professed to idolizing faulkner 
hes the one person i regret not having met i think hes the 
greatest american writer of the 20th century his whole creation of 
yoknapatawpha was the reason i began to write this series of 
connected novels i found the way he interconnected his lives to be 
quite extraordinary and i thought it was a very compelling way to 
write 
fans of the other albany novels legs billy phelans 
greatest game and ironweed will enjoy ferreting out 
characters in quinns book mentioned as ancesters in those 
works quinn for example is the grandfather of 10yearold daniel 
quinn in ironweed 
unlike legs kennedys fictional rendering of the reallife 
gangster legs diamond the author didnt let himself get bogged 
down in historical research for quinns book 
i worked quite differently on this book he said i knew 
where i was going in a certain general sense i knew i wanted to 
deal with the civil war with journalism with the theater with 
conspiratorial secret societies and i knew some things about them 
so i went and did specific kinds of research the opening day at 
saratoga racetrack for example i went to some pains to be 
accurate 
during his research kennedy stumbled across the name will 
canaday which he found too irresistible to pass up so with tongue 
firmly in cheek the author himself a former newspaperman 
bestowed the name on a secondary character the editor of the 
albany chronicle who takes young quinn under his wing 
the success of ironweed has allowed kennedy 60 a longtime 
film buff to branch into writing screenplays he wrote the 
original screenplay for the francis coppoladirected the cotton 
club as well as the screen adaptation of ironweed he has 
also writen scripts for legs and billy phelan although 
neither is currently under production 
kennedy is asked how writing for the cinema differs from writing 
a novel 
very much different with a novel you can do anything with a 
screenplay your scenes have to play in a page and a half 
everything has to be created visually you cant go inside a 
characters mind the way you do in a novel you cant have 
people explaining things talking forever like you can do in a 
novel 
meanwhile kennedy said he has just begun work on a novel that 
is still too embryonic to discuss except that it is set in 1958 
and in albany of course

bedouin tribesmen wont go near the 
quicksands in the desert of northern oman they say caravans of 
camels and herds of goats have been swallowed up in what they call 
the umm assamim mother of poisons 
but western engineers are moving in just the same defying the 
desert nomads superstition in hopes of tapping natural gas 
believed to lie deep below the surface 
weve heard the stories and were obviously concerned said 
john hayhurst the british plant manager of desert line the omani 
company that is preparing to build a road and set up drilling rigs 
in the region 
you have to approach a project like this with infinite care 
you have to investigate every inch of land before you move 
bedouin tribes such as the nomadic duru know how to endure the 
sandstorms and blazing sun of the rub al khali empty quarter the 
great sandsea of arabia with its 600foothigh dunes 
but they will not venture near the quicksands in the belief they 
are haunted by devils 
bedouin tales speak of caravans of camels and their riders and 
herds of goats disappearing in the quicksands of oman which is in 
the southeastern corner of the arabian peninsula 
most of hayhursts workers are foreigners mainly from india and 
pakistan 
hayhurst said if workers wander off the compacted areas they 
could indeed sink without trace 
weve very nearly lost equipment he said were well 
equipped with ropes and chains 
hayhurst 39 is a 17year veteran of prospecting in the middle 
east and africa but this is his first experience with quicksands 
drillers will shortly move into the area just south of the 
yibal oilfield discovered in 1962 targeted under the omani 
governments gas exploration program directed by the staterun 
petroleum development oman pdo 
oil is the backbone of omans economy its production is about 
600000 barrels daily gas exploration is being intensified mainly 
for local consumption 
pdos project engineer dutchman jan martens said the 
surface is a salty silty material which is reasonably hard when 
dry but when wet is soft and would swallow a vehicle 
the sandy layer is nine meters 27 feet deep at the drilling 
locations 
his engineers will float a road across the quicksands to 
support a 1500ton drilling rig the road will be built from 
layers of webbed matting that will bind the soft sand together 
beneath compacted surface material 
the first european to observe these quicksands was the british 
explorer wilfred thesiger who described them in his book 
arabian sands 
the ground of white gypsum powder was covered with a sand 
sprinkled crust of salt through which protruded occasional dead 
twigs of salt bush he wrote 
these scattered bushes marked the firm land farther out only 
a slight darkening of the surface indicated the bog below 
his arab companion warned him not to go too near telling 
thesiger a raiding party of bedouin warriors had perished in the 
sands and that he himself had watched a flock of goats disappear 
the scientific explanation lies in the quicksands geographical 
position as omans lowest inland area just 177 feet above sealevel 
the area acts as a sump for rainwater running out from gulches 
in the mountains of northern oman 
as the water runs down it leaches salt from the earth and 
carries it to into the mother of poisons where the water 
evaporates in the searing sun crystallizing the salt in a thick 
white crust on the surface 
the crust crunches underfoot but its firmness is deceptive and 
the water table may be only a few inches underneath 
the sands were the center of a flourishing salt trade many years 
ago 
caravans of camels ventured in some never returned the bedouin 
say swallowed without trace

isolated and dreary all winter long leh 
springs to life in summer when vegetables ripen in the fields and 
tourists swarm in from 11500 feet below filling up 80 hotels and 
guest houses in the worlds highest desert 
women wearing shining strings of turquoise and coral greet the 
visitors with shy smiles and a soft julley hello 
with about 10000 permanent residents leh is the major town of 
indias ladakh region a himalayan desert because high surrounding 
mountains block rain and snow but the area is cut off when snow at 
lower altitudes block roads and the regions 68000 people settle 
in for eight months of winter privation 
but this time of year people and supplies flow in and leh known 
as the last shangrila vibrates 
stark brown mountains surround the town and the buddhist 
monasteries perched on hilltops 
the moonlike landscape is broken occasionally by splashes of 
willow and poplar and small farms growing wheat barley and 
vegetables 
come june the leh valley fills with europeans and americans 
tourists and mountain trekkers 
the road from srinagar the capital of kashmir opens as the 
snow melts down the mountains 
last year even matchsticks were not available because the 
road closed early and opened late said akbar ladakhi a 
longtime resident 
people survive on tsempa he said 
tsempa a salted paste of chickpea flour is eaten sometimes 
with onions and sometimes thinned into a soup wealthier ladakhis 
spice their winters with a barley wine 
but with summer these highdesert people feast on tomatoes 
turnips carrots peas potatoes and beans all either grown 
locally or shipped from below when the road opens 
akbar ladakhi said tourism has helped improve the regions 
economy providing money for reviving dying arts restoring 
monastries and preserving old buddhist paintings 
but some others feel tourists have commercialized ladakh where 
merchants once slept amid their wares and buyers simply took goods 
and left money behind 
corruption culture has invaded us people have become clever 
and businessminded said sonam wangchuk a student involved in 
promoting ladakhi culture and dance 
he complained youngsters were becoming westernized discarding 
their traditional robes for tshirts and jeans lehs main street 
is filled with the music of hindi movies and and michael jackson 
for the summer tourists restaurants offer an array of chinese 
and tibetan foods but cooks also have mastered apple and banana 
pancakes for those preferring a westernstyle breakfast 
ladakh is a predominantly buddhist region influenced over the 
centuries by nearby tibet the region was originally a tibetan 
province and is still known as little tibet 
but rock carvings found nearby indicate ladakh had been used for 
thousands of years by nomadic tribes including the mons of north 
india the dards of baltistan and the mongols of central asia 
ladakhs golden age began in 1533 when king soyang namgyal 
united the region established his capital at leh and extended his 
boundaries to the outskirts of lhasa in tibet 
kashmiri rulers invaded in the last century and since indias 
independence from britain in 1947 the region has been caught up in 
indias border wars with pakistan and china 
the namgyal palace overlooking leh stands as a mute testimony to 
the battles its sprawling walls bearing wide gaping holes 
most ladakhis are followers of the dalai lama the exiled 
godking of tibet who lives in the indian himalayan town of 
dharamsala 
tibetan prayer flags flutter over most houses and shops their 
colors fading under summers bright sun 
being near the indianchinese border ladakh also is an army 
base convoys of army trucks spew black smoke along the narrow 
roads the army also is the regions biggest employer hiring local 
people to build military roads and dams 
but most work ends in september when winter begins people lay 
in food and firewood only emergency goods are brought in by army 
planes 
temperatures go down to 18 degrees below zero farhenheit and 
prices soar 
but wangchuk the traditionalist says the people are enured to 
it 
we have grown up with hardship he said it doesnt matter 
if you dont have vegetables or milk

the palestinian uprising has prompted educators 
to discuss current events and encourage debate about the 
arabisraeli conflict in israeli classrooms for the first time 
new education ministry orders to devote classes to the 
palestinian issue breaks with a 40year tradition begun by israels 
first prime minister the late david bengurion he barred teachers 
from raising topical political issues in school 
as a result the history of the arabisraeli conflict has 
normally not gone beyond the 1967 middle east war when israel was 
lopsidedly victorious and usually ignored detailed references to 
the palestinian point of view 
now however students heatedly argue such issues as whether 
israel should negotiate with the palestine liberation organization 
or withdraw from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
teachers fear high school pupils who face a compulsory military 
draft at 18 will be emotionally unprepared for army service unless 
they are better educated about the arabisraeli conflict 
another concern is to avoid the swelling of antiarab prejudice 
which has grown among israeli youth in the wake of the palestinian 
uprising that began dec 8 and has claimed the lives of more than 
200 arabs and four israelis 
ive started to think about the palestinian side of things 
now i understand that a state is what they the palestinians 
need danny sirkin 17 said in a recent discussion in his 11th 
grade classroom 
few students agreed with the sirkin 
if we return the territories nobody knows if that will bring 
war or peace the plo wants all of israel said doron 
kapitolnick 17 
the 40minute debate was at the rene cassin high school built 
on a battlefield of the 1967 war when israel captured the arab 
sector of jerusalem and the west bank from jordan and wrested the 
gaza strip from egyptian control 
most students said peace talks were needed but maintained israel 
should boycott the plo even though palestinians consider that 
group to be their only representative 
other students expressed concern for relatives serving in the 
occupied territories 
the outside world doesnt understand said tamar kater 
they only talk about soldiers beating arabs its not their 
fathers or brothers doing army reserve duty 
another girl interrupted to say she was afraid to ride buses 
with palestinians because of recent firebomb and rockthrowing 
attacks in jerusalem others denounced palestinians as 
terrorists 
arab pupils at the palestinian medhamiya girls high school 
just a mile down the road from rene cassin never mingle with the 
jewish students although their schools and homes are near each 
other 
at medhamiya in israeliannexed east jerusalem teacher randa 
nusseibeh a palestinian spoke generally about the roots of the 
arabisraeli conflict to her 11th graders she said the united 
states and britain helped jews create a homeland in palestine in 
1948 
what colonialism and the jews want is to create tension in the 
area mrs nusseibeh told the class 
after class pupil randa takash told a reporter she wanted the 
israelis to go back to where they came from 
but in contrast with the israeli students the palestinian 
students did not debate the current problems in the occupied 
territories or what should be done about them 
school officials say palestinian teachers discuss the uprising 
only indirectly fearing they could be accused of inciting violence 
and their schools would be closed 
in some israeli classes pupils have been asked to express their 
feelings by drawing said tova tsur an adviser at the education 
ministry who coordinates the program on the arabisraeli conflict 
eighthgraders in one tel aviv classroom drew pictures of 
soldiers toting guns or palestinians wielding knives mrs tsur 
said in an interview 
one drawing she said was of an airplane taking off with 
israelis on board mrs tsur said the drawing dramatized studies 
that indicate many young israelis want to leave the country 
mrs tsur said a new ministry booklet advises high school 
teachers to assign literature by palestinian refugees and to 
instruct classes that palestinians like israelis have a strong 
emotional tie to the land of israel 
but she added that many teachers cited deep emotional 
involvement in the conflict as one reason they hesitate to comply 
with government instructions about teaching the arabisraeli 
conflict

it hasnt happened since 1975 but some year the 
united states will once again export more than it imports the 
question is when 
the dollar leaped friday as currency traders decided the nation 
was making rapid progress toward wiping out the trade deficit the 
optimism was spawned by a government report that the may deficit 
was a relatively low 109 billion 
but currency traders are notoriously shortterm forecasters far 
more interested in the next tick of the dollaryen exchange rate 
than the outlook for trade in the 1990s 
and in a strange twist trade improvement is likely to be set 
back in the long run because of the very rise in the dollar that 
has come from expectations that trade will improve a higher dollar 
makes us products less competitive in world markets 
including fridays jump the dollar has ascended 9 percent 
against the west german mark and 7 percent against the japanese yen 
since june 10 
cautious american companies have just begun aggressively 
pursuing export opportunities made possible by the lower dollar 
and some could back off if they feel the dollars rise is going to 
last 
moreover foreign companies that were about to be dislodged from 
the us market might decide to hang on a bit longer because of the 
dollars rise 
for both those reasons its terribly important to keep the 
dollar down richard obrien of londonbased american express 
bank ltd said in a recent interview 
while mays deficit was the second smallest in nearly three 
years imports still exceeded exports by 41 percent small 
incremental changes cannot quickly wipe out a gap of that size 
some economists the optimists say the switch from red ink to 
black ink on the trade ledgers could happen on a monthly basis by 
late next year and on an annual basis by 1990 
our advantage is we can export literally thousands of 
products were not unidimensional said one of the optimists 
thomas carpenter vice president and director of economics for asb 
capital management in washington 
given the weak dollar we can sell anything from basic 
materials to agricultural products to boeing aircraft to 
automobiles and computer software products weve got it he said 
we will see the results and well see it in spades said 
charles reeder who runs a forecasting firm in wilmington del 
and says the benefits of the dollars longterm decline have been 
underestimated 
the economists spoke before the last leg of the dollars rise 
late this past week 
other economists say the first annual merchandise trade surplus 
will not come until nearly the end of the century because the 
torrid pace of export growth is bound to slow down 
exports will grow close to 7 percent annually over the next 
decade while imports grow about 2 percent a year predicts the wea 
group in bala cynwyd pa which predicts merchandise trade will 
not flip to a surplus until 1997 
the percentage differential between export and import growth 
just chews away at the surplus year by year said wefas glenn 
forman 
the vastly different forecasts for zero day the day when 
exports finally catch up with imports is a sign of the 
inexactitude of economics trade isnt measured by the day anyway 
picking the year is probably the best anyone can expect 
wefa group is one of the few organizations willing to make 
forecasts even tentative ones for a decade ahead 
theres definitely a limit to what we can reasonably 
project said stacy kottman of georgia states economic 
forecasting center which declines to make forecasts much past next 
year 
small unanticipated changes say if the dollar continues to 
rally then that will dampen the progress we make against the 
merchandise trade deficit he said 
the georgia state group predicts the trade deficit will still be 
averaging 8 billion to 9 billion a month next summer 
thrift is a virtue and trade surpluses would allow the nation 
to begin digging itself out of its status as the worlds biggest 
debtor but economists dont even agree whether it is important to 
vanquish the deficit or worry about debtor status 
i believe that the reasons for the trade deficit are much more 
fundamentally positive than many would have us believe said 
brian wesbury an economist for harris trust and savings bank in 
chicago 
wesbury argues the trade deficit is a byproduct of foreigners 
strong desire to invest in the united states americas high 
technology and rapid productivity growth make it an attractive 
place to sink money and foreigners are paying for their 
investments by shipping their goods here he said 
the more we move away from freemarket policies and a low tax 
environment the sooner well get to that zero situation but wed 
end up hurting our economy hurting productivy making this a less 
attractive place to invest wesbury said 
shrinking the deficit to zero may easily take another decade 
wesbury said and he is in no hurry to see it happen sooner 
even economists who are more concerned about the deficit dont 
think it will or should shrink too rapidly 
consider that most of the increase in shipments of manufactured 
goods has come from making better use of existing plants with 
factories churning near their full practical capacity and the labor 
market tightening exports cannot continue to expand rapidly 
without severe inflationary strains 
the market swings from overpessimism to excessive optimism we 
awkwardly find ourselves on the lets cool it folks side having 
been bulls on the side of an export boom obrien of american 
express bank said

alan greenspan has made his intentions clear to 
wall street the federal reserve either will or will not tighten 
credit further in the weeks ahead 
making his midsummer appearance before a congressional committee 
on wednesday the fed chairman expressed a goodly measure of 
concern about the prospect of increased inflation if economic 
growth begins to strain the capacity of production facilities and 
the labor force 
as a result he said the central bank might be well advised 
to err more on the side of restrictiveness rather than of 
stimulus 
at the same time however he said higher interest rates were 
not inevitable and indicated he was in no rush to raise the 
discount rate the rate the fed charges on loans to private 
financial institutions and one of its most visible tools for 
influencing trends in money and credit 
the next morning a headline in one major newspaper declared 
greenspan signals higher interest rates while another 
reported greenspan sees stable rates 
all in a days work for wall streets fed watchers the job 
description for the top job at the fed stresses the ability to talk 
before congress for long periods of time without saying much of 
anything 
some find this sort of thing offensive arguing that an 
organization with as much power as the fed should be more 
accountable to the citizenry and their elected representatives in a 
democracy 
but defenders of the present way of doing things say that 
whoever speaks for the fed is obliged to choose his words 
carefully if only because of the financial markets tendency 
toward emotional overreaction 
in order to pursue its policies effectively they say the fed 
must keep a close eye on how the bond market in particular is 
behaving 
suppose for example that the fed sought to ease credit and 
lower interest rates in circumstances that bond traders saw as 
potentially inflationary they would then tend to push interest 
rates up not down 
the stock market behaved through the past week as if it had 
learned nothing startlingly new about the feds intentions prices 
meandered in a narrow range and the dow jones average of 30 
industrials closed friday at 212945 up 2330 points from the 
week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 84 to 15365 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
26 to 39459 and the american stock exchange market value index 
increased 29 at 30931 
volume on the big board averaged 17520 million shares a day 
against 16340 in the previous week 
as circumspect as he was about the future greenspan did confirm 
that the fed took a series of steps during the spring toward 
tighter credit when it became increasingly clear that the economy 
was stronger than expected 
skepticism about the feds resolve to resist inflationary 
pressures persists observed david resler economist at nomura 
securities international in a midyear appraisal of the outlook 
many suspect that the fed will be too slow to take necessary 
action against inflation during the election year 
however resler said the three credit tightening moves that 
the fed took over an eightweek span in the second quarter ought to 
assuage fears that the fed will not respond quickly and decisively 
to inflation pressures whenever they surface 
moreover the financial markets hypersensitivity to signs of 
inflation renders fruitless any attempt to steer the economy along 
an unwarranted growth path

as the stock and bond markets have made clear 
lately wall street investors have very mixed feelings about the 
strong employment growth that has occurred this year 
providing jobs of course is one of the basic goals of economic 
policymakers 
so when the unemployment rate falls to a 14year low as it did 
in june something obviously is going right 
the question facing investors however is whether and when 
gains in employment become too much of a good thing reaching a 
point where the capacity of the labor force is strained unleashing 
new inflationary forces 
on that point the views of wall street economists diverge 
widely some say the danger point is close at hand while others 
argue that circumstances allow for plenty more growth 
the optimists point out that while nonfarm payroll employment 
grew by 346000 in june the labor departments measure of hourly 
wages actually declined 
nevertheless argues allen sinai economist at the boston co 
and economic advisers inc this is still no great comfort on 
inflation worries since economic and labor market strength 
typically comes first and then inflationary pressures second with 
some lag 
with so much strength in labor markets and such low 
unemployment rates it is hard to think that wage inflation will 
not keep accelerating 
david levine economist at sanford c bernstein amp co points 
out that payments to employees make up about twothirds of the 
costs businesses incur in this country 
unemployment has clearly entered the realm that was associated 
with wage and price problems in the early and late 1970s he 
maintains 
while wage growth remains quite temperate by the standards of 
those years it has now begun to accelerate 
assuming as we do that above consensus growth in the gross 
national product will continue to pull down the unemployment rate 
the labor market seems likely to become tighter than at any time 
since 1973 and wage pressures should intensify 
levine says he is looking for wage increases in the 6 to 7 
percent range next year 
by contrast edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache 
securities contends that times have changed in ways that allow for 
further job growth without a big increase in inflation 
in the 1970s and the early 1980s he says the babyboom 
generation born after world war ii moved into the labor force in 
huge numbers the unemployment rate and inflation both rose 
now because of the birth dearth in the 1960s he says 
demographic forces are working in the opposite direction 
yardeni predicts that the unemployment rate now at 53 percent 
will get as low as 4 percent by 1990 or maybe sooner 
if the unemployment rate is heading toward 4 percent doesnt 
that suggest much higher wage inflation ahead not necessarily 
he says 
weve argued that laborsaving productivityenhancing capital 
spending is the only intelligent way that corporate america can 
respond to the labor shortage 
of course they could start a bidding war but that way 
theyll get costlier workers not more workers in our opinion 
corporate managers are unlikely to suddenly offer big wage hikes 
after they spent five years cutting costs 
the corporate culture of the 1980s and 1990s emphasizes cost 
cutting price increases were fashionable in the 1970s global and 
domestic pressures suggest that a return to the inflationary 
culture of the 1970s is unlikely

its no secret that bondholders usually get the 
short end of the stick when it comes to things like corporate 
takeovers or restructurings 
unlike stock prices that often skyrocket even at the hint of a 
merger corporate paper usually suffers as bondholders worry about 
a company being saddled with additional debt once a deal is 
completed 
and unlike stockholders who have final say over such a deal 
bondholders are relegated to a passive nonvoting role 
a group of investors though is working to change that through 
the recently formed institutional bondholders rights association 
the fledgling group believed to be the first of its kind has 
two goals to help institutional investors respond promptly to 
specific situations threatening the value of debt investments and 
to develop basic means for protecting the interests of 
institutional investors association president richard s swingle 
explained in a recent interview 
widespread corporate restructuring including mergers and 
acquisitions management buyouts and bankruptcy reorganizations 
has underscored the need for an organization that will help 
safeguard the interests of institutional bondholders swingle 
said 
recently it has become typical for a corporation to finance a 
restructuring by drastically increasing its debt load often the 
result is a reduction in the credit quality of existing corporate 
debt held by institutions he said 
eight companies have joined the association since its inception 
earlier this month among them metropolitan life insurance co 
prudential life insurance co of america and loomis sayles amp co 
all holders of billions of dollars in corporate debt 
the association looking for more strength in numbers hopes to 
have at least 25 members in a year and up to 100 in the next three 
to four years 
swingle who is also a vice president at t rowe price 
associates inc said that as specific situations arise the 
association will assist institutional investors in taking the 
appropriate action 
for example he said the group may develop a set of provisions 
to insert in corporate debt agreements that would guarantee 
institutional investor rights such provisions would assure that no 
corporate transaction could benefit shareholders at the expense of 
bondholders 
in addition swingle said the association might form ad hoc 
bondholder groups to negotiate terms or defeat an asset sale or 
work with a corporations management to preserve existing debt 
value in a reorganization 
by helping institutions respond cooperatively to specific 
restructuring situations and by building explicit protection for 
institutions into corporate debt agreements we hope to guarantee 
that rights of institutional investors are afforded greater 
consideration when a corporation alters its financial structure 
swingle said

the government on friday criticized 
production overruns by some opec members that have allowed crude 
oil prices to drop on the world market in recent weeks 
mexicos view was contained in a message which energy and mines 
secretary fernando hiriart sent the newly named general secretary 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries subroto of 
indonesia 
he said in the message that the international cartels failure 
to adhere to its own agreed upon export quotas is undermining the 
market 
this has prevented crude prices from reaching the expected 
levels because of overproduction in export platforms the 
message released here said 
mexico the worlds sixth largest oil exporter is not a member 
of the 13nation cartel but it has often cooperated with opec by 
restricting sales abroad and following its pricing guidelines 
mexico has actively supported opecs measures to stabilize the 
international petroleum market and these unilateral decisions were 
taken within a context where cooperation and discipline were to be 
expected by all members of the cartels exporters of 
hydrocarbons the message said 
subroto is expected to arrive in mexico city on aug 17 to 
discuss with officials here measures to stabilize the market and 
boost prices crude oil is this countrys principal source of 
export earnings 
mexico produces an average of 25 million barrels of crude a 
day and exports 136 million barrels about half of it to the 
united states it used to export 15 million barrels daily two 
years ago but reduced the amount in order to help keep prices up

an encouraging report on the us trade deficit has helped 
catapult the dollar to recent highs against several key foreign 
currencies 
the commerce department reported friday that the united states 
posted a 109 billion trade deficit in may the second smallest 
shortfall in almost three years 
the news helped the dollar make its best showing since october 
against the british pound the pound finished at 16605 in late 
new york trading far cheaper than thursdays 16875 
the dollars surge lifted bond prices pushing interest rates 
lower the yield on the treasurys closely watched 30year bond 
slipped to 914 percent from 917 percent late thursday 
the favorable trade news also sparked a moderate gain in stock 
prices on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
1583 points to 212945 finishing the week with a net gain of 
2330 
in another key economic report the labor department said 
wholesale prices rose a moderate 04 percent in june but analysts 
saw cause for worry in the steep droughtinduced climb in raw food 
prices 
the hot dry weather searing much of the nation sent prices of 
unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by more than 20 percent last 
month pushing raw food prices 42 percent higher than in may it 
was the biggest jump since october 1985 
grain futures closed mixed while soybeans posted strong gains on 
the chicago board of trade amid conflicting weather forecasts for 
the droughtstricken farm belt 
in other economic developments friday 
the federal reserve reported that us industrial production 
boosted by heavy demand for electricity during the summer heat 
wave climbed 04 percent in june the ninth consecutive month 
without a decline 
the commerce department said business inventories climbed in 
may for the 17th consecutive month sales also rose strongly 
easing economists worries that too many goods are accumulating on 
shelves and back lots 
the reagan administration and private economists were in 
agreement that the may trade report offered conclusive proof that 
the governments efforts to deal with one of the countrys biggest 
economic problems a seemingly intractable trade deficit were 
beginning to show results 
the may deficit was actually 627 million higher than a revised 
april imbalance of 103 billion but the april figure was the 
smallest imbalance since a 99 billion deficit in august 1985 and 
the may deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time 
commerce secretary c william verity noted that for the first 
five months of this year us exports have surged by 31 percent 
compared with the same period in 1987 reflecting the boom 
conditions in the nations manufacturing brought on by the weaker 
dollar 
the merchandise trade figures for may are consistent with the 
trend toward a lower trade deficit verity said the 
improvement in the trade balance in the first five months has been 
widespread geographically 
the administration launched an effort three years ago with major 
us allies to devalue the dollar as a way of making american goods 
more competitive on overseas markets

financially pressed pan am corp has moved a 
step closer to its goal of recovery by reaching a tentative labor 
agreement with leaders of its largest union 
the transport workers union agreed friday to freeze wages 
prompting pan am to withdraw its recent threat to sell a large 
portion of its assets the airline engaged in sporadic talks with 
the transport workers since last february originally had sought a 
10 percent cut in wages 
the agreement covering about 5200 mechanics aircraft service 
personnel and flight dispatchers still must be ratified by the 
union membership it would save the airline around 81 million over 
the next three years according to both the union and pan am 
this is a crucial development in pan ams plan for financial 
recovery pan am chairman thomas g plaskett said in a statement 
the transport workers union is the third out of the five unions 
at pan am to sign a new costsaving contract with the carrier 
which is seeking 90 million in wage reductions from its flight 
attendants and has imposed 35 million in cuts on the teamsters 
under federal labor rules 
pan am said it will now direct its efforts toward reaching an 
accord with the flight attendants 
the airlines management believes it needs around 540 million 
over three years in pay cuts and other labor concessions to turn 
itself around last spring the two unions representing pilots and 
flight engineers at pan am agreed to cuts totaling about 240 
million over three years 
teamsters leader william genoese said the new agreement with the 
transport workers didnt change his unions position 
representatives of the pan am flight attendants werent immediately 
available for comment 
the whole thing is a farce the company is going down the 
tubes genoese director of the teamsters airline division told 
the associated press were in a position to strike the company 
were going to fight em toothandnail 
because pan am softened its position with the transport workers 
and accepted a wage freeze rather than a cut genoese asserted 
theyve got to soften their position with everybody 
last february teamsters leaders vowed guerrilla warfare 
against pan am including deliberate diversion of baggage after 
a strike deadline passed the 4500member teamsters at pan am 
include reservation clerks baggage handlers and other ground staff 
pan am the nations eighth largest airline lost 2653 million 
last year earlier this year it replaced top management in return 
for the concessions from the pilots and flight engineers

crude and heating oil prices rose but gasoline 
prices declined in light preweekend trading that brokers 
attributed largely to internal market influences 
on the new york mercantile exchange the augustdelivery price 
for west texas intermediate advanced 10 cents a barrel on friday to 
1486 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale no 2 
heating oil rose 021 cent a gallon to 4112 cents and unleaded 
gasoline fell 081 cent a gallon to 4973 cents 
brokers said crude and heating oil prices rose partly from 
shortcovering the purchase of contracts by speculators to replace 
borrowed contracts they had sold earlier shortcovering can cause 
shortterm price rises 
others attributed the advances partly to a tendency by many 
traders to reduce risky positions heading into a weekend weve 
got a lot of people squaring up their books said peter beutel 
assistant director at elders futures inc a new york 
energyfutures trading concern 
traders said the decline in gasoline came from preweekend 
profit taking contrary to recent declines in oil prices gasoline 
has been rising sharply because of unprecedented demand and tight 
supplies in the united states
