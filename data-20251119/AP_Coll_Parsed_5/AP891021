the release of seven african 
congress national leaders from prison has been welcomed in black 
townships nationwide but there is no sign of a thaw between the 
guerrilla group and its black political rivals 
mangosuthu buthelezi the most powerful black moderate in south 
africa complained the anc wants to project itself as the sole 
representative of the countrys blacks 
i shudder to think what would happen to south africa if we all 
stood aside and allowed only one black party to negotiate the 
future with the government buthelezi said thursday 
buthelezi a critic of the ancs socialist ideology and its 
bombing and sabotage campaign is chief minister of the tribal 
homeland of kwazulu he also is leader of inkatha a zulu 
organization that claims 15 million members and which has feuded 
violently in the past three years with supporters of the anc 
more than 2000 blacks in natal province have died in the 
conflict and recent efforts to promote peace talks have collapsed 
also remaining at odds with the anc is the outlawed pan 
africanist congress both groups have conducted guerrilla 
operations against the government in the past three decades but 
the pan africanist congress is smaller has been less active and 
has sharp ideological differences with the anc 
the anc follows a policy of nonracialism and welcomes whites in 
its ranks the pan africanist congress espouses the black 
consciousness philosophy pioneered by steve biko before his death 
in detention in 1977 and believes whites should have no role in 
the struggle for black rights 
one pan africanist congress member jafta masemola was released 
from prison oct 14 along with the seven anc leaders but he stayed 
out of the spotlight at his home near pretoria while the anc men 
held a triumphant news conference that was covered by journalists 
from around the world 
in subsequent interviews masemola 60 said he foresaw no 
likelihood of his group and the anc uniting unlike the anc 
leaders he said there was no purpose in pursuing negotiations with 
the government calling them an exercise in futility because 
the ruling national party would not negotiate itself out of power 
the leader of the pan africanist congress zeph mothopeng was 
freed from prison last year he met during the week with walter 
sisulu the most senior of the freed anc prisoners but has given 
no indication of an ideological rapprochement between the two 
groups 
earlier this month mothopeng even criticized the campaign of 
protest marches organized by antiapartheid groups aligned with the 
anc 
he said president fw de klerk had gained favorable publicity 
overseas by allowing the marches and asked how much closer to 
liberation did they bring the oppressed 
both mothopeng and buthelezi have sought to avoid portraying 
themselves as personal rivals of nelson mandela the paramount anc 
leader who remains in jail buthelezi has depicted mandela as his 
friend and said repeatedly that he will not enter political 
negotiations with the government until mandela is freed

from classic elegance at givenchy to skintight and 
slinky jerseys at tarlazzi styles in fridays fashion shows for 
next summer ran the gamut 
tailored ruffled draped and baremidriff looks took over the 
runways as the fashion picture was unfocused 
givenchy had his act together a sophisticated range of clothes 
that looked worthy of the elder statesman of couture 
but the clothes were far from elderly givenchy simply took some 
of his favorite themes and brought them out in luxurious fabrics 
he firmly padded shoulders for shape ignoring the softer shoulders 
elsewhere there were lots of short skirts and easy long pants in 
plaid or solid suits with fitted or bolero tops the suits were 
handsome in windowpane plaids stripes or glen plaids in silks 
linens and cottons 
simple sheaths with big padded cap sleeves or offtheshoulder 
banded tops with huge puffy sleeves over narrow short skirts added 
to the range of feminine silhouettes for summer 
there were navy gray and neutrals for daytime with sizzling 
colors for later on they came out in gazar or organza outfits with 
big flounces flowered prints shades of orange pink wisteria and 
turquoise sometimes decorated with lilyofthe valley appliques or 
sparkly fish just for fun 
karl lagerfelds ideas oozed with originality all the clothes 
cut for action from striped knit pullovers long pants and shorts 
to the fluid fullskirted minis 
borrowing some of his own ideas from chanel where hes also 
head designer lagerfeld sometimes paired big tweed checked blazers 
with dark chiffon culottes and long skirts 
jackets were the forte and whether short or long they were 
always fitted to the waist and often had deeply cut lapels 
hugging the hips over contrasting short and lean skirts with 
matching tights or the new full minis the best jacket had 
crescentshaped lapels one large one small and for evening it 
came out with pearled embroidery 
lagerfelds prettiest cocktail clothes paired up black and white 
short looks in bustier outfits with revealing black lace loose 
jackets 
folklore and graphic prints with sequins and big polkadotted 
satins and cottons looked great too lagerfeld mixed them up in 
tiny minis with fitted jackets or in long highwaisted pyjamas 
and short or cutaway jackets 
come play with me declared angelo tarlazzi in his program 
the italian designer who now also plies his trade for guy laroche 
couture went all out for hotcolored and clingy knits leaving 
little to the imagination with elastic shoulder wraps many bare 
midriffs pleated ruffles at the bust or hem some of the viscose 
knits were convertible and could be pulled out from mini length 
to make a long dress 
the most amusing evening dresses were called totems and 
combined bubbles of africaninspired prints in hot colors and black 
with raffia fringes and fishnet hems 
to emphasize the waist he gave a girdle effect in lame 
waistcinchers to many outfits with fullness in blouses above and 
long pants or shorts below 
tarlazzi raided the linen closet for his ideas in summer white 
hemstitched jackets and flounced skirts with boleros were a great 
exercise in what you can do with sheets napkins and tablecloths 
annemarie berettas daytime suits with mother of pearl buttons 
or snaps on long jackets worn with pedal pushes or pleated skirts 
looked a bit too strict for the pampered set that frequents the 
automobile club where the show was held 
the outfits were better in light pastel linens forest green and 
petrol blue than in the rather sad shades of khaki putty and muddy 
brown that predominated 
she draped lots of clothes rather awkwardly for daytime giving 
them a heavy look in front but some of the taffeta and lace 
evening drapes and big ruffles were opulent if not especially 
feminine 
woodstock was reborn for bernard perris who went back to the 
1960s and 70s for his inspiration his girls trotted out in 
flared funnelshaped trousers lots of embroidered and jeweled 
hipster pants and skirts and fringes all over the place 
he also harked back to the age of aquarius in his mixed indian 
cotton and silk prints in wrapped and draped skirts and 
cummerbunds and his idea of the tuxedo got all dressed up with 
acres of long tassels 
bellbottomed pants jumpsuits and shorts came out at chloe the 
collection designed by martine sitbon her black pants suits or 
short skirts with cutaway jackets were stitched with white giving 
nice vertical lines all over 
the many cutouts bareback and baremidriff outfits gave 
another nod to the 1960s in this group of shows that seems to be 
floundering as designers search for details and silhouettes for the 
1990s

japan has become the most earthquakeconscious 
nation in the world since the earth shook in 1923 and destroyed 
tokyo but the next great quake probably will be a human and 
economic disaster despite all precautions 
tokyo had 2 million people when the earthqake struck now 12 
million people live in the city and the nation is a pillar of 
finance with worlds richest stock exchange and the most money 
flowing out to international capital markets 
predictions about the next great earthquake its due about 
1993 if calculations of a 70year cycle are correct include 
casualties in tens of thousands and a setback for the world as 
japanese money stays home to rebuild 
a lot is being done to lessen the effect more new buildings are 
resistant to earthquakes and the fires temblors often cause and 13 
million people took part in the last national disasterprevention 
drill in september 
japan is a world leader in earthquake engineering newer 
buildings are designed not to collapse even in a quake registering 
about 8 on the richter scale said shinsuke nakata a design code 
specialist in the construction ministry 
japanese and us codes follow different philosophies nakata 
said a tendency to rigid construction in japan while california 
emphasizes improved margin of deformability in building codes 
that are much more sophisticated 
after the california quake tuesday japanese experts went to the 
san francisco bay area to study why one structure collapsed and 
another stood what the soil conditions were and other aspects of 
the disaster 
if tokyos new skyscrapers perform as well as those in san 
francisco most of the damage will occur elsewhere 
some experts believe japan is doing some things wrong however 
and that the inevitable great quake will be more costly as a result 
a fundamental problem is the dense tokyo area megalopolis of 
close to 30 million people nearly onequarter of the national 
population the archipelago is in the worlds most active seismic 
zone a meeting place of four tectonic plates 
japan and the surrounding seabed experience about 10 percent of 
global earthquake action the government says and tokyo is on a 
particularly active site even by japanese standards 
although residents of the city feel several quakes a year of low 
to medium intensity experts say this is a quiet time 
since a strong quake nearby in 1929 tokyo has not experienced 
a single tremor with an intensity of 5 or more katsuhiko 
ishibashi a seismologist with the construction ministry wrote in 
1987 
on the japanese intensity scale he cited 5 is a very strong 
quake just below the disastrous level the great quake of sept 1 
1923 which caused 140000 deaths in tokyo and nearby yokohama was 
a 7 the top of that scale 
no direct conversion is possible between the japanese scale and 
the openended richter which was developed later but the 1923 
tokyo quake was estimated to have had a 79 richter reading the 
1906 san francisco earthquake was estimated at 83 
ishibashi and other japanese scientists have focused on a 
volcanic eruption in 1986 on oshima island 70 miles south of 
tokyo as evidence of deadly seismic activity on the way 
if history repeats itself the next focus would be odawara 40 
miles south of tokyo and after that a great earthquake is likely 
toward the end of this century in the heavily populated tokai 
region a bit farther south he wrote 
these quakes are also likely to inaugurate an extended period 
of frequent and destructive earthquakes directly under tokyo bay 
he said 
ishibashi said japan must decentralize away from tokyo and the 
kanto plain on which it sits he urged national leaders to find a 
way of freeing ourselves from tokyos magnetic pull and steering 
japan clear of tragedy 
his article in the monthly chuo koron monthly said it was folly 
to proceed with plans for tokyo that put strong emphasis on 
building artificial islands in the bay to house several million 
people 
because of a phenomenon called liquefaction landfill can turn 
into something like quicksand in a big earthquake magnifying 
ground motion and damage he wrote even if buildings bridges 
and highways themselves are of earthquakeresistant or 
vibrationfree design 
some of the worst damage in san francisco this week was in the 
marina district built on landfill 
after the san francisco quake japanese tv viewers saw long 
programs on disaster measures at home often including maps of 
tokyo showing large areas already built on landfill and prone to 
liquefaction 
last year city authorities calculated the loss if tokyo were 
hit by a quake as strong as the 1923 disaster especially on a 
winter evening when cooking stoves and gas heaters were in use 
the estimate was 37000 dead 78000 injured onethird of homes 
and offices destroyed and massive disruption to communications and 
power supplies 
a study by the national land agency put the toll much higher 
150000 dead and 200000 injured 
tokai bank of nagoya calculated such a quake would cause damage 
valued at 570 billion or about 20 percent of japans economic 
output 
it predicted the flow of capital to the united states would be 
cut in half causing us interest rates to rise and stock markets 
to plunge worsening third world debt problems and threatening a 
world depression 
some japanese are fatalistic about the impending disaster one 
survey showed 94 percent of businesses thought they needed backup 
computer systems but only 95 percent had them 
you cant do anything about it a foreign ministry official 
said que sera sera

of the entire 85mile span of the san 
franciscooakland bay bridge only about 50 feet is not where it 
belongs 
but that is all the difference in the world 
ninetyfive percent of the bridge worked said greg bayol a 
spokesman for the california department of transportation 
officials estimate it will take about four weeks to repair two 
sections of the bridge damaged in tuesdays earthquake and reopen 
the span to the 270000 vehicles that cross back and forth each day 
one month sounds awful ambitious conceded bob halligan 
spokesman for transportation department we may get in there and 
find something else 
one person died in the collapse a 23yearold berkeley woman 
whose car sped over the edge moments after the gap opened 
initial work is planned for this weekend when a huge crane will 
lower the 250ton section of the upper roadway more than 100 feet 
to a barge in the bay 
on friday crews prepared the damaged section working in stiff 
37 mph winds biting temperatures and a light fog 
the fivelanewide chunk of roadway slumps at a terrifying angle 
toward the water which is visible through a savage slice cut into 
the lower level by the falling edge 
workers operated small vehicles and cables just a few feet from 
the edge defiant of wind gusts and the choppy gray water below 
since the accident workers have hoisted pennants on the upper 
span in the blackandgold colors of the san francisco giants and 
green and yellow of the oakland as the crossbay rivals meeting 
in the delayed world series 
reporters were allowed to tour the bridge friday but could not 
talk to workers 
one project manager however volunteered that the repair work 
would be unique 
weve never done anything exactly like this said doug 
comstock of the smith rice co of oakland which is removing the 
damaged section 
the companys no 5 barge and its crane capable of hoisting 400 
tons were already in place friday afternoon 
once the bridge section is on the barge officials said it will 
be taken to alameda for study and if possible repairs 
jim roberts chief of structures for the state transportation 
department said the damaged section appears to be in good shape 
if it can be salvaged it will be put back in place as soon as 
possible he said 
it will be upgraded to todays technology he said 
the top section fell when its anchor bolts were sheared off by 
more than 2 million pounds of pressure roberts said at a news 
conference friday 
that was far in excess of what anyone calculated when it was 
designed in the early 30s he said 
the bolts were sheared by the movement of a column that supports 
the bridge bayol said 
the tower shifted bayol said 
the tower is structurally sound although workers will have to 
use winches and cables to push it three to five inches back into 
place he said 
the bottom section of the twotiered bridge suffered three 
puncture holes opening portions of the roadway to the water below 
bayol said 
it may be possible to repair that section while it remains in 
place bayol said roberts said it could also be replaced by a 
prefabricated section 
total repair cost is estimated at 1 million halligan said 
asked what the biggest potential problem was in the rebuilding 
bayol deadpanned earthquake 
severed light cables and communication lines for bridge workers 
will also have to be repaired 
atts coaxial telephone cable normally capable of handling 
1200 phone calls simultaneously was bent and that traffic has 
been permanently rerouted to other lines said atampt spokesman ron 
beagley 
the bridge closure is expected to cause havoc with the local 
traffic even with many businesses closed friday traffic was 
bumper to bumper on other bridges

a woman convicted with her 
religious sectleader husband of sexually exploiting teenage boys 
was sentenced friday to eight years in prison 
colleen randazzo has repeatedly exploited children for her own 
sexual gratification and that of those around her mesa county 
district judge david bottger said in sentencing her on eight felony 
convictions 
supplying teenagers with cocaine having sex with them and 
videotaping the sessions is not casual or inadvertent acts 
bottger said i watched that videotape and i didnt see any love 
or affection at all all i saw was sex 
the only reason she doesnt have any other felony convictions 
is because her conduct was not detected and prosecuted sooner 
the judge said 
bottger allowed mrs randazzo 38 to go free on 80000 bond 
pending her appeal 
on the 1hour videotape mrs randazzos husband james is 
seen lying naked next to his wife and the teenage boy as they have 
sex he called out direction made requests of them and fondled 
himself 
the randazzos were leaders of a group called the spiral of 
friends a christianitybased cult whose five or six dozen members 
believed that james randazzo had reached the highest level of 
spirituality since jesus christ according to testimony 
the mesa county probation office had recommended a sentence of 
90 days in jail followed by probation for mrs randazzo who had 
faced up to 66 years in prison 
bottger said he couldnt agree because mrs randazzos conduct 
had not constituted an isolated incident and because she had not 
expressed remorse or acknowleged that what she did was wrong 
he sentenced her to two consecutive terms of four years each 
under state law she will probably serve four years 
her 50yearold husband james was convicted of 10 charges and 
also was to be sentenced friday however his attorney was unable 
to be present and his sentencing was rescheduled for jan 26 he 
faces up to 130 years in prison 
mrs randazzos attorney robert flynn said he would base his 
appeal on the admissibility of the videotape and the courts 
refusal to allow her to use a choice of evils defense 
mrs randazzo had contended that she engaged in sex with the boy 
in the videotape because he was depressed and needed to have his 
selfesteem boosted 
bottger however said her case is not a case of religion 
or of therapy or kindness or affection or love

the traumatic rescue of a 6yearold boy 
from the rubble of tuesdays earthquake has become a focal point of 
sympathy and good will from his classmates his city and his 
president 
julio berumen lost his right leg after doctors had to cut 
through the body of his dead mother to free him from the family car 
trapped in a freeway collapse 
the richmond boy was in serious but stable condition friday his 
8yearold sister cathy was in fair condition with head injuries 
suffered in the crash 
while the childrens father pastor waited for further word 
about his children news of tuesdays rescue had spread 
by friday childrens hospital officials said there was even 
some discussion about a presidential bedside visit 
president bush did meet friday with dr jim betts who performed 
the surgery on the boy while lying on his stomach on a board which 
had been pushed into a narrow opening in the wreckage 
the hospital had received hundreds of calls by friday from 
around the country expressing support for the family people 
stopped at the front desk to bring toys some of them were in tears 
hospital officials said the elder berumen was aware of the 
attention his family had attracted but wanted to stay out of the 
spotlight 
hes vey much in touch with this but in his grief he has 
asked everyone to leave said hospital spokesman dennis green 
green said berumen had been at the hospital almost constantly 
since the accident and was being supported by relatives friends 
and hospital counselors 
the rescue to many people brought the earthquake very close to 
home 
it really brings it the earthquake to a personal level 
said antonieta franco cathys teacher the whole family was very 
close the mother was devoted to her children she dropped them off 
at school and picked them up in the morning 
now the mother was dead after being killed instantly when a 
pillar on the freeway sliced through her car 
cathy was pried from the car soon after rescuers reached it but 
julio was pinned the mother lay between the rescuers and the boy 
doctors decided they had no choice but to saw through the seat and 
the body to get to julio 
then came the decision to amputate the boys leg 
id do it again betts said afterwards i knew if i was up 
there or one of my family members were up there id want them to 
do it 
the story of the rescue which took more than four hours has 
stirred neighbors and friends who have organized two funds to help 
the family 
and the memory of it will serve as a reminder for many of the 
childrens classmates long after the last aftershock fades 
its going to be hard for the kids in my class to forget about 
it the earthquake after something like this ms franco said

a preliminary investigation of rep newt 
gingrich is nearing its end with an apparent conclusion by an 
outside attorney that there are no grounds for a fullfledged 
ethics probe of the no 2 house republican leader capitol hill 
sources say 
but the final answer on whether the georgia republican is off 
the hook on ethics charges will await the outcome of some loose 
ends which will be looked into by the house ethics committees 
own staff investigators 
chicago attorney william kunkle representing the firm hired as 
outside counsel to look into the gingrich matter completed a 
threemonth 150000 investigation and gave his findings to the 
committee on standards of official conduct on wednesday the 
sources said 
the panel could act on gingrichs case as early as its expected 
meeting next week 
but democratic and republican sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said kunkle also gave the panel questions that remained 
unanswered and will have to be pursued by the committees own staff 
before final disposition of the case 
one source said some of the questions could be important 
adding theres a lot of loose money out there it will be a 
close call on whether to drop the case 
some of the questions involve what was done by the publisher to 
promote sales of a book gingrich wrote window of opportunity 
one source said 
kunkle is a partner in phelan pope and john the same chicago 
law firm that investigated former house speaker jim wright 
dtexas wright resigned may 31 gingrich filed the complaint that 
led to the opening of wrights ethics case and has said his 
current problems are the result of democratic vindictiveness rather 
than any wrongdoing on his part 
gingrich said friday he did not know what was in the report but 
he called for it to be released publicly he also said he had not 
been contacted by the ethics committee 
i havent seen it we have no idea what it says and were 
waiting for the committee to finish its work and well continue to 
cooperate with the committee gingrich said when its all 
done im sure they will release it 
gingrich is the minority whip the secondranking post in the 
house republican leadership 
the case stems from a complaint by rep bill alexander dark 
that gingrich violated house rules and federal campaign finance 
laws with a limited partnership created in 1984 to promote the 
book which gingrich wrote with his wife and another coauthor 
alexanders complaint focuses on a partnership of 21 individuals 
who each put up to 5000 to promote the book gingrich was not an 
investor but his wife was paid more than 10000 for running the 
partnership 
the complaint contended the 105000 raised by the partnership 
could be considered income to gingrich in violation of house 
limits on members outside earnings if not income the complaint 
said it could be a gift to gingrich in violation of house rules 
that prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more than 100 
from anyone with a direct interest in legislation

dozens of problems noted by inspectors 
of an oakland freeway over the years gave no hint of its disastrous 
collapse during a major earthquake a top california transportation 
official contends 
the periodic maintenance and repair reports described a sagging 
deck cracks flaking concrete bent spans a cracked girder and 
other problems since the cypress viaduct opened in 1957 
but the reports on the doubledeck nimitz freeway section that 
collapsed and crushed dozens of drivers were no cause for 
alarm caltrans chief engineer bill schaefer said friday the 
maintenance reports are not unusual at all 
caltrans structures chief jim roberts made similar remarks at a 
news conference saying i dont think its fraught with any more 
problemsbridges grow old like we do 
i wouldnt leave that thing open if i thought it was unsafe 
said roberts who was driving on the interstate 880 section the day 
before its top deck crashed onto the bottom deck 
roberts also insisted it was a lack of technology and not a lack 
of money that led to delays in earthquake safety improvements on 
i880 and similar elevated roads supported by outrigger columns 
on either side 
he also said the collapse of the freeway and the damage to two 
other twotiered roads in san francisco doesnt mean caltrans 
should stop building such structures he said use of new technology 
can ensure safety 
the three i880 the embarcadero and i280 were the only 
doubledeck freeways in northern california and all were closed by 
the quake 
roberts also said its not the caltrans policy to make easy 
repairs first to quakethreatened roads adding the worst case 
is being fixed first and he repeated that the 1milelong 
section of freeway that collapsed had not been viewed as a hazard 
caltrans has spent 54 million on firststage earthquake safety 
improvements mainly to tie roadways to support columns and is 
spending an additional 64 million on secondstage improvements to 
strengthen vertical columns but the plan doesnt include the 
nimitz freeway or other multicolumned freeways because they 
were considered safe 
roberts said the thirdstage work which involves strengthening 
doublecolumn supports will have to include roads such as the 
nimitz he said the thirdphase cost could run as high as 300 
million and research under way on how to fix doublecolumn 
structures will be speeded up 
he added that the cost of replacing the nimitz freeway section 
could range from 50 million to 100 million once its demolished 
schaefer and roberts also questioned various statements from 
outside engineers who have said i880 had an outdated design and 
was vulnerable to quakes 
you can talk to 100 engineers and get 100 different answers 
said schaefer roberts added we can armchair quarterback 
everything we do lets face it 
asked whether the fill land beneath the nimitz was too soft 
roberts said i dont think you can say the land is so unstable 
you cant build a bridge there reports made available friday by 
caltrans showed top layers of fill and rubble over soft clay and 
gravel 
another report produced in 1982 by the state department of 
mines and geology said in part the elevated section through 
downtown oakland is expected to be extensively damaged 
liquefaction and related ground failures will occur in a quake 
with a magnitude of 83 on the richter scale of ground motion 
tuesdays earthquake registered at 69 
the hydraulic fills used to construct miles of freeway along 
the east shore of san francisco bay in alameda county may liquefy 
during heavy shaking with long sections becoming totally 
impassable said the report to the governors emergency task 
force on earthquake preparedness 
of course the soils had a lot to do with the collapse said 
john kariotis one of the engineers offering criticism friday go 
back and look at pictures of oakland in 1916 it was all marsh that 
was filled in 
kariotis a south pasadena expert on earthquake effects and san 
francisco engineer loring wyllie in san francisco also said that 
if i880s columns had been girded in steel and addtional concrete 
the elevated section probably would not have collapsed 
the collapse was an unfortunate combination of an old 
structure on soft ground said ian buckle the prominent 
structural engineer who was named by gov deukmejian to chair a 
special panel reviewing the i880 disaster im not surprised 
given the earthquake we know those column of these old structures 
are vulnerable

seven dispatching stations tuesday and telephone company workers 
had scarcely connected phone lines to the new equipment when the 
quake hit at 504 pm england said 
if the earthquake had struck 10 minutes earlier england said

as workers continue the painstaking 
effort to chip away freeway concrete from crushed motorists 
psychologists and counselors have launched their own 
roundtheclock effort to help rescuers cope 
denver psychologist tom williams said friday the slowness of the 
recovry effort and the extent of the carnage are particularly 
frustrating for workers who may be susceptible to longterm 
emotional problems 
the biggie is when they go back to their regular jobs they 
feel so meaningless said williams who was coordinating the 
onsite counseling program 
stress from the rescue is building up said williams who urged 
workers to share their concerns and problems with friends as well 
as professional counselors 
if you dont deal with it its going to come up and bite you 
on the butt later williams said they might not want to be 
rescue workers later 
as days pass and workers continue pounding through pavement in 
their search for bodies workers struggle with the frustrations of 
slow equipment he said 
typically rescuers are accustomed to retrieving people who can 
be saved but the chances of discovering a survivor are now 
extremely slim he said 
with every passing hour the little candle in the tunnel 
dims for them williams said its amazing the strength of 
character these people have 
the rescue scene is overwhelming said the former career marine 
who served two tours of duty in vietnam 
it just reminds me of being in vietnam for a couple of 
years said williams it smelled like sort of the same thing

of jazz records others searched for photo albums some piled up 
chairs chests and everything else they could on the streets 
our poor little lives are right here on the sidewalk said 
patrice gehrke 36 packing items from furniture to ferns in the 
back of a pickup truck friday 
for residents of the citys upscale marina district whose homes 
may have to be demolished friday was a dash to salvage whatever 
they could from the rubble of tuesdays earthquake 
they stuffed their belongings into mercedes bmws and other 
luxury cars if they couldnt find rental trucks or pickups others 
carried away goods in shopping carts toy wagons cardboard boxes 
laundry baskets and garbage bags 
residents were supposed to have just 15 minutes to grab all 
their valuables those whose buildings will be torn down were given 
red tags and escorted into their homes by a corps of officials 
wearing orange vests and hard hats 
but the time limit was largely ignored some tossed possessions 
through upperfloor windows 
i felt like i just won a free hour in the supermarket on one 
of those tv game shows said al challacomb guarding his stash of 
belongings on a buckled sidewalk 
the mood was not always lighthearted 
some people returned to find their homes and apartments 
collapsed one couple stood in the street in a tearful embrace 
jennifer ritz tried not to cry as she squeezed clothes artwork 
chairs tables and knickknacks into every available inch of her 
friends blue mercedes 
you feel rushed and you cant stop to think of what you 
should take said ms ritz a legal secretary 
im alive but ive lost certain aspects of my life she 
said sobbing i dont know where im going i dont know what 
im doing its terribly unsettling i just feel like im lost 
ways of life crumbled along with stucco condominiums and posh 
apartments in the neighborhood the worsthit in san francisco 
because its homes were built on landfill not bedrock 
as many as 60 homes either collapsed or will be torn down many 
others were too severely damaged to live in damage was so bad 
police cordoned off eight square blocks after gas leaks were 
detected 
when residents were allowed back in the operation looked like a 
grotesque sidewalk sale streets held motley piles of leather 
couches cedar chests mahogany trunks lamps paintings chairs 
televisions stereos vcrs skis snowshoes vacuum cleaners 
microwaves and mattresses 
janet wyleczuk 28 was able to grab her dishes clothes and 
personal mementoes out of an apartment scheduled to be demolished 
this was our last chance she said i was able to get a 
piece of my past before starting n 
all i cared about was my photo albums said lisa radomski 
helmeted motorcycle police officers and red cross volunteers 
assisted with the chores huffing and puffing their way down the 
stairs 
diane whitacre 47 hoisted a drawing board on her shoulder so 
she could get on with her freelance work 
the most important thing to me was the stuff i need to make a 
living life does go on said ms whitacre

the federal aviation administration wont 
allow thomas root who ended up in the atlantic ocean after flying 
unconscious for several hours last july to pilot planes again 
anytime soon 
the communications lawyer said friday the faa had pulled the 
medical certificate he needs to fly but that he wouldnt take a 
plane in the air anyway 
it would be a very foolhardy thing for me to do to go flying 
without knowing what caused the blackout root said after 
receiving a letter informing him of the faa decision 
root whose washington communications law firm filed for 
bankruptcy after the july 13 incident said he would turn in his 
certificate as ordered 
but root added i dont need the faa to tell me it would be 
dumb to fly 
the faa said root was suspended because he refused to supply all 
relevant medical documents including psychiatric records from his 
treatment in hollywood fla after the flight 
root suffered from a gunshot wound he said must have occurred 
when a pistol he kept in the cockpit discharged apparently as the 
plane hit the water off bermuda 
root said he no longer owns a plane and had not flown since the 
incident that occurred as he was on a business flight from 
washington to rocky mount nc roots pilots certificate was not 
suspended but he cannot fly without medical certification 
in a letter dated wednesday faa counsel donald p byrne told 
root faa administrator james b busey ordered the suspension and 
safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the 
immediate effectiveness of this order 
the letter said root had 10 days to appeal to the national 
transportation safety board which is investigating the incident 
root has challenged in court the boards use of his psychiatric 
records claiming florida law protects their confidentiality 
roots attorney gene propper said the hospital had refused to 
release the records but inadvertently sent them to the safety board 
along with other medical documents

the bush administration is expected to 
announce next week that it will make it a crime for any american to 
do business with panamas gen manuel antonio noriega or firms in 
which he has an interest 
the penalty for violators is a jail term or fines of 500000 
officials said friday 
the sanction is the product of an effort by the administration 
to find ways of pressuring noriega without further damaging the 
panamanian economy in an additional bid to deprive panama of 
sorely needed income the administration also is considering 
barring panamanianflag vessels from us ports said the 
administration officials 
panama has been in a steep economic decline over the past year 
and a half partly as a result of limited sanctions imposed by the 
united states 
many of the more than 30 firms targeted by the new sanctions are 
used as intermediaries for illegal trade between the united states 
and cuba 
the us move will not only tighten the embargo against cuba but 
will also affect firms in which noriega has an interest said the 
officials who asked not to be identified 
the sanction was first reported by the los angeles times in its 
friday editions state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler had 
no comment on the report 
cuba has found the panamanian firms identified with noriega to 
be useful using them to import high technology usmade items 
which would otherwise be beyond cubas reach because of the trade 
embargo 
the firms also have served as conduits for illegal cuban exports 
to the united states officials said speaking on condition they 
not be identified 
the bush administration has been searching for additional ways 
to weaken noriega since long before the abortive coup attempt 
against him almost three weeks ago 
the administration has not ruled out the use of force but 
visiting spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez said friday any 
such step would be unwise 
interventionism is never desirable gonzalez said shortly 
before ending his twoday visit here 
he praised president bush for not committing us forces to 
allout support for the rebel officers who revolted against noriega 
gonzalez has called for new elections in panama and for the 
newly elected leadership to have the authority to name a new 
defense force commander to replace noriega

a small generic drug manufacturer in new york 
is recalling seven products because the company filed false 
information to win government approval for the drugs according to 
the company and government officials 
quantum pharmics of amityville ny last month suspended the 
production and distribution of all 21 of its generic drugs pending 
completion of an internal audit 
american home products corp of new york said the audit found 
that the seven drugs being recalled had been approved on the 
basis of false information filed by the companys quantums prior 
management the company said friday 
american home products completed acquisition of quantum in june 
1988 said spokeswoman carol emerling 
the fda said for some of the drugs the company told the agency 
the size of the production batch submitted for testing to gain fda 
approval was larger than it actually was for other drugs the fda 
said it was concerned about data submitted in the original 
applications for approval 
the drugs being recalled are minoxidil tablets chlorazepate 
dipotassium tablets meclofenamate sodium capsules trazadone 
doxepin diazepam and lorazapam 
both the fda and the company said there was no indication of any 
safety problem with any of the drugs

investigated by the fda following disclosures of irregularities 
ranging from falsified records to misrepresentation of test data

the leader of a clerical workers union says 
employers are using computer surveillance to supervise their 
employees out of control and fear 
karen nussbaum executive director of 9to5 the national 
association of working women appealed to computer specialists 
friday to help curb abuses that she says are leaving many of the 
nations lowestpaid workers frustrated in their workplace 
a management strategy characterized by this lack of commitment 
to and faith in the workforce requires a supervision style based on 
control and fear she said surveillance and control now take 
the place of supervision commitment and training 
you are the creators of this wonderful technology she told 
a meeting sponsored by computer professionals for social 
responsibility a public interest group based in palo alto calif 
but it is misused and there is no one with more credibility than 
you to speak out against this misuse 
ms nussbaum also serves as president of district 925 of the 
service employees international union representing about 10000 
clerical workers 
computer monitoring is most widely used with workers using video 
display terminals modern technology enables employers to 
automatically monitor a variety of work performance data including 
keyboard strokes typing mistakes time spent on each phone call 
and rest breaks 
the congressional office of technology assessment has said 
there are strong arguments that the present extent of 
computerbased monitoring is only a preview of growing 
technological capabilities for monitoring surveillance and worker 
testing on the job 
if this is the case then there may be a need for a new 
balance between workers rights to privacy or autonomy in the 
workplace and management requirements for information ota said 
in a 1987 report 
several states including connecticut massachusetts 
minnesota new jersey oregon and rhode island are considering 
bills that seek to regulate computer monitoring practices 
industry management officials generally argue that computer 
monitoring if properly used benefits employees by providing an 
objective basis for evaluating work performance and rewarding more 
productive workers 
ms nussbaum cited a survey released earlier this year by the 
massachusetts coalition on new office technology a bostonbased 
unionaffiliated group which took questionnaire responses from 
more than 700 electronically monitored office workers 
the survey found 62 percent of the respondents were not informed 
they would be monitored prior to hiring 75 percent of the workers 
said monitoring lowers morale and 80 percent said monitoring makes 
their job more stressful 
this survey shows deep alienation from the work process and 
these feelings are substantiated by study after study ms 
nussbaum said

a polish sailor who is seeking political asylum 
says he fears for his life if hes deported even though an 
american judge doesnt think the newly liberalized polish 
government poses any threat 
i will be persecuted i will be jailed i might lose my life 
if i am returned to poland because the media there knows that i 
have asked for asylum polish fisherman roman marczak 25 said 
through an interpreter 
immigration judge jesse sellers ruled thursday that marczak had 
nothing to fear from the recently reformed polish government 
i think the applicant has failed to prove a wellfounded fear 
of persecution by the present government of poland sellers said 
prior to those recent changes i think he would have had a 
wellfounded fear 
marczak is totally ignoring changes made in communist bloc 
countries in the past year the judge said 
marczak was one of nine fishermen who defected in anchorage 
alaska in midaugust all are being held in the immigration and 
naturalization services aurora detention facility where marczaks 
hearing was held 
he is assured of remaining in the united states for up to 
another four months as his case is appealed 
its a bad decision based on an erroneous legal stcndard 
said dan kowalski marczaks lawyer im very pessimistic about 
the other cases if this case cant win im dubious that any of 
the other cases will win this was one of the stronger cases 
the ins in a departure from past practice refused the 
fishermens requests for temporary work permits and transported 
them to the detention center here contending the fishermen were 
seeking lucrative jobs on american boats not freedom from 
political persecution

fifty chinese scholars expressed surprise and 
indignation over a tokyo court ruling against revising textbooks 
that avoid calling japans 1930s attack on china an aggression 
we chinese are reluctant to keep bringing up the bitter past 
but that does not mean that we can allow the japanese to hurt 
chinese feelings by distorting history the academics said in a 
statement friday later carried by the official xinhua news agency 
china says at least 200000 people were killed when japanese 
troops invaded nanjing in 1937 and it has strongly objected to 
japanese textbooks characterizing the military campaign as an 
advance rather than aggression 
the scholars attending a symposium on the sinojapanese war of 
193745 said japanese aggression against china during that period 
was firmly maintained by the international community 
tokyo district court this month ruled the governments 
inspection of textbooks is legal but said there were mistakes in 
the education ministrys orders that parts of a historians

his chances and how they might affect the race thats about as

a flurry of earthquakes that hit northern china 
this week destroyed 27500 homes and left more than 50000 
homeless radio beijing said today 
the broadcast monitored in tokyo also said there have been 
1500 aftershocks four between 50 and 60 on the richter scale 
since the initial temblors devastated farming villages late 
wednesday and early thursday 
there were no new reports of casualties today in the official 
press which has carried little coverage of the quakes official 
reports friday said 29 people were killed and more than 150 injured 
the communist partys peoples daily said today that the temblor 
caused damage in 40 villages over a 320squaremile area mostly in 
northern shanxi province 
it said 1600 soldiers were mobilized to help relief operations 
and that such items as bread noodles chopsticks quilts tents 
mats and medical supplies were rushed to the affected areas 
however the report emphasized that production and commerce were 
little affected by the quakes it said coal production in datong 
the provinces main city exceeded its normal daily output thursday 
the beijing radio report also said 32400 houses were damaged 
and in danger of collapse and that cracks had appeared in the 
shanxi no 2 dam 
a western reporter in the stricken area friday night said 
peasants rigged tents of quilts and straw and gathered around fires 
in nearfreezing temperatures 
northern shanxi is an impoverished area located on a windswept 
plain about 4000 feet above sea level the local population works 
in coal mines or scratches out a living by growing wheat and corn 
in the dusty infertile soil 
many live in homes of mud and stone that easily crumble in 
earthquakes 
chinese seismologists said the quakes were the worst to hit 
northern china since 1976 when a temblor measuring at least 78 on 
the richter scale killed 240000 people in northeastern tangshan 
the strongest quake thursday registered 61 on the richter scale 
despite the destruction casualties appeared to be low because 
many people fled their homes after a first quake late wednesday and 
were outside when the second big tremor destroyed their dwellings 
the richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph a quake 
measuring 60 can cause severe damage in a populated area

two new england universities are using different tactics to 
grapple with racist attacks and racial hostility on their campuses 
the university of massachusetts launched a week of events aimed 
at greater racial understanding at brown university authorities 
reacting to attacks on asian and white students said they were 
canceling a dance sponsored by a black fraternity but later the 
dance was rescheduled 
some students had protested the cancellation 
the whole black community is upset we feel the university is 
holding blacks liable for the attacks in providence said john 
robertson vice president of omega psi phi fraternity theyre 
cutting the social lives of black students at brown right out from 
underneath them theyre taking away the places we go to get away 
from the academic rigors at brown 
robert reichley vice president for university affairs said the 
event had been rescheduled and moved to a more internally located 
part of campus 
officials at the ivy league school in providence ri said the 
party was moved to discourage high school or nonbrown students 
from attending 
there have been 19 attacks on 22 brown students since classes 
began in september at least 14 white and asian men described their 
attackers as black teenagers believed to be from offcampus 
meanwhile at the university of massachusetts at amherst 
officials opened civility week an eightday series of events 
designed to promote racial harmony on the campus the series of 
events being held for the second year marks a brawl that followed 
the 1986 world series it left one black student seriously injured 
a number of racial incidents have occurred at new england 
campuses in the last two years 
at exclusive smith college racist notes were slipped under the 
doors of minority students last spring at hampshire and williams 
colleges also located in western massachusetts sitins were held 
in the spring of 1988 to demand more attention to racial issues on 
campus 
in march of this year go home notes were shoved under a 
black students door at umass this semester a black man was 
assaulted by three white nonstudents 
racism on campus is difficult to predict and hard to stamp out 
said the director of the national institute against prejudice and 
violence 
were talking about a form of terrorism and there isnt any 
defense said howard ehrlich director of research at the 
baltimorebased institute in order to build up a defense you 
wind up sacrificing a lot of peoples personal rights and 
liberties 
ehrlich said the institute estimates one out of five minority 
students are victimized during the course of an academic year 
based on case studies on a dozen campuses 
he said he recommends that colleges take a twopronged approach 
to racism institute stiff punishment for offenders and establish a 
core of educational programs 
you cannot organize to stop random acts so what you try to do 
in a sense is to inoculate a campus to deal with the effects and 
the impacts he said you can watch your curriculum and you can 
watch the way in which the university as an institution deals with 
matters of group relations

shouldnt be ordained

within anglicanism who oppose the ordination of women hold a 
recognized theological position 
runcie commended the bishops for their courtesy and respect 
toward those who reject the american churchs position 
i pay tribute to that spirit of unity and to the wise and 
sensitive pastoral leadership of bishop browning which has done so 
much to foster it he said it needs translation into every 
diocese in the communion edmond browning is the presiding 
episcopal bishop

rep robert garcia became the second congressman 
convicted in the wedtech scandal when he and his wife were found 
guilty of extortion and conspiracy for taking bribes and 
interestfree loans from the company 
the federal jury said friday that robert and jane lee garcia 
conspired to obtain 175000 in payments and a 1900 emerald and 
diamond necklace for mrs garcia from 1984 to 1986 in exchange 
for garcias political influence in helping the nowdefunct 
military contractor get government business 
the democrat and his wife were acquitted of bribery and receipts 
of illegal gratuities 
the verdict shows that the jury can see through sophisticated 
methods used by politicians to sell political influence said the 
lead prosecutor assistant us attorney edward little 
another bronx congressman former rep mario biaggi was 
convicted in a wedtech racketeering case last year and sentenced to 
eight years in prison 
others convicted in the wedtech scandal were e robert wallach 
a friend of exus attorney edwin meese former bronx borough 
president stanley simon and wedtech founder john mariotta 
the garcias face up to five years in prison on the conspiracy 
charge and up to 20 years on each of two counts of extortion 
sentencing was set for jan 5 ronald fischetti a lawyer for 
jane lee garcia said the verdict would be appealed 
as the jury forewoman read off the first guilty verdict garcia 
reached over and squeezed his wifes hand afterward he appeared 
shaken and his voice broke when he read a prepared statement to 
reporters 
my faith in god remains strong so i remain strong said 
garcia the son of a pentecostal minister he recalled a song he 
sang in church in the good times you praise his name in the 
bad times you do the same 
garcia 56 didnt announce if he intended to give up his seat 
which he has held since 1978 
in the next few weeks i will be consulting with my political 
advisers and the democratic party leaders about the best way of my 
preserving the interests of my constituents he said 
garcia doesnt automatically lose his house seat the 
constitution gives each chamber of congress sole authority for 
disciplining its members 
under house rules a convicted member is urged but not 
required to abstain from voting in committee or on the floor 
unless he is later cleared of wrongdoing or is reelected to his 
seat after being indicted garcia was effectively stripped of the 
chairmanship of the banking subcommittee on policy research and 
insurance 
the garcias monthlong trial was the seventh to stem from the 
wideranging scandal at wedtech the small south bronx machine shop 
that grew into a multimilliondollar defense contractor through 
various bribe schemes 
the company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of corruption 
one extortion charge against the garcias dealt with 76000 
allegedly funneled by wedtech through an attorney in puerto rico to 
mrs garcias consulting firm leesonia enterprises in numerous 
payments between 1984 and 1986 
the attorney ralph vallone jr a close friend of mrs garcia 
was charged with the garcias but was severed from the trial for 
health reasons 
the other extortion charge was for a 20000 nointerest loan 
garcia received from wedtech in 1985 testimony showed garcia 
instructed wedtech to make the loan to his sister who transferred 
the money to mrs garcia 
the conspiracy count also included a 77500 investment 
mariottas wife made in a benetton store mrs garcia wanted to open 
in puerto rico another 1500 loan from wedtech to garcia and the 
necklace which mariotta bought for mrs garcia the day after the 
garcias set up a 1985 meeting between wedtech officials and gov 
rafael hernandezcolon of puerto rico

five railroad cars full of rotting refuse 
were on their way back to philadelphia today after state officials 
won a court order blocking a plan to dump the garbage in indiana 
the state department of environmental management said the four 
companies involved in carting the trash lacked a permit allowing 
garbage to be transferred from railroad cars to dump trucks 
the cars headed back friday after the state obtained a 
restraining order against the dumping and threatened to fine the 
trash haulers 25000 for each day the garbage was parked at a 
terre haute rail yard the order was issued by a clay county 
circuit judge in brazil ind 
the household trash originally was destined for the center point 
landfill near brazil about 60 miles west of indianapolis near 
terre haute 
fridays action is really intended to send a message to 
anybody that if theyre going to bring their trash into indiana 
theyre going to have to do it legally environmental management 
commissioner kathy prosser said in a telephone interview 
susan shadley an attorney representing the four companies 
didnt respond to a telephone request for comment 
its not surprising to see boxcars of garbage being shipped 
across the country prosser said this really symbolizes a 
bigger problem this nation has a lot of states have never 
addressed how theyre going to manage their solid waste 
the disposal dispute recalled the saga of a freighter also 
from philadelphia that sailed the seas for two years searching 
for a place to dump 14000 tons of ash from burned garbage it was 
rejected by 11 countries before turning up empty in singapore late 
in 1988 after changing names and owners 
the garbageladen rail cars emitting a foul smell and with 
steam rising from their cargo in the cold air left a conrail yard 
about 1030 am headed east officials said 
the conrail train was to have left the state by early today 
heading back to pennsylvania through ohio prosser said 
she said the trains progress was being monitored and that ohio 
and pennsylvania officials would be alerted it was heading their 
way 
mayor pete chalos of terre haute learned thursday that the 
garbage cars were in his city and organized a hunt to locate them 
prosser then sent investigators to the rail yard late thursday 
the cars had been in indiana since late last week 
a us supreme court ruling prohibits indiana from stopping 
solid waste from entering the state in railroad cars however 
state solidwaste rules forbid trash from being unloaded from 
railroad cars onto trucks that would take it to landfills 
the four companies involved in the garbage transport included 
the terre haute brazil amp eastern railroad inc of terre haute 
girard point transfer station inc of philadelphia and united 
waste removal inc and ok storage transfer amp cartage inc of 
louisville ky said bettie cadou a spokeswoman for the 
department of environmental management

zones by 90 percent and take down the barbed wire in many areas 
kgb officials told a soviet legislative committee 
tass the soviet news agency said the committee was told 
bordercrossing procedures will also be simplified the committee 
oversees the kgb and the defense ministry 
in its report friday tass did not specify the area now 
protected by 200000 border guards or how the zone will be cut 
the kgb is trying to soften its image and move away from a cold 
war mentality in keeping with president mikhail s gorbachevs 
push for greater openness and democracy 
a kgb official said moscows better relations with neighbors 
prompted the move and kgb head vladimir a kryuchkov said there 
was no longer any reason to maintain such a large border zone the 
news agency said 
kgb deputy chief vadim matrosov told the defense and security 
committee the southern border particularly with afghanistan 
requires extra guards to combat smuggling and armed gangs but in 
general improving relations with china iran and nato members 
turkey and norway has meant reduced border tension 
in some places the forbidden border zone is hundreds of miles 
wide and even along the soviet unions border with warsaw pact 
allies moscow has strung barbed wire and placed armed kgb guards 
in towers 
foreigners are barred from a 16milewide strip along the soviet 
borders with norway finland iran turkey and afghanistan 
the country plans to remove the barbedwire entanglement in 
many areas tass said 
about 3400 people illegally crossed into border zones since 
last year tass said

spokeswoman said 
atlantis is scheduled to touch down at this mojave desert base

a judge barred the city from enforcing an 
ordinance which bans sales of semiautomatic assault weapons 
judge luther alverson of superior court in fulton county ruled 
friday for the second time that only the general assembly can 
regulate the sale of firearms in july the judge blocked 
enforcement of an almost identical fulton county ordinance 
alverson said he would grant temporary restraining orders 
against the city council police and mayor andrew young 
attorney martha glisson a lawyer for citizens for safe 
government a gunfanciers group that challenged the law argued 
that the local laws are so vague and broadly written that even 
sporting weapons could be considered illegal by police 
assistant city attorney joe m harris argued that the city 
ordinance isnt preempted by state law because he said it goes 
farther than any state legislation now on the books 
both ordinances were aimed at limiting drug dealers access to 
weapons like uzi semiautomatic pistols rifles and the ak47 
assault rifle

parliament voted to rehabilitate 
victims of the military crackdown that followed the 1956 
anticommunist uprising and declared next monday the day the 
revolt began a day of reconciliation 
the vote friday ended a weeklong parliamentary session devoted 
to moving the country toward multiparty democracy and the first 
freely contested elections since the communists consolidated power 
in 1948 
the house also voted to disband the workers militia 
established after the 1956 revolt to protect the communist party 
the communist party itself was disbanded oct 7 and the new 
hungarian socialist party which is committed to democratic ideals 
took its place 
the new party largely led by the same people who led the 
communist party had backed a motion to disarm the 60000man force 
but keep it as a civil defense organization but this was defeated 
the house also overwhelmingly approved a proposal by house 
speaker matyas szueros to declare oct 23 a day of national 
reconciliation however the house rejected a motion favored by 
the opposition to make it a national holiday 
let us be understanding of each others differing opinions 
the statement adopted by the house on the commemoration said 
tens of thousands are expected to participate in a peaceful 
rally called by 23 opposition groups of parliament on monday to 
mark the 33rd anniversary of the revolt in the past such rallies 
were prohibited 
csaba vass a member of the socialist party presidium told a 
news conference that his party would not try to take the initiative 
away from the opposition 
in a statement the socialist party presidium said it rejects 
the soviet invasion that crushed the revolt and opposed all forms 
of intervention or interference in a countrys sovereignty 
the house adopted two bills exonerating victims of political 
trials and other reprisals one bill rehabilitated those convicted 
of revolutionary activity after 1956 and pledged unspecified 
compensation to victims of reprisals 
earlier this year the government rehabilitated imre nagy the 
leader of the uprising and several of his close associates 
a second bill also formally rehabilitated those victimized 
between 1948 and 1962 the period now officially considered 
hungarys stalinist period 
reforms enacted over the past year have put hungary at the 
forefront of democratic change in eastern europe along with poland 
the only country in the soviet bloc with a noncommunistled 
government 
earlier in the day the body adopted an electoral law envisaging 
a modified system of proportional representation meant to give all 
parties a chance to win mandates 
it also adopted a bill outlining plans for a presidential 
election but put off deciding on a specific date the socialist 
party and most of the major opposition groups tentatively agreed 
nov 26 would be a direct election with subsequent presidents 
appointed by parliament 
but some opposition groups fearing the short campaign period 
would give the socialist party candidate an unfair advantage 
collected more than 100000 signatures the amount needed to force 
a plebiscite for a referendum on the issue parliament is to 
debate it at its next session oct 30 
on thursday the house passed legislation permitting opposition 
parties to operate and field candidates in the elections

gov bob martinez was hoping an 
11000yearold living coral reef could succeed where he floridas 
congressional delegation and thousands of angry citizens so far 
have failed 
but interior secretary manuel lujan refused to commit to a 
permanent ban on oil exploration and drilling off floridas shores 
friday despite a firsthand look at parrotfish and barracuda 
darting among brain coral in the waters off key largo 
its a very beautiful area what most impressed me is how 
fragile the area is and what a resource it is for all of florida 
said lujan after viewing some of floridas estimated 6000 reefs 
from a helicopter and a glassbottomed boat 
the reefs a key element of a state economy largely based on 
tourism and fishing are downcurrent from the oil fields of the 
gulf of mexico and would be devastated by an oil spill there 
martinez said 
we are looking for a permanent solution said martinez 
what weve been able to get so far is yeartoyear bans on leases 
and thats been very nervewracking 
the sightseeing tour also made good politics for the republican 
governor whose constituents overwhelmingly supported calls for a 
permanent ban on offshore oil and gas exploration at public 
hearings around the state this year 
but lujan who chairs president bushs task force on outer 
continental shelf drilling said he has to give equal weight to 
both environmental and development interests and cant reveal his 
intentions before the task force gives its report to the president 
on jan 1 
it would be unfair of me to make that decision before meeting 
with other members of the task force said the secretary 
lujan also noted that buying back the existing 73 leases from 
nine companies would be an expensive proposition 
people put up 105 million and they have a legitimate right to 
it having paid for it lujan said they can take us to court 
a temporary drilling ban is in effect through october 1990 but 
mobil and unocal already have proposals to set up exploratory 
platforms and begin oil drilling on their leases as soon as the 
deadline passes 
similar oneyear moratoriums are in effect at the georges bank 
off new england in alaskas bristol bay and off parts of northern 
and southern california 
a bill supported by the governor and floridas entire delegation 
in washington would prohibit the interior secretary from issuing 
new oil and gas leases in the gulf of mexico from naples south to 
the florida keys and provide funds to buy back existing leases

a chinese man and two women who fled china 
to avoid arrest for involvement in junes prodemocracy protests 
have secretly arrived for resettlement officials said today 
government officials said the three identified as tien 
hsinjen 43 bai hsueh 26 and chin chin 27 are the first 
chinese involved in the prodemocracy movement to receive 
permission to settle in taiwan 
seven others were expected to arrive later the officials said 
the three attended a news conference today arranged by the 
semiofficial free china relief association but they continually 
used magazines to shield their faces from photographers 
they said they feared communist authorities might identify them 
from the photographs and persecute their relatives in china 
officials declined to say whether the three were using 
pseudonyms and refused to disclose how they escaped from china 
before arriving in taiwan from undisclosed european countries 
earlier this week 
a number of prodemocracy demonstrators including student 
leaders have fled china to escape arrest since june when chinese 
troops rolled into beijings tiananmen square to suppress the 
movement hundreds and perhaps thousands of people died in the 
crackdown

the end of exxons oilspill cleanup 
helped push alaskas unemployment rate up more than a percentage 
point to 73 percent in september the labor department reported 
the rate was up from 59 percent in august but low compared to 
the 87 percent rate in september 1988 
the loss of about 2700 cleanup jobs and sharp seasonal job 
declines in fish processing and tourism reversed a fivemonth drop 
in the states unemployment rate that began with the cleanup boom 
the states unemployment rate from april to august was the 
lowest recorded since at least 1976 the department said

decisions that will affect how prince 
william sound is restored are being made by anonymous federal 
officials who are ignoring local interests according to alaskas 
attorney general 
at issue is the trustee council a highlevel government group 
charged under federal law with determining the longterm damage 
from the exxon valdez oil spill an assessment that eventually will 
be used to determine how much exxon corp must pay to restore the 
environment 
the council includes the federal secretaries of interior 
agriculture and commerce and a state representative commissioner 
don collinsworth of the alaska department of fish and game 
a group of federal and state scientists and bureaucrats have 
been working together on the assessment and related studies and 
they report to the trustees attorney general douglas baily said 
friday 
but their decisions have regularly been overturned once they 
get back to the policymaking people back in washington he said 
theyll be rewritten in washington by parties unknown 
the exxon valdez hit a reef march 24 and spilled about 11 
million gallons of oil into the prince william sound exxons 
cleanup operation in the sound ended in september but may continue 
in the spring 
the council staff has held several meetings in washington 
without enough notice to permit state representatives to attend 
baily said he said the council has yet to name a chairman or 
lead trustee and to his knowledge the trustees have never met 
together 
were still under the direction of a headless horseperson and 
nobody has final say so nobodys accountable he said 
there has been an inordinate amount of time spent trying to 
figure out where we are and to keep track of what other people are 
doing at meetings where we are not invited baily said 
bob walker an interior department spokesman in washington said 
the federal trustees have met several times with william reilly 
director of the environmental protection agency he said alaskan 
officials declined to participate in the meetings 
baily disagreed 
i dont know that theres ever been a meeting of the trustees 
period he said i have never heard that they have ever sat 
down in the same room on this topic 
federal and state officials were in disagreement about the 
formation of the council with alaska demanding that collinsworth 
be named the lead trustee 
walker acknowledged the dispute was over power 
the feeling of several of the trustees was that they could not 
operate that way that they would be yielding authority they could 
not yield he said 
baily said that while the state and federal officials in the 
field are working well their recommendations are being ignored 
for example the staff recently recommended a threeyear budget to 
fund its research but officials in washington limited it to a year 
without consulting the state baily said 
many times a report goes back to washington and it comes out 
in a different form 
another brewing dispute with ramifications beyond the spill is 
over who owns the tidelands and submerged lands in prince william 
sound 
baily said alaskan officials believe the tide and submerged 
lands belong to the state of alaska but the federal government 
through the forest service has insisted since the spill that it 
owns those lands

four former cordis corp officials accused of 
selling defective heart pacemakers from 1983 to 1985 have been 
found innocent in federal court 
the defendants were acquitted friday after a sixweek trial on 
conspiracy and related charges in what the government claimed was 
the sale of 2200 defective pacemakers and 6000 corrosionprone 
batteries 
harold hershenson 62 a former executive vice president john 
pagones 64 former vice president for corporate product assurance 
stephen vadas 48 manager for product administration and dean 
ciporkin 42 senior reliability assurance engineer all were 
cleared by the 12member federal jury 
all four left cordis which has since sold off its pacemaker 
division 
the miamibased company itself previously had pleaded guilty and 
paid a 764000 fine along with 5 million in civil penalties to 
various federal agencies 
the fda said the pacemakers could have stopped without warning 
yet no deaths were attributed to failure of the devices implanted 
under the skin to regulate the heartbeat 
company officials knew of the problems but sold the pacemakers 
anyway according to the charges 
cordis pacemaker business was sold to the australian medical 
device manufacturer telectronics cordis now concentrates on making 
catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for 
monitoring pressure on the brain 
a company statement released after the verdict that cardis was 
extremely gratified by the acquittals 
we fully supported the individuals and have always believed 
that no crime had been committed the unsigned statement said

after two weeks of negotiations delegates to an 
international conference on the antarctic disagreed over how to 
protect the frozen continents environment and next year might 
consider making it a global nature reserve 
representatives of the 39 signatory nations of the antarctica 
treaty of 1959 said friday discussion of comprehensive 
environmental measures would be continued next year 
the paris meeting was the latest installment of an unfolding 
drama about the future of a frozen continent larger than the united 
states and mexico combined 
a member of belgiums delegation predicted privately that 
before the 1990 meeting public opinion will create pressure for 
stringent protection 
this is a big day for the environment said jim barnes 
director of the antarctic and southern oceans coalition an 
umbrella for about 200 environmental groups although most 
substantive matters were postponed barnes said just focusing world 
attention on antartica was significant 
there is momentum that is leading to antarctica being 
declared a special place unlike any other on earth barnes said 
no time or place was immediately announced for next years 
meeting 
the united states britain and new zealand support an 
international minerals convention that would open antarctica to 
regulated mining they sought to exclude discussion of the nature 
reserve from the 1990 discusssions 
we were not prepared to accept any proposal that predicted the 
outcome of the next meeting or ran counter to our position said 
tucker scully head of the us delegation 
a mining convention worked out over six years of negotiations 
was signed in june 1988 in wellington new zealand washington 
wants a meeting next year to discuss the convention which it says 
sets stringent standards and offers the most practical way of 
safeguarding the antarctic environment 
the convention does not assign liability for accidents such as 
oil spills two fuel leaks at us bases in antarctica have been 
announced this month 
australia and france want to declare antarctica a wilderness 
park where mining would be prohibited and human activity 
carefully controlled they were joined recently by italy belgium 
india greece austria and bulgaria 
the us delegation has agreed to a separate meeting on the 
mining convention barnes the environmentalist representative 
called the planned talks victory for common sense 
delegates to the paris conference agreed on minor issues 
adopting a waste disposal code and extending international marine 
pollution conventions to include the seas around antarctica they 
also created a category of areas to be given special protection 
because they are wild beautiful or geologically important 
the 1959 treaty set aside all territorial claims to antarctica 
and declared it a region of peace and scientific cooperation

rockwell international corp will 
close the nuclear hot lab at its rocketdyne division plant a 
facility besieged by protests from nearby residents and 
antinuclear activists 
rocketdyne president bob paster defended the nuclear safety 
track record of the field laboratory in a statement announcing the 
decision friday he said community pressure contributed to the 
decision to close the lab 
while the hot lab poses no threat to safety health or the 
environment we hope closure of the facility will allay concerns 
and will assure the public of our commitment to the community in 
which we live and work paster said in the prepared statement 
rockwell which was pursuing a 10year renewal of a special 
nuclear materials license to operate the hot lab will instead 
request a oneyear extension lasting through next october to 
complete existing work and file a decontamination plan with the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
most of the work at the lab was decladding the taking apart 
of nuclear fuel to remove the plutonium and uranium for shipment to 
approved doe storage sites the last of the decladding work was 
done in 1986 but the lab continued to handle nuclear material 
rocketdyne critics and neighbors applauded the announcement 
that is great that is the best news ive heard in a long 
time said jim werner of the natural resources defense council 
an environmental group that opposed the labs relicensing bid 
opponents contended the plant leaked small amounts of 
radioactivity but us department of energy and state and federal 
environmental agencies all reported that conditions there do not 
pose an immediate health risk 
the amount of radioactivity to be handled in the hot lab for the 
remainder of its life will be less than that found in a typical 
neighborhood hospital radiation therapy unit company officials 
said 
the shutdown of the lab wasnt expected to cause any job losses 
or adversely affect the companys business officials said 
established in the late 1940s the lab is near simi valley 
about 30 miles northwest of downtown los angeles

the distance between a school yard and a drug 
dealer is measured in a straight line a federal appeals court 
ruled 
the 9th circuit court of appeals on friday rejected the claim of 
a convicted drug dealer that a federal law imposing strict 
penalties for drug peddling within 1000 feet of a school should be 
measured by how far children would have to walk to the crime scene 
everton gladstone watson was convicted of selling marijuana at a 
market about 960 feet from an elementary school said his lawyer 
michael brush 
students would have had to walk more than 1000 feet from the 
school to reach watson brush said 
but the appeals court ruled that a straight line measurement 
creates a readily ascertainable zone of protection for children 
watson was sentenced last year to two years in prison under the 
law which imposes a minimum oneyear sentence

economic growth was cut almost in half this year 
by lower production strikes and ethnic unrest while foreign trade 
and consumer prices were higher a government official said 
growth was 24 percent in the first nine months of 1989 
compared to 47 percent in the same period last year said nikolai 
g belov deputy chairman of the state committee for statistics 
negative tendencies were notably on an increase from july to 
september caused mostly by the weakening of production discipline 
ethnic conflicts and strikes the official tass news agency 
quoted belov as saying 
soviet coal miners walked of their jobs this summer demanding 
better working conditions they also made political demands 
local ethnic disputes brought on strikes in factories in the 
republics of azerbaijan moldavia and estonia last month armenias 
economy largely shut down after an azerbaijani rail blockade cut 
off supplies of fuel food and building materials in a dispute over 
a territory both republics claim 
consumer prices rose 26 percent so far this year and demand 
remains greater than supply belov said 
there has been a 57 percent increase in consumer goods lower 
than the plan which called for 10 percent he said 
in the first nine months foreign trade grew by 28 percent and 
all but 05 percent of it was increased imports belov said 
belov said the number of foreign companies forming joint 
ventures with soviet companies grew to 936 involving 53 different 
countries and employ 15000 people soviet and foreign 
agriculture officials anticipate an improved grain harvest this 
year belov said he gave the harvest figure to date as about 209 
million tons compared with 195 million tons at this time last year 
in washington the us agriculture department said the soviet 
union was continuing to buy large amounts of grain from the united 
states 
it said sales for 198889 were more about 217 million tons 
163 million tons of corn and 54 million tons of wheat in 
addition sales included 442500 tons of soybeans 135 million 
tons of soybean meal and 102 million tons of grain sorghums

mask on display at an antiques show that a hopi priest said was 
stolen from an arizona indian reservation about seven months ago 
as soon as i saw it i knew it was ours said the priest 
herman lewis at a friday news conference

is key to the rites of passage to young hopis said leigh jenkins 
director of the tribes cultural preservation office 
gary kimble executive director of the indian affairs

like a jewish community being unable to hold a bar mitzvah

34000 and then sold it to an unidentified connecticut dealer for 
75000 friday it was on display but not for sale at a show

baer who it the greatest pueblo mask ive ever seen and 
said he bought the mask for 70000 in april from a private

britain today accused its former 
colonies in the commonwealth of being wrongheaded as the 
49nation summit finalized a new strategy seeking tighter financial 
pressure on south africa 
but british foreign secretary john major said the organization 
recognized for the first time sanctions should not be punitive and 
should be scaled down if the whiteled government delivers on 
promises of reform 
we do not wish to hand a brokenbacked economy over to a new 
south africa in due course major said in an interview with the 
british broadcasting corp 
in a separate development the commonwealth summit issued a 
declaration on the environment which in a victory for the 
developed nations failed to give outright support to an indian 
demand to set up a new environmental fund 
commonwealth leaders debated the south africa draft today during 
a weekend retreat at langkawi a luxury resort island 210 miles 
northwest of the capital midway through the weeklong summit 
malayasian officials said the final communique will be issued 
sunday 
major rejected both the call to tighten financial screws on 
south africa and to reappoint a foreign ministers committee 
drawing up the communique on financial sanctions 
we think theyre both wrongheaded he said 
the draft was drawn up after the 10nation foreign ministers 
committee including britain argued into the early hours 
diplomatic sources said the draft incorporated the essence of a 
fivepoint australian plan which stipulates that the commonwealth 
will try to squeeze south africas foreign loans and trade credits 
while the dispute remained the outcome appeared to reflect the 
first signs of concensus on a policy toward south africa by the 
49nation association of britain and its former colonies 
the draft the sources said stipulates that a reappointed 
committee of eight foreign ministers which has monitored sanctions 
for the past two years will meet next april to examine how far 
fw de klerk south africas new president who took office in 
august has moved toward reform 
south africa quit the commonwealth in 1961 
the commmittee expanded to nine with summit host malayasia is 
chaired by canada and also includes four of the most deeply hostile 
critics of south africa the black african nations of zimbabwe 
zambia nigeria and tanzania the 10point declaration on the 
environment approved saturday morning by the commonwealth leaders 
called for additional support for the development of 
international funding mechanisms to preserve the enviroment 
and it said these should take account of indias proposal 
for a new planet protection fund stopping well short of 
endorsing the proposal 
developed countries led by britains prime minister margaret 
thatcher argued a new fund would be an unnecessary duplication and 
that all aid should be channelled through the un environmental 
protection program 
the commonwealth in 1986 adopted 11 nonbinding sanctions 
including bans on air links new investment and imports of 
agricultural products iron steel coal and uranium britain the 
largest foreign investor in south africa strongly resisted the 
idea of a list but eventually applied a handful of measures

syria has agreed to relocate some of 
its troops in beirut a development that moves lebanese lawmakers 
closer to agreeing on a peace plan for their country sources said 
today 
christian lawmakers also agreed to a new powersharing 
arrangement with rival moslems the sources said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the breakthroughs were disclosed one day before the final 
scheduled session of the fractured lebanese parliament in taif 
where moslem and christian lawmakers have been meeting in an effort 
to settle their 14yearold civil war 
the lawmakers would next meet in lebanon to formerly implement 
any plan reached on sunday 
whatever peace accord if any is drafted by lebanese lawmakers 
still must win the approval of the militia leaders who control the 
guns and the troops involved in lebanons civil war 
syria with 40000 troops in lebanon has been backing moslem 
forces in the war with the christians and is the main power broker 
in the divided country 
sources at the peace conference speaking on condition of 
anonymity said christian lawmakers have been consulting with gen 
michel aoun the commander of christian forces and other hardline 
leaders in beirut 
aouns insistence on a quick guaranteed timetable for the 
pullout of syrian troops has stalled the talks 
the conference sources have said syria accepted the idea that 
its troops pull out of a security zone around the lebanese 
parliament before it meets in formal sessions to approve political 
changes and elect a new president 
the syrians would be replaced by lebanese police backed by 
algerian and moroccan observers the sources said 
the sources however said syria refused a specific timetable 
for withdrawing from the rest of the country proposing instead 
that it be worked out by a joint syrialebanon committee 
the sources said the christians meanwhile agreed to political 
changes that are to give moslems a greater share of political 
power lebanons existing political was written when christians 
were thought to be in the majority but it is believed now that 
moslems comprise a greater share of the population 
christians have agreed to expand the size of parliament from 99 
seats to 128 with an equal number for moslems and christians 
the current parliament with only 73 surviving members from the 
last elections in 1972 was formed under the 6to5 advantage for 
christians a formula imposed when lebanon obtained independence 
from france in 1943 
syria agreed to provisions in the plan after saudi foreign 
minister saud alfaisal met with syrian leaders earlier this week 
the conference sources said christian lawmakers seemed 80 percent 
satisfied with the syrian response 
the 63 christian and moslem deputies have been in the mountain 
resort of taif since sept 30 
the sources quoted faisal as telling the christian deputies that 
what he got from damascus was the maximum 
christian deputies refused to comment to reporters saying they 
had first to properly study what was relayed from damascus 
moslem deputies on the other hand appeared to have no hesitation 
in accepting what was agreed upon in damascus with jamil kubi a 
respected moslem deputy saying each party got a prize and 
lebanon got the best prize

treasury secretary nicholas f brady says bush 
administration officials knew before stock market trading began 
last monday they likely werent facing a repeat of the 1987 crash 
i dont think anybody had an air of panic brady said friday 
in his first extensive public discussion of the sudden 190point 
drop in the dow jones industrial average on oct 13 
as senior administration officials gathered at the white house 
at 7 am monday the first trading day after the plunge they 
focused on the reaction of foreign markets which had been closed 
during the friday the 13th plummet he said 
it became clear as i stared at those statistics that it looked 
much more like a technical market change the us stock 
decline was picked up around the rest of the world but not added 
to that is an important distinction he said in an interview 
from the white house brady went to the treasury building and 
personally monitored developments on computer screens providing 
uptodate information simultaneously on stocks stock futures 
international currency and bond trading he said 
the market sharply recovered monday rising 88 points for the 
week it regained 120 points 
you shouldnt look at this loss on friday as some cataclysmic 
event but more of an instantaneous technical reaction he said 
two years earlier the story was different the market fell more 
than 100 points on a friday then crashed 508 points the next 
trading day which became known as black monday 
the treasury secretary who as a private citizen headed a 
presidential commission that investigated the 1987 crash said top 
administration officials had learned from the past 
this time officials were better prepared to coordinate their 
actions and statements and had much more sophisticated means of 
monitoring markets 
brady declined to say precisely what he would propose when he 
testifies next week in congress but he left little doubt that he 
hasnt changed his mind about the steps he recommended two years 
ago 
with all due modesty i might say theres been nothing written 
since that contravenes any of the information in the report so 
its in a certain sense a guide to what happened then and what 
you might need to do now he said 
among the recommendations then was that a single agency 
probably the federal reserve coordinate regulation of all 
financial markets 
the more progress we can make towards bringing the regulation 
into one place or to bring it into a high degree of coordination 
the better off were going to be at it he said 
then a wall street investment banker brady was widely praised 
for his report although the reagan administration failed to adopt 
many of its recommendations 
brady assisted by two harvard professors who are now senior 
deputies at treasury concluded the stock market in new york and 
the futures markets in chicago and to a degree stock and futures 
markets worldwide function as one market because of the speed of 
electronic communication and computerexecuted trading 
the implication of the conclusion that we had one market would 
indicate that too many different regulators for that one market 
dont make an awful lot of sense he said 
then as now the securities and exchange commission oversaw 
stock and options markets the commodity futures trading commission 
regulated futures markets and the federal reserve board set stock 
margins and supervised the payments system among banks and 
brokerage houses 
but brady acknowledged the political difficulty of disturbing 
regulatory turf that was divided years ago after the 1987 crash 
traders on the chicago futures markets and the members of congress 
who represent them resisted any changes in the regulatory lineup 
those geographic markets have their constituencies and they 
dont want to be changed brady said that doesnt mean that 
they shouldnt be 
the reagan administration did establish a working group through 
which the various agency heads could coordinate policy although 
none of the regulators have the power to impose their views on the 
others it continues to operate

thousands of people clutched candles and called 
for reform during a latenight vigil in dresden the government 
took a more tolerant line against such protests today promising to 
probe charges of police brutality at earlier rallies for democracy 
east germanys official adn news agency said the candlelight 
demonstration was held after lutheran church services in dresden 
late friday prodemocracy activists estimated the crowd at 50000 
but lutheran church sources and adn said 20000 participated 
adn said there was no trouble at the rally the latest in a 
series of protests held by an increasingly vocal populace unhappy 
with their governments strict adherence to socialism 
adn reported that the deputy police chief in east berlin pledged 
to investigate all allegations of police brutality during mass 
demonstrations two weeks ago 
dieter dietze was quoted as saying 60 complaints had been filed 
and they all would be thoroughly investigated 
police used force to break up prodemocracy protests that swept 
the nation two weeks ago but have shown restraint since then 
on friday east german officials appealed to tens of thousands 
of those who have fled west to return home spokesman wolfgang 
meyer said east berlins diplomatic missions would help east 
germans return home as quickly as possible 
we want to help anyone unless there are reasons to prevent 
it to come back home meyer said without elaborating 
the message was in sharp contrast to previous government 
statements denouncing those who took part in the exodus 
more than 55000 east germans have fled west in recent months 
discouraged by the stalinist social restrictions placed on them 
when other east european nations are moving toward democracy 
hardline leader erich honecker who had resisted reforms was 
replaced by his protege egon krenz on wednesday after 18 years in 
power krenz is also an orthodox proponent of strict party rule 
but he has sought to project a willingess for reforms as long as 
the communist partys leading role is not challenged 
since krenzs takeover staterun media have embarked on an 
unprecedented course of more critical reporting on economic and 
political problems 
meanwhile a west german official rejected conditions set by 
krenz for the possible loosening of travel for east germans to the 
west 
krenz said thursday that a new law would be drafted to expand 
east germans travel rights but made it clear that substantial 
economic and political hurdles stood in the way of letting everyone 
travel west 
many east germans say a lack of travel freedom is the hard to 
bear in the tightlycontrolled society it has in part fueled the 
exodus west 
but krenz said the biggest obstacle to freer travel is west 
germanys refusal to recognize east german citizenship 
east german leaders say economic problems also pose considerable 
obstacles because east germans need convertible currency to travel 
in the west 
dorothee wilms who heads west germanys ministry for 
intergerman relations said bonn will not change its position on 
the east german citizenship issue and charged that east berlin 
already receives millions of dollars worth of hard currency from 
west germany 
if east german officials really want to allow their citizens 
free travel to the west then they should use some of this money 
ms wilms said in an interview with west germanys zdf television 
network 
east german marks are not convertible to currencies traded on 
international markets and therefore have no real value in the west

space shuttle flight controllers 
today considered bringing the atlantis home three hours early 
because of predicted high winds monday afternoon at the california 
landing site 
the astronauts were told to shut down some equipment friday to 
conserve power in case nasa is forced to extend the flight a day or 
two to wait for calmer weather 
the forecast is for gusts up to 35 mph at edwards air force base 
at the planned 1238 pm pdt landing time on monday because winds 
at the mojave desert base normally are lighter in the morning 
flight director bob castle said today that controllers were 
studying whether to cut the mission by two orbits about 90 minutes 
each 
were looking at that option but depending on the weather 
monday were also prepared to stay up a day or two longer he 
said 
he said atlantis is humming right along its a very clean 
vehicle 
the space travelers plunged into a fourth day of experiments 
after being awakened today by a rock song bohemian rhapsody 
by the band queen it includes the words lightning lightning 
very frightening galileo galileo galileo 
mission control reported the song was a tribute to the galileo 
spacecraft that the space travelers dispatched on a sixyear 
24billionmile trip toward jupiter on wednesday their first day 
in space the center said the 15 billion probe continued to 
operate well today 
controllers also sent the crew the new york times friday 
crossword puzzle by teleprinter and radioed up scores from some 
texas high school football games 
the possibility of a one to twoday delay in landing arose 
friday when a weather front trailing high winds moved across 
edwards 
should bad weather persist at edwards the shuttle has two 
alternative sites the northrup strip at white sands missile range 
nm would be the first choice and kennedy space center in 
florida the second dittemore said 
atlantis has enough fuel oxygen power and other supplies to 
remain in orbit two days beyond the planned fiveday mission 
without any conservation efforts said mission control commentator 
brian welch 
but to be conservative welch said the crew was told friday to 
save some power to enable the shuttle to stay aloft even longer 
welch said mission control wanted to save about 600 watts of power 
the astronauts conservation efforts included dimming or turning 
off unneeded lights on the shuttle and shutting down one of three 
computer displays on the flight deck and one of three general 
purpose computers generally left on while the shuttle is in orbit 
but the astronauts inorbit schedule remained the same the 
crew consists of commander don williams pilot mike mcculley and 
mission specialists franklin changdiaz shannon lucid and ellen 
baker 
today the astronauts planned to use a powerful imax camera to 
film various parts of the world for a documentary film they also 
hoped to photograph lightning systems for a weather experiment 
the day includes a special event for changdiaz who was born in 
san jose costa rica and has been a hero there since his first 
trip to space in 1986 at about 6 pm edt changdiaz plans to 
speak from orbit with costa rican president oscar arias the 1987 
nobel peace prize winner 
a solar flare erupted on thursday and radiation from the burst 
may disrupt galileos computer memory the computer should correct 
itself as designed but if not a correction can be made by ground 
controllers nasa spokesman charles redmond said 
since the radiation dose from the sun would be greater than what 
the spacecraft will encounter at jupiter it will be a good test of 
the vehicle he said 
this will give galileo the smart robot a chance to prove how 
smart it is he said 
on thursday two of the crew members spent part of the day 
demonstrating simple medical procedures that can be done aboard the 
shuttle 
as ms lucid the patient floated upside down ms baker 
a physician took her temperature and examined her throat and ears 
the session was taped earlier in the day by the astronauts and 
later aired on nasa satellite television 
the shuttles firstaid kit carries pretty much what any 
doctors black bag would carry ms baker said it includes a 
stethoscope bandages adhesive aspirin and other common 
medications

activists today said the government 
will allow seven freed black prisoners to appear at a rally of the 
outlawed african national congress 
no african national congress rally has been allowed in south 
africa since the organization was banned in 1960 
eight prominent black prisoners many of them jailed in excess 
of 25 years were freed by the government on sunday seven were 
african national congress leaders 
activists said those seven will appear at the oct 29 rally in 
soweto that is being billed as an african national congress event 
apart from being a welcoming party the rally is going to be 
an occasion at which our leaders will be making a major address to 
the nation on a whole range of issues national union of 
mineworkers secretarygeneral cyril ramaphosa said at a news 
conference near the home of walter sisulu one of the freed 
prisoners 
the black green and gold african national congress flag flew 
from a pole above sisulus roof he and some of the other recently 
freed prisoners met today with anglican archbishop desmond tutu at 
a birthday celebration for sisulus activist wife albertina 72 
ramaphosa said the group had not sought government permission 
for the rally to be held at noon oct 29 in a new soccer stadium 
near soweto but he said letters had been sent to president fw de 
klerk the minister of justice and the chief magistrate of 
johannesburg informing them of the plans 
the department of justice issued a statement late friday night 
saying an application to hold the meeting had been approved by the 
chief magistrate 
informed of the approval during the news conference ramaphosa 
said they approved it because they knew we would give them 
trouble if they didnt 
this will be the first rally of leaders of the african 
national congress in nearly 30 years said murphy morobe 
spokesman for the banned united democratic front comrade walter 
sisulu will deliver a major address to the nation 
ramaphosa said the group had asked the government to lift 
restrictions on former african national congress national chairman 
govan mbeki so that he could join his colleagues at the rally 
mbeki was freed from prison in 1987 but the government banned 
two rallies he was to address then restricted him to his hometown 
near port elizabeth and prohibited him from speaking in public or 
talking to the press 
de klerk said that if there was some guarantee from 
organizations which practiced a policy of political violence and 
acts of terror that such things would not recur it would improve 
the atmosphere in which the 3yearold national emergency could be 
lifted 
de klerk has preached conciliation with the black majority since 
he was elected in august he has promised to gradually bring blacks 
into the political process in south africa where the white 
minority holds all power 
several rallies that normally would have been broken up by 
police have been allowed to take place in recent weeks

a swiss photographer today said he saw 
decomposing bodies described by villagers as just a few of scores 
of porters allegedly massacred by the burmese army 
karl ammann said he saw six or seven corpses mostly skeletal 
remains but that villagers estimated there were at least 150 
corpses in the area 
villagers and karenni rebels who escorted ammann into burma on 
oct 12 said the porters who toted supplies for the army were 
killed during a burmese army offensive against the karennis in july 
the porters were given virtually no food or water the villagers 
said and were shot beheaded or had their legs broken and were 
left to die when they could no longer shoulder their heavy burdens 
it was not clear which ethnic or political groups the porters 
belonged to there have been previous reports of the burmese army 
forcing political prisoners to become porters and take part in 
brutal jungle marches resulting in scores of deaths 
refugees rebel groups and human rights organizations such as 
the londonbased amnesty international have long accused the 
burmese army of widespread atrocities last year amnesty published 
two detailed reports charging a consistent pattern of gross 
violations of human rights by the burmese military in trying to 
suppress the ethnic rebels 
but there has been virtually no firsthand substantiation of the 
charges due to the difficulty of access to most of burma by 
foreigners the rangoon government has either denied the various 
allegations or remained silent 
the karenni are among a variety of ethnic minority groups in 
burma many of which have guerrillas fighting the central 
government in rangoon for greater autonomy 
following the brutal suppression of a prodemocracy uprising in 
the country last year several thousand students from burmas 
cities have joined the insurgents in remote border areas 
ammann a kenyabased swiss national who specializes in wildlife 
photography said he made contact with the karennis in order to 
photograph the socalled padaung giraffe women who wear copper 
and brass rings around their necks 
he crossed into kayah state in eastcentral burma from thailand 
and trekked to the salween river about 435 miles northwest of 
bangkok opposite thailands province of mae hong son 
ammann said neither the karennis he was with nor the villagers 
pressed him to see the corpses and seemed to accept the killings 
as a routine matter 
he said the remains were all found along trails at considerable 
distance from one another some still had tattered clothing and 
belts sticking to the bones one skeleton was lying very near a 
stream 
ammann said he had no interest in seeing more than the first 
half dozen bodies but numerous villagers along the route offered 
to take him to more killing sites 
the rebels said the offensive involved between 500 to 600 troops 
from the kayah state capital of loikaw along with 700 to 800 
porters the burmese troops retreated back across the salween after 
inflicting some damage to karenni camps they said 
independently of the photographers account a letter from 
loikaw received recently in bangkok and addressed to another swiss 
journalist claimed that prior to the july offensive troops of the 
burmese 66th division had provoked terror in the town and 
surrounding villages by forcefully rounding up porters

president mikhail s gorbachev has shown the 
soviet press who is boss 
first he told the new generation of freeswinging journalists 
not to overstep the bounds of glasnost then he ousted the 
conservative editor of pravda 
the result has left gorbachev in what he clearly thinks is the 
best place for every soviet to be in the center 
by accusing the more liberal editors of stirring up dangerous 
public passions gorbachev drew a line and told them they cannot 
always print what they choose he then demonstrated he could 
install his own man at the helm of pravda the most prestigious 
editors job in the soviet union 
at a meeting with editors of major publications oct 13 
gorbachev accused them of stirring up the public at a time of great 
uncertainty one editor paraphrased gorbachev as saying reading 
the papers one gets the impression of standing kneedeep in a pool 
of spilled gasoline all it needs is one tiny spark 
it was a reminder that glasnost or openness has limits 
many accounts of the session came from soviet journalists who 
werent present but had been briefed by their bosses under the 
cloak of anonymity and in the more casual climate spawned by 
glasnost dismayed informants shared with western colleagues what 
they regarded as an assault on the gains they have so recently made 
gorbachev reportedly called for the resignation of the editor of 
arguments and facts vladislav a starkov who led his weekly in 
little more than a year from a recorder of social statistics 
circulated among party members to a breezily written tabloid with a 
circulation of 26 million 
on monday starkov was called to the partys central committee 
headquarters where he reportedly was given a dressingdown by 
gorbachevs ideology chief and told he had two days to think over 
his position 
soviet lawmakers the newspapers workers and other editors 
rallied in starkovs defense and he was not fired but the edition 
that appeared friday was a chastened version of arguments and facts 
its first three pages were devoted entirely to two articles the 
lead story confessed that a poll the paper published two weeks ago 
indicating human rights activist andrei sakharov was more popular 
than gorbachev was an unscientific sampling of readers letters 
the article then reported the results of what it described as a 
scientific poll of 2461 people although sakharov found some 
popular support among students the poll showed gorbachevs 
performance got a favorable assessment from 66 percent of those who 
responded 
the second twothirds of page 1 all of page 2 and most of page 
3 were devoted to a friendly interview with yegor k ligachev the 
sole surviving conservative party stalwart on the ruling politburo 
ligachev used the space to condemn efforts by reformers to 
restore the concept of private property and defended the oneparty 
system in the soviet union 
if arguments and facts took a sharp turn to the right pravda 
apparently took a sudden and equally abrupt turn to the left 
viktor g afanasyev the 66yearold editor who had headed the 
official party organ since 1976 cleaned out his desk thursday to 
make room for ivan t frolov a gorbachev aide and communist 
philosopher 
frolov is said to have come up with the ideological underpinning 
for gorbachevs conciliatory foreign policy based on the need for 
cooperation among nations 
afanasyev ostensibily supported glasnost but was closely 
identified with the leadership of leonid i brezhnev from 1964 to 
1982 when the press helped hide the countrys problems he 
rejected political pluralism and warned against letting criticism 
of party policy get out of hand 
one seasoned diplomatic observer used a boxing analogy 
suggesting gorbachevs criticism of the editors at the closeddoor 
meeting could have been a feint to the left before the right hook 
came in 
but there also is reason to believe gorbachev was simply 
following his instincts and giving the guidance he believes 
necessary 
the only published account of the meeting to appear in the 
following week was from yegor yakovlev editor of moscow news a 
weekly that has spearheaded the drive for more open examination of 
the problems of soviet society 
yakovlev said gorbachev told the group the press has contributed 
to setting political passions on fire but has done little to point 
the way toward solutions to problems 
yakovlev said gorbachev told the editors youll come home 
after this meeting and youll probably say gorbachev tried again 
to reconcile the irreconcilable and fell between two chairs 
dont you see im sitting on my own chair

ocean explorer jacques cousteau said saturday he 
will campaign in the united states and around the world to rally 
support for making antarctica an international nature reserve 
delegates from 39 nations at the biennial antarctica treaty 
meeting agreed late friday to call a meeting next year to discuss 
comprehensive environmental measures for the icy continent 
including a frenchaustralian proposal for a nature reserve there 
the united states and britain lead opposition to the proposal 
urging support instead for an international minerals treaty that 
would permit regulated mining in antarctica france and australia 
have refused to sign the treaty blocking it from taking effect 
tucker scully head of the us delegation said he was 
satisfied with the compromise outcome of the paris meeting which 
lasted two weeks 
we were not prepared to accept any proposal that predicted the 
outcome of the next meeting or ran counter to our position 
scully said 
under the compromise two meetings have been called for next 
year one to discuss environmental measures and one to consider 
proposals for establishing accident liability under the mining 
convention 
when and where the meetings will take place was not decided 
although chile has offered to be host 
the next general antarctica treaty meeting will be in west 
germany in 1991 
cousteau the 79yearold adventurer known for his television 
specials and environmental activism said his foundation would 
continue to seek signatures on petitions urging permanent 
protection for antarctica 
he told a news conference he plans to pursue his campaign in his 
travels to the united states in midnovember to argentina in 
december to chile next april and to britain at a date not yet set 
cousteau said he hoped next years meeting on environmental 
protection in antarctica would have a more active participation 
of political authorities not just the bureaucrats 
french environment minister brice lalonde at a separate news 
conference said he thought public pressure could change the us 
governments stance 
when i consider the state of mind of a large part of the 
american population i think the position of the united states can 
change lalonde said 
environmental groups called the outcome of the paris meeting a 
success 
this is a victory for common sense and the environment 
greenpeace international spokeswoman lena hagelin said in a 
statement we now have the momentum to begin the negotiation of a 
successful new environmental regime

congressional nerves frayed over a republican 
drive to slash the capital gains tax are setting the stage for a 
partisan game of chicken with a looming budget deadline that packs 
devastating clout 
the governments legal authority to borrow money expires with 
the end of october although there is likely to be enough money 
jangling around the treasury to last another day or two failure to 
extend the debt limit before about nov 3 would lead to an 
unprecedented federal default 
no one believes lawmakers are likely to let the debt limit lapse 
while they joust over legislation 
i suspect at some point in time common sense will prevail 
predicts rep marvin leath dtexas 
but as usual the debt limit bill should attract a slew of 
unrelated highly partisan amendments from lawmakers looking for 
the surest way to get their pet projects enacted into law in the 
process congress will be playing with fire 
its been almost a week since the sequester and the country 
doesnt even know it happened said university of maryland public 
policy professor allen schick referring to the automatic budget 
cuts triggered last monday by the grammrudman law with a 
default theyd know it happened immediately 
the current 287 trillion debt limit expires at the end of the 
day on halloween as of late last week total federal red ink had 
reached 285 trillion and was climbing steadily 
if no extension were signed into law by late oct 31 default 
would not occur immediately 
but congress has several enormous bills to pay during the first 
few days of november this includes about 10 billion owed federal 
workers and retirees nov 1 14 billion in treasury bills maturing 
nov 2 and 20 billion worth of social security checks payable 
nov 3 
failure to make any of those payments would mean default and 
default would mean the government would have to send workers home 
and stop providing services virtually shutting down it would also 
face steeper borrowing costs in the future as lenders people who 
buy treasury bills demand higher interest rates 
the united states has never defaulted on its debt 
obligations treasury secretary nicholas f brady wrote congress 
last week to do so would be unthinkable and irresponsible 
most members of congress also want to see the debt limit 
extended promptly at least in part because of the consequences 
they would face from constituents if it werent 
most people are afraid to vote against social security 
checks says rep denny smith rore 
yet with the contentious political climate of recent months a 
clash over the bill is likely 
gop senators were thwarted earlier this month in an effort to 
pass a capital gains tax reduction a move dear to the heart of 
president bush and anathema to democratic leaders 
last week sens bob packwood rore and william roth rdel 
proposed a new version of that idea and said they would attach it 
to whatever legislation is moving including the debt limit bill 
the debt limit bill is a likely target for other measures as 
well including several competing proposals to change the 
muchmaligned federal budget process other possible candidates for 
inclusion are initiatives ranging from expanded child care programs 
to a rollback of medicare benefits for severely ill elderly people 
many of these proposals have already sparked battles between 
republicans and democrats unless party leaders could work out an 
agreement in advance an attempt to attach any of those provisions 
to the debt limit bill would be certain to slow work on it 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said he 
believed the acrimonious atmosphere even makes it possible a 
default will occur although he conceded there was only a slim 
chance 
the debt limit bill was once seen as the vehicle for a 
bipartisan deal on the fiscal 1991 budget but bickering between 
the two parties has scuttled such a pact 
instead the very item that has poisoned the atmosphere between 
democrats and republicans bushs capital gains tax cut plan is 
bucking for a ride on the debt limit extension

suspected soviet spy felix bloch is learning 
that fame may be fleeting but the fbi is not 
the nightly news no longer chronicles the 54yearold diplomats 
walks in the park visits to his lawyer or trips to the grocery 
the two dozen reporters and camera crews who followed him 
everywhere in july and august have dwindled to none 
but the fbi agents are still there around the clock in what 
they call wheellock surveillance experts say bloch also 
remains surrounded by the governments electronic eavesdropping 
and he remains on paid leave from his 80000ayear job in the 
state departments european bureau 
still there is no indictment not even a public move to fire 
him 
how long can this go on how long will it 
legally it could go on forever 
no one in the government will predict but current and former 
intelligence officials see no letup well into next year some spy 
investigations have lasted more than a decade although mostly out 
of the public eye 
bloch could be removed from the government payroll next spring 
under a state department uporout policy requiring periodic 
promotions to remain employed 
his departure from government would not end the fbi 
investigation into allegations that he spied for the soviet union 
since his posting in east berlin in 1975 but it would increase the 
parallels between the bloch case and that of kim philby the famed 
soviet mole who penetrated british intelligence 
the british relieved philby of his duties in 1951 but did not 
dismiss him from government until 1955 the investigation remained 
open while philby worked as a journalist in beirut until 
additional evidence surfaced and he fled to moscow in 1963 
in the bloch case us counterintelligence officials have 
enough evidence to suspect him of spying but not enough to bring 
charges 
although blochs situation is hardly without parallel public 
awareness of it is unparalled and that has raised concerns even 
objections from a range of observers 
they should fish or cut bait either indict him or let him 
live his life rep don edwards dcalif told the associated 
press last week hes being punished as a convicted criminal 
hes practically enslaved 
you cant treat people like that in this country even if you 
lose a spy the issue is terribly important to have a policy 
agency behaving like this 
edwards a former fbi agent who is chairman of the house civil 
and constitutional rights subcommittee said the fbi should 
continue its investigation without the obvious tight surveillance 
their duty is investigate in accordance with their usual rules 
but their usual rules do not include harassment he said 
a former no 2 official of the fbi homer boynton doubted the 
current level of surveillance could be pursued indefinitely at 
some point the guys right to privacy should come into play he 
said 
assistant fbi director milt ahlerich responded i appreciate 
those concerns but the investigation is being conducted lawfully 
and within the bounds of the foreign counterintelligence guidelines 
of the department of justice 
it may not be pleasing to the eye or the mind but that has to 
be a secondary consideration ahlerich continued one of the 
objectives of this investigation is not to harass but to counter 
the possibility of damage to us government security 
former fbi agents say such surveillance is designed to prevent a 
spy suspect from acquiring or turning over additional secrets the 
concerns over the tactic are by no means universal 
l britt snyder general counsel of the senate intelligence 
committee said he has heard no complaints from senators but 
observed that you cant keep this on forever 
counterintelligence investigations are reviewed annually and 
eavesdropping every 90 days by the fbi and the justice 
department the guidelines started in the ford administration 
following disclosures that the fbi had investigated figures such as 
civil rights leader martin luther king jr for decades without 
bringing indictments 
the review concentrates on whether there is enough evidence for 
a full investigation using all investigative techniques 
based on interviews with government sources and broadcast and 
published reports the evidence in hand in the bloch case looks 
like this 
bloch was observed in paris last may meeting a suspected soviet 
agent after using traditional drycleaning techniques to shake 
surveillance he passed a travel bag to the man who was later 
recorded telephoning bloch with what sounded like a warning that 
authorities were on to them 
other electronic surveillance is said to have picked up bloch 
telling his wife that he had accepted payments from the soviets a 
onetime viennese prostitute has told a federal grand jury that 
bloch spent roughly 10000 a year for her services over seven 
years an amount that investigators cannot find withdrawn from 
blochs acknowledged bank accounts 
but missing from this list is the identity of even one secret 
turned over to the soviets and that is the minimum requirement 
for obtaining an espionage indictment 
in interviews bloch has repeatedly passed up chances to deny 
the allegations contenting himself with the observation that the 
government has not been able to bring any charges much less prove 
them 
kenneth c bass the justice departments chief intelligence 
counsel during the carter administration predicted that if the 
news leaks are accurate the justice department will never close 
down the investigation 
in theory you can keep the case going forever he said 
with up to five dozen agents required to keep an eye on bloch 
around the clock others monitoring electronic bugs and still 
others interviewing witnesses and tracing financial transactions 
here and abroad the cost of such surveillance can easily run into 
the millions of dollars 
but bass said it is very very rare for the justice 
intelligence counsel to question such investigations on the basis 
of cost or time elapsed 
ahlerich said when all leads have been run down you might very 
well go back and do everything all over again its not uncommon 
that you miss something the first time through 
bass and ahlerich said it would be no surprise for this case to 
run a year at its current pace later bass said after a long 
period with no activity at all the fbi might begin to think about 
discontinuance of some surveillance particularly if pressed by 
new cases 
bass snyder and ahlerich all dismissed the idea that 
information bloch has from working at the state department would 
ever be so outdated that it would be harmless for him to flee to 
moscow 
i cant think of a case where thats the way weve looked at 
it ahlerich said explaining that what seems out of date to most 
citizens is often still very useful to intelligence officers 
government officials did consider firing bloch for cause but 
that would provide him with an appeal hearing at which the 
government could be forced to disclose details of its counterspy 
techniques 
far more likely is that bloch will be dismissed next year under 
state department policy requiring that officers who reach the title 
of ministercounselor as bloch did in april 1985 be promoted 
within five years to career minister or be selected out 
without a hearing 
and the diplomats very public ballet with the fbi would 
continue 
as bloch himself put it longevity runs in the family this 
could go on another 35 years

it was just another subway ride until the door 
between cars clanged open and woodrow wright entered he pressed a 
comb to his lips and distracted his captive audience with a 
subterranean concert 
i am a homeless man but when i play a comb i am the magic 
man he said after rough renditions of tv themes and beethovens 
fifth symphony 
some riders smiled but the folks who run the transit authority 
which operates the subways are not amused and theyre pulling the 
curtain on acts by wright and others beginning wednesday 
jared lebow the authoritys chief spokesman says beggars and 
homeless people are creating an air of anarchy and bothering 
many of the 37 million daily riders 
hardened by the daily parade of the sick the desperate the 
mentally ill the panhandlers and drug addicts many riders do not 
look up as beggars employ a range of tactics to get them to part 
with change 
some shout many sing a few play instruments veterans carry 
papers to prove past heroism others carry hospital papers to 
authenticate injuries some have severe disabilities 
in a subway car at 45 mph you cant leave when somebody comes 
up and shakes a coffee container filled with coins in front of your 
nose and intimidates you into giving money or makes you feel 
uncomfortable lebow said 
as cold weather arrived the time when the subways homeless 
population burgeons the transit authority warned in posters and 
leaflets of a crackdown on panhandling begging sleeping selling 
trinkets and playing music on the systems 6200 subway cars and in 
stations 
such activities always have violated rules but the 3800 
transit police officers have been instructed to begin following the 
book after being trained to treat the homeless gently but firmly 
lebow said 
we know its not going to change overnight or over several 
months but we want to send out a message lebow said noting 
that it took four years to rid the cars of graffiti 
the message has fallen harshly on some people including george 
mcdonald one of the citys most outspoken advocates for the 
homeless 
its a policy that will cause the death of many people this 
winter he said claiming that up to 5000 people live in new 
york subways a person should be able to have a sign and cup and 
ask for help if theyre reduced to that 
when its freezing people are going to risk the consequences 
of this policy and seek warm places to rest other people will die 
fifteen percent of the folks are mentally ill and frightened away 
police will come after them with their clubs mcdonald said 
lebow promised police wont come in like storm troopers if 
its freezing outside were not going to throw anybody out in the 
street 
lebow notes that 44 homeless people died for a variety of 
reasons in the subway stations between may 1988 and last may he 
said many of the homeless use subway cars both as a bedroom and a 
bathroom and should be sent to city shelters 
brian brewster a 32yearold homeless man said he found the 
subways safer than shelters he said he was robbed at one shelter 
he was walking near another last winter when a bullet struck his 
thumb 
he said his tailspin began when the woman he lived with on long 
island cheated on him and he left her nearly two years of college 
and years working as a barternder or cook are distant memories 
when begging he tells subway riders i dont like sleeping in 
this train but i have no family and no friends nobody wants to 
say come in my house take a bath or heres a pair of underwear 
nobody wants 
he struggles to accumulate about 16 a day enough for food and 
a place to shower he knows that he raises a stench 
i want a home i want to be a man again said brewster 
right now i need a shower bath and a shave so bad 
cynthia wynn who said she was burned out of her apartment and 
lives with two sons ages 18 and 7 in a welfare hotel said she 
begs on the trains only when she needs to make ends meet 
i dont know what to say to you ladies and gentleman but i 
need help she tells riders ive got my children in a hotel 
with no refrigerator and i ran out of food thank you for anything 
you can do a nickel a dime 
as one homeless man begged riders for money one afternoon chris 
rangel 26 of new york handed him an apple 
if they need food i give them food he said he refuses to 
give coins he suspects might be spent on drugs or alcohol 
the combplaying wright who said a drug problem and other bad 
decisions put him on the street two years ago said that after 
eight months in shelters he sought safety in the subways and is 
content 
he recalls making between 12 and 15 by just asking people for 
money then he began playing the comb something he learned in 
grade school and found he could make up to 60 in seven hours of 
begging 
now he said he hopes one day that somebody discovers me 
playing this comb 
he said a lot of people say i got a talent and should be on 
tv im looking for david letterman id like to show him i can 
play a comb

a leader during the coal strikes that crippled the 
mining industry over the summer has been found dead and fellow 
miners fear he was the victim of a revenge killing a newspaper 
said saturday 
the body of alexander sotnikov a member of the regional strike 
committee in the donetsk coal basin in the ukraine was found last 
week in the village of zverevo the newspaper socialist industry 
reported 
it gave no details on the condition of the body or where exactly 
it was discovered sotnikovs age was not known 
the miners are seriously anxious the newspaper said 
could this be some kind of revenge on their comrade 
much of the soviet coal industry was paralyzed during the summer 
when hundreds of thousands of miners walked off the job to press 
for better working conditions and political changes 
instead of cracking down on the miners as it once would have 
the soviet government negotiated with them and conceded on many of 
their demands 
socialist industry said police were not prepared to say whether 
sotnikovs death was a result of foul play but a colleague said in 
a telephone interview that the strike leader was brutally 
murdered with his skull cracked by a blunt object and his face 
cut 
the colleague yuri boldyrev who also helped organize strikes 
said sotnikov had received threats telling him to stop trying to 
uncover corruption at the mine where he worked 
boldyrev did not say who he thought might be responsible he 
said sotnikov had three children ages five 10 and 17 
the minister of internal affairs vadim v bakatin is 
personally overseeing the investigation into sotnikovs death 
socialist industry said

defense secretary dick cheney setting off on 
a threeweek tour of key allied capitals and us military posts 
says eastwest negotiations on slashing conventional forces are 
going so well that an agreement is possible in the 
nottoodistant future 
cheney was departing saturday for a trip that will take him to 
france great britain west germany and italy with a stop in 
portugal for nato talks as well as meetings in australia and 
hawaii 
forging an approach to the sweeping changes in the soviet union 
and eastern europe and discussing with his nato counterparts the 
vienna talks on conventional force reductions are high on the 
agenda at many of cheneys sessions pentagon officials say 
in an interview with the associated press shortly before he left 
on his first major excursion as defense secretary cheney observed 
that the negotiations between north atlantic treaty organization 
members and the warsaw pact are moving along in pretty good 
shape 
there are still a lot of issues to work out but i think there 
is a sincere desire on the part of virtually everybody including 
the soviets i am fairly optimistic we will get a good agreement 
in the nottoodistant future cheney said 
while problems remain in verification and counting aircraft i 
think were talking about a year or two at most for reaching a 
full agreement he said 
cheney said another item under constant discussion is 
burdensharing and he spoke of the pressures against increases in 
military spending for the united states and its western european 
allies 
as convictions grow that mr mikhail gorbachev and the 
soviets dont constitute the threat they used to its more and 
more difficult to get people to allocate the same levels of 
resources to their defense budget and that affects the kind of 
decisions we have to make cheney said 
the allies would be prepared to allocate much higher levels of 
resources if the soviets were pursuing a policy more hostile to 
the west or more intolerant of the changes under way in poland 
hungary and east germany he said 
cheney added that while it is perhaps more difficult to 
maintain alliance cohesion and unity at a time when there is this 
perception that the threat is significantly reduced if anything it 
is more important 
the united states allocates about 60 percent of its conventional 
forces budget to the defense of western europe a situation that 
prompts criticism among some lawmakers who have called for fewer 
expenditures for such economically welloff nations 
weve maintained our commitments and we are encourage our 
allies to do the same cheney said 
the former wyoming congressman is leaving as his negotiations 
over the pentagons fiscal 1990 budget have stalemated in part 
over cheneys demands that lawmakers do away with several weapons 
systems 
cheney noted that he had twice postponed the trip and couldnt 
avoid being out of washington for three full weeks given that he 
was is also scheduled to attend an annual ministerial conference 
with australian officials 
weve got good communications so we can manage to maintain 
our involvement with major issues the budget and so forth he 
said 
cheney will meet with his counterparts in paris on sunday and 
then travels on monday to vilamoura portugal for two days of nato 
discussions with defense ministers 
he travels to england on wednesday where he will visit with a 
us air force unit and have meetings with british officials on 
thursday he meets in bonn with defense minister gerhard 
stoltenberg and goes on to berlin and sessions with army troops 
cheney is slated to travel to rome on saturday where he will 
spend three days and visit ships from the us sixth fleet 
during the pacific leg of the trip in the first week of 
november cheney will join secretary of state james a baker iii 
for the annual session with australian officials 
afterwards he is scheduled to visit us naval facilities and 
consult in hawaii with adm huntington hardisty the 
commanderinchief of us forces in the pacfic 
he is slated to return to washington nov 10

two months after noncommunists took over 
the government top officials are flashing solidarity 
vforvictory signs there is talk of developing a market 
economy and the new labor minister is on tv telling people prices 
have to go up 
there is a new mood and style in prime minister tadeusz 
mazowieckis administration the first noncommunist government in 
an east bloc country there is a clear effort in the premiers 
words to separate ourselves from the past with a thick line 
take juliusz burski new chairman of the state film committee 
he sits in a cavernous office in the ministry of culture the first 
time a director not a politician has the job 
he wants to give up the right to veto film projects sell the 
stateowned movie houses and create conditions to allow private 
filmmakers to blossom alongside the stateowned companies 
in my opinion the film industry should not be managed but 
should be allowed to live he said 
he ended the interview by explaining that there are no longer 
any banned films in poland and gave solidaritys trademark 
vforvictory sign 
across town at the ministry of building and spatial planning 
minister aleksander paszynski talks about the huge bureaucracy and 
his plans to solve a housing crisis that can force young couples to 
wait 15 to 20 years for an apartment 
his solution is to create postwar polands first free housing 
market he says he is studying the privatization of 
governmentowned apartments in prime minister margaret thatchers 
britain 
paszynski sees change in government working habits you have 
to work overtime or maybe even harder because the premier is 
after us he joked 
mazowiecki a journalist and former political prisoner came to 
power aug 24 through a stunning political manuever engineered by 
solidarity leader lech walesa who lured the communist partys 
former allies the peasants and democrats into a parliamentary 
coalition 
on sept 12 parliament approved a 24member cabinet that 
includes 12 members of solidarity there are just four communists 
heading foreign trade and the defense interior and transportation 
ministries one independent four peasants and three democrats make 
up the balance 
but the communist party remains a power to be reckoned with and 
wojciech jaruzelski the former communist party chief retains the 
powerful presidency 
most of the ministers are new to administration because 
executive jobs once were virtually off limits to anyone but 
communist party members the new cabinet is dominated by 
journalists professors and that vague designation in the east 
bloc political activist 
the confusion is less than you might have expected which does 
not mean that it is going smoothly paszynski said 
in virtually every ministry there are signs of radical change 
justice minister aleksander bentkowski asked victims of 
stalinist crimes to come forward so their cases can be investigated 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak dissolved the muchhated zomo 
riot police 
minister of education henryk samsonowicz receives members of the 
oncebanned independent students association 
foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski argues against deporting 
back to east germany refugees reaching poland 
labor minister jacek kuron a born rabblerouser and thorn in 
the side of every communist leader of the last three decades has 
appeared on television in a denim shirt and chainsmoking american 
cigarettes to explain why prices must go up 
despite such symbolic acts there have been some complaints 
principally surrounding television and information policy 
mazowiecki made clear he wanted no witch hunts meaning the 
old ranks could keep their jobs as long as they loyally followed 
instructions of the new ministers and displayed competence 
mazowieckis appointee to head the radiotelevision committee 
controlling state broadcasting andrzej drawicz fired no one he 
did reassign to offcamera jobs three newscasters who were most 
associated with the martiallaw propaganda of the early 1980s 
the communist party daily trybuna ludu protested loudly 
comparing it to the 198283 purge of hundreds of prosolidarity 
journalists 
there were also complaints from solidarity that more people 
should have disappeared from television screens and that the style 
of presenting news still gives disproportionate attention to the 
communist party 
another complaint voiced by walesa among others is that the 
new government is not doing enough to explain its economic policies 
at a time when prices are leaping by 50 percent a month 
mazowiecki wants to undo the old centralized economy in one to 
two years and has been willing to take on entrenched interests 
within the communist party and among his own followers 
solidaritys rankandfile suffered when the government 
persuaded parliament to limit automatic costofliving increases to 
help plug the budget gap and fight inflation 
another sacred cow the coal industry is about to feel the 
sting as the government reduces subsidies by the equivalent of 571 
million in coming weeks some inefficient mines may have to close 
deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz hopes to sign an imf 
standby loan agreement next month something previous communist 
governments were unable to negotiate in 3 years 
the sharp turn to a market economy foresees heightened inflation 
at first as price controls end and state subsidies that lowered 
prices are eliminated price increases have accelerated under 
mazowiecki a loaf of bread that cost 11 cents a year ago is now 27 
cents and quart of milk that cost about 5 cents now costs about 45 
cents 
but the price increases far greater than those that toppled 
communist governments in the past are so far accepted with pained 
understanding by consumers strikes have gradually died out 
that reflects the popularity of the mazowiecki government 
how long the initial trust will last is anybodys guess but one 
prosolidarity teacher said the world might be surprised at poles 
patience now that they have a government they support

the director of religous affairs for the 
communist government in czechoslovakia says his country has freedom 
of worship and his office has a good working relationship with the 
roman catholic and other faiths 
the churches are an integral part of our society today and in 
the future vladimir janku the czech official told a gathering 
of us roman catholics czechoslovak emigres congressional 
staffers diplomats and journalists friday 
janku also dismissed a petition on religious freedom signed by 
hundreds of thousands of czechoslovaks the past year as a 
normal statement supporting freedom rather than a demand for 
what is lacking 
president gustav husak has invited cardinal frantisek tomasek 
the 90yearold roman catholic archbishop of prague to participate 
in drafting the countrys next constitution he said 
janku defended the continued existence of his office and the 
governments right to approve appointment of bishops after years 
of negotiation four roman catholic bishops were named this year 
but half the 13 dioceses still lack them 
janku plans to meet on monday with richard schifter us 
assistant secretary of state for human rights other state 
department officials and congressman tom lantos dcalif a native 
of hungary who heads the congressional human rights caucus 
mondays meetings could determine if the two countries are ready 
to begin a dialogue on human rights that us secretary of state 
james baker iii suggested to czechoslovakias foreign minister 
during their un meeting last month earlier in the year former 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead said in prague that human 
rights would be the key to improving relations with the united 
states 
fridays gathering in the us capitol complex was arranged by 
the slovak american national council an emigre organization that 
until recently was among the communist governments archcritics 
the organizations executive director is john hvasta a 
slovakamerican us navy veteran who spent three years in 
czechoslovakias leopoldov prison escaped in 1951 and made his 
way to the us embassy in prague in one of the celebrated 
incidents of the cold war 
hvasta said he was surprised by the new atmosphere though less 
than satisfied with some of jankus answers 
janku told the gathering that perestroika or restructuring has 
come to czechoslovakia but in a different form from the efforts in 
poland and hungary to abandon the leninist model of socialism 
if perestroika means dismantling of socialism we are 
lagging said vladimir janku during a visit late last week 
ours is a socialist perestroika

when the body of ramzi asfour was lifted 
from his mangled cadillac seville and lowered off a mountain of 
crumbled concrete a threeday vigil ended for his anxious wife 
children and cousins 
on sunday they will hold a funeral rather than the celebration 
planned for his 51st birthday 
their dread that asfour had been among the people crushed when 
an elevated section of interstate 880 collapsed in tuesdays killer 
earthquake were confirmed at 4 am friday a day in which 18 
bodies were removed from the still horrible scene 
the wait goes on for dozens of families who fear their loved 
ones remain entombed in the rubble 
the asfour familys ordeal began tuesday night when they along 
with millions of others were rocked by the 69strength quake 
when the ground stopped shaking asfours wife lily turned on 
the television at the familys home in novato 15 miles north of 
san francisco in marin county 
in horror she watched the news reports which came to focus on 
the greatest single point of death and destruction a milelong 
stretch of doubledeck highway that had bucked and heaved a 
behemoth in spasms and finally collapsed on itself 
an unknown number of cars and trucks were sandwiched between 
layers of broken concrete and twisted iron bars 
lily asfour knew that highway was the most direct route between 
oakland international airport and the san franciscooakland bay 
bridge and her husband a bank of america vice president 
returning from a business trip had been due to land at the airport 
half an hour before the 504 pm quake 
could ramzi asfour be buried in the concrete 
my mom suspected it from the beginning said fareed asfour 
18 when my father didnt come home by midnight we thought 
thats what might have happened but we had hope that it didnt 
aunts uncles and cousins in the big lebaneseamerican family 
came to comfort mrs asfour and her daughters 16yearold zeina 
and 12yearold leina fareed rushed home from the university of 
california at davis 
they called the police to report asfour missing they called the 
red cross they called hospitals to ask if he had been admitted 
and they called the police again but there was no word of him 
anywhere 
so they waited 
we wanted to go to the scene but the police said not to 
fareed said they said the roads were blocked and we couldnt get 
near the highway anyway they wanted to keep down the crowds 
two of asfours cousins david and ramzi hissen went anyway 
for hours they drove around oakland or waited outside police 
barricades for a sign of asfour periodically they called in their 
discouraging reports to novato 
through the night and the next morning the family stuck 
together their eyes glued to the ghastly images on the television 
screen 
they knew they were not alone in their pain and they shared 
strangers grief when tv cameras showed sobbing relatives at police 
barricades near i880 they watched as officials stepped up to 
microphones to estimate the number of dead and to voice their 
doubts that anyone would be found alive 
by noon wednesday the morbid scenes were too much to bear the

her teacher and the girls mother was arrested police said 
carmen garcia 31 was arrested thursday after police searching 
her home discovered 14 similar bags of cocaine said lt bud harper 
her daughter whose name was withheld didnt bring the powder 
in for showandtell harper said she was concerned she was 
confiding in her teacher she wanted to tell somebody she knew 
this is a gutsy little gal harper said i think shes 
very brave 
the girl was warned about the dangers of drugs in a 
policesponsored drug education program at her north hollywood 
elementary school harper said 
so when she stumbled upon about one halfounce of white powder 
divided into several bags at her mothers home she was worried and 
brought one bag to school thursday morning harper said 
the teacher notified school authorities who turned the bag of 
powder over to police 
lab tests showed that the powder was cocaine and detectives 
obtained a search warrant for the mothers home thursday afternoon 
ms garcia was booked for investigation of possession of cocaine 
for sale and was being held on 5000 bail at the van nuys womens 
jail harper said police will seek formal charges against her 
monday he said 
after the arrest the girl was staying with her father at a 
separate home and was expected to continue going to class harper 
said adding that he did not know if she realized that her mother

warsaw poland the communistlinked trade union alliance on 
saturday urged a limited nationwide protest to oppose price hikes 
and plans to privatize stateowned property but it stopped short 
of calling for work stoppages 
union members are to hang banners and posters at their 
workplaces and office buildings from monday to friday the opzz 
alliance said in a statement published in weekend newspapers 
in declaring the protest opzz cited factors such as prices 
going up madly speculation selling out the national property and 
the phantom of hunger and poverty for many polish families 
it said no work stoppages were called thanks only to a promise 
by deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz that he would take 
opzzs concerns under consideration 
opzz said current economic reform plans would halt pay increases 
at a time when prices are rising uncontrollably this it said 
would bring growing poverty and the possibility of a social 
outburst 
the alliance also said not enough is being done to increase the 
flow of goods to the market and that the economic program as 
formulated would lead to higher inflation 
government plans call for reducing subsidies to factories 
expected to cause higher prices initially and reducing wage 
increases in an attempt to balance the state budget and introduce a 
tight money policy the government hopes that policy eventually 
will bring inflation under control 
some state property such as factories is to be sold off the 
government says the process will be gradual marked by competitve 
bidding and will take different forms such as public stock sales 
foreign investments or employee buyouts 
the government has warned poles to expect difficult times 
including bankruptcies and unemployment but says the situation 
should stabilize by the end of next year 
opzz has called for talks between workers and the government to 
win public support for the economic reforms and the communist 
party supports the idea 
we note with concern that a number of important decisions 
undertaken or planned by the government are not consulted with 
social groups or their concerned representatives said a 
statement by party spokesman jan bisztyga last week 
such important concepts cannot be implemented without 
social approval without the consent of the working people and an 
agreement signed by them he said 
he said the changes require an accord such as the one reached in 
april after talks between the government and opposition those 
talks led to elections that resulted in solidarity taking over the 
government 
opzz created by communist authorities in 1982 to try to 
supplant solidarity has always been considered by solidarity a 
hollow shell supported only by communist activists and careerists 
in factories 
it has been struggling in recent years to establish credibility 
as a real union and often takes more militant stances than 
solidarity 
although opzz unions claim 6 million members about three times 
as many as solidarity an opzz picketing action outside parliament 
oct 13 that was to draw representatives from around the country 
attracted only about 150 people 
opzz says solidarity and the solidarityled government of prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki are committed to reintroducing 
capitalis in poland it portrays itself as the defender of the 
common worker and socialist social values such as protecting the 
needy 
the deeply divided communist party a participant in the 
government has so far gone along with mazowieckis plans and 
offered only muted criticism

when the body of ramzi asfour was lifted 
from his mangled cadillac seville and lowered off a mountain of 
crumbled concrete a threeday vigil ended for his anxious wife 
children and cousins 
on sunday they will hold a funeral rather than the celebration 
planned for his 51st birthday 
their dread that asfour had been among the people crushed when 
an elevated section of interstate 880 collapsed in tuesdays 
earthquake was confirmed at 4 am friday a day in which 18 bodies 
were removed from the still horrible scene 
the wait goes on for dozens of families who fear their loved 
ones remain entombed in the rubble 
the asfour familys ordeal began tuesday night when they along 
with millions of others were rocked by the 69strength quake 
when the ground stopped shaking asfours wife lily turned on 
the television at the familys home in novato 15 miles north of 
san francisco in marin county 
in horror she watched the news reports which came to focus on 
the greatest single point of death and destruction a milelong 
stretch of doubledeck highway that had bucked and heaved a 
behemoth in spasms and finally collapsed on itself 
an unknown number of cars and trucks were sandwiched between 
layers of broken concrete and twisted iron bars 
lily asfour knew that highway was the most direct route between 
oakland international airport and the san franciscooakland bay 
bridge and her husband a bank of america vice president 
returning from a business trip had been due to land at the airport 
half an hour before the 504 pm quake 
could ramzi asfour be buried in the concrete 
my mom suspected it from the beginning said fareed asfour 
18 when my father didnt come home by midnight we thought 
thats what might have happened but we had hope that it didnt 
aunts uncles and cousins in the big lebaneseamerican family 
came to comfort mrs asfour and her daughters 16yearold zeina 
and 12yearold leina fareed rushed home from the university of 
california at davis 
they called the police to report asfour missing they called the 
red cross they called hospitals to ask if he had been admitted 
and they called the police again but there was no word of him 
anywhere 
so they waited 
we wanted to go to the scene but the police said not to 
fareed said they said the roads were blocked and we couldnt get 
near the highway anyway they wanted to keep down the crowds 
two of asfours cousins david and ramzi hissen went anyway 
for hours they drove around oakland or waited outside police 
barricades for a sign of asfour periodically they called in their 
discouraging reports to novato 
through the night and the next morning the family stuck 
together their eyes glued to the ghastly images on the television 
screen 
they knew they were not alone in their pain and they shared 
strangers grief when tv cameras showed sobbing relatives at police 
barricades near i880 they watched as officials stepped up to 
microphones to estimate the number of dead and to voice their 
doubts that anyone would be found alive 
by noon wednesday the morbid scenes were too much to bear the 
asfours switched off the set 
by then a swarm of people had filled the house friends and 
family offering food help and shoulders to cry on overseas 
relatives called with words of sympathy asfour was born in 
palestine and the family had lived in london for several years

the occupational safety and health 
administration fell so out of favor with prolabor lawmakers and 
its watchdogs during the reagan years that one senator accused it 
of making a retreat from safety and another critic blamed it 
for 9000 deaths 
but under labor secretary elizabeth dole the agency has this 
year assumed a highprofile calming if not quieting its critics 
with actions on troublesome issues affecting exposure of workers to 
the aids virus hazardous chemicals and repetitivemotion disorders 
most recently she has ordered a new rule requiring seatbelt 
use on jobrelated drives a move she said should significantly 
reduce the nearly 2500 workrelated automobile fatalities each 
year 375 percent of all onthejob deaths last year 
a lot of it will be education she said of the rule which 
she concedes will be difficult to enforce getting people in the 
habit of using seat belts is the most important thing 
in an interview friday mrs dole refused to respond directly to 
criticisms of osha during the reagan administration but when she 
spoke of her plans it was clear she does not believe it had been 
doing enough 
it seems to me that we really need a recommitment to worker 
health and safety she said this has to come from the top 
were going to be fair certainly but we are going to enforce the 
law 
even her critics within the department give high marks to her 
efforts to promote safety 
in the last six months the agency has 
proposed exposure limits for mda a chemical widely used in 
construction that it said would prevent at least 20 cancer deaths 
a year 
fined lockheed corp 149 million for safety violations at a 
california plant where it makes the b2 stealth bomber 
fined a ford motor co subsidiary nearly 2 million for 
allegedly violating a previous agreement with osha 
recommended criminal charges against two companies it blamed 
for a fatal explosion in a milwaukee sewer tunnel 
ordered 631000 factories to install locks and other 
protections to guarantee machines stay idle during repairs a step 
designed to save 120 lives a year this rule had been bogged in the 
bureaucracy for a decade 
agreed with sara lee corp on a plan to protect 8000 workers 
in 31 meatprocessing plants from injuries blamed on repetitive 
motion 
fined a maine paper mill 16 million for 531 alleged safety 
violations 
issued a proposed rule designed to protect 53 million health 
care and rescue workers from exposure to blood and other bodily 
fluids potentially infected with the aids virus 
adopted new standards governing the use of trenches in 
construction that cover 1 million jobsites and are designed to 
prevent 75 deaths and 3000 injuries a year 
asked congress for 148 million for 179 more inspectors 
getting the agency involved in preventive efforts is a dole 
priority 
in the past osha actions have depended on looking at the 
illness and injury data that is reported to us she said 
thats sort of like closing the barn door after the horse is out 
of the barn 
one such effort begins soon within the highly hazardous 
meatpacking industry with nationwide distribution of voluntary 
guidelines designed to prevent injuries by recommending redesigned 
equipment and work spaces and rotation of employees whose jobs 
require using sharp objects and repetitive motion 
osha also plans to encourage employers who use hazardous 
chemicals to study whether they could use safer alternatives that 
cost more up front but might actually cost the same or less in the 
long run when storage and handling costs are considered 
mrs dole defended the osha against criticism that it too often 
settles for greatly reduced fines saying that in the place of 
money the agency might accept a promise by a company to improve 
safety in all its plants not just the one cited 
its not just how many dollars you get she said its 
getting the problem corrected

every four hours the 10 officers on duty 
at the missing persons bureau of the oakland police check their 
list to determine if anyone has turned up after being reported as 
missing in the earthquake 
a lot of times they dont call us back when someone has shown 
up said sgt greg hughes who heads the bureau when we 
contact them usually they say you know i was just going to call 
you 
since tuesday night 250 people have been reported missing 
specifically in connection with the quake by friday evening 164 
had been located alive or dead more than 30 victims have been 
pulled from the wreckage of collapsed interstate 880 
that left 86 still missing all of whom reports indicated had 
a chance of driving on the doubledecker freeway when it collapsed 
trapping cars in the rubble 
most of the calls to us are coming from out of state hughes 
said were isolating and screening reports so make sure we dont 
include someone who just hasnt seen their aunt tilley in four 
months 
officer gary foppiana said all the people believed missing from 
the earthquake can be traced to the freeway collapse and most are 
from the bay area 
occasionally an officer will call us to give a license plate 
from out there foppiana said of the crushed cars being pulled 
from the collapsed freeway 
one of the missing is melissa maxwell a deputy district 
attorney for alameda county

freeway on tuesday afternoon for the san francisco airport to pick 
up some relatives and hasnt been heard from since said senior 
deputy district attorney john adams 
they found some cars and one of them looked like hers adams 
said were hoping for the best but who knows 
foppiana said the count had been complicated by the fact that 
some of the dead were never reported missing 
thats why police are regularly calling everyone who has made a 
report 
its not like an air crash where people are international 
said hughes you have people working stiffs living in the east

there was fallen plaster in the war 
memorial opera house and the building was unsafe for the public so 
the san francisco opera moved a performance for the first time in 
its 67year history 
instead of performing verdis otello in the ornate opera 
house beside city hall the company prsented a semistaged version 
in the masonic auditorium atop nob hill it was the companys first 
performance since tuesdays earthquake 
it was a great experience said soprano katia ricciarelli 
who sang desdemona it was like the franco zeffirelli film you 
are so close you just use emotion you dont have to use such big 
movements 
jeanpierre ponnelles scenery was left at the opera house 
which still needs several days of cleanup but the performers wore 
costumes and the supertitles were taken along too 
the masonic auditorium is much more intimate than the 3252seat 
war memorial even though it has only 87 fewer seats the entire 
hall is only slightly larger than the stage of new yorks 
metropolitan opera house 
two more semistaged performances are scheduled for the masonic 
auditorium this weekend the season premiere of verdis aida 
on saturday and mozarts idomeneo on sunday the company 
intends to return to the war memorial on tuesday for the final 
otello 
when tuesday performance of idomeneo was canceled following 
the quake it was the second canceled performance in the companys 
history the first was after president kennedys assassination on 
nov 22 1963 
the performers got just one hour of rehearsal in the new 
auditorium and kazimierz kord the conductor was unsure of the 
acoustics 
we are just happy we can do it the maestro said 
before the performance san francisco opera general director 
lotfi mansouri addressed the audience of about 1000 
we all have so much to be thankful for he said at the 
same time our thoughts are with the people who shouldered the 
burden this week 
joanne dunne of san rafael calif a subscriber for 25 years 
was impressed by the way the company pressed ahead despite the 
tragedy 
were hearty souls she said 
but her daughter laurie would have preferred otello at the 
war memorial 
id much rather have it in the opera house with the costumes 
on stage and the champagne downstairs she said

waist freddie paul heugel rejoins his comrades who sacrificed 
their lives in vietnam

war wounds has been inscribed on the vietnam veterans memorial in 
washington it will be dedicated at a nov 11 ceremony with the 
names of 19 other servicemen recently added to the black granite 
wall which carries the names of more than 58000 americans 
his mother maggie heugel of taylor mich will be there 
he would be very proud mrs heugel said in a telephone 
interview from her home a softspoken woman who works the 
allnight shift making salads for airline dinners she still finds 
it hard to discuss her son without crying 
truman a strong might not be able to attend the ceremony but 
the event will be special nonetheless for the livonia dentist 
strong launched the campaign to have heugels name inscribed on the 
memorial and enlisted the help of rep william ford dmich who 
interceded with the pentagon 
he was the nicest kid ive ever seen very easygoing 
strong said he deserves to be on that memorial as much as 
anybody

dearborn heights service station when the draft notice came 
by feb 23 1969 the day his life changed forever he was 
cpl heugel assistant gunner on a 105mm howitzer 
as he manned his weapon in a bunker two miles from the ho chi 
minh trail a mortar shell exploded nearby wounding a buddy 
heugel ran to summon a medic 
then i got it too heugel said in a 1974 interview with the 
detroit news i remember getting hit and smelling the gunpowder 
and then falling over backward then there was a medic leaning over 
me saying oh my god oh my god 
he was evacuated to japan where doctors rated his survival 
chances as practically nil telegrams were sent to michigan urging 
his family to hurry to his bedside 
one physician however suggested a risky operation that would 
involve further amputations and removal of 80 percent of heugels 
spine it would mean he would never even sit up again but he might 
live 
heugel resisted 
fords office helped mrs heugel catch a flight to tokyo where 
she persuaded her son to undergo the surgery he spent four years 
convalescing in hospitals repeatedly confounding predictions that 
he would die within months 
with sheer grit and help from friends he managed to lead a 
productive life despite being permanently confined to a prone 
position on a hospital gurney 
heugel taught himself to drive a specially equipped van 
controlling the brakes gears and accelerator with a single lever 
he and his mother drove to the 1982 worlds fair in knoxville 
tenn and to disney world in orlando fla a veterans of foreign 
wars post raised money for an elevator and recreation room in 
heugels home he read played pool and poker and took up 
photography 
we had a great time together mrs heugel said everybody 
that knew him loved him he cheered up people who came to see him 
he also became a volunteer in fords congressional campaigns 
driving workers around the district and making telephone calls 
i have an annual family birthday picnic and hed come ford 
said people would marvel at how hed drive up in his van wheel 
himself out on his gurney his courage was remarkable i never 
heard a bitter word out of him that he had gotten a raw deal that 
anybody owed him anything 
but life was difficult heugel required heavy doses of 
painkillers and he was constantly returning to the local veterans 
hospital for dialysis and other treatment he developed cirrhosis 
of the liver from a blood transfusion and toward the end his heart 
deteriorated 
no one disputed heugels fitness for a spot on the vietnam 
memorial when his name was submitted in 1987 but because of the 
strict qualification standards and red tape it took a year to win 
the pentagons approval 
for mrs heugel the passage of time has made it no easier to 
understand the war and her sons fate i dont even watch the war 
movies on tv i cant she said i dont know why it had to 
happen before my son went to vietnam he never said nothing 
like i dont want to go but he just said mom why do we have to 
go and fight people we dont even know 
heugel died may 12 1984 at age 35

former first lady nancy reagan says she failed 
to talk her husband into retiring after one term in the white 
house then argued in his second term that he should tone down his 
antisoviet rhetoric 
mrs reagan discusses some of her disagreements with former 
president reagan and his advisers in her new book my turn 
coauthored with william nowak and scheduled for publication friday 
by random house 
she makes light of her influence at times but leaves no doubt 
that she expressed herself strongly on many personnel and other 
decisions of reagans administration 
had it been up to me she writes ronald reagan might well 
have been a oneterm president 
she says that in 1983 missing her friends and her home in 
california and concerned for her husbands safety after one attempt 
on his life she tried to persuade him not to run again 
reagan was determined to seek reelection so that he could work 
for his policies for another four years and because he believed it 
had been too long since a president had served a full two terms 
she says 
in the end she writes it was just a matter of convincing 
me 
the former first lady says her husband was never a 
warmonger but his calling the soviet union an evil empire 
was not particularly helpful in establishing a dialogue with the 
other side 
the world had become too small for the two superpowers not to 
be on speaking terms and unless that old perception about ronnie 
could be revised nothing positive was likely to happen she 
writes 
some of his advisers wanted him to keep up the tough rhetoric 
but i argued against it and suggested that he tone it down as 
always ronnie listened to various points of view and then made the 
decision that he thought was best 
many of the stories mrs reagan tells have been told before from 
different perspectives but the book gives some new insights into 
the view of the reagan administration and the presidency from the 
east wing where the first ladys office is located 
the west wing has traditionally seen itself as the sole center 
of power and the men surrounding the president have resented any 
assertion of independence and autonomy on the part of the first 
lady she writes but it doesnt have to be that way after 
all nobody knows the president better than his wife 
mrs reagan says she believes acceptance of her advice might 
have saved the president trouble in several instances 
she says reagan did not ask her opinion of david stockman the 
white house budget director who expressed his misgivings about the 
reagan administration economic plan in a 1981 magazine article but 
she says she gave it to him anyway 
had it been up to me stockman would have been out on the 
street that afternoon she writes but ronnie can be stubborn 
and he insisted on keeping stockman i believed then and i believe 
now that this was a serious mistake 
she says she and the president also disagreed about secretary of 
labor raymond donovan who resigned after being indicted on fraud 
and larceny charges of which he was later acquitted he had done 
nothing wrong she says but as i told ronnie on any number of 
occasions it would have been better for everyone if hed stepped 
down earlier 
mrs reagan says that after white house chief of staff donald t 
regan came under fire for his handling of the irancontra crisis 
i told ronnie repeatedly that he should be fired but it was many 
months before ronnie took that advice 
mrs reagan defends her practice of consulting an astrologer 
which was revealed by regan in his white house memoirs she also 
says that when the president found about it he told her if it 
makes you feel better go ahead and do it but be careful it might 
look a little odd if it ever came out

elizabeth dole began the debate over raising 
the 55 mph speed limit by stressing safety but in the privacy of 
the reagan white house the debate turned to states rights budget 
worries and electionyear politics 
mr edwin meese felt this is a good issue to put off until 
december or politically we will be seen as raising the speed 
limit read the final paragraph of the minutes of the july 1986 
session in the roosevelt room and the words from the attorney 
general settled the issue 
the minutes and scores of others detailing reagans domestic 
and economic policy councils were recently released under the 
freedom of information act 
the hundreds of pages offer a behindthescenes look at how 
officials weighed ideology and politics in setting policy on issues 
from aids to the governments petroleum reserves to establishment 
of minimum government standards for toaster ovens and other 
household appliances 
they also show reagan aides could become exasperated by public 
criticism 
the public often does not recognize that environmental 
protection can conflict with other social goals environmental 
protection agency chief lee thomas said in one council memo 
there are unrealistic expectations of what we can and should 
achieve 
the debate over the speed limit on july 24 1986 went this way 
according to the notes 
mrs dole then transportation secretary began by saying a 
higher speed limit no doubt would lead to increased highway deaths 
but she said she believed the administration should support raising 
it to 65 mph on rural highways 
budget director james miller thanked her for her analysis and 
then promptly disagreed saying outright repeal of the national 
limit was the best course because the federal government had no 
business setting speed limits 
beryl sprinkel the presidents conservative top economic 
adviser concurred and said safety was not the sole issue 
mr sprinkel said that if we believe in federalism we should 
leave speed to the states and let the consumers decide the speed 
they will travel according to the minutes he felt the 55 mph 
limit is bad regulatory policy and that we need to be sensitive to 
costs as well as safety 
in principle bill brock and donald p hodel secretaries of 
labor and interior agreed but then they talked politics 
hodel said if we support a federal limit of 65 mph we could be 
held responsible for increased deaths the minutes read added 
brock if we are wrong on this issue we can lose votes 
attorney general meese had heard enough as chairman of the 
group he deferred the decision to another day 
congress and the white house ultimately agreed to the 65 mph 
rural limit but that didnt come until after the 1986 elections a 
reflection of white house concern over bucking polls that showed 
opverwhelming public support for the 55 mph limit in effect since 
the energy crisis of the 1970s 
the minutes included in the recently released files of the top 
aide to former housing secretary samuel pierce show that the most 
frequent topics of discussion at the domestic policy sessions from 
1985 through 1987 were reagans drug policy and how the 
administration should respond to the aids epidemic 
the council considered a virtually identical memo on aids more 
than a halfdozen times 
in november 1985 the first paragraph said 14000 aids cases had 
been diagnosed in the united states by may 1987 the number had 
grown to 35000 and the advisers thought it time to name a 
presidential commission 
invariably the potential political impact at home and abroad of 
suggested policies was discussed 
on one occasion in december 1985 top cabinet members were 
discussing a plan to retaliate against japan for unfair trade 
practices when trade representative clayton yeutter said japanese 
prime minister nakasone had asked that the action at least be 
delayed two weeks until the japanese parliament adjourned 
the reagan advisers agreed and treasury secretary james a 
baker iii said the administration would need a public line if 
asked to explain the delay although the administration had a plan 
in hand baker according to the minutes said official position 
would be that it was just drafting one 
the topics of the power policy sessions werent always so 
weighty 
for a february 1987 meeting the subject was the appliancehis 
day 
instead a memo to the advisers suggested the administration 
take a stand because under the bill 90 percent of current 
frostfree refrigerators could no longer be sold 
they decided on a classic washington course of action 
suggesting amendments to relax the standards and recommending the 
president sign the bill if it were altered

in 15 seconds as deep jagged fissures cut 
through the santa cruz mountains and earthquake waves rocked a 
world series crowd euphoria turned to fear and life may have 
changed forever for millions of californians 
it came without warning the only sound close to the milewide 
25milelong ruptures along the san andreas fault seemed like 
distant thunder in the mountains until the cruel random 
destruction began 
then there were the sickening sounds of crashing cars broken 
glass and crumbling houses 
fifteen seconds time enough to kill dozens injure thousands 
displace more than 10000 people and wreak billions of dollars 
worth of damage time enough to send a jolt up and down the state 
and across the valleys and deserts 
in the first five seconds the heart and perhaps the soul of 
picturesque santa cruz were destroyed hundredyearold homes 
survivors of the 1906 great quake gone quaint downtown shops 
reduced to rubble longtime residents stunned and many later would 
talk about leaving a city prized for its freespirited lifestyle 
surfing beaches and historic boardwalk 
about 10 seconds later the towering bay bridge symbol of a 
world series between the san francisco giants and oakland athletics 
that had infused the bay area with giddiness and pride partially 
collapsed and a section of interstate 880 came smashing down on 
rushhour commuters 
candlestick park where 62000 fans waited for the start of game 
3 of the series quivered violently but didnt fall amazingly 
there was no panic no stampede for the exits indeed a wild roar 
erupted from the fans who took the quake as an omen of the giants 
comeback from two losses 
at the same moment beautiful apartment buildings and condos 
worth millions of dollars tumbled or caught fire in san francisco 
on the soft landfill in the marina district a mile from 
fishermans wharf luxury cars were crushed by the bricks and 
debris remnants of the good life lay on the sidewalks and littered 
streets stereos vcrs skis golf clubs carried out by desperate 
residents trying to salvage whatever they could 
oaklands ornate city hall was rendered unusable along with a 
dozen other buildings homes and businesses in silicon valley the 
hightech center of the nation located between santa cruz and san 
francisco somehow escaped with relatively little damage 
skyscrapers in the cities swayed but didnt fall 
when the quake struck it was the start of happy hour in 
many restaurants and bars and patrons were gathered to watch the 
series when suddenly bottles and glasses and mirrors flew in every 
direction 
children waiting to be picked up from day care centers began 
wailing as they tumbled among the scattering toys 
water sloshed out of pools dishes fell liquor stores and 
supermarkets had bottles and groceries splattered on the floor 
no one who survived those 15 seconds of terror at 504 pm on 
oct 17 1989 is likely to forget where he or she was just as 
those who lived through the great quake of 1906 never forgot what 
happened to them 
whether they were injured suffered damage to their homes or 
businesses or the losses of friends or relatives the survivors 
must live with the memory of the event and the fear it could happen 
again on an even larger scale 
they are trying to return to normal life but it is difficult 
when the evidence of ruin is so widespread and more than 1500 
aftershocks have hit since 
this is one of those events like the kennedy assassination 
that almost everyone who lived through it will remember in 
detail said dr donald tarver a psychiatrist with the mission 
crisis unit in san francisco it had a lifechanging context for 
those who lost homes or loved ones and it could have lifechanging 
consequences for many others who shared in an event with such a 
wide impact 
it all began 10 miles underground in the mountains along the san 
andreas fault the boundary between the north american and pacific 
tectonic plates which move sideways to each other at the rate of 
two inches a year 
the fault straight in some places curves like the letter s 
in the santa cruz area 57 miles south of san francisco causing 
both horizontal motions and compression according to robert 
uhrhammer research seismologist for the university of 
californiaberkeley seismographic station 
on tuesday when the strain exceeded the strength of the rock 
the earths crust ruptured unleashing a force that uhrhammer said 
was equivalent to about 30 million tons of high explosives nearly 
10 times the total of explosive power of all bombs in world war ii 
including the two atomic bombs 
compression waves shot out in all directions at the rate of 
18000 mph followed by the more damaging horizontal shear waves 
traveling at 10800 mph and elliptically shaped waves going 7800 
mph 
unlike the narrow 270milelong split from the 1906 quake in 
the same region the new quake caused many cracks fractures 
slides and slumps along a broader shorter zone

the berkeley stations instruments measured the magnitude of 
tuesdays quake at 7 on the richter scale a bit more than the 69 
magnitude registered on the alaskabased seismograph of the us 
geological survey in a few weeks scientists from around the world 
will meet to compare notes and tag the quake with its official 
reading 
when the quake hit candlestick giants center fielder brett 
butler was stretching down the rightfield line the first thing he 
saw was the lights blinking off one by one 
i thought there was a ceremony they hadnt told us about and i 
expected to see the blue angels parachute down near home plate 
he said then i heard the crowd and i knew something was up then 
i felt the ground start rolling 
a few miles away in the tube under the bay anthony ramsey of 
hayward couldnt understand why his train was suddenly dark and 
standing still 
nobody told us what was going on ramsey said we waited 
around about an hour until it started back up nobody panicked but 
we were all upset i would rather have known what was happening 
but maybe it was better that way it might have panicked people to 
know they were in the tube during a big quake 
the quake knocked down power lines and cut electricity supplies 
to more than 1 million customers including all of san francisco 
at that same moment the worst disaster occurred across the bay 
in oakland when a milelong stretch of the elevated portion of 
interstate 880 buckled and crumbled cars on top plunged downward 
and those on the bottom were buried under tons of concrete and 
twisted steel 
among those killed on the highway were five women employees of 
the university of california at san francisco who were traveling 
home to alameda in a carpool van they were just five minutes 
from home said bruce marsden husband of one of the vans 
victims donna marsden 
on the bay bridge a section of the upper deck dropped down like 
a trap door one woman tried to race her car across the gap but her 
car plunged down and smashed into the hanging slab of roadway she 
died later of massive injuries 
the capricious nature of the quakes death toll claimed young 
and old 
scott dickinson a 3monthold infant was killed in the 
collapse of a building in the marina only minutes before his 
father walter had waved goodbye to his wife and son and pedaled 
off on a bike ride when he returned his son was dead and his wife 
seriously injured 
diane laufer 40 and paul harris 48 of san francisco died in 
a crush of rubble in the city 
the couple died hand in hand with his hand on hers as if he 
were trying to protect her said paramedic joe delligatti she 
died first he said a few more words and then died 
len jann a bay area rapid transit station agent observed with 
a sense of hope that the 15 seconds of the quake may have claimed 
many lives but also created a special bond among those who lived 
through it 
the scene that is most vivid in my mind is when we were 
walking up the stairs at night to take some women to the ferry and 
we saw these waves of people walking down market street he said 
they were in the middle of the street on islands on sidewalks 
everybody calm nobody panicking all talking people who had never 
met before 
you could smell smoke in the air hear sirens from the police 
cars ambulances and fire trucks he said it was like a scene 
out of a horror move or a war film we were at ground zero and we 
survived

from the pursuit of democracy to 
an unbending adherence to socialism communist countries are 
responding in vastly different ways to the reforms of soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the power shift in east germany last week was another reminder 
of the influence of reform movements rippling across the east bloc 
but the speed and the scope of change varies depending on the 
level of tolerance at the top 
poland is pursuing democracy and a free market economy with a 
vigor borne of economic desperation romania though also plagued 
with terrible food shortages and skyrocketing inflation is keeping 
a tight grip on socialism 
czechoslovakia and hungary are in somewhat better shape 
economically but czechoslovakia jails prodemocracy dissenters 
while hungary says they can run for political office next year 
seemingly adrift in this unpredictable ideological sea is east 
germany long considered a hardline adherent to communism but now 
something of a question mark 
communist party officials in east germany acted to remove erich 
honecker as leader only after mounting protests at home and a flood 
of emigrants to the west deeply embarrassed the orthodox socialist 
leadership 
the new leader 52yearold egon krenz has been considered a 
hardliner also but he tried to give the impression of 
conciliation during his first days in office and on saturday he 
was quoted as saying there may be important lessons to be 
learned from gorbachevs reforms 
the man who gave strength to the communist reform movement 
gorbachev continues to lead the soviet union down a rocky path of 
greater openness and a less centralized economy 
gorbachev who must deal with sniping from the right and the 
left over his policies and a phalanx of ethnic disputes in the 
soviet republics has said he will not interfere in what the rest 
of the warsaw pact alliance is doing 
moscow however is expected to keep siding with east germany 
czechoslovakia and other eastern european countries that hold the 
partys leading role sacrosanct 
in east germany the new forum and other opposition groups used 
gorbachevs visit to the country earlier this month to press for 
reform 
if gorbachev werent there the new forum people would be sent 
to the hinterlands or be sitting in prison says eastwest expert 
josef janning of the university of mainz 
western countries have made it clear they are willing to help 
those countries undertaking political and economic reforms the 
us house overwhelmingly approved 837 million in aid to poland 
and hungary on thursday nearly double what the white house had 
asked 
only the market place only free enterprise can solve the 
desperate economic problems of the eastern countries us 
secretary of commerce robert a mosbacher said in a speech in 
frankfurt last week 
marxist economics do not work 
despite that assertion there are likely to be problems ahead as 
growing calls for capitalistoriented free enterprise clash with 
the cradletograve socialism that now reigns in eastern europe 
the changes have created much friction between hardline and 
progressive countries hungary infuriated warsaw pact ally east 
germany in september by opening its western borders to east german 
refugees 
that was only one of several changes initiated by the 
reformminded leaders in budapest who also have promoted greater 
free enterprise and promised free elections by june 
this free elections characterizes all modern democratic 
legal states interior minister istvan horvath told parliament on 
thursday 
although the leadership has disbanded the communist party in a 
symbolic move the top figures remain at the head of the newly 
created socialist party 
poland is giddy over becoming the first east bloc country led by 
noncommunists but is facing the potential for more unrest as it 
implements tough austerity measures 
communists meanwhile still control the foreign trade defense 
interior and transportation ministries 
bulgaria has been paying lip service to reform and has 
introduced limited economic changes but is unlikely to change much 
under 78yearold leader todor zhivkov 
in czechoslovakia the communist government responded to a wave 
of prodemocracy protests in january with carefully targeted 
repression of key activists 
that prompted czechoslovak playwright and human rights activist 
vaclav havel who was jailed for four months this year to speak of 
a country where one is still thrown in jail for his words and 
where socialism has become a rubber truncheon 
in romania the east bloc reform movement irked stalinist 
president nicolae ceausescu so much that he suggested warsaw pact 
intervention to block solidaritys takeover in poland 
ceausescus ironfisted 24year rule in romania refuses to 
budge despite chronic shortages of food and fuel that leave 
thousands literally shivering in their homes each winter 
yugoslavia though not a member of the soviet bloc has been 
grappling with serious ethnic clashes that until now have 
overshadowed growing calls to banish the communist partys power 
monopoly 
yugoslavs for decades have enjoyed the freedoms that many of 
their eastern european neighbors would cherish the country faces 
mounting economic troubles and an inflation rate of nearly 1200 
percent while hundreds of thousands have gone to the west in 
search of work

one pennsylvania lawmaker received 
gruesome pictures of aborted fetuses in the mail while another was 
accused of maintaining an unholy alliance with the pope 
as the legislature prepares to vote on a stringent package of 
abortion restrictions this week protesters have hung metal hangers 
on the walls of legislators district offices conducted 
candlelight vigils picketed lawmakers when they spoke at almost 
any kind of appearance and sent mail by the truckload 
when the vote is taken tuesday the traditionally antiabortion 
legislature could become the first in the nation to adopt abortion 
restrictions since the supreme court allowed states more latitude 
in restricting abortions in july an effort to pass new 
restrictions fell short in the florida legislature earlier this 
month gov robert p casey has said he will sign the bill 
prochoice lawmakers who hold a minority in both the house and 
senate here plan to fight the proposed restrictions and also will 
try to loosen current regulations 
the missouri measures upheld by the supreme court ruling july 3 
ban abortions in public hospitals stop public employees from 
counseling women about abortions and require doctors performing 
abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks old to determine if 
it could live outside the womb 
the antiabortion legislation before the pennsylvania 
legislature would ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy 
except to save the life of the mother prohibit abortions based on 
a fetus sex require women to inform their husbands if they plan 
to get an abortion and require a 24hour waiting period the 
legislation also would ban experiments done with the tissue of an 
aborted fetus except to save its life 
last year casey vetoed antiabortion legislation saying he 
opposes abortion but didnt think it would survive a court 
challenge but in light of the supreme court decision casey said 
he believed the current legislation would withstand a court fight 
rep stephen freind a suburban philadelphia republican and the 
legislatures chief abortion opponent said he hopes to get his 
proposed restrictions passed as an amendment to a bill now before 
the house that would toughen penalties for incest he said he 
thought the measure could be passed more quickly that way rather 
than having the restrictions considered in a separate bill 
rep karen ritter a democrat from the lehigh valley who leads 
the house prochoice caucus said lobbying from both sides has been 
intense 
i got a postcard from a priest with a picture of a mutilated 
fetus it said im praying for your soul to come back to 
christ she said 
antiabortion supporters have vowed to bump her from the seat 
she has held since 1987 her father james ritter held the same 
seat from 165 to 1982 and received similar pressure she said 
chris mcnally a freshman democrat from allegheny county said 
he is taking the 1000 hangers taped to his office last week by 
prochoice advocates and using them in an impromptu clothing drive 
the hangers have become the symbol of the prochoice movement 
because they signify how some women were forced to abort their 
fetuses before abortion became legal 
i think its great people ought to lobby like this for every 
issue theres a lot of other issues that are very important and i 
wish people would be more active on those mcnally said 
an ardent opponent of abortion rep gerard kosinski said his 
most memorable communication with prochoice advocates was a letter 
chastising him for taking orders from the vatican 
as yet im still awaiting a call from the pope kosinski 
said 
so far this fall abortion opponents have made little headway in 
state capitals or in congress in austin texas on friday gov 
bill clements stunned antiabortion leaders when he announced that 
abortion restrictions will not appear on an agenda of an upcoming 
special legislative session 
clements said the nov 14 special session will be limited to 
workers compensation reform 
clements spokeswoman said she didnt think the governor was 
swayed by recent events in florida where the legislature rejected 
in two days all abortion restrictions proposed by gov bob martinez

britain on saturday rejected as 
wrongheaded a commonwealth strategy on south africa seeking to 
tighten financial pressures but said the organization now 
acknowledges measures should not be punitive 
it is a novel recognition that change is beginning in south 
africa that change is welcome and that we do not wish to hand 
a brokenbacked economy over to a new south africa said british 
foreign secretary john major 
he said there was a very welcome and new recognition at the 
49nation commonwealth summit that sanctions may be relaxed as we 
begin to see evidence that apartheid is being dismantled 
britain also rejected outright three other key sections of a 
draft declaration on south africa 
the draft was drawn up by a 10nation foreign ministers 
committee after a day of argument diplomats called the exchanges 
robust 
officials from canada which headed the committee said that 
with britain refusing to budge from its lone opposition to 
sanctions we agreed to disagree 
commonwealth leaders debated the south africa draft during a 
weekend retreat at langkawi a luxury resort island 210 miles 
northwest of kuala lumpur 
malayasian officials said the final version would be issued 
sunday 
at the retreat some of the leaders played golf and pakistan 
prime minister benazir bhuttos 15monthold son bilawal joined 
other leaders for lunch in his high chair 
in a separate development the summit issued a declaration on 
the environment which in a victory for developed nations rejected 
an indian demand to set up a new environmental fund 
the developed nations including britain argued there was a 
need for additional money but a new fund would be a wasteful 
duplication of un programs 
major rejected both the call to tighten financial screws on 
south africa and to reappoint a foreign ministers committee 
drawing up the communique on financial sanctions 
we think they the decisions are both wrongheaded major 
said in an interview with the british broadcasting corp 
diplomatic sources said the draft avoids setting any deadline 
for reforms under threat of new sanctions 
but the foreign ministers committee expanded to nine with the 
inclusion of malaysia is to meet again in april to examine whether 
south africas new president fw de klerk has delivered on 
promises of reform 
despite the deep differences the draft appeared to mark a 
modest shift toward consensus on south africa an issue which has 
long isolated britain from its former colonies 
south africa quit the commonwealth in 1961 
the draft declaration encompasses a fivepoint australian 
proposal to organize international aid for a postapartheid south 
africa and says pressures should be eased if there is 
irreversible change sources said 
apart from legalizing the african national congress guerrilla 
movement that would mean de klerk introducing legislation to 
abolish fundamental race laws that deny south africas black 
majority the vote 
britain complained here that the commonwealth condemns south 
africa constantly while remaining silent of human rights violations 
by black groups including the south west african peoples 
organization in namibia

african national congress leaders 
plan to address a rally in south africa for the first time since 
the organization was banned in 1960 activists said saturday the 
government has granted permission 
its time for the anc leaders to address the nation said 
cyril ramaphosa general secretary of the national union of 
mineworkers 
the seven anc leaders freed from prison last sunday will speak 
at the rally oct 29 in the black township of soweto outside 
johannesburg the activists said 
the activists belong to the national reception committee a 
group of leaders and workers in major antiapartheid organizations 
set up to deal with release of the black leaders 
apart from being a welcoming party the rally is going to be 
an occasion at which our leaders will be making a major address to 
the nation on a whole range of issues said ramaphosa 
he said the government had been informed of plans for the rally 
but no permission was sought however the department of justice 
said in a statement late friday that the chief magistrate of 
johannesburg had approved the rally 
no african national congress rally has been allowed in south 
africa since the organization was banned in 1960 
informed by reporters of the government action ramaphosa said 
i am sure they knew that if they didnt allow it we would have 
taken them on 
he spoke at a news conference near the home of senior anc leader 
walter sisulu where the black green and gold anc flag legal 
but seldom tolerated by police flew above the roof 
sisulu and some of the other freed prisoners met saturday with 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu at an impromptu birthday 
celebration for sisulus activist wife albertina 72 
having walter home is the best birthday present i could ever 
have been given said mrs sisulu who had been prohibited from 
making public statements or attending public meetings since 
february 1988 
she said she intended to make her first address sunday at a 
rally in johannesburg in support of the southwest african peoples 
organization fighting a preindependence election in namibia 
mrs sisulus restrictions were lifted oct 13 but the 
organization she heads the united democratic front is still 
banned she was reelected this week as copresident of the front 
a coalition of antiapartheid organizations youth groups and 
township committees 
also saturday sisulu and tutu reacted negatively to a statement 
by president fw de klerk that before the government can consider 
lifting the emergency and legalizing organizations the groups must 
promise that all violence will end 
the more de klerk allows our meetings to go ahead without 
hindrance the more he will understand that we are a peaceloving 
people said sisulu the organizations shall not give 
guarantees as to the cessation of violence it is the government 
which must pave the way for peace 
tutu cited the many peaceful marches that have occurred since de 
klerk took power in august the only violence happened when police 
stopped a march by women in pretoria and when some black youths 
broke shop windows and looted at the end of a march in 
pietermaritzburg

poland is pressing president bush to 
lead relief efforts for its new noncommunist government but 
western leaders have made clear they see the matter as primarily 
europes responsibility 
participants at last weeks eastwest security conference in 
frankfurt called security in the 1990s indicated they will 
continue to approach financial aid for reformoriented east 
european states as in the security interests of all western nations 
chancellor helmut kohls government already has promised more 
than 1 billion in debt relief to poland and projects to aid 
hungary in its move toward a multiparty democracy are also in the 
works in advance of kohls visit to budapest in december 
the group of seven wealthy democracies decided at their summit 
in paris in july to coordinate aid to poland and hungary through 
the european economic community based in brussels belgium 
poland however would like to see washington lead the effort 
its soon to become a question of whether we have a marshall 
plan or martial law said dariusz k rosati director of warsaws 
foreign trade research institute 
i say this to help visualize the dramatic choice facing the 
western side he said in an interview 
the marshall plan was a broad usfinanced aid program that 
helped west germany rebuild itself into an economic powerhouse 
after the destruction of world war ii 
some west german politicians have suggested a similar relief 
effort be organized for poland and hungary to help rebuild 
economies that have been ravaged by four decades of socialism 
if there is no substantial improvement in the market situation 
within a few months no one not even the mazowiecki government 
will be able to control what happens rosati said referring to 
the new leadership of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a former 
solidarity journalist 
rosati said the bush government should do the most because the 
united states has always played a leading role in supporting change 
in poland 
but he acknowledged that european efforts have been swifter and 
more comprehensive in organizing food aid and debt relief for 
poland 
bush has pledged 200 million in aid to poland in conjunction 
with a western fund being set up to help the new warsaw government 
the us house of representatives substantially upped bushs aid 
offer with its approval thursday of 837 million in support for 
hungary and poland but the package still awaits senate approval 
and the white house has suggested the sum may be excessive 
kohls chief foreign affairs adviser horst teltschik has said 
the chancellor plans to guarantee during his visit to warsaw in 
midnovember that the aid pool will reach 1 billion effectively 
promising whatever west german contribution is needed to reach that 
level 
us commerce secretary robert a mosbacher told participants at 
the security conference thursday that eastern europes economic 
problems are homegrown and can be overcome only by 
wideranging internal changes 
only the marketplace only free enterprise can solve the 
desperate economic problems of the eastern countries mosbacher 
told the delegates in frankfurt 
polish participants complained his views were shortsighted and 
failed to address how poland should get through the difficult 
transition period 
rosati said inflation is spiraling and could soon overwhelm the 
patience of poles if they begin to see the turn toward democracy as 
costing them food and economic stability 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher reiterated 
bonns view that financial aid for reformist states like poland and 
hungary is a crucial means of maintaining political and military 
stability in europe in a period of rapid change

community leaders in this racially tense city are 
bracing for the trial of a police officer in the shooting death of 
a black motorcyclist that touched off riots in january 
acquittals of police officers in the deaths of blacks sparked 
violence in miami in 1980 and 1984 the impeachment conviction 
friday of a popular black federal judge a heated local election 
campaign and the drug war add kindling for catastrophe 
suspended miami officer william e lozano is charged with 
manslaughter in the jan 16 shooting of clement lloyd in a police 
chase after lloyd was shot his motorcycle crashed and passenger 
allan blanchard was fatally injured 
jury selection begins monday in circuit court unless lozanos 
attorneys succeed in getting the trial moved 
the proceedings will be watched carefully by miamis blacks who 
on friday saw us district judge alcee hastings removed by the 
senate for bribery conspiracy six years after his acquittal in a 
jury trial black reaction was angry but peaceful and an upbeat 
hastings announced he will run for governor 
nevertheless community leaders say the removal of floridas 
first black us district judge adds to tensions fueled by a 
campaign in which a cubanamerican is seeking a city commission 
seat traditionally held by a black 
perceptions of political and judicial inequality combined with 
persistent problems of crime and poverty in the innercity 
neighborhoods may need only a spark to flash into violence again 
some community leaders say 
if too many of those things break together and appear to be 
going against the black community i think there could be a 
demonstration of concern and anger said arthur teele a black 
lawyer to quote dr martin luther king dark and difficult days 
lie ahead 
mayor xavier suarez said he doesnt think a dantes inferno 
scenario will occur although he and other city officials are 
preparing for the possibility of riots if lozano is acquitted 
lozano boosted by fundraising efforts on spanishlanguage 
radio in miami and in colombia for his defense expressed 
confidence last week 
im innocent what i did i did in selfdefense and were 
going to prove that in court said lozano who is of colombian 
descent 
defense attorneys roy black and mark seiden helped miami officer 
luis alvarez gain acquittal in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a 
black youth that verdict began two days of violence 
in 1980 the acquittal of five metrodade officers in the 
beating death of a black motorcyclist sparked three days of bloody 
rioting that killed 18 people 
police chief perry anderson who is black and was raised in 
miamis inner city said most blacks he hears talking about the 
case just want to see a fair trial but he stills expects an 
acquittal to mean trouble in part because efforts to ease the 
despair and frustration underlying the recurrent racial violence 
have infringed on the profitable turfs of crack dealers 
i know for a fact that the drug dealers are preparing to try 
to cause problems a riot anderson said they like to see the 
police in a hostile situation the community hostile against the 
police 
unlike the sudden january disturbances in which one person died 
and 22 stores were burned police this time have had months to 
prepare all 1100 officers will be on call at the end of the 
trial expected to last about three weeks 
the city has ordered 700 gas masks and has two armored personnel 
carriers and national guard military equipment available 
the city has a clear mandate from people in overtown liberty 
city and other predominantly black neighborhoods not to allow 
looting suarez said 
anderson said police will make arrests immediately unlike in 
january when they formed a perimeter and refrained from mass 
arrests until the third day of violence the trouble occurred the 
week before the city was host to the super bowl 
because the trouble broke out on martin luther king day police 
were reluctant to charge into a community whose holiday had been 
disrupted by a police killing anderson said 
youve got to utilize force but youve also got to use 
sensitivity he said 
a review panel set up after the january riots called on police 
to improve recruitment and promotion of blacks anderson said the 
police force is 19 percent black up from 17 percent and moving 
toward a goal of 21 percent to match the percentage of blacks in 
the city population

chris hervey started her week with an 
office to go to each morning and a house to return to each night 
now she has neither 
but she has no time for pouting or pity im here the 
earthquake survivor said proudly i think people are just happy 
theyre alive then you assess your losses you take what youve 
got and you go on 
its a philosophy shared by many residents of santa cruz county 
as they recover rebuild and rebound from the catastrophic quake 
that shook their communities last week 
start all over its what you have to do said john kane 
who narrowly escaped death tuesday as he watched from the doorway 
while a stream of bricks tumbled from the top of the building that 
houses his insurance business 
you cant roll over and die he said surveying his office 
equipment spread out in the rubblestrewn parking lot in the back 
of the office building that has been condemned 
its time for a rebirth he said 
but he knows it wont be easy im preparing myself for a lot 
of problems and a lot of trials and a lot of frustrations he 
said 
others will be in the same predicament in this county where five 
people died hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged and 
thousands were left homeless some have ended up with the sky as a 
roof huddling in tents or sleeping bags in school grounds parking 
lots and back yards 
though some businesses have reopened and electricity has been 
restored in many places in towns such as watsonville there still 
are long lines for food and mothers and their children walk the 
streets carrying empty plastic jugs in search of water 
damage estimates already have reached the billiondollar mark in 
this county of 229000 people and the devastation is felt from the 
rugged mountains near the epicenter of the quake where fissures 
ripped open threefoot gashes in the earth to the pacific garden 
mall in santa cruz where buildings split open like melons to the 
agricultural town of watsonville where a victorian gothic church 
that survived the 1906 quake wasnt as lucky this time 
for people in the county this is only the latest assault by 
nature in recent years there have been floods and fires and 
fears of an earthquake 
and if tuesdays temblor wasnt bad enough a series of 
aftershocks frayed nerves and knocked down people trying to get 
back on their feet 
people say i think im going to die said crisis counselor 
rosa zayas whos been helping out at a 24hour medical clinic in 
watsonville people are sick theyre vomiting theyre confused 
theyre not sure its stopped 
miss hervey for one said the aftershocks were so big that when 
her hands began trembling you couldnt tell if it was nerves 
your pulse or the earthquake 
her house has been condemned and she said she has slept 
outside taking her 86yearold grandmother with her you sleep 
in an area where nothing falls on you she explained 
mary oyervides said she along with her husband and two 
children spent the last two nights in a car then in a tent her 
7yearold daughter she said was with her the day of the quake 
and witnessed flying bricks and trembling buildings for a few days 
after she said when something was not moving she would think it 
was moving 
now she said she just holds on to us 
randy graff who works as a red cross volunteer at a santa cruz 
shelter said he also notices lingering fears when there was an 
aftershock thursday i watched people get off their cots and 
start running he said people are cracking under the 
pressure 
but others are coping with their losses by getting involved 
doctors and nurses have offered their services at the free 
watsonville clinic scores of volunteers have showed up to help the 
red cross at shelters 
one is ken biby who lost his mobile home and many of his 
belongings in the quake 
ive been keeping myself busy he said as long as im 
doing this i aint got all of that on my mind 
he said he and his family are planning to move next week to 
alaska originally he had planned to wait until next summer but 
he said this was the extra push i needed 
biby is pragmatic about his plight 
if i had lost a kid i probably would have gone crazy he 
said i face reality material things can be replaced humans 
cant i got my truck i got my wife and my kids thats enough 
and for those who are staying in santa cruz county theres a 
combination of resiliency and an acceptance of natures quirks 
you can take your choice miss hervey said theres stuff all 
over the world that can scare your shorts off 
red cross volunteer graff said he also is staying and expects 
others will too people here he said are trying to gather 
their things their thoughts fix themselves up and dust themselves 
off and be ready for the next one

nine months after attorney general dick 
thornburgh ousted five career civil servants from the justice 
departments public affairs staff he has hired two political 
appointees to help answer reporters queries 
michael robinson who helps edit the daily news summary for 
president bush and amy j casner an aide to health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan will soon join the department 
chief spokesman david runkel said friday 
thornburgh had cited budgetary constraints nine months ago when 
he laid off the five career spokesmen with many years in their 
jobs the latest appointments bring to three the number of new 
public affairs officers hired since the office was scaled back 
last spring thornburgh appointed daniel eramian who had been a 
republican party spokesman in the massachusetts legislature to be 
deputy public affairs director 
runkel denied that the hirings are part of a plan to replace 
career employees with republican party loyalists but since the 
layoffs earlier this year joseph c krovisky has been the only 
civil servant working as a justice department spokesman 
the intention of the the january rifs reductions in force 
an action which has been upheld by the office of personnel 
management was to bring the departments public affairs office 
within the budget set for it by the congress runkel said 
there is nothing being done which in any way would run counter 
to the omb office of management and budget personnel and 
budgetary provisions for the public affairs office runkel said 
this does not signal any increase in the personnel level or 
the budget runkel said he declined to say whether that meant 
someone currently on the staff would be leaving 
runkel who heads the office of public affairs was thornburghs 
press secretary when the attorney general was governor of 
pennsylvania 
casner who has worked in advertising as well as the bushquayle 
campaign press office last year will be paid 28800 a year 
robinson who has worked for the syracuse poststandard the 
chicago suntimes and the new york times will be paid 26200 
runkel said 
i think you will find these are bright energetic people who 
will assist our public affairs office he said 
thornburgh has had rocky relations with the justice department 
press corps in recent months 
he has been outspoken about stopping news leaks of details of 
ongoing criminal investigations saying that justice department 
attorneys should not talk to reporters 
he has ordered several leak investigations notably an extensive 
probe into disclosures that the fbi was investigating alleged 
financial irregularities in the office of rep william gray iii 
dpa 
that leak proved particularly embarrassing for thornburgh 
because it came as gray was running for house majority whip 
accusations from democrats that the justice department was 
engaged in political leaks prompted one of thornburghs top aides 
to state that gray was not a target of the investigation 
the justice department considered subpoenaing the telephone 
records of rita braver the cbs correspondent who first reported 
the gray story but leak investigators dropped the effort after 
determining the telephone company doesnt log local calls 
since then the justice departments criminal division adopted a 
new policy allowing for the prosecution of officials for theft of 
government property if they leak nonclassified information about 
criminal investigations 
previous department policy dating back to 1978 had barred the 
use of the statute to prosecute leakers conviction of the theft 
charge carries a 10year prison term

hours buried in the rubble of northern californias major 
earthquake he was able to wave his arms authorities said 
he has been removed and is in transit to highland hospital 
five miles from the scene said tom silvey a spokesman for the 
state office of emergency services in sacramento

57 hometown not immediately known he was alone in a chevrolet 
sprint automobile 
helms had a steady pulse and was apparently in stable condition 
silvey said 
oakland mayor lionel wilson was at the scene when the man was 
rescued and saw the man wave his arms 
when he came out it was just an incredible and a wonderful 
sight to see after he had been there some 89 hours the mayor 
said 
rescue operations had been suspended friday night because the 
1mile stretch of interstate 880 became too unstable but at 6 
am a transportation engineer reported seeing movement in a 
heavily damaged section and an allout effort started 
five fours later officials said the man was alive 
workers pushed dirt under the roadbed to stabilize it and 
drilled holes in the concrete to reach the victim 
it is a very very dangerous effort said california highway 
patrol spokesman mike garver 
rain winds and colder temperatures that began moving in today 
were expected to fill shelters for the homeless this weekend slow 
recovery work and possibly even touch off further landslides across 
earthquakeshaken northern california

said matt mclaughlin a relief coordinator in santa cruz county 
south of here where an estimated 10000 residents have been 
displaced and some have been sleeping outside 
at the fallen stretch of doubledeck interstate 880 in oakland 
the massive dig to recover bodies from the fallen stretch of 
doubledeck highway in oakland was suspended friday night after 
workers felt the roadway shake high winds were a contributing 
factor a spokesman said 
telephonepolesized timbers were trucked in to help prop up 
precariously perched chunks of roadway and dirt was heaped 
underneath for support 
coordinators said work would continue today unless nature 
inflicts further hardship on the area 
it depends on how hard the rain is if its not too hard we 
hope to be able to work through it said bob jacobs deputy 
district director of california department of transportation 
the national weather service said splatterings of light rain 
showers are moving through the bay area this morning and will 
continue through the night a second system sunday will bring 
heavier rain forecaster daryl williams said 
on friday state officials raised the estimate of damage from

oakland police said some 85 people are listed as missing 
building supply stores rushed to fill orders for glass plywood 
cement flashlights power generators and tarpaulins to shield 
from the rain 
rain also raised the threat of additional landslides in the 
mountains north of santa cruz where 60 homes already have been 
destroyed in boulder creek a town of 6800 
its a dangerous area but all my stuff is here my dogs are 
here i figured you go down with the ship where do you go said 
todd viele 27 who decided to stay 
county spokeswoman dinah phillips said not enough rain was 
expected to cause widespread land problems 
there probably will be some additional landslides but where 
you really get some serious land and mudslides is where the earth 
has been saturated and weve been having a drought said ms 
phillips 
national weather service forecaster doug atkinson said the storm 
would probably produce only onequarter inch of rain 
more than 1500 aftershocks have hit since tuesday 
a moderate aftershock measuring 40 on the richter scale struck 
near santa cruz at 550 pm pdt according to the seismograph 
station at the university of california at berkeley there were no

at 113 am friday an aftershock of magnitude 39 was centered 
about seven miles southwest of los gatos berkeley seismologists 
said it caused additional landslides in that shaky area south of 
san francisco and was felt north and south of the city 
the reality of the grim task of uncovering bodies at the i880 
disaster appeared to be taking a toll on workers friday even as 
president bush arrived for a tour 
you see a car thats crushed a lot of debris you usually 
find the people slumped over the steering wheel said alameda 
firefighter matt tunney who was part of the rescue operation 
id thought id seen everything this is devastation the 
worst disaster ive ever seen he said 
bush also was struck by what he saw as he toured ravaged areas 
to offer sympathy aid and a pledge of no bureaucratic redtape 
i am deeply moved by this saddened in some ways yet very 
stimulated by this team effort the president said 
bush walked over chunks of concrete beside the 1mile crumpled 
stretch of i880 where scores of people were feared entombed and 
talked with rescue workers he had said he hoped to offer 
encouragement 
ironworker joe carter said the president asked him how his 
rescue crew felt 
i told him were beat were tired but were still going 
at it carter said bush let me know the eyes of the world are 
on us right now 
relief aid continued to stream into the area friday but the 
most urgent requirement was for money to help relocate homeless 
families from sheltersto temporary living quarters such as hotels 
a red cross official said 
about 5000 people have been housed in 30 shelters in the region 
affected by tuesdays quake the red cross said 
members of the san francisco giants participants in baseballs 
suspended world series visited a downtown shelter friday to hand 
out souvenir balls caps and tshirts to families left homeless by 
the quake 
scientists roaming through mountains southeast of san francisco 
pinpointed the epicenter of tuesdays 504 pm killer quake in the 
northeast corner of the nisene marks state park near the top of 
aptos creek said joseph cotton with the us geological survey in 
menlo park 
thats about 57 miles from san francisco atop the san andreas 
fault and just 14 miles northeast santa cruz 
the scientists converged on the santa cruz mountains to look for 
the origins of the earthquake geologists were investigating 
whether a fissure hundreds of yards long and as wide as 20 inches 
in some spots was in fact the result of the san andreas fault 
rupturing to the surface 
estimates for reopening the main lifeline between san francisco 
and oakland the bay bridge slipped to at least a month 
engineers hoped to use a floating crane to lift the fallen 
200ton 50footlong fivelane highway span onto a barge this 
weekend and begin repairs the transportation department said 
at stanford university near palo alto 24 building were closed 
indefinitely and university president donald kennedy said the 
destruction certainly is going to add up in the many tens of 
millions of dollars 
housing for 500 students was damaged and professors have been 
asked to postpone tests 
in san franciscos marina district an upscale neighborhood 
where lifestyles crumbled along with stucco condominiums and posh 
apartments residents stuffed clothes artwork furniture and 
knickknacks into cars toy wagons and even laundry bags

a couple that claims their daughter was 
switched with another girl in a hospital maternity ward promised 
not to seek custody in exchange for an agreement on genetic testing 
to settle the dispute 
ernest and regina twigg returned from pennsylvania to sebring 
earlier this month to be closer to the 10yearold sarasota girl 
they claim is their daughter kimberly michelle mays 
the childs father robert mays agreed friday to the genetic 
testing only after the twiggs promised not to seek custody of 
kimberly if she proves to be their biological daughter they will 
retain the option to seek visitation rights 
i dont know why it took so long to get to this point mays 
said if mr and mrs twigg and i had sat down a year ago we 
could have accomplished the same thing 
regina twigg said her family was relieved and her seven other 
children were ecstatic that they might soon meet their missing 
sister 
for once and for all we will find out if she is or is not a 
twigg said john blakely the twiggs attorney 
mays who has long resisted testing for fear he would traumatize 
or even lose his daughter agreed for himself and his daughter to 
give blood samples within 10 days to be tested at either johns 
hopkins university in baltimore or the university of florida in 
gainesville mays first wife died in 1981 
under the agreement which still must be approved by a sarasota 
circuit judge the twiggs could seek visitation rights if they are 
determined to be the biological parents each party would select a 
psychologist to interview everyone involved and make a 
recommendation within two months about how much contact should be 
maintained 
the twiggs began their fight after learning through genetic 
tests that the girl they raised arlena was not biologically 
theirs arlena died of a heart defect in 1988 never knowing that 
questions had been raised about who her parents were 
the twiggs have sued hardee memorial hospital in us district 
court in tampa claiming employees at the wauchula hospital 
switched their child shortly after birth with another newborn the 
only other white girl born there about the same time was kimberly 
mays 
as early as february the twiggs said they would forgo custody 
of kimberly even if she turned out to be their real child if 
they could spend time with her 
mays has maintained since the twiggs first raised the question 
of kimberlys parentage that he would do what was in the best 
interest of his daughter short of giving her up to the twiggs

lebanese christian lawmakers agreed to 
a new powersharing arrangement with rival moslems and syria 
agreed to relocate some of its troops in beirut sources at a 
lebanese parliament conference said saturday 
the breakthroughs were disclosed one day before the final 
scheduled session of the fractured lebanese parliament in taif 
where moslem and christian lawmakers have been meeting in an effort 
to settle their 14yearold civil war 
the lawmakers would next meet in lebanon to formerly implement 
any plan reached sunday 
one source close to the talks speaking on condition of 
anonymity said differences of opinion surfaced in the 
christian camp during a meeting saturday afternoon 
conference sources said that before debate began on the thorny 
issue of the syrian military presence the christians accepted a 
proposal to expand the 99seat parliament by 29 members to allow 
moslems equal legislative powers 
that was one of the key points of political reform suggested in 
a fourchapter peace plan drafted by an arab league committee to 
settle the war 
sixtythree of parliaments 73 surviving members have been 
studying the draft peace accord since sept 30 
a second session of the christian legislators was set for 11 
pm and was expected to continue well into the night the sources 
said 
they said the christian deputies would confer by telephone with 
army commander gen michel aoun and militia chieftain samir geagea 
in beirut and with maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir at 
the vatican 
although the 33 christians and 30 moslems meeting in taif 
clashed on a number of issues in the original draft the problem 
that nearly collapsed the talks was the chapter on syrian troops 
the original draft suggested a gradual withdrawal from beirut 
into east lebanons bekaa valley in two years without committing 
damascus to a total evacuation from the country after that 
christians insisted on a fixed timetable for a quick withdrawal 
from all of lebanon and moslems argued that the syrian presence is 
their only guarantee for implementation of political reforms 
moslems who make up 55 percent of the 4 million population 
want an equal share of power with the christians who have 
dominated the government parliament army and judiciary since 
independence from france in 1943 
the compromise worked out by saudi foreign minister prince saud 
alfaisal during a twoday visit to damascus this week was not 
disclosed 
but sources said damascus agreed to it 
they said it fell short of the christians demand for a 
withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops from lebanon in less than three 
years 
they said syria agreed that its troops pull out of a 
6mileradius security zone around the parliament before the 
chamber meets in formal sessions to ratify political changes and 
elect a new president 
the syrians would be replaced by lebanese police backed by 
algerian and moroccan observers the sources said 
lebanon has been without a head of state since sept 22 1988 
when president amin gemayels term ended with parliament unable to 
meet to elect a successor 
whether syria accepted the christian demand that the syrian 
presence in the bekaa does not exceed one year remained unclear 
conference sources said syria refused a specific timetable for 
the bekaa withdrawal instead proposing it be worked out by a joint 
syrianlebanese military committee after political reforms are 
ratified a president is elected and a unified government is formed 
conference sources said there were minor changes in legalistic 
terms in the formulation of the draft that the christians sought 
the sources quoted faisal as telling the christian deputies that 
the concessions he got from damascus were the maximum syria was 
prepared to agree to 
the sources said that as a guarantee to the christians faisal 
suggested the 22member arab league which gave the 
saudimoroccanalgerian committee six months from may to find a 
settlement in lebanon extend this mandate to two years to oversee 
full implementation of the accord

millions of dollars worth of fruits and 
vegetables were destroyed in the northern california earthquake 
with much of it crushed in warehouse collapses or spoiled in 
frozenfood processing plants brought to a halt 
and agricultural workers many of them living in substandard 
houses knocked down by the quake have scattered or are too busy 
finding housing to return to the fields or help clean up officials 
said 
cans and drums filled with 400000 tons of the san francisco bay 
area summer tomato harvest came tumbling down in many of the 14 
corrugated steel wall warehouses of hollister an ammonia leak at 
the green giant frozen food plant in watsonville could result in 
20 million worth of losses in frozen brussels sprouts broccoli 
and other vegetables 
the loss will be in the millions said steve arnoldy 
director of operations for san benito foods which owns six of the 
hollister tomato warehouses some of our buildings we cant even 
get into its a miracle there was no one in the warehouses 
crops in the field were only slightly affected by irrigation 
pumps temporarily stopped because of electrical power outages in 
the earthquake on tuesday 
del mar foods in watsonville a mediumsized food processor 
resumed operation thursday when electrical power was restored said 
del mar president pj mecozzi 
cool weather kept unprocessed food from spoiling but a lack of 
returning workers has delayed cleanup of about 1 million worth of 
goods that fell from warehouse pallets during the quake 
weve had a hard time getting our crews back to work because 
they have been displaced from their homes mecozzi said

after years of resistance to change east 
germanys communist leadership conceded saturday there may be 
important lessons to be learned from reforms introduced by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
thousands of prodemocracy activists rallied in east berlin and 
plauen to keep up the pressure for change east berlins top two 
officials had a heated confrontation with a crowd that briefly 
surrounded them 
the official adn news agency said east germanys new communist 
party chief egon krenz spoke by telephone with gorbachev about 
his reforms which have given noncommunists seats in the soviet 
government and allowed more open discussion of the nations 
problems 
after years of contending gorbachevs reforms were unnecessary 
in east germany adn said krenz acknowledged there are important 
lessons to be learned from soviet perestroika in the german 
democratic republic perestroika refers to gorbachevs reforms 
gorbachev invited krenz to visit moscow and the trip will take 
place soon adn said without giving a date 
about 2000 east germans marched through central east berlin 
linked arminarm demanding democracy now and the release of 
political prisoners and jailed protesters 
lutheran church sources also reported that at least 30000 
demonstrated in the city of plauen chanting democracy and 
neues forum the german name of a new opposition group 
after the east berlin march east berlin communist party leader 
guenter schabowsky and mayor erhard krack were surrounded by more 
than 100 marchers demanding to know if the government is serious 
about reform witnesses said 
it was not immediately clear how schabowsky and krack came to be 
on the streets with the demonstrators 
after 40 years now you come to us and want to talk 
exclaimed one citizen what are you really going to do to change 
things 
a young east berliner declared when you trust us enough to 
let us buy a ticket to munich or rome then youll start being 
taken seriously 
travel restrictions are among the most frequently aired 
complaints about east germany 
on the main evening newscast aktuelle kamera schabowsky was 
shown telling citizens we are going to have to live with the 
fact that for a long time people are going to think that what we 
are doing is a trap but it is not 
the encounter involving schabowsky and krack was likely intended 
to gauge public sentiment on the hesistant moves toward change 
taken since wednesday when krenz was named party leader 
in another unusually frank report by the government news agency 
adn said at least 20000 east germans staged a proreform 
candlelight vigil in the city of dresden late friday it also 
reported that the deputy police chief in east erlin promised to 
investigate allegations of police brutality during prodemocracy 
demonstrations earlier this month 
the police official dieter dietze was quoted as saying 60 
complaints filed in connection with those marches would be 
thoroughly investigated 
police used force to break up prodemocracy protests that swept 
the nation before and during its oct 7 celebration of 40 years of 
statehood larger demonstrations since then have been allowed to 
take place peacefully 
krenz replaced erich honecker as communist party leader when the 
77yearold honecker stepped down after 18 years in power 
honecker cited health reaons but widespread dissatisfaction 
with his authoritarian government which has led about 55000 east 
germans to flee west in recent weeks had increased pressure for a 
change 
the krenz leadership responded to public calls for more 
democracy with a promised dialogue on ways to improve east german 
living standards but krenz made clear in a speech the night of his 
appointment that communists have no plan to share power with 
fledgling opposition groups or embrace reforms as broad as those 
under way in poland and hungary 
since krenz took over the staterun media have embarked on 
unprecedented discourses advocating change 
the gate to dialogue over reforms in our nation has been flung 
open the communist party newspaper berliner zeitung reported 
saturday 
we have to be very clear about which concrete form of 
democracy we want it said 
another communist party newspaper neues deutschland devoted a 
lengthy commentary to the nations problems focusing on krenzs 
proposal to draft a new law making it easier for east germans to 
travel outside the country 
we dont want to leave our german democratic republic the 
newspaper wrote we want to help change things for the better 
but we would like every now and then to see vienna or paris or 
munich or stockholm and come home with new and interesting 
impressions 
western diplomatic sources in east berlin said they were 
expecting another meeting of the policysetting party central 
committee later this week to consider some reform proposals and 
replacements for party officials fired last week in the shakeup 
that ousted honecker

a man infected with the aids virus was 
convicted of attempted murder for biting a police officer and 
sentenced to 10 years in prison 
gregory scott scroggins 27 of smyrna was found guilty late 
friday night after three hours of deliberations by a cobb county 
superior court jury 
judge watson white sentenced him to 10 years in prison which 
defense attorney greg schroeder said was tantamount to a death 
sentence 
scroggins bit cobb county police officer david crook as the 
officer was investigating a dispute between scroggins and his 
roommate paul murray on jan 29 
scroggins testified that he did bite the officer but i would 
never intentionally inflict this terrible disease on anyone he 
said he bit because the officer had him in a choke hold and he 
could not breathe 
schroeder said he would appeal scroggins conviction this 
decision sends the message that anyone testing hiv aids virus 
positive and involved in a crime can expect to be charged with 
murder he said 
scroggins tested positive for the aids virus last december 
according to trial testimony the police officer said he has tested 
negative for the virus in two aids tests 
emory university medical school professor david rimland said 
there have been no confirmed cases of the virus being transmitted 
through saliva although the possibility exists at least in 
theory 
murray was convicted of obstructing a police officer as were 
scroggins parents philip and angie scroggins they were accused 
of assaulting crook while he tried to arrest their son and were 
sentenced to a years probation and a 250 fine 
officials said it was the first case of its kind in georgia 
they say theres no documented cases crook said but i 
would hate to be the first 
prosecutors in fort lauderdale fla in 1986 charged an 
aidsinfected man with attempted murder for biting a jail guard 
but the jury in that case acquitted the man 
in alabama a state appeals court overturned a firstdegree 
assault conviction this summer of an aidsinfected inmate who bit a 
prison guard but said there was enough evidence to support a 
lesser assault charge 
in st louis an inmate who bit two guards after testing 
positive for exposure to the aids virus was properly convicted of 
assault with a deadly weapon because human bites are inherently 
dangerous a federal appeals court ruled in may

i had just got home to watch the pregame and the world series 
im lying there on the bed all comfortable and i have my munchies 
and everything all set for the game and suddenly it started 
shaking which im used to theyre sort of like an adventure 
usually but this was a real adventure 
usually it will shake a little bit and then it stops but this 
one just kept getting bigger and bigger and the wall across the 
room is coming toward me away from me toward me away from me 
rocking back and forth 
and when the first plaster came down i just thought im 
getting under the bed but it was rocking so hard i couldnt even 
get off the bed and then the ceiling came down 
the first heavy thing that came down was from the guy who 
lived above me his dresser came right through the ceiling and 
landed on my cat when i saw that i thought well this is 
it 
i just barely had time to look up and the whole ceiling came 
down the whole thing came down in one piece if i had been on 
the floor a solid surface i dont think i would have made it but 
i was on the soft bed so i sort of sank onto the bed i was 
kind of crushed i injured my back 
after about an hour i broke through the plaster that was 
against my face to give me some maneuvering room and i pushed 
down on the mattress and once i got down to the side of the bed i 
had a crawl space 
i didnt realize i was a whole floor lower than where i started 
the building had just pancaked

shaking got real intense and at that point i thought the building 
was going to come down 
we went outside and the whole top of our building had shifted 
like the whole sixth floor had shifted to the right we went 
back in our building a little later that night but then the fire 
department said the whole building was going to collapse it was 
unsafe to be in and they evacuated us into a bus and brought us 
here a shelter at the moscone center 
thats what happened 
naturally like anyone else i was hoping id survive i was 
kind of freaked out whether or not as i was going to live through 
it or not because it really seemed at that time the building was 
going to come down it was that intense 
it was wavy rumbling a lot of rattling shaking like a bomb 
exploded underground in slow motion

i was watching the television at home the station that 
didnt have verbal communication with their helicopter 
the commentators were trying to guess what they were seeing from 
the air working here and knowing the area i knew that was the 
cypress structure that had come down and i knew that my wife had 
just got off work at 5 oclock i waited for 2 hours in front of 
the tv 
they were in a van pool when it hit they were heading to get on 
the structure to go up the corridor to head to the north bay where 
i live she was about two blocks away in traffic when the quake 
hit 
after the quake stopped they knew they had been in an earthquake 
and they tried to head as fast as possible to get on the structure 
and when they made the turn they saw that it had collapsed 
they veered back into oakland through berkeley and onto i80 
that way and went straight home she said they were pretty 
devastated because they travel that corridor every day and they 
know that the cars were jammed up there

the scene most vivid in my mind is when we were walking up the 
stairs at night to take some women to the ferry and we saw these 
waves of people walking down market street 
they were in the middle of the street on islands on sidewalks 
everybody calm nobody panicking all talking people who had never 
met before 
you could smell smoke in the air hear sirens from the police 
cars ambulances and fire trucks it was like a scene out of a 
horror movie or a war film we were at ground zero

safaris caribbean soirees and circus gymnasts were 
just a few of the themes at saturdays shows of 1990 summer 
fashions curvy and feminine clothes emphasized the bust in 
virtually all designs from claude montana to jeanlouis scherrer 
montana who has just been chosen to design couture for the 
house of lanvin seemed to be skimping on his ideas for his own 
house perhaps saving up for january when hell show for lanvin he 
concentrated on rigorously honeddown curvaceous clothes much 
softer than many of his past styles 
there was hardly a skirt in sight 
montana put very few accessories on the figurehugging corsair 
body suits and belted drawstringtied jackets with shorts in 
spicy shades of cinnamon clove curry saffron and dill green 
some of the safari jackets with saddlebag pockets had daring 
vshaped decolletes 
memorable for color and shape were the tomato linen shortie 
coats split into several panels with pushedup puffy sleeves worn 
over shorts or long pants 
another terrific look is in montanas version of the 
opaquetransparent theme popular all over town he paired long and 
sober raw silk or linen jackets with flowing pleated sheer 
georgette crepe pants 
his most revealing styles were centered on seethrough silk and 
viscose cobweb tops another favorite paris theme done daringly 
here paired with clinging silk stretch tights 
also in the secondskin vein were the clinging outfits with 
matching string or rope decor strung like strands of pearls across 
a shoulder at the hip or on bare backs the sober shades of brown 
rust khaki and putty merely emphasizing the curvy figure 
underneath 
this was perfect in a sheath topped with a transparent wide 
organza jacket showing the designers sheer perfection of line 
although its not for timid souls with figure problems 
for scherrer there were no endangered species as he brought 
out every kind of animal print leopards tigers zebras often 
best worn by his favorite model his blond daughter laetitia 
the big cat prints pounced onstage in bermudas and billowing 
tops in gracefully wrapped and draped dresses and bathing suits 
cut out to show lots of skin and even decorated lapels of tailored 
suits 
he too went for a transparentsolid look combining sheer 
animalprint blouses and pants with solid linen safari jackets 
wildanimal prints are already all over the streets here but it 
still looked great at scherrer 
his more sober daytime ideas included soft paisley prints in 
suits sharp navy coat dresses with striking white lapels decollete 
to the waist and a range of lovely softly checked and glen plaid 
pastel suits in silk and cool wools 
scherrer also laid on a caribbean soiree it was a blazing color 
show with casual draped sarongs knotted shirts and shorts or 
croppedpants outfits in multicolored batik flower patterns 
his gorgeous evening clothes were delicately edged in arum 
lilies magnolias and garlands of sequined embroidery by master 
embroiderer francois lesage coming out in satin sheaths silk 
pajamas or ball gowns with full organza skirts the women had tank 
tops or bustiers always underlining the female curves 
issey miyakes show was full of stretchy gymnasts suits and 
corsair pants spotlighting the sportier side of summer fashion 
his yellow royal blue or redandwhite striped or 
harlequinpatterned stretch cotton pant suits with their boxy 
jackets would make a jaunty entry to the beach scene the 
turtleshaped or chromehooped handbags added wonderful touches of 
wit to this fun show of bouncy clothes 
yellow black and white or turquoise tailcoats paired with 
bicolored corsairs or cropped wider pants were another theme 
an artist with silhouettes as well as fabrics miyake also 
showed some great new shirt shapes over shortshorts the tops 
centered on triangular elbows in dolman sleeves in striped cotton 
or in pleated stiffened fabrics miyake often favors 
dressier and more feminine clothes were shown by michel goma at 
balenciaga in a show that was not only full of peppy stuff but 
sometimes had touches of the inimitable balenciaga in couture 
shapes and luxurious silk fabrics 
the champagne lace and silk tunics and lean short skirts looked 
just as easy to wear as the brightly colored crepe de chine 
flowered dresses with long linen jackets 
some lovely white piques with caramel organza touches looked 
great when cut out at the back as did the multicolored flowered 
organza dance dresses or the pastel crepe georgette pleated 
charleston dresses edged in lace at the hems 
the billowy organza evening dresses were perfect for debutantes 
and other younghearted party girls 
most remarkable was the royal blue bustier dress with a huge bow 
at the top a big bellshaped flounced skirt shorter in front to 
reveal buttoned organza leggings underneath it was worthy of 
balenciaga

several hundred people sang dixie on 
saturday at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the death 
of confederate president jefferson davis 
more than 150 people in civil war uniforms and period clothing 
plus a similar number of spectators in modern clothing watched a 
reenactment of davis being sworn in as president in 1861 atop the 
capitol steps in montgomery richard couch portraying davis stood 
on a bronze star that marks the spot where a country was divided 
some spectators carried rebel flags and most joined in singing 
dixie during the program which included historical lectures 
and displays and a rifle and cannon salute by civil war reenactors 
from throughout alabama 
norman dasinger state commander of the sons of confederate 
veterans said davis death a century ago was important to mark 
because there was so much misunderstanding about the civil war 
davis was 81 when he died in louisiana 
the ignorance is so pervasive about the war being over 
slavery out of the 50000 alabamians who died in the war 90 
percent owned no one said dasinger a professor of education 
administration at jacksonville state university 
the majority of the people here today believe jefferson davis 
was right and i do too dasinger said that does not mean we 
want to have a slave nation we believe in individual rights and 
freedoms and states rights 
david toifel a history teacher at hillsdale middle school in 
mobile who had the idea for the ceremony said that one reason 
southerners loved davis so much after the war was that he never 
admitted what he did was wrong 
one of the programs at the state archives included a film of a 
reenactment in 1914 of davis swearingin by real confederate 
veterans in that ceremony they raised the first flag of the 
confederacy atop the capitol the kind of flag that actually flew 
over the building when it was the capitol of the confederacy 
rather than the confederate battle flag that flies there now 
the confederate battle flag has been the focus of protests 
including one on feb 2 1988 that resulted in the arrest of 14 
black state legislators who made a symbolic attempt to rip it down 
black leaders contend the flag has become a symbol of racism 
through its use by the ku klux klan 
saturdays ceremony attracted no protests 
the ceremony did bring two sons of confederate veterans 
80yearold eddie jordan of selma and 83yearold willard fred 
kennedy of gadsden 
my daddy never owned a slave he fought 3 years in the war as 
a volunteer he was fighting for principle jordan said when 
the union told him youve got to get rid of slaves he didnt like 
it it was the principle most people dont like to be told what to 
do

federal relief officials under criticism 
for responding sluggishly after hurricane hugo said saturday that 
disasteraid centers will open sunday in seven earthquakeravaged 
counties 
the federal emergency management agency has processed about 
4000 applications over a 24hour hotline since thursday a day 
after president bush issued a disaster declaration for parts of 
northern california 
but those who lost their homes in one of the nations costliest 
natural disasters should expect to wait seven to 10 days for a 
check to pay for temporary housing once their applications are 
processed and verified 
there is no magic wand said fema spokesman phil cogan 
people have to understand that fema does not have people standing 
by waiting for disasters to happen it takes us a little time to 
get rolling and do it right 
until federal money is approved those displaced can seek 
emergency shelter with the red cross or pay for a hotel and seek 
reimbursement from the government fema said 
at least one center will be open by 1 pm sunday in san 
francisco and the counties of alameda monterrey san benito santa 
clara santa cruz and san mateo according to robert broussard a 
fema official 
at a news briefing broussard said fema wanted to make sure its 
disaster centers were in structurally sound buildings 
local officials pleaded for quick government help and president 
bush pledged no red tape when he toured the area friday 
we need fast action we need checks written on the spot 
said san francisco mayor art agnos 
after hurricane hugo slammed south carolina on sept 21 it took 
fema seven days to open its first disaster center us sen fritz 
hollings dsc called fema officials a bunch of bureaucratic 
jackasses for the slowness of their response 
areas in the virgin islands puerto rico and north and south 
carolina are still under disaster declarations because of hurricane 
hugo 
in addition to money for temporary housing the government can 
provide low interest loans cash grants of up to 10400 for 
individuals jobless pay for those not covered by unemployment 
insurance and advice on how to claim losses on their federal tax 
returns

the widow of swedish prime minister 
olof palme said saturday that police and the press sabotaged 
the inquiry into her husbands murder and the subsequent trial 
lisbeth palme was the chief witness against a local career 
criminal christer pettersson whose july conviction in the slaying 
was thrown out earlier this month by an appeals court which cited 
insufficient evidence 
mrs palme made her first direct public comment on swedens 
trial of the century in a 30minute tv interview she accused 
the swedish tabloids and other media of interfering in the inquiry 
buying information from sources including police and hounding her 
mrs palme also lambasted the police she said she knew of 
officers who accepted money for leaks but she did not identify 
them 
mrs palme herself has been criticized by the press for 
hindering the investigation into her husbands death by setting 
preconditions for her participation in police lineups and court 
testimony 
her demand that any recording of her testimony be banned was 
granted in court 
in saturdays tv interview mrs palme said she stuck to her 
testimony that 43year old christer pettersson was her husbands 
murderer 
palme was killed feb 28 1986 while he walked with his wife on 
a stockholm street 
mrs palme testified she saw pettersson when she looked up from 
her dying husband and was 100 percent certain he was the gunman 
legal experts said that unequivocal statement would prohibit her 
from testifying against anyone else accused of the crime

the cost of attending some of the nations 
most prestigious colleges is virtually the same according to a 
survey prompting the government to investigate whether the 
tuitions are fixed 
in the 198990 school year four schools generally considered 
among the best ranged by less than 250 total tuition room and 
board costs 19164 at stanford 19207 at princeton 19310 at 
yale and 19395 at harvard according to their catalogs 
under investigation by the us justice department are at least 
55 schools according to a survey by the chronicle of higher 
education a trade publication the probe apparently does not 
include public colleges and universities 
investigators are looking at the extent in which administrators 
compare financial information with other schools before setting 
tuition levels 
school officials deny any wrongdoing and experts in antitrust 
law say the government would have a difficult time establishing a 
strong case against the schools 
but the probe has focused a spotlight on colleges tuition 
practices and has put extra pressure on administrators to justify a 
decade of tuition increases that have outpaced inflation 
regardless of whether actual wrongdoing is found the 
investigation can only benefit students and families whose ability 
to pay often does not match the demands of greedy colleges said 
an editorial in the south bend ind tribune 
investigators would need to look no further than the colleges 
own catalogs under the listing for tuition room and board for 
evidence of a rigged education market critics said 
the university of southern california at 17610 in total 
costs falls behind stanford and the top ivy league schools but 
compares in price closely with many other california private 
schools with costs of 17877 at occidental 17050 at the 
university of pacific and 17530 at claremont mckenna college 
school administrators say they find nothing surprising in the 
similarity in costs and they say there is a strong motivation to 
keep tuitions in line with schools with which they compete for 
students 
administrators also say that the relatively public nature of the 
budget process including open meetings with school boards and 
faculty makes exchange of financial information inevitable 
but the justice department suspects that the exchange of 
information is more formal and less public than administrators 
admit legal scholars say the department is also studying whether 
top universities share information on how much scholarship aid they 
offer individual students 
former usc administrator taylor w meloan said that before final 
tuition decisions are made school officials commonly talk to 
administrators at other schools to see what tuitions are being 
considered 
you call around and say what is your tuition going to be 
this coming year what is going to be your increase said 
meloan now a usc marketing professor schools dont want to be 
too far out of line you dont want to be higher than prestigious 
universities so you may lag just a little bit behind 
usc officials deny trading information in the manner described 
by meloan and noted that he has not been an administrator for 
about 10 years 
we dont do it that way now and we didnt do it that way 
then said university spokeswoman martha harris maybe he was 
the only one doing it 
officials at other schools also deny such practices but 
acknowledge that it is virtually impossible to keep many tuition 
matters private 
administrators at stanford for instance meet in open session 
with the academic senate in december to discuss among other 
things the possible tuition increase for the upcoming term 
long before the universitys board of trustees approves the 
final tuition in february or march administrators at other 
colleges have an accurate picture of where stanford is headed in 
tuition and other costs 
stanford in turn also gets information from other schools 
through open forums said tim warner stanfords director of 
budgets 
we dont ask other universities for information he said 
even if the justice department finds evidence of information 
exchange it still faces problems establishing a strong antitrust 
case said lawrence a sullivan law professor at uc berkeleys 
boalt hall law school 
the primarily problem is convincing a court that the few 
prestigious schools that allegedly exchange information make up an 
education market of their own regardless of the thousands of other 
schools in the country that charge different amounts said sullivan 
the government would be hardpressed to prove that a more 
broadly defined education market could be affected by the actions 
of a few schools he said 
quite frankly my own top of the head reaction is that if all 
they have is an information exchange they havent got one hell of 
an antitrust case sullivan said

the premier of uzbekistan who has been struggling 
with growing ethnic nationalism and unrest was replaced by a 
younger communist party official tass reported saturday 
uzbekistans parliament also passed a compromise language law 
that failed to satisfy uzbek nationalists who have taken to the 
streets several times in the past week to protest hundreds of 
people were reported arrested 
the parliament removed premier gairat kadyrov at a twoday 
session that ended saturday and replaced him with 48yearold 
mirakhmat mirkasymov a longtime uzbek party official tass said 
kadyrov 61 had been premier of the central asian republic 
since 1984 tass said he would be transferred to a new post but did 
not elaborate 
kadyrov had struggled in recent months swelling uzbek 
nationalism which led to formation of a grassroots political 
movement and ethnic unrest that killed 100 people in the fergana 
valley 
the new language law fueled further unrest tass said the law 
would make uzbek the official langauge of the republic correcting 
the historical injustice dictator josef stalin committed in the 
1930s by forcing russian on the population 
at the same time tass said russian and other languages common 
in uzbekistan such as tajik could still be used by all groups for 
interethnic communications 
a spokesman for the uzbek writers union said militia units 
continued to patrol the republics capital of tashkent on saturday 
to prevent further demonstrations by the new grassroots movement 
known as berlik or unity 
all the streets and squares are blocked by the police said 
the spokesman who commented on condition of anonymity there is 
no traffic but people keep gathering in groups with slogans 
addressing their demands 
a similar law passed in the republic of moldavia last summer 
raised protests by ethnic moldavians and prolonged strikes by 
russian speakers 
in the baltic and caucasus regions as well as other areas of the 
country popular movements have openly held meetings and protests 
and won the support of many top government officials 
but in tashkent hundreds of people have been arrested since 
thursday during berliksponsored protests including the movements 
leader abdurakhim pulatov group sources said 
residents said they did not know if mirkasymov had played a role 
in the efforts to suppress the movement 
he has held senior communist party jobs in the republic for the 
past 16 years tass said 
kadyrov was reprimanded at a regional party congress in 1986 for 
failing to ease the chronic unemployment in the republic of 20 
million people such criticism has persisted 
last year pravda the communist party newspaper ridiculed 
kadyrov for his handling of a land and water dispute the affair 
climaxed when an angry crowd cornered kadyrov who had to radio 
guards for help 
in the fergana valley in june uzbek nationalists clashed with 
minority meskhetian turks activists attributed much of the 
violence to pentup anger over economic conditions in the poor 
cottongrowing republic 
also saturday tass said the uzbek parliament passed a law 
banning ethnic restrictions on the right to vote 
a recent law championed by estonion nationalists in their baltic 
republic set residency requirements for voting and touched off 
strikes by russians and other ethnic groups

workers used concrete saws and blowtorches 
saturday to cut through a collapsed section of the san 
franciscooakland bay bridge operating under a tight deadline to 
reopen a major link knocked out by tuesdays earthquake 
the california department of transportation had hoped to remove 
the collapsed section of roadway on saturday but that was likely 
delayed until monday by the decision to saw the 250ton piece in 
half said greg bayol of the transportation department 
the transportation department has set a fourweek deadline and a 
1 million pricetag for reopening the 85mile bridge which 
carries 270000 cars each day but some officials have said the 
repairs could take two months 
bayol said officials decided overnight saturday to avoid 
unnecessarily adding stress to the tower supporting the roadway 
piece which is 50 feet long 60 feet wide and holds five lanes of 
traffic 
they were afraid if they lifted 250 tons the shifting of 
weight would be more of a problem than if they cut it he said 
it would be more safe for everyone concerned if they cut the slab 
into two sections and lifted it out one at a time 
the pieces will be lowered by a 190foot bargebased crane onto 
a waiting barge the section is to be repaired and reassembled at 
nearby alameda bayol said 
the cutting should not delay the reopening because other repair 
work can continue during the weekend he said 
a section of the upper span of the bridge shook loose during 
tuesdays earthquake and crashed down on the lower roadway 
destroying several vehicles and killing a 23yearold berkeley 
woman whose car sped over the edge moments after the gap opened 
television pictures of the pitched upper section provided the first 
graphic indication of the strength of the quake 
workers are using diamondtipped saws to cut an 18inchwide 
strip through the concrete roadway and blowtorches to cut through 
the steel frame said jim drago of the transportation department 
repair and reopening of the bridge is being closely watched in 
the bay area because the span is vital to commuters for now 
residents will have to rely on jampacked bay area rapid transit 
systems and a makeshift fleet of donated ferry boats 
officials are still unclear why only the one section of the 
bridge failed bayol said 
theories center on the notion that the collapsed section was at 
the point where the different construction techniques used to build 
the 1930sera bridge are joined bayol said jutting west out of 
oakland the bridge is supported underneath only by towers while 
the central cantilevered section is held up by steel girders from 
above as well as towers 
this one section is unique to the whole bridge bayol said 
it was more rigid maybe it didnt move as much 
jim roberts chief of structures for the state transportation 
department said the damaged section appears to be in good shape 
if it can be salvaged it will be put back in place as soon as 
possible he said 
the bottom section of the twotiered bridge suffered three 
puncture holes opening portions of the roadway to the water below 
bayol said transportation department officials have given 
conflicting accounts of whether that section can be repaired or 
whether it will have to be replaced

president bush on saturday signed a 9 million 
aid package designed to help the political opposition running 
against nicaraguas ruling sandinista government in next years 
election 
the money to be spent for general political activity such as 
registering voters and getting them to the polls is to start 
flowing into the central american country in the next 10 days to be 
used during the voter registration period that concludes at the end 
of october 
the stated purpose of the aid package which congress sent to 
bush on friday is to level the playing field for the underfinanced 
opposition the money is to go to registering nicaraguans 
including thousands who have left their homeland and paying for 
poll monitoring vote counting and other electionrelated 
activities 
however because of nicaraguan regulation of foreign 
contributions some of the money as much as 2 million probably 
will end up with the sandinistacontrolled national election 
council 
critics allege the package is merely an attempt by the united 
states to buy out the sandinistas through political influence after 
years of failure to oust them by militarily backing the contra 
rebels 
but white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement that the step reflects administration hopes that through 
fair elections nicaragua will join other countries that have made 
the transition from repression to freedom 
the aid which passed congress easily represents another step 
forward in our efforts to promote democracy in countries that have 
been deprived of political and economic freedom fitzwaters 
statement said around the world the tide of democracy is 
advancing as more and more authoritarian and totalitarian regimes 
realize that human progress is inseparable from the principles of 
liberty 
bushs action comes just before his twoday trip to costa rica 
for a hemispheric democracy celebration where nicaraguas president 
daniel ortega also will attend along with many heads of state from 
the western hemisphere 
they are to participate on friday and saturday in a centennial 
celebration of costa rican democracy hosted by that nations 
president oscar arias 
bush earlier acknowledged in a letter to lawmakers that because 
of the nicaraguan election laws as much as 2 million of the 
package would have to go to the sandinistacontrolled supreme 
electoral council but he said that situation should not be used 
as a transparent attempt to prevent the united states from helping 
its democratic friends 
under nicaraguan rules on foreign money donated to the electoral 
process 50 percent of the money spent in certain categories must 
go the supreme electoral council the council oversees and 
regulates the election process 
most of the us aid is to go through the national endowment for 
democracy a quasigovernmental agency that promotes democratic 
elections around the world to pay for ostensibly nonpartisan 
activities like voter registration election monitoring and party 
building 
part of the money also will go to independent groups that will 
monitor the feb 25 elections including one headed by former 
president carter 
the legislation was vague on how the money will be used but 
congressional observers said it appeared that up to 6 million 
could go directly to the national opposition union a coalition 
group that is backing the presidential candidacy of opposition 
newspaper publisher violeta chamorro 
however money is not to go directly into her campaign coffers 
or be used for advertising to promote her candidacy backers say 
the national endowments charter forbids such partisan campaign 
activity but administration officials believe that spending money 
on the democratic process will ultimately benefit mrs chamorro 
who is at a heavy financial disadvantage to the pervasive 
sandinista party 
bush in his letter lobbying congress to pass the package said 
mrs chamorros party needs our assistance desperately 
with the funds provided for in this legislation the national 
endowment for democracy and other organizations will work to 
strengthen democratic institutions in nicaragua so that truly free 
and fair elections may be held fitzwater said saturday 
the 9 million is money reprogrammed from the state departments 
agency for international development 
an administration official said 5 million will go to ned to be 
dispensed to mrs chamorros group while the other 4 million will 
go to election monitoring groups and to the supreme electoral 
council to match money for unos activities that fall under the 50 
percent rule

a navstar navigation satellite 
rocketed into orbit saturday to join a network of spacecraft that 
guide bombers warships missiles and ground troops with pinpoint 
accuracy 
an air force delta 2 rocket propelled the 65 million satellite 
into an orbit ranging out to 11000 miles high following a fiery 
liftoff that brilliantly illuminated the predawn sky 
the satellite has been picked up we sent commands and its 
responding as expected said air force col marty runkle the 
mission director it appeared to be a normal mission he said 
information on rocket performance was delayed nearly an hour 
because a tracking station on ascension island in the south 
atlantic also was supporting the space shuttle atlantis at the 
time trackers there recorded the rocket data and later played it 
back to the launch control center here 
the navstar is the fourth in a new series of spacecraft that 
enable us and allied military units such as planes ships 
submarines tanks and field troops to precisely determine their 
positions to within 50 feet in any type of weather anywhere in the 
world 
they tune in on the networks radio signals using receivers as 
small as a handheld telephone 
the satellites also keep track of the speed of military units 
within a fraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within a 
millionth of a second

a canister used to move space 
shuttle payloads was damaged saturday when a crane apparently 
failed and dropped a 20ton concrete weight on it nasa reported 
the weight struck the top of the 65foottall carrier striking 
a door a glancing blow as it fell to the floor of the canister a 
statement said 
the concrete weight being lifted out of the canister was just 
about clear of the canisters doors when an apparent crane failure 
caused the weight to fall it said 
the concrete was being used to simulate a payload for a test 
the canister is the size of a shuttle cargo bay 
the statement said there were no injuries and an inspection was 
being made to determine the extent of the damage an investigation 
of the accident was begun 
the container is one of two available at the kennedy space 
center for transporting satellites and other shuttle payloads from 
a processing building to the launch pad nasa said the accident 
would have no impact on launch schedules 
the damaged canister was recently used to check out launch pad 
39a which has undergone renovation and is to be used for a shuttle 
liftoff in december for the first time in nearly four years 
the canister and its enclosed piece of concrete had recently 
been moved from the pad to an assembly building where the accident 
took place

it was too hard to believe 
a 57yearold longshoreman wedged behind the wheel 90 hours and 
23 minutes and given up for dead was plucked from the ruins of a 
collapsed roadway after he was found alive saturday by a worker 
doing a stress check in the rubble 
the trapped man was still buckled into his seatbelt 
rescue workers drained by almost four grisly days of peeling 
bodies and vehicles from the wreckage burst into a throaty cheer 
when they saw the face of burly buck helm who was wearing a red 
jogging suit 
they cheered again when helm was placed into an ambulance and 
whisked to highland hospital five miles away 
its amazing he was extricated alive it is phenomenal said 
dr monica rosenthal 
the miracle of interstate 880 was as startling as finding a 
miner trapped for four days in a cavein 
weary workers had actually suspended their grim labors friday 
night because officials feared the collapsed doubledecked highway 
was too unsafe they were already talking about tearing the 
remaining sections down 
helms silver chevrolet sprint was in the flattest and most 
unstable section of the 1mile stretch of highway that slammed 
down like a concrete sandwich in tuesdays earthquake trapping 
bodies and vehicles in the middle 
but incredibly it was shielded by a 3foothigh ripple in the 
shattered concrete 
a california transportation department worker walking the 
roadway in the dim morning light was the first to spot helm 
stress tests were being done so workers could proceed with their 
search when at 6 am something moved 
he couldnt believe was he was seeing so he brought some 
others who also detected movement said bob jacobs deputy 
director of caltrans 
helm parched and weakened by days without food and water 
nodded his head to signal he was alive 
one of the guys came running down yelling theres somebody 
alive up there said alfred anderson 63 of oliver construction 
co wed been working here all along and we didnt realize he was 
right there it is a thrill to know somebodys going to survive 
from this horrible thing 
heavy rain fell briefly as rejuvenated crews scrambled to free 
the miracle survivor 
before crews could attempt to rescue helm they had to reinforce 
the area with a 60footlong steel girder stacked on top of beams 
the size of telephone poles then rescuers with jackhammers and 
concrete saws raced into action 
working from the side they gouged a hole 2 feet high and 4 
feet wide through 15 feet of stubborn concrete rescuers burrowed 
in from the passenger side and opened the car with the jaws of 
life they cut off his seat belt and freed him from the drivers 
side 
he was brought out feet first at 1127 am and lowered to the 
ground on a gurney suspended from a crane 
helm lapsed in and out of consciousness according to paramedic 
diana moore 25 the first person to reach him she put him on 
oxygen but couldnt give him an intravenous injection because the 
space was too cramped 
he was very anxious to get out said ms moore he was 
mainly moaning the only thing that he was that was understandable 
was when am i going to get out of here

on veterans day more than 20 years after 
enemy mortar blew away most of his body below the waist freddie 
paul heugel rejoins his comrades who sacrificed their lives in 
vietnam 
the name of heugel who died in 1984 of complications from his 
war wounds has been inscribed on the vietnam veterans memorial in 
washington it will be dedicated at a nov 11 ceremony with the 
names of 19 other servicemen recently added to the black granite 
wall which carries the names of more than 58000 americans 
his mother maggie heugel of taylor mich will be there 
he would be very proud mrs heugel said in a telephone 
interview from her home a softspoken woman who works the 
allnight shift making salads for airline dinners she still finds 
it hard to discuss her son without crying 
truman a strong might not be able to attend the ceremony but 
the event will be special nonetheless for the livonia mich 
dentist strong launched the campaign to have heugels name 
inscribed on the memorial and enlisted the help of rep william 
ford dmich who interceded with the pentagon 
he was the nicest kid ive ever seen very easygoing 
strong said he deserves to be on that memorial as much as 
anybody 
heugels story begins in 1968 when he was 19 and working at a 
dearborn heights mich service station when the draft notice came 
by feb 23 1969 the day his life changed forever he was 
cpl heugel assistant gunner on a 105mm howitzer 
as he manned his weapon in a bunker two miles from the ho chi 
minh trail a mortar shell exploded nearby wounding a buddy 
heugel ran to summon a medic 
then i got it too heugel said in a 1974 interview with the 
detroit news i remember getting hit and smelling the gunpowder 
and then falling over backward then there was a medic leaning over 
me saying oh my god oh my god 
he was evacuated to japan where doctors rated his survival 
chances as practically nil telegrams were sent to michigan urging 
his family to hurry to his bedside 
one physician however suggested a risky operation that would 
involve further amputations and removal of 80 percent of heugels 
spine it would mean he would never even sit up again but he might 
live 
heugel resisted 
fords office helped mrs heugel catch a flight to tokyo where 
she persuaded her son to undergo the surgery he spent four years 
convalescing in hospitals repeatedly confounding predictions that 
he would die within months 
with sheer grit and help from friends he managed to lead a 
productive life despite being permanently confined to a prone 
position on a hospital gurney 
heugel taught himself to drive a specially equipped van 
controlling the brakes gears and accelerator with a single lever 
he and his mother drove to the 1982 worlds fair in knoxville 
tenn and to disney world in orlando fla a veterans of foreign 
wars post raised money for an elevator and recreation room in 
heugels home he read played pool and poker and took up 
photography 
we had a great time together mrs heugel said everybody 
that knew him loved him he cheered up people who came to see him 
he also became a volunteer in fords congressional campaigns 
driving workers around the district and making telephone calls 
i have an annual family birthday picnic and hed come ford 
said people would marvel at how hed drive up in his van wheel 
himself out on his gurney his courage was remarkable i never 
heard a bitter word out of him that he had gotten a raw deal that 
anybody owed him anything 
but life was difficult heugel required heavy doses of 
painkillers and he was constantly returning to the local veterans 
hospital for dialysis and other treatment he developed cirrhosis 
of the liver from a blood transfusion and toward the end his heart 
deteriorated 
no one disputed heugels fitness for a spot on the vietnam 
memorial when his name was submitted in 1987 but because of the 
strict qualification standards and red tape it took a year to win 
the pentagons approval 
for mrs heugel the passage of time has made it no easier to 
understand the war and her sons fate i dont even watch the war 
movies on tv i cant she said i dont know why it had to 
happen before my son went to vietnam he never said nothing 
like i dont want to go but he just said mom why do we have to 
go and fight people we dont even know 
heugel died may 12 1984 at age 35

earthquake experts contended saturday 
the states rush to strengthen elevated roadways like the oakland 
stretch that crushed scores of motorists smacks more of politics 
than muchneeded safety planning 
the sudden activity demonstrates again that state government 
often reacts to the most visible results of the last quake while 
ignoring warnings of what is likely to happen in future temblors 
some state experts said 
there are too few people in power political visionaries 
who have a strong will to lead us to better prepare for future 
quakes said richard eisner who heads the statefunded bay area 
earthquake preparedness project 
of course we have to look back but we must begin to look 
forward too and devote more resources to preparing for 
earthquakes he said 
but other observers asserted californians would never pay the 
billions of dollars needed to prepare for all quake scenarios 
given resources limited by taxcutting proposition 13 as well as 
pressing needs elsewhere the most sensible alternative is to act 
on lessons learned in past quakes 
youre always short of money for those freeways and other 
things said former gov pat brown earthquakes are so seldom 
you know and you probably think things should be done but theyre 
a low priority 
he said it was unfair to fault government for simply fixing 
problems revealed in past quakes given lack of money to do more 
we learn more every time theres an earthquake and we act on 
it thats what we should be doing added caltrans chief engineer 
bill schaefer 
but ed hensley a top official with the state seismic safety 
commission said the swift move to speed improvements of oaklands 
interstate 880 only after it claimed so many lives appears to be a 
political reaction 
the highways apparent flaws were just some of many earthquake 
hazards long noted in dusty government reports he said 
hensley said a lengthy 1982 state study on effects of a big 
quake in the bay area noted what some consulting engineers suspect 
contributed to i880s collapse extremely unstable ground beneath 
the highway 
the study predicted the former marsh would liquefy in a big 
quake so far as i know nobody at the top paid attention to that 
study nor to his own seismic safety commission research on 
likely future earthquake effects hensley said 
these documents seem to be taken as interesting academic 
exercises until something happens hensley said 
jim roberts a top structural engineer for the california 
transportation department said friday that gov george deukmejian 
obviously is going to speed up research to find ways to 
quakeproof the 1 miles of i880 that collapsed killing scores of 
motorists 
the 1950sera doubledecker freeway is among four such 
structures in the bay area another the embarcadero freeway in san 
francisco was severely damaged in tuesdays quake and shut down 
for lengthy repair the two others a portion of i280 and the 
central viaduct received less damage 
roberts confirmed that the four structures earthquake 
stability particularly their aged doublesupport columns have 
worried engineers for years he admitted that warnings came even 
from within his own department including a may 31 memorandum that 
mentioned the need to act soon to bolster some multicolumn bridges 
the transportation department however has put off column work 
on the freeways pending more study instead it is readying a 55 
million effort to strengthen singlecolumn freeways as a result 
of the 1971 san fernando valley earthquake which severely damaged 
such roads roberts said 
he also acknowledged the department hadnt asked for research 
money to seek technology to strengthen freeways like i880 until 
after the 1987 whittier quake when more flaws were revealed in 
multicolumned structures 
now the department will seek 200 million to 300 million to 
strengthen the structures once research is finished he said 
since the 1971 quake the department has completed first 
phase work on 1300 bridges including doublecolumned bridge 
entryways like i880 to bolster horizontal decking ironically 
installation of strengthening cables may have contributed to 
1880s collapse by pulling down sections of the roadway jarred 
loose by the quake said dr pyotr moncarz a palo alto engineer 
you can talk to 100 engineers and get 100 different answers 
as to why the section collapsed retorted caltrans schaefer who 
added that the department will spare no effort to learn causes of 
the bridge failure

more than 2000 aftershocks have been 
recorded since the big earthquake oct 17 government seismologists 
said saturday as they warned of the risk of further damage 
the aftershocks are expected to last for several more days with 
some strong enough to cause additional harm especially to 
structures weakened in the original 69 quake according to the 
us geological survey 
an aftershock measuring 46 rattled the quake area anew saturday 
afternoon the usgs said it was centered about 8 miles northeast of 
santa cruz just a few miles from the epicenter of the big quake 
although the aftershocks are generally decreasing in magnitude 
there is still a small chance of a strong temblor measuring 50 or 
more on the richter scale of ground movement in the next few days 
said usgs seismologist william bakun 
the 69 quake relieved strain on the san andreas fault in the 
southern santa cruz mountains greatly reducing the chances of an 
equally powerful quake in the same spot over the next 50 years 
said geologist bill ellsworth 
but the quake did nothing to reduce the chances of another big 
temblor along a 25mile stretch of the san andreas north of the 
oct 17 rupture or along any of the other faults in california 
ellsworth said 
there are a number of small segments within the bay area that 
are estimated to have a reasonably high chance of rupturing in a 
magnitude 7 earthquake during the next 30 years ellsworth said 
three segments two along the hayward fault on the east side of 
san francisco bay and one along the san andreas each have about a 
20 percent chance of breaking in the 30year period he said 
there are many other faults in the bay area most of which we 
do not have the same kinds of geological information to build these 
kinds of forecasts ellsworth said so in some sense the 
longterm forecasts for the bay region the chance of another 
magnitude 7 earthquake in the next 30 years is probably an 
understatement of the probability 
as of saturday 17 aftershocks of magnitude 40 or larger and 71 
measuring at least 30 had been recorded the usgs said the 
largest was the 52 temblor that occurred 37 minutes after the main 
shock tuesday evening the second largest was a 50 that occurred 
at 314 am thursday 
because of this continuing hazard we are urging that 
earthquake preparedness measures continue to be taken and that 
extreme caution be exercised in and around damaged structures 
said usgs geologist thomas holzer

dogged rescuers punching through concrete 
pulled a burly longshoreman alive saturday from the rubble of an 
oakland freeway destroyed by an earthquake four days earlier 
onlookers burst into cheers as buck helm 57 was removed from 
his subcompact car and again when he waved weakly from a stretcher 
when he came out it was just an incredible and a wonderful 
sight to see after he had been there some 89 hours oakland mayor 
lionel wilson said that gives hope to everyone in terms of what 
the potential is who knows what is under there 
helm had asked paramedics crawling into a 3foothigh cavern 
when am i going to get out of here he asked doctors for a 
drink of milk when he arrived at highland general hospital 
he probably could have survived two more days doctors said 
workers have toiled for days uncovering bodies from the mayhem 
of the 1milelong stretch of doubledecked interstate 880 and by 
saturday there had been little hope of finding anyone alive helm 
was the first person rescued alive since tuesday night 
damage estimates from tuesdays quake stood at some 55 
billion and the confirmed death toll rose saturday to 55 34 of 
them pulled from the remains of i880 dozens are still listed as 
missing in oakland police said 
a strong aftershock saturday afternoon measuring 46 of the 
richter scale was centered eight miles northeast of santa cruz 
very close to the site of tuesdays earthquake the us geological 
survey reported it was felt in the san francisco area but there 
were no immediate reports of damage 
in all more than 2000 aftershocks have been registered since 
the initial quake 
helm a 240pound longshoremans clerk who works in oakland was 
pulled from a chevrolet sprint automobile and was rushed to 
highland five miles from the scene said tom silvey a spokesman 
for the state office of emergency services in sacramento 
helm had a steady pulse and was in criticalguarded condition 
officials said suffering from dehydration kidney failure three 
broken ribs and breathing difficulties he had been on the missing 
persons list since the disaster 
i raised my hands and screamed and thanked god hes alive 
his exwife lorene helm told the cable news network from her home 
in weaverville 250 miles northeast of san francisco 
we figured that if anybody could make it buck helm could 
hes tough hes a fighter said dave comport a coworker on the 
docks 
asked why he thought helm survived his son greg responded 
hes an ornery old fart 
rescuers said helm was packed inside the drivers seat not so 
much pinned as trapped 
paramedic diana moore said she and other rescuers had to crawl 
into an area only 3 feet tal helm seat belt proved to be an 
obstacle she said 
he was removed from a hole punched through the car with a 
jawsoflife device placed on a gurney and lifted out with a crane 
i was overwhelmed finding him it was a wonderful feeling 
she said 
he was very anxious to get out he was mainly moaning ms 
moore said the only thing that he said was understandable was 
when am i going to get out of here 
dr michael smith director of trauma at highland said helm was 
responding to fluids and had asked for a drink of milk 
helms left leg was partially crushed causing some kidney 
damage hospital medical director floyd huen said doctors were 
also checking for a skull fracture smith said 
he was not really compressed or in too bad a condition he 
said 
helm and a coworker had left the oakland terminal at 5 pm 
tuesday in separate cars headed north according to comport a 
superintendent for stevedore services of america 
the 69magnitude quake struck at 504 pm 
one of his coworkers was 10 car lengths ahead when the 
earthquake hit comport said he knew that buck helm was behind 
him and didnt come out all the word on the waterfront was that 
buck helm didnt come out 
were all ecstatic he said 
work had been suspended friday night at the freeway site because 
the morass of concrete and twisted steel had become too unstable 
and some sections shifted as much as three inches officials said 
but at 6 am a transportation engineer looked through one of 
the new seams created by the shifting and saw something move in a 
heavily damaged section 
he couldnt believe what he was seeing so he brought some 
others who also detected movement said bob jacobs deputy 
director at the california department of transportation 
an allout effort with jackhammers was begun two hours later 
ms moore was able to get within eight feet and yell to helm who 
moved his head 
that was the first confirmation that he was alive 
the crowd of rescuers cheered when told helm was alive 
we saw him wave his hand and everybody started cheering 
again said seth isler a los angeles actor volunteering with the 
red cross 
it was an incredible site to see 
helm was identified by his cars license plates and a check of 
the list of missing people 
there were no other survivors in nearby cars but the search was 
renewed after the discovery of helm officials said 
there have been five sweeps of the entire structure and we 
are in the process of making a sixth sweep garver said 
caltrans spokesman jim drago said despite renewed enthusiasm for 
the rescue operation they effort cant be sped up for fear of 
causing caveins 
the problem is we still have to proceed cautiously and 
deliberately even though our people are encouraged that others 
might still be alive drago said 
in san francisco firefighters removed what they first thought 
was the body of a baby discovered saturday in the smoldering 
remains of a fire in the marina district the coronors office 
later said tests would have to determine if the remains were human 
a search with trained dogs continued for others missing in the 
blaze which killed three people following the earthquake 
bulldozers began demolishing the first halfdozen of about 60 
dwellings in the marina that were too badly damaged to be repaired 
in hardhit santa cruz where the quake and its aftershocks 
still have residents jittery rain forced people inside for the 
first time since tuesday 
many of the families who had earlier been camped out in 
backyards and parks because they didnt feel secure inside 
buildings are making a value judgment and seeking getting out of 
the weather said lee duffuss of the local red cross office 
tents have sprung up all over town he said and federal 
officials are trying to determine whether to create a longterm 
tent city for those driven out of their homes 
officials said they began noticing increases in shelter 
populations saturday and expected more sunday as a second storm 
was expected in the bay area 
high winds dashed engineers hopes of quickly removing the 
collapsed 50foot section of the upper deck of the bay bridge the 
lifeline connecting oakland and san francisco 
experts decided to cut the 250ton slab of fivelane highway 
into two pieces with a giant saw and lower them to a barge with a 
crane said greg bayol of the california department of 
transportation 
the decision to delay the lifting is not expected to set back 
the fourweek target date for reopening the bridge bayol said 
rain also raised the threat of additional landslides in the 
mountains north of santa cruz near the epicenter of tuesdays 
69magnitude quake in boulder creek a town of 6800 60 homes 
already have been destroyed 
county spokeswoman dinah phillips said not enough rain was 
expected to cause widespread land problems 
relief aid continued to stream into the area but the most 
urgent requirement was for money to help relocate homeless families 
from shelters to temporary living quarters such as hotels a red 
cross official said 
about 5000 people have been housed in 30 shelters in the region 
affected by tuesdays quake the red cross said 
some 12000 people 10000 of them in santa cruz county have 
been displaced from their homes officials said

police searched on saturday for a palestinian 
suspected of strangling seven people in tel aviv and the case has 
prompted officials to review the policy that lets workers from the 
occupied lands stay overnight in the city 
police said the murders apparently stemmed from financial 
disputes between the suspect and his victims over drugs and 
prostitution but they would not rule out a political motive 
army radio quoted police officials as saying the suspect was 
known as a criminal and was given an overnight permit because he 
served as an informant for israels security forces tel aviv 
police declined comment 
the victims included prostitutes and drug dealers some were 
jews and others were arabs including some from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
the investigation began friday when residents of an impoverished 
tel aviv neighborhood reported bad odors coming from an apartment 
police arrived to discover the decomposing bodies of two women 
and one man hidden under mattresses in the apartment 
they said the investigation led them to the arabjewish tel aviv 
suburb of jaffa where the bodies of three women and one man were 
found 
news reports said police suspected more bodies may be found in 
southern tel aviv 
assistant inspector general yigal markus the tel aviv police 
chief said the main suspect was a palestinian from the occupied 
territories who had a permit to stay in tel aviv at night 
israel army radio said the victims apparently were strangled 
with nylon string 
police commissioner david krauss said saturday the policy of 
granting permits to palestinian workers to spend the night in tel 
aviv will be reexamined 
tel aviv should not serve as a haven for criminals from the 
occupied territories he said 
thousands of palestinian workers travel each morning to tel aviv 
but need a special permit to stay the night many hide in 
apartments warehouses or shelters to avoid the journey back home 
or the possibility of being caught in a palestinian commercial 
strike 
police officials have said they are instructed not to arrest 
laborers staying in tel aviv illegally however measures have been 
taken to limit the flow into israel of suspected criminals and 
activists of the 22monthold palestinian uprising against israeli 
rule of the territories 
in june the army began requiring that palestinian workers from 
the gaza strip present magnetic id cards to enter israel leaders 
of the uprising have ordered strikes and attacks to protest the 
step but they appear to have lost the battle 
in july police gave the army a list of about 3300 palestinians 
it wanted permanently barred from entering israel because of 
suspected criminal activity

the head of nbc news has criticized the 
networks initial response to san franciscos earthquake and 
ordered executives to find out why nbc was late with its coverage 
an internal memo issued friday by nbc news president michael 
gartner and made available by a source was written after the 
network received complaints from affiliates 
although the network eventually broadcast nonstop coverage of 
tuesdays quake it lagged far behind its rivals both in reports 
and pictures 
nbcs first live pictures from the scene didnt air until 908 
pm edt tuesday well after abc cbs and cnn were broadcasting 
live shots 
gartners memo blamed some of the delay in coverage on 
problems and confusion that were not related to technical 
problems nbc spokewoman peggy hubble confirmed saturday that the 
memo was by gartner 
gartner had said in an interview wednesday that the delay was 
because nbcs san francisco affiliate krontv had been harder hit 
by the earthquake than other network affiliates and was knocked 
off the air longer 
however francis martin president of chronicle broadcasting 
which owns kron said in a letter friday that the station was back 
on the air by 835 pm 31 minutes after the earthquake 
in a letter to james r sefert chairman of nbcs affiliate

president bush on saturday kept his pledge to 
veto legislation that would liberalize abortion law by making 
federal funds available for poor women in cases of incest and rape 
bush said he was unwilling to expend tax dollars unless the 
mothers life is endangered which is the only way medicaid can 
fund abortions under current law 
this year regrettably the congress has expanded the 
circumstances in which federal appropriated funds could be used to 
pay for abortions bush said in a veto message released by the 
white house 
the senate on thursday completed action on the abortion 
language passing on a 6731 vote a 1567 billion fiscal 1990 
spending bill for the departments of health and human services 
labor and education that included the expanded abortion funding 
provision despite bushs threat of a veto 
the house passed the measure the previous week by a much more 
narrow margin 216206 far short of the twothirds vote that 
would be needed to override a veto 
however house speaker thomas s foley dwash has indicated 
he would make an override attempt foley and other democrats say 
they do not believe there will be sufficient votes 
the leading sponsor of the abortion language change rep 
barbara boxer dcalif has said supporters will attempt to attach 
the language to other legislation 
congressional action to broaden the federal guidelines that have 
covered abortions for medicaid mothers since 1981 came amid 
increased activism nationwide by prochoice forces angered by the 
supreme courts decision in july to allow state discretion on 
abortion law 
prochoice advocates had been buoyed by congressional passage of 
the new abortion language and by the failure of florida gov bob 
martinez to get bills toughening that states abortion laws through 
a special session of the florida legislature earlier this month 
they expressed dismay saturday over bushs decision 
with one stroke of his pen president bush today condemned 
impoverished women to continue crisis pregnancies that can destroy 
their lives said kate michelman executive director of the 
national abortion rights action league the political arm of the 
prochoice movement she said bush defied public opinion and 
pandered to extremists 
but douglas johnson legislative director of the prolife 
national right to life committee said pesident bush has acted to 
protect innocent human life now prolife americans must persuade 
the house of representatives to back him up 
in his veto message bush said i have informed the congress on 
numerous occasions that i would veto legislation if it permitted 
the use of appropriated funds to pay for abortions other than those 
in which the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus 
were carried to term 
he noted that he wrote to the senate on tuesday warning he would 
veto such language 
in his brief veto message bush said he also was unhappy that 
the spending bill did not provide adequate funding for the pell 
grant program for higher education and that it failed to provide 
needed flexibility in the use of hhs discretionary funds to combat 
hiv aids one of americas highest public health priorities 
bush had indicated last week he was willing to discuss 
compromise language on abortion but then made what some saw as a 
concession to conservative republicans 
supporters of the expanded guidelines said the presidents 
position discriminated unfairly against poor mothers bush supports 
the practice of abortion in cases of rape or incest as well as 
when the mothers life is endangered but he does not favor using 
federal funds for the first two situations 
he said in a news conference oct 13 that he was not looking 
for any conflict over this and was interested in seeing if 
conference language could be worked out by the house and senate 
that may be able to avoid a veto on my part 
bush said when he wrote to the senate last tuesday that he had 
not reached his position on abortion easily or lightly 
since 1981 the federal government has determined i think 
wisely that taxpayer funds should be used for abortion in only the 
most narrow of circumstances where the life of the mother is 
endangered if abortion funding were expanded to include other 
circumstances it would be difficult to limit to the few cases of 
actual rape or incest and could have the unintended consequence of 
allowing the taking of countless other lives of unborn children 
well beyond the few cased argued as reasons for the proposed 
legislative change 
that letter came on the heels of what abortion proponents had 
seen as a glimmer of hope for a shift in bushs position in his 
oct 13 news conference he had said he wanted to see if theres 
room for flexibility on the question in congress 
his veto means the entire 1567 billion spending package goes 
back to congress 
it is the third bill bush has vetoed since he took office in 
june he vetoed legislation raising the minimum wage to 455 an 
hour and in july he vetoed a measure placing restrictions on a 6 
billion program for the united states to build a new jet fighter 
the fsx with japan

president bushs veto saturday of legislation 
allowing federally financed abortions for rape and incest victims 
marks the third time since he took office that he has exercised 
that constitutional prerogative 
bush said he vetoed the 1567 billion health education and 
labor spending measure that included the abortion provision because 
he opposed expanding the use of tax dollars for abortion 
current law makes federal medicaid funds for abortion available 
to poor women only when the mothers life is endangered 
this summer the president vetoed a bill that effectively would 
have killed a joint production agreement between the united states 
and japan for the fsx jet fighter 
in june he also vetoed legislation that would have raised the 
minimum wage to 455 an hour by october 1991 
congressional opponents of the fighter deal wanted to place 
restrictions on the transfer of certain advanced us technology to 
the japanese in the development of the 6 billion aircraft by 
general dynamics and mitsubishi heavy industries 
bush argued the restrictions were an infringement on 
presidential powers to conduct foreign policy the senate last 
month failed by a single vote to override the veto 
bushs first veto came after less than six months in office when 
congress approved an increase of the hourly minimum wage from 355 
to 455 bush had offered an increase to 425 an hour over a 
longer period with a sixmonth subminimum 340 an hour training 
wage for new employees 
democrats initially resisted the subminimum wage but later 
included a provision allowing the lower wage for firsttime 
employees with fewer than 60 days work experience in the measure 
bush rejected 
neither the house nor senate could muster the votes needed to 
override that veto 
last week the democraticcontrolled house labor and education 
committee approved a new minimum wage bill with bushs 425 
ceiling but the panel insisted the increase must come in two 
45cent increments by october 1991 it also retained the 60day 
limit on the lower wage 
senate sources have said the modified house bill could be 
brought up within the next three weeks

about three dozen parachutists leaped 
off the countrys second tallest bridge saturday in defiance of 
official warnings that flooding made the jump too dangerous on the 
one day a year it is allowed 
no injuries were reported police cited at least one of the 
parachutists who jumped from the 876foot new river gorge national 
bridge 
the national park service the fayetteville chamber of commerce 
and a group organizing the jump as part of the 10th annual bridge 
day celebration called off the jump saturday morning saying the 
river which was running 11 feet above normal had flooded all 
safe landing sites 
authorities did not set another date for the jump because they 
could not predict when water would subside parachutists had 
traveled from as far away as europe and australia and 100000 
spectators had gathered 
last year more than 100000 people turned out to watch 300 
divers perform 600 jumps from the center of the bridge 
i didnt come here to spin doughnuts said gerald harendza 
30 before making the 8second leap its not dangerous 
harendza a construction worker from lordsville ny who has 
performed 135 jumps off buildings antennas bridges and cliffs 
since 1982 landed on a pathway at the bottom of the 
3000footwide gorge 
nunzio forte a 59yearold father of six who had never jumped 
off a structure before landed on railroad tracks after hitting a 
tree 
i have six kids sure im worried forte a carpenter from 
effort pa said before jumping its a little risky but im 
going to try it ive been wanting to do this for my birthday 
the mornings third jumper yelled skydive wyoming as he 
leaped over the edge of the bridge timothy sell 23 of davis 
calif landed in a parking lot and was cited for parachuting onto 
federal property without a permit 
sell said it was his sixth jump from the bridge 
i think its unfair i come out here from california and i get 
this said sell who said he didnt consider the jump dangerous 
for veterans 
the offense carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail 
5000 in fines and confiscation of equipment police said 
the area under the bridge includes state federal and private 
land giving jurisdiction to different law enforcement agencies 
damien hansen 24 a parachute rigger from melbourne australia 
opted not to jump 
it was a wise move all in all hansen said we came all 
the way from australia but were happy itll be here next year 
about two dozen parachutists made their jumps in late afternoon 
as authorities were preparing to clear the bridge of thousands of 
spectators 
one sheriffs guy came on the pa and said lets clear the 
bridge one diver said later i said ok see you later 
and leaped 
unlike earlier divers who landed on the north side of the river 
later divers zeroed in on a clearing on a twisting road amid about 
150 dodging cheering spectators on the south side of the river 
one diver landed on the roof of a car another was left dangling in 
a tree and a third brushed a tree before falling in a pile of 
leaves 
the river has to be running at most at 4 feet above normal to 
permit jumping on bridge day said lizzie watts a park service 
ranger the water level fell only 2 feet from its level of 14 feet 
above normal friday night despite the opening by the us army 
corps of engineers of four floodgates 
three people have been killed in parachute leaps from the 
bridge two during bridge day festivities the last fatality 
occurred in 1987 no prior jumps were canceled 
other bridge day festivities went on as scheduled including 
arts and crafts sales and the detouring of traffic so that 
pedestrians could walk on the worlds longest steel arch bridge and 
view the fall foliage 
the only taller bridge in the united states is the royal gorge

buck alvin helm a beefy longshoreman who 
splits his time between the oakland waterfront and the klamath 
mountains is strong tough and ornery those traits served him 
well in a deathdefying 90hour ordeal on a crumpled highway 
helms family and friends know him as an occasionally 
cantankerous familyloving man with a booming voice who knows how 
to survive and survive he did through three nights of terrifying 
conditions inside his crushed car in the concrete wreckage of the 
nimitz freeway 
asked what kept his father alive so long greg helm responded 
hes an ornery old fart 
helm 57 has worked in the bay area since 1969 as a shipping 
clerk for local 34 of the international longshoremens and 
warehousemens union a former teacher he has worked most recently 
at the port of oakland keeping track of the cargo received and 
delivered on the waterfront 
most weekends and sometimes on weekdays he drives 250 miles 
north to weaverville on the edge of the klamath mountains to visit 
his children and his exwife with whom he remains good friends 
his silver chevrolet sprint mashed in the wreckage had nearly 
200000 miles on it 
news of his miraculous survival and rescue shot through the town 
of 3500 like a lightning bolt saturday 
one woman came into tops market where buck shops the largest 
grocery store in town and hollered at the top of her lungs they 
found him they found him according to assistant manager tony 
giassullo 
a group of helms friends and relatives was watching television 
together at the home of his exwife lorene when news came that he 
was alive 
everyone was happy yelling crying and holding each other 
said frank desmond a friend of helms son jeff mrs helm was 
saying thank god 
said former nexttodoor neighbor cathy hardisty i still got 
chills all over my body at him living through that 
helms tale of survival starts with his own misfortune in timing 
after finishing up work at 5 pm helm and basil parker a 
coworker for the last six years left the howard terminal and 
headed north on the nimitz parker for his home in berkeley and 
helm for weaverville seconds after passing helm and waving to him 
parker looked in his rearview mirror as the earthquake struck 
helm who had been about 10 car lengths behind him was gone 
right now all i can say is im glad to see him alive said 
parker im happy for his family more than anything 
helm described by one acquaintance as about 6 feet tall 240 
pounds and pretty goodsized around the middle is a wellknown 
figure in weaverville his family has lived there about 10 years 
sons greg by a first marriage and jeff a high school student 
and fifthgrader desiree 
he was a real family man said bridgitte calkins we saw 
him when he went to the football games and the soccer games with 
his children hes real friendly and real talkative 
waitress lory hartland 25 serves him cherry pie and coffee 
almost every weekend at the nugget restaurant 
hes big strong tough and ornery she said im not 
surprised he survived he always comes in here with all his kids 
and their friends hes a real good dad im ecstatic hes alive 
so is weaverville resident fred meyer who described his friend 
as a big bear of a guy 
he has a booming voice and a heart of gold meyer said 
 
peggy mcconnell of weaverville said helm is one of her best 
friends she said he stands out as an individualist in this 
fundamentalist redneck little town 
mcconnell 40 described helms car as dirty and disorganized 
and said it might have contained food and water she said he had 
access to a van that he slept in while in the bay area in order to 
save money even though he makes plenty of money 
 
the day after the 69 quake helms former wife walked into 
weaverville variety office supply in a daze and spoke with store 
owner pat zugg 
she said she had a gut feeling that he was trapped in that 
freeway she said she was pretty stunned he hadnt called to 
say he was ok so she knew something wasnt right he was very 
familyoriented every time i saw him he was with his kids 
helms coworkers on the waterfront had known for days that he 
was almost surely among the victims on the devastated stretch of 
freeway when radio and television reported he had been found many 
called in to the local 34 office to share the good news 
were all ecstatic said dave comport a shipping 
superintendent who works in the same terminal as helm we figured 
that if anybody could make it buck helm could hes tough hes a 
fighter 
frances lona secretary for the local 34 main office in san 
francisco characterized helm and his coworkers as wild 
characters but said he is a great guy 
hes now a guy with a new nickname according to coworker bob

flight controllers told the atlantis 
astronauts saturday they will have to return to earth at least 90 
minutes early monday to avoid predicted high afternoon winds at the 
california landing site 
officials also said they were preserving an option outlined 
friday of keeping the space shuttle in orbit an extra day or two 
if a landing cant be made monday a threeday extension was 
possible but not likely they said 
meanwhile astronaut franklin changdiaz a naturalized us 
citizen who was born in san jose costa rica spoke from orbit

america in general

astronauts turned off unneeded lights and shut off some computers 
and other redundant equipment 
they were directed saturday to adjust their work and sleep 
schedules to be ready to return at least 90 minutes or one orbit

force base at the planned 1238 pm pdt landing time on monday 
nasa decided to land a little earlier because winds at the mojave 
desert base normally are lighter in the morning flight director 
ron dittemore said saturday afternoon 
the new landing time is now 1108 am monday at edwards 
dittemore said 
if the winds look as if they will still be too strong the 
shuttle could land another 90 minutes earlier monday he added 
flight controllers will reevaluate the landing time after a weather 
briefing sunday morning he added 
were just going to have to watch the winds real closely 
dittemore said 
for safety reasons a shuttle would not land if a crosswind 
exceeded 18 mph or a headwind was more than 29 mph 
the crew consists of commander don williams pilot mike 
mcculley and mission specialists changdiaz shannon lucid and 
ellen baker 
changdiaz a physicist discussed the flight with the costa 
rican president in spanish saying it has been a marvelous 
mission he also said the crew had taken several photographs of 
costa rica and he hoped to show them to arias after the mission 
we feel exceedingly proud of everything you have accomplished 
in reality you raise high the name of costa rica and of latin 
america in general arias told changdiaz who has been a hero in 
his homeland since his first trip to space in 1986 
arias invited the crew members to a space conference next march 
i dont have words to thank on behalf of our people all of 
you for what you are doing for the welfare of humankind arias

animal rights activists in ohio kentucky maryland and 
minnesota staged protests at department stores saturday against the 
sale of furs 
pickets stood outside lazarus department stores in columbus 
ohio cincinnati and louisville ky handing out fliers and copies 
of a letter from lazarus officials declining to take a stand 
a protest was also held at higbees stores in cleveland and at a 
hutzlers in baltimore two minneapolis stores a saks fifth 
avenue and a daytonhudson corp outlet were also the target of 
demonstrators 
in columbus robin russell head of the group protect our 
earths treasures suggested the stores could sell fake furs and 
still satisfy their customers 
what we found out was that this lazarus had taken their furs 
out a couple months ago because of low sales russell said but 
that reinforces what we are asking even more furs are not a large 
part of their sales and its not going to hurt lazarus to take the 
furs out of their stores 
the demonstrators passed out a flier showing a copy of a letter 
daniel g bukey lazarus vice president for consumer relations 
wrote to an animal rights group he said the company found it 
impractical to make moral religious and political judgments about 
products or the companies that manufacture them we simply must buy 
and sell the merchandise on the merit of the merchandise itself

volunteers searching northwest iowa farm 
fields saturday found more parts from an engine of a dc10 that 
crashed july 19 but the key part has failed to turn up 
authorities said 
the search by 90 volunteers paid for by general electric 
aircraft engines was to be discontinued sunday but rewards still 
will be given for significant discoveries 
jerry clark a ge representative said search parties using 
metal detectors would try one last time to find a flange that 
connected the forward fan shaft to the disc in the tailmounted ge 
engine and was held together with 20 bolts 
the no 2 engine flew apart as united flight 232 was flying 
north of alta spewing metal and severing hydraulic lines for 
flight controls pilots wrestled the jumbo jet to the sioux gateway 
airport in sioux city but the plane cartwheeled down the runway in 
a fiery crash that killed 112 of the 296 people aboard 
of the engine pieces still missing clark said the flange is the 
thing most important to investigators 
nick droegmiller a farmer near alta said volunteers scoured 
the fields on his land and found a variety of fragments 
they came up with a couple of retainer pins and an oil line 
with what looked like a pump on the end of it he said searchers 
said it was apparently part of the hydraulic system of the dc10 
the company has offered more than 270000 in rewards for the 
return of various parts 
the largest single award of 119000 was claimed this month when 
droegmillers neighbor farmer janice sorenson found most of the 
rear engine fan disc the rest of the disc was found on the nearby 
farm of harold halverson who received about 40000

hungarys foreign minister on saturday said 
soviet forces should quickly leave his country and that hungary may 
someday join the european economic community 
foreign minister gyula horn on a twoday official visit to 
norway friday discussed historic reforms in his east bloc nation 
with norways prime minister jan p syse on saturday he met with 
foreign minister kjell magne bondevik 
as soon as possible soviet forces should be pulled out of 
hungarian territory it depends on the success of talks in vienna 
in 1990 about conventional disarmament which should give the 
green light to the withdrawal horn said at a news conference 
about 62000 soviet soldiers are stationed in hungary the 
soviets have pledged to pull out 10000 of them by the end of next 
year as part of a withdrawal from eastern europe 
horn also proposed a draft agreement of cooperation with the 
sixnation european free trade association to pave the way for 
future hungarian membership 
he said hungary may join western european nations in the 
european economic community in 10 to 15 years the eec which is 
promoting a common european market by 1992 now has 12 members 
meanwhile horn said it would be more realistic for hungary to 
seek cooperation with the trade association 
he said economic reform and trade are as important to 
debtridden hungary as political reform he said the west must help 
bolster hungarys economy 
development of a political system is something that hungary 
itself decides economic development depends on our will and the 
wests will he said 
hungary this month rewrote its constitution to reflect 
democratic ideals allowing opposition parties and preparing for 
its first free elections in 41 years the elections are to be held 
early next year 
the communist party also dissolved itself and formed the 
hungarian socialist party which is headed by reformers 
hungary is beginning to near the democracy of western 
europe horn said he predicted that the new party which now 
rules the country will be part of a governing coalition after 
multiparty elections
