david and james taggart lied when they 
said ptl founder jim bakker authorized them to take ministry money 
they used to buy property and jewelry a prosecutor said monday 
before deliberations began in the taggarts tax evasion trial 
the jury started deliberations just after 5 pm on the 12th day 
of the trial jurors left after three hours and were to resume 
tuesday 
in a nutshell this case is about power prosecutor david 
brown said in his closing statement in the brothers trial the 
power david taggart and his brother exercised at ptl to line their 
own pockets 
the taggarts are charged with evading 525000 in income taxes 
after spending nearly 12 million in ptl money on personal 
luxuries such as condominums jewelry expensive cars and designer 
clothes the trial began july 5 
if convicted each brother could be sentenced to 25 years in 
prison and face fines of more than 1 million 
the defense rested thursday following two days of testimony from 
the taggarts who began at ptl as piano players us district 
judge robert potter gave no reasons for then postponing fridays 
session 
within a few years of joining ptl in the late 1970s david 
taggart 32 was bakkers top personal aide james 35 was the 
interior designer at ptls heritage usa christian retreat just 
south of charlotte 
before his closing remarks defense attorney ben cotten placed 
items from such exclusive new york stores as cartier and gucci on a 
bench in front of the jury if what is on trial here is a 
lifestyle you dont like then we didnt need a trial at all he 
said 
brown told the jury that the governments case was made more 
difficult by some of the witnesses including the two defendants 
if youre not offended by the evidence of how they spent the 
money they took from ptl you should be offended by the fact 
that both defendants got on the stand and lied brown said 
he said there was ample evidence to support the governments 
case 
david taggart showed audacity and greed when he testified he 
was entitled to be paid at a level similar to bakker 
jim bakker never authorized it never not once david taggart 
took the stand and lied to you and david taggart and james taggart 
conspired to take money from ptl and not pay taxes on it brown 
said he referred to taggarts testimony that he had authority from 
bakker to take large cash advances and use ptl blank checks 
david taggart testified last week that his way of accounting for 
the 12 million was to submit documentation to justify it receive 
a tax form from ptl that called the cash advances income or that 
the cash advances would be considered a loan which would be 
converted into a bonus 
cotten used his closing arguments to return to testimony about a 
verbal agreement he said was reached between david taggart and 
bakker in 1983 he asked the jurors not to dismiss the agreement 
simply because it was an oral contract 
cotten said bakker agreed to give david taggart access to the 
same resources he enjoyed the intent was not to beat the irs out 
of money it was to have ptl shoulder the burden cotten said

prime minister margaret thatcher appointed new 
foreign and defense secretaries monday fired two cabinet ministers 
and switched around others in the biggest government shakeup since 
she won power 10 years ago 
mrs thatcher named john major one of the leastknown members 
of her 22member cabinet as the new foreign secretary making him 
a prime contender to succeed her 
he replaces sir geoffrey howe who was moved to a vacant post as 
deputy prime minister howe will also lead the governing 
conservative party in the house of commons 
the prime minister battling to halt her governments slide in 
popularity also put new appointees in an array of major posts 
including the portfolios for northern ireland and the environment 
mrs thatcher fired her harassed transport secretary paul 
channon who had been accused of bungling bomb warnings before pan 
am flight 103 was blown up over scotland on dec 21 and social 
security secretary john moore 
the two other cabinet ministers to depart defense secretary 
george younger and trade and industry secretary lord young said 
they were resigning to resume business careers 
northern ireland secretary tom king was named defense secretary 
in an apparent reward after four years as britains top official in 
the embattled province 
the appointment of major as foreign secretary was a big step up 
from his former cabinet post as chief secretary to the treasury 
the no 2 financial official 
the 46yearold son of a circus trapeze artist was raised in 
poverty in south londons rundown brixton district never went to 
university and worked as a building laborer before making a career 
in banking 
he entered parliament in the may 1979 general election that 
brought mrs thatcher to power and ousted a socialist labor party 
government 
his appointment underlined the transformation of the hierarchy 
of the conservative party once the preserve of the british upper 
classes since mrs thatcher a grocers daughter took over 
we now know without the need for guesswork who her chosen 
successor will be londons liberal guardian newspaper commented 
tuesday 
mrs thatcher 63 is widely expected to retire some time after 
bidding for an unprecedented fourth successive term at the next 
election it must be held by mid1992 
the move of howe 62 to deputy prime minister was widely 
regarded as a demotion from one of the most prestigious jobs in the 
cabinet 
mrs thatcher also brought into the cabinet another member of 
the class of 1979 christopher patten a rising star from the 
partys liberal wing as the new environment secretary 
reflecting anxiety at the governments drop in the polls and its 
drubbing in elections for the european parliament last month mrs 
thatcher shifted education secretary kenneth baker to the 
chairmanship of the conservative party 
party chairman peter brooke was named northern ireland 
secretary a tough job that effectively removes the incumbent from 
daytoday contact with party political issues in mainland britain 
energy secretary cecil parkinson a thatcher favorite whose 
political career was interrupted after a scandal over an 
extramarital liaison six years ago was named transport secretary 
he resigned from the cabinet in 1983 after news broke that his 
exsecretary with whom he had an affair was carrying his child 
mrs thatcher brought him back into the cabinet when she won a 
third term in may 1987 
the shakeup announced after mrs thatcher summoned government 
ministers to her downing street office for private meetings 
appeared aimed primarily at freshening the governments image 
beset by rising inflation a revival of labor union militancy 
and facing a much tougher challenge from the revived labor party 
mrs thatcher has trailed labor seven to 15 points in polls since 
the spring 
patten succeeded nicholas ridley a chainsmoking scion of an 
aristocratic family who was named trade and industry secretary 
ridley accused by critics of mishandling the current passage 
through parliament of a controversial new tax is deeply unpopular 
with many party members who blame him for worsening the 
governments poll standing 
but mrs thatcher who has the sole power to appoint cabinet 
ministers has repeatedly defended him 
the dismissal of transport secretary channon an heir to the 
guinness brewing fortune and reputedly the richest member of the 
cabinet had been predicted 
in the aftermath of the pan am disaster his department was 
accused of being tardy about passing on detailed bomb warnings to 
airlines critics also said he mishandled current strikes by 
employees of british rail and the london underground 
other new cabinet appointments announced were norman lamont as 
treasury secretary and john gummer as agriculture minister both 
previously held government jobs outside the cabinet 
john wakeham conservative party leader in the commons became 
the new energy secretary and tony newton former trade minister 
the new social security secretary

the man accused of killing actress rebecca 
schaeffer reportedly traveled to the maine hometown of samantha 
smith the young girl whose 1983 visit to the soviet union drew 
international attention 
police investigators were told that robert john bardo now 19 
ran away and traveled to maine four or five years ago to be near 
the smith girl the tucson citizen reported saturday 
in july 1983 miss smith then 11 went to the soviet union for 
a twoweek tour at the invitation of the late soviet leader yuri 
andropov she had written a letter to andropov asking the world 
leader whether he favored war 
in an unusual move he responded to her letter telling her the 
soviet people had peaceful intentions and inviting her to visit his 
country 
two years later on aug 25 1985 she and her father were 
killed in a plane crash near auburn maine 
dan andrews a los angeles homicide detective said he heard the 
smith story from an acquaintance of bardo andrews would not 
identify the acquaintance 
detective sgt charles armijo said bardos father phillip a 
bardo jr told tucson police detectives after his sons arrest 
that the son had developed the obsession for miss smith and had run 
away to find her 
armijo said detectives were told bardo had gotten within several 
blocks of the smith home but was picked up by police when he asked 
for directions bardo was returned to his parents 
bardo was arrested in tucson last wednesday one day after ms 
schaeffer was gunned down at her apartment building in los angeles 
he is jailed in lieu of 1 million bail and his lawyer has said 
bardo will fight extradition to california 
neither armijo nor andrews indicated they thought bardo was 
thinking of harming the young girl 
bardos father phillip declined to comment on the smith matter 
were not discussing anything with anyone the elder bardo 
said later on well release a statement but were kind of 
sorting it out ourselves right now

friend of president reagan wrote samuel r pierce jr to endorse a 
request for more than 16 million in rent subsidies for denver 
housing projects according to a published report 
the new york times reported in its monday editions that the 
endorsement two years ago by coors came as the request appeared 
headed for rejection 
the times based the information on coors on internal government 
documents 
it also quoted former senior housing official thomas t demery 
as saying a hud selection committee was told that pierce then the 
departments secretary wanted the denver application given very 
careful consideration which it was 
the newspaper said the finding followed other revelations that 
during the reagan administration the department of housing and 
urban development was more likely to approve projects endorsed by 
prominent republicans former reagan aides and friends of pierce 
documents showed the denver proposal was originally left off a 
list of 1987 applications to be recommended for financing 
on aug 12 1987 coors wrote pierce urging him to look into 
this matter and give it your favorable approval 
one week after the letter was written the selection panel met

mexico reached agreement with its creditor 
banks late sunday on a package that is expected to make significant 
reductions in mexicos foreign debt burden the second largest in 
the developing world 
the agreement which provides banks with three options to chose 
from in providing assistance to mexico marks the first 
breakthrough for the bush administrations third world debt 
strategy 
officials involved in the talks estimated that the package had 
the potential of reducing by up to onethird the 45 billion in 
payments mexico must make annually to service the 54 billion it 
owes to commercial banks 
however the exact benefits of the plan will not be known for 
many months until the individual banks holding the loans make 
decisions regarding the extent to which they will participate in 
the debt reduction package arrived at sunday 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari hailed the accord in 
a nationwide television and radio address in that country he said 
it answered the cry of mexicans to return to growth and 
opened a breach for other countries with similar debt problems 
salinas described the negotiations as difficult complex and 
tense 
the successful conclusion of the negotiations came after us 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan joined in the final stages of the marathon discussions 
brady emerging after the talks ended late sunday said you 
see a lot of smiles around here but he refused to discuss 
specifics of the final agreement 
however another official who spoke on condition that his name 
not be used said the final package offers banks two ways to 
provide debt relief to mexico 
they can agree to reduce the principal on the old loans by 35 
percent or they can agree to reduce the interest being charged on 
the loans to 625 percent a third option commercial banks will 
have is providing new loans to mexico 
those banks willing to reduce principal or cut the interest 
charged will be able to get guarantees on the remaining debt from 
the international monetary fund and the world bank the two 
multinational lending agencies that are backing the 
administrations debt strategy 
in a statement brady called the mexican agreement a major 
step forward in the implemenation of the administrations debt 
reduction initiative 
the agreement between mexico and its creditor banks will 
provide significant debt and debtservice reduction for mexico as 
well as new money to support mexicos economic growth brady 
said 
he said the united states working with other countries was 
willing to offer mexico shortterm financing of up to 2 billion 
until mexico began receiving the new money agreed to in the plan 
the negotiating teams for the final agreement were led by 
mexican treasury secretary pedro aspe and john reed chairman of 
citicorp and the head of the committee representing commerical 
banks in the talks 
both men were smiling when they emerged from the talks held in 
bradys office and various conference rooms on the third floor of 
the us treasury 
the official mexican new agency notimex said there were 
lastminute negotiations over a readjustment clause that would 
increase debt payments once the mexican economy got moving again 
but the official who discussed the talks said that both sides 
had agreed to tie increased debt payments to any improvements in 
mexicos export sales after the year 1996 
the socalled readjustment clause has reportedly been a 
sticking point in the talks with mexico maintaining that raising 
debt payments at a later date might block an economic recovery that 
the cuts are designed to foster 
the fact that brady and greenspan were both participating in the 
talks was an indication of the high priority the united states has 
placed on completing a deal with mexico the country which is 
considered the test case for the administrations new initiative to 
reduce debt 
last march brady unveiled the strategy which sought to reduce a 
portion of the 13 trillion debt burden being carried by third 
world nations by offering various inducements to persuade 
commercial banks to forgive a portion of their loans 
the administration had hoped to have a finished mexican debt 
package to present during the sevennation economic summit held 
week in paris to help move the talks along president bush held a 
hurriedly scheduled meeting with mexican president carlos salinas 
de gortari 
while the talks between mexico and its creditor banks failed to 
arrive at a breakthrough before the summit ended bush was 
successful in winning backing for the strategy in the final 
economic communique 
the administration also announced in paris that the united 
states was prepared to put up between 1 billion and 2 billion as 
an emergency bridge loan to supply money until funds start 
arriving from the commercial banks 
with this accord we have achieved our goal of reducing from 6 
to 2 percent of the gross national product our net transfers 
abroad an anonymous source close to the talks said according to 
notimex 
the 54 billion owed to private banks represents about half of 
mexicos 107 billion foreign debt the second largest in the 
developing world after brazils 
reducing the crushing debt is the centerpiece of president 
carlos salinas de gortaris policy it is seen in mexico as the key 
to getting the nations stagnant economy moving again 
mexicos debt crisis began with a borrowing spree during the oil 
boom years of the late 1970s when the bottom fell out of the oil 
market in 1982 the mexican economy went into a tailspin that has 
seen the average workers buying power fall by half 
the economic crisis sparked fears of political instability as 
unhappy mexicans began turning against the party that has ruled for 
60 uninterrupted years salinas a harvardeducated economist was 
held to the smallest margin of victory in party history in last 
years presidential elections

in a continent littered with economic 
disasters namibia heads toward independence as a potential success 
if it can meet the demands of poor blacks without alienating 
wealthy whites and foreign investors 
the desert territory has profitable mining fishing and farming 
industries and one of the best infrastructures in africa much of 
it built with money from south africa 
whitecontrolled south africa has administered namibia also 
known as southwest africa for 74 years under a mandate from the 
defunct league of nations 
namibias per capita income of about 1000 annually is among 
the highest in africa but economists say its independence could 
bring a sharp economic decline and they list these reasons 
south africa which has provided up to 25 percent of namibias 
750 million annual budget is expected to cut virtually all aid 
after independence expected early next year 
thousands of namibias whites concerned about the future 
under a blackled government are expected to leave the country or 
move their assets to neighboring south africa 
leaders of the southwest africa peoples organization the 
guerrilla group expected to win preindependence elections in 
november have virtually no handson economic experience they 
proclaim socialist policies associated with crumbling economies 
elsewhere in africa 
swapo does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of 
socialism over capitalism the organization said in an election 
manifesto 
the state will have ownership of a significant part of the 
countrys economic resources it said egalitarianism forms the 
basis of swapos vision of a just social order 
such promises are popular among the black majority in a 
territory where the unemployment rate is estimated at 25 percent 
and few blacks own homes or businesses 
will it work 
all the southern african nations that have relied heavily on 
state control of the economy angola zambia zimbabwe tanzania 
and mozambique have suffered economic declines or fallen short of 
their potential 
botswana the one blackruled country in the region to pursue a 
marketoriented economy has prospered 
swapo has raised expectations that will be difficult to meet 
regardless of their policies said rainer ritter a private 
economist in windhoek 
the organization has promised major improvements in education 
health care housing and jobs 
but swapo has not said how it will finance the programs the 
territory now has a budget deficit of about 180 million and a 
foreign debt of more than 300 million 
swapo will have to try to prevent a recession in the northern 
towns and villages of the ovambo tribe where the organization 
draws its strongest support 
an estimated 50000 south african soldiers have left namibia 
since the yearlong independence plan took effect april 1 most 
were stationed in the north where namibians fought them but relied 
on their money 
hundreds of small general stores known as cuca shops are 
central to economic life in the north and are likely to suffer 
thousands of namibians employed by the military in jobs ranging 
from soldiers to maids are now out of work 
swapo has softened its hardline socialist language in recent 
months in an effort to encourage whites to stay and to attract 
foreign investors 
we will invite foreign investors to develop our economy 
swapo president sam nujoma said recently in cairo egypt we do 
not think the present moment is the time for nationalizations 
swapo also has made it clear it will accept a mixed economy and 
needs the skills and capital of namibias 75000 whites who make 
up 6 percent of the territorys 13 million people 
whites own an estimated 65 percent of private property in 
namibia and earn at least 10 times more than blacks on average 
according to swapo 
swapos main opponent the democratic turnhalle alliance says 
swapos moderate tone will vanish if the organization comes to 
power 
swapo remains committed to an outdated and demonstrably 
unsuccessful ideology that of doctrinaire socialism an ideology 
that has already destroyed the economies of most african states 
said the alliance a multiracial coalition that favors a 
marketoriented economy 
the namibian government under south african control already 
accounts for more than half the territorys 13 billion gross 
domestic product 
large diamond and uranium mining companies owned by firms in 
britain and south africa make up the largest chunk of the private 
sector 
consolidated diamond mining of namibia owned by de beers of 
south africa recently said swapos economic views contain some 
inaccuracies and a certain lack of realism 
but the company also said it was encouraged by swapos 
apparent willingness to negotiate and that willingness offers 
scope for reconciliation between government and the private 
sector

stuck in traffic tired of waiting for the 
bus fed up with rising air fares 
transportation secretary samuel skinner is trying to find out 
what americans want to do about it 
but skinner in starting today a series of nationwide public 
hearings aimed at coming up with a national transportation policy 
is asking for ideas not complaints 
you shouldnt go if youre just going to say weve got 
gridlock somebody ought to do something about it because we know 
that said skinner in an interview these are needs and idea 
sessions 
skinner who carries a regular washington metrorail card in his 
wallet and drives to work on the same jammed roads as this regions 
other commuters said the nation has been taking transportation for 
granted 
and he makes it clear this includes the reagan administration 
skinner is a former federal prosecutor and chicago area transit 
chief brought to washington by president bush 
weve had a policy but there hasnt been a coordinated 
national policy he said there was an absence of planning and 
i happen to be a planner 
skinner said the nations airports highways bridges waterways 
and mass transit system are simply wearing out 
were going to have to rebuild it and replace it or were not 
going to be able to rely on it anymore he said 
among the most critical problems are a lack of planning for new 
airports skinner said and 80 billion worth of work on the 
countrys deteriorating bridges 
the transportation department has scheduled 33 meetings in

george bush rebounding from negative reviews 
early in his presidency is now winning good marks after two 
successful trips to europe and a general sense of economic 
wellbeing at home 
the president is a late bloomer says one analyst 
at the 100day point bush was criticized as being too cautious 
unimaginative and unwilling to compete with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
after six months in office bush basks in praise for winning 
support at a nato summit for a us plan to reduce conventional 
arms in europe and for traveling to poland and hungary to 
encourage democratic reforms 
hes actually done well after a halting beginning said 
thomas cronin a presidential scholar at colorado college 
cronin said bush was aided enormously by the fact that the 
democrats in congress were in disarray as house speaker jim 
wright of texas and house whip tony coelho of california struggled 
with ethical problems and then resigned there was no challenge 
to his leadership 
after losing a battle with congress for confirmation of john 
tower as secretary of defense bush came back with a decisive 
victory on his veto of a 120 increase in the minimum wage 
hes obviously in a lot better shape than he was at 100 
days said stephen hess a presidential scholar at the brookings 
institution hes had two awfully good trips abroad and when a 
president travels abroad he gets an awful lot of attention 
larry sabato the university of virginia political scientist who 
called bush a late bloomer said its as though theres a second 
honeymoon at the sixmonth point 
its tied to real successes particularly in the foreign 
sphere and things are going reasonably well abroad and at home 
sabato said the economy may be slow but its not in recession 
theres no war or threat of it and things appear to be going in 
our direction 
norman ornstein a political analyst at the american enterprise 
institute said bushs foreign travels tilt the balance away from 
the notion that the guy who was making things happen was gorbachev 
and that bush was asleep at the switch 
it erases the notion of a passive president whos doing 
nothing ornstein said 
at the white house bushs chief of staff john sununu said 
its nice to see the beginning of a response that everybody hoped 
there would be 
polls show bush has a positive rating of 66 to 73 percent which 
puts him ahead of ronald reagan at this point in his presidency 
andy kohut president of gallup opinion research said bushs 
approval rating was slipping in april and may but then began to 
turn around 
between may and july hes been dealing with international 
problems and the country tends to rally around a president whos 
dealing with rather clearcut international issues said kohut 
on the other hand kohut said bush is still an enigmatic 
character to many people thats where hes weak he said the 
category of people classified as dont know or no opinion 
about bush is higher than with other presidents running at about 
26 percent 
countering that criticism sununu said vision doesnt fit on a 
bumper sticker 
he said the president is defining his agenda with specific 
proposals to balance the budget bail out the savings and loan 
industry clean up air pollution and combat crime 
sununu said bush has demonstrated a willingness to do his 
homework to spend the time examining the details then to make a 
decision not in haste 
asked what bush should have done differently sununu replied 
honest in terms of the big issues and timetable and the agenda 
and the approach not a heck of a lot 
ornstein said bush should be more aggressive establish a 
longterm agenda and take some risks beyond that he said bush was 
losing an awful lot of direction and momentum by the fact that 
hundreds of toplevel appointments have not been made 
he could plummet the next six months if we slipped into a 
recession cautioned sabato 
theres a little too much basking in the glow of a 70 percent 
approval rating not capitalizing on it ornstein said if 
youre up around 70 percent early on its a good time to let it 
drop down to 60 percent by pushing some things through that may be 
a little controversial 
there is widespread agreement that much of bushs popularity is 
due to his personal style his high energy level and obvious relish 
for the job 
i think weve grown used to him like an old comfortable 
shoe said hess some of the rough edges from the campaign have 
rubbed off he hasnt forced himself on us 
ornstein said bush is not the kind of guy whos going to fall 
asleep with the pope alluding to an occasion where reagan 
nodded off while meeting with john paul ii 
sununu said i think people right off the bat perceived a 
different style from the reagan days they have really begun to 
feel comfortable and appreciative of the style i think that is 
very important for a president to do to give his mark to the 
office that he probably will be occupying for eight years

holy batroots is it really true as some 
scientists suggest that human beings and bats might be distant 
cousins who share the same primeval ancestors is there a batman or 
count dracula lurking in each of us 
in the heat of this summers batmania with american moviegoers 
breaking boxoffice records to see batman anything seems 
possible 
the national zoos bat expert dr john seidensticker says its 
an intriguing theory one you could sink your teeth into but hes 
not sure he believes it other scientists at the smithsonian 
institution scoff at the idea 
seidensticker says brain studies have yielded evidence that 
certain kinds of large bats found in africa and the south pacific 
may be descendants of prehistoric primates akin to lemurs or 
mouselike shrews 
the theory is that these bats are really flying primates he 
says and connected somehow in the evolutionary chain to the early 
primate ancestors of monkeys apes gorillas and humans 
but dr charles handley a leading authority on bats and other 
mammals at the smithsonians national museum of natural history 
says this theory is a hot potato of scientific controversy that 
has won few adherents 
we dont know what the ancestors of bats really were 
handley said 
the 160 fluttering bats in the national zoos new bat cave 
arent talking 
in fact they dont display the slightest familial interest in 
their supposed twolegged cousins who stare intently through a 
glass wall into their dimly lighted hideaway of damp rocks and 
hollow tree trunks 
one recent visitor was vice president dan quayle and his 
children who attended the washington premiere of batman at a 
nearby movie theater and then joined a postscreening party for 
1200 guests in a tent outside the bat cave 
seidensticker the zoos associate curator of mammals 
illuminated the cave for quayle with a flashlight he said the vice 
president was very interested in the bats and lingered for 
seven minutes much longer than the average tourist 
seidensticker said bats are not mice with wings they are 
bats and people shouldnt be afraid of them 
they actually are nice fun incredible animals he says 
theyre great little guys 
keeper carol prima who wears a batman baseball cap says the 
bats have never bothered her theyre not aggressive she said 
if anything theyre just curious 
they hover watchfully while she scrubs the cave walls or 
delivers their meals the bats three species of fruit eaters 
consume 30 pounds of grapes melons bananas and a gruel of peach 
nectar and vitamins every day 
the rest of the time they fly back and forth socialize in their 
harems and just hang out or more precisely hang down they 
also have active sex lives 
theyre continuously producing babies seidensticker says 
ms prima says shes never felt threatened working in the bat 
cave 
they never touch me and theyve never flown into my hair 
she said they keep their distance they know youre there but 
they arent interested in coming near you they arent accepting 
you as a bat 
theres no need to fear these little guys she says 
although some visitors have been seen anxiously sprinting past the 
bat cave without a glance 
the publics most frequently asked question says seidensticker 
is wheres the batmobile

action on capitol hill reaches a frenzied 
level this week as lawmakers seek to pass a flurry of money bills 
grapple with how much to spend on the stealth bomber and clear 
other legislative tangles before going on summer vacation 
leading the agenda in both the house and senate is legislation 
laying out pentagon spending priorities for the coming year 
president bush will be lobbying house members against an effort to 
either freeze production of the b2 bomber known as the stealth 
because of its radareluding capabilities or cut the number to be 
built from eight per year to two 
meanwhile a house subcommittee is pushing ahead with its 
investigation of the scandal at the department of housing and urban 
development the house government operations housing subcommittee 
summoned lynda murphy a former career hud employee to testify 
today about dealings with her friend deborah gore dean a former 
top hud official 
the administration contends that the stealth bomber built to 
penetrate soviet airspace is a key to future us nuclear 
deterrence but members of congress wrestling with serious deficit 
problems are shocked at its cost more than half a billion dollars 
each 
also to be fought is the perennial debate over how much to 
devote to the administrations star wars strategic defense 
initiative and how much money to give to railmobile mx missiles 
versus the singlewarhead midgetman 
at the same time the house is seeking to complete work on the 
13 basic spending bills needed to run the government in the next 
fiscal year which begins oct 1 congress also is pushing ahead on 
legislation from child care to clean air and budget cuts 
ms dean was executive assistant to former hud secretary samuel 
pierce but numerous witnesses have described her as almost a 
surrogate cabinet member who was heavily involved in funneling 
department money to wellplaced republicans 
miss dean has chosen to take the fifth amendment and we very 
much hope that she will change her mind said subcommittee 
chairman tom lantos dcalif but we will need to get at her 
role if shes unprepared to testify through individuals who had 
close contact with her 
on tuesday the house judiciary committee plans to hold a 
drafting session to deal with responses to last months supreme 
courts decision that burning the american flag is a protected form 
of political expression 
the panels subcommittee on constitutional rights completed 
hearings last week on the issue congress is divided over whether 
to seek a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration or to 
address the matter through a simple change in the law 
after working behind closed doors most of last week house and 
senate negotiators on a 166 bailout plan for the savings and loan 
industry will meet tuesday with hopes of nailing down a final 
package 
the major remaining disagreement is how to raise the 50 billion 
needed immediately to cover the loss of federally insured deposits 
in some 500 sampls at or near insolvency because of poor and often 
fraudulent lending 
president bush and the senate want to raise the money through 
30year private bonds in order to prevent the bailout from swelling 
the federal deficit the house and democrats would borrow the money 
directly through the treasury but exempt the amount from annual 
deficit reduction targets 
the senate judiciary committee could vote as early as thursday 
on the nomination of william c lucas to be bushs assistant 
attorney general for civil rights at the justice department 
the black former sheriff of wayne county michigan is opposed 
by many civil rights groups for lack of experience but bush 
contends he will be a tough enforcer of antidiscrimination laws 
and the house ways and means committee continues work on a tax 
bill with members apparently divided almost down the middle on a 
proposal favored by bush to reduce taxes on capital gains 
the panel also will try to find a way to change the surtax that 
finances the catastrophic health insurance program for older 
americans higher income retirees who pay most of the cost of the 
program have been lobbying the committee to spread the cost among 
all taxpayers not just older citizens

a new federally funded study on 8000 women 
office workers aims to resolve persistent questions over whether 
video display terminals can harm the health of people who use them 
rep ted weiss dny whose house government operations 
subcommittee has held hearings on vdts said the twoyear 2 
million study by mount sinai school of medicine in new york is long 
overdue 
weiss said he had urged the us public health service for 
several years to fund research that could determine whether vdts 
cause serious harm especially for pregnant women who use them 
they have been terribly slow to respond partly due to 
encouragement by several large corporations to avoid this kind of 
research he said meanwhile the potential harm has increased 
dramatically as the number of vdt users has multiplied 
weiss calls the mount sinai epidemiological study being funded 
by the national institute of child health and human development a 
unit of the national institutes of health an important first 
step toward resolving the health issue 
the study comes in the wake of a report issued last month by the 
congressional office of technology assessment saying more research 
is needed to explore the potential health risks of power frequency 
electromagnetic fields particularly their effects on the nervous 
system and possible role in promoting cancer 
the ota report said that while most public concern has focused 
on highvoltage transmission lines more attention should be paid 
to exposure to such fields from other sources such as household and 
office wiring appliances and other electrical equipment including 
vdts 
it is now clear that 60 hz cycles per second and other low 
frequency electromagnetic fields can interact with individual cells 
and organs to produce biological changes it said the nature 
of these interactions is subtle and complex the implications of 
these interactions for public health remain unclear but there are 
legitimate reasons for concern 
michele marcus the mount sinai studys principal investigator 
said it will be conducted in four cities new york boston 
cleveland and an as yet undetermined city in california both union 
and nonunion workplaces will be included 
dr marcus said a major difference between the mount sinai 
project and previous epidemiological studies in this country is 
that in addition to gathering healthhistory data through 
questionnaires we are going to be looking at reproductive 
effects prospectively that is were going to be following women 
forward in time 
well be identifying their exposure or their use of video 
display terminals and then seeing whether or not they get pregnant 
and following the course of the pregnancy she said 
sen albert gore jr dtenn chairman of the senate commerce 
subcommittee on science technology and space said there are 
still many unanswered questions about the potential health effects 
of vdts and of electromagnetic fields generally but there is no 
longer any doubt that this form of radiation can cause some 
biochemical changes 
the decision by nih to support mount sinais study is an 
important step but more is needed gore said government must 
expand its research program and do more to ensure that private 
industry is preparing solutions should the evidence warrant it 
also welcoming the study was rep joseph m gaydos dpa 
chairman of the house education and labor subcommittee on health 
and safety which plans to hold further hearings on the vdt issue 
early next year 
i am concerned about the health hazards faced by office 
workers especially those who use video display terminals for long 
periods of time during the working day gaydos said

americans by nearly a 21 margin are inclined to 
oppose antiabortion candidates for their state legislatures and to 
support legal abortion in their states a national poll has found 
as lawmakers across the country prepare to take up new abortion 
laws 38 percent of respondents to the media generalassociated 
press poll said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate 
who firmly opposes abortion 
the same number said abortion wouldnt matter much in their 
vote while the smallest group about two in 10 said they would 
be more apt to vote for a candidate who took a strong antiabortion 
position 
moreover 63 percent of the 1163 adults polled said they would 
want abortion to be legal in their state if the us supreme court 
reversed its 1973 ruling that made abortion a constitutional right 
and let each state make its own abortion laws 
that support for legal abortion was up slightly from 57 percent 
in an mgap poll in march similarly support for the 1973 ruling 
in the roe vs wade case was up to 59 percent from 53 percent 
while those increases were within the polls margin of error 
similar movement in several questions indicated a slight rise in 
prochoice opinion since the high court decision july 3 that 
permitted states to increase restrictions on abortion 
the new survey conducted july 716 had a margin of error of 
plus or minus three percentage points 
while most respondents expressed general support for legal 
abortion they were split on specific restrictions permitted in the 
recent supreme court ruling among those findings 
sixtyfive percent said abortions at public hospitals should be 
legal but that fell to 51 percent when respondents were asked 
specifically about abortions that are not required to save the 
mothers life the supreme court said states can ban such abortions 
from public hospitals 
respondents split about evenly on whether it should be legal 
for public health employees to perform or assist in abortions the 
court said that too can be barred by the states when the mothers 
life is not at risk 
respondents strongly supported mandatory preabortion tests to 
see if fetuses that are at least 20 weeks old can survive outside 
the womb with 62 percent in favor the high court said such tests 
can be required 
by 5438 percent with 8 percent undecided respondents said it 
should be legal to use public funds to counsel women about the 
availability of abortion the court left that issue undecided 
overall 48 percent said they opposed the july 3 ruling 43 
percent favored it and 9 percent were unsure that was a split in 
opinion given the margin of error 
as in previous polls general questions on abortion produced 
divided views reflecting public discomfort with an issue that pits 
the rights of pregnant women with concern for their fetuses 
sixtyseven percent said a woman should be allowed to have an 
abortion if she wants one and her doctor agrees to it 25 percent 
said not and 8 percent were undecided on the other hand 42 
percent said they would support a constitutional amendment to ban 
most abortions fiftythree percent opposed such an amendment and 
the rest were undecided 
younger more educated and wealthier people were more apt to 
support legal abortion as were residents of the northeast and the 
west and bigcity dwellers people who called themselves 
conservatives were far more likely to oppose abortion just 42 
percent of conservatives supported the 1973 ruling compared with 
66 percent of moderates and 80 percent of liberals

interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent 
birthday a random phenomenon

sample the poll has a threepoint margin of error meaning that 19 
of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if 
every adult american were asked the same questions the error 
margin is larger for subgroups it is five points for people who 
called themselves conservatives for example

when it comes to teaching medical 
students about mental illness don fidler doesnt go by the book 
he makes movies 
a lot of the videotapes i make are designed to make people 
feel like they really are in the patients shoes said fidler an 
adolescent psychiatrist at chestnut ridge hospital and an associate 
professor of psychiatry at west virginia university 
like what does it feel like to be psychotic the audience 
gets confused they really begin to take on some of the feelings 
that are being portrayed 
fidler 40 has produced more than 100 features since he began 
using videotapes as a teaching tool a decade ago while at the 
university of north carolina at chapel hill 
about half are for sale to medical schools throughout the 
country the videos range from 8 minutes to two hours in length and 
cost from 50 to 1200 
a year and a half ago fidler began working on a new educational 
series called medicine playhouse at west virginia each episode 
presents an emotional medical or philosophical problem typically 
faced by health professionals 
a questionandanswer session with an expert in the field is 
held after each show 
its sort of a lake wobegone approach to medical education 
fidler said referring to the mythical place made famous by 
humorist garrison keillor on his radio show a prairie home 
companion 
students say the videos are a good learning tool 
its much more helpful for a medical student to observe a 
patient said kellie gooding 24 a thirdyear student at the 
medical school 
it stays in your mind much longer if you can actually see a 
schizophrenic or whatever rather than just reading about it you 
might just remember something a couple of days if you read it if 
you see it on the screen you might remember it for the rest of 
your life 
the videos show a really comprehensive picture said sloane 
blair 23 also a thirdyear student it shows you as it is 
real people in real life in a book they would break a subject 
down into one component and then another 
some of the videotapes fidler said make medical students 
squirm 
in one video shot in blackandwhite and titled simply 
depression a loud clock ticks in the background as cameras 
close in from different angles on the troubled face of an actor 
its just 15 minutes long but it seems like it runs for an 
eternity fidler said ive had people actually come up and 
tell me they feel suicidal after watching it even though the word 
is never mentioned 
in another called paranoia a man grows more and more 
anxious as passengers riding on a city bus turn around in their 
seats and begin staring at him 
he admits his videos may not be right for everyone 
about 10 or 15 percent of the students dont learn well using 
the videotapes fidler said theyd be better off with books or 
a lecture some people just arent good visual learners 
but thats ok i dont think many lectures in medical school 
reach 85 percent of the students he said

a prospective us levy on imports of 
unprocessed fresh chilled and frozen pork from canada could add 
further to a growing number of live hogs coming across the border 
according to an agriculture department analysis 
last week the commerce department ruled in a final 
determination that canadas pork is being subsidized the ruling 
now goes to the us international trade commission which has 45 
days to decide whether the imports are hurting american hog farmers 
if the commission agrees with the commerce ruling the bureau of 
customs will be ordered to collect countervailing duties on imports 
of canadian pork to offset the benefits of the subsidies 
the commerce investigation did not include processed or 
preserved pork products such as canned hams bacon sausage or 
ground pork countervailing duties have been levied on imports of 
live hogs from canada the past four years 
overall the united states is the worlds largest pork importer 
with about 114 billion pounds carcass weight equivalent imported 
last year approximately 7 percent of us consumption according 
to the departments economic research service 
canada supplied almost 45 percent of the 1988 pork imports 
denmark 29 percent and poland 11 percent the remainder comes 
mainly from other eastern european countries 
pork imports during the first four months of this year totaled 
about 333 million pounds down 17 percent from januaryapril 1988 
the report said imports from canada and denmark were 
substantially below the yearearlier level while shipments 
from eastern europe were up slightly 
canadian hog and pork prices remain below last year which has 
encouraged domestic consumption and diverted some supply from the 
export market the report said despite nearrecord yearago 
hog slaughter canadian statistics indicate that total exports of 
pork through the end of may were about 8 percent below 1988 
levels 
earlier this year there was a wide spread between western 
canadian hog prices and us prices the report said that provided 
a strong incentive for western canadian producers to ship live hogs 
to the us market 
the spread narrowed in april and imports of live hogs from 
canada declined to less than half of their march level but still 
were 18 percent more than a year earlier 
hog imports from all sources for the januaryapril period 
totaled 475845 head the report said that was 125 percent above 
the same period in 1988 
canadian production this year is expected to be down about 2 
percent from 1988 because of herd liquidations prompted by lower 
hog prices 
the addition of a countervailing duty deposit on fresh 
chilled and frozen pork imports from canada is expected to 
reinforce the existing shift towards imports of canadian hogs 
the report said 
shayle d shagam an economist in the usda agency said in 
another report that the world pork trade is small relative to total 
production and that a handful of countries are involved 
china is the largest pork producer accounting for almost a 
third of the worlds total last year but the countrys huge 
population requires most of the production shagam said last year 
china was the fourth largest pork exporter with live hogs and pork 
going to hong kong and frozen pork to eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
on an individual country basis the united states is the second 
largest pork producer but ranks fourth when the 12nation european 
economic community and eastern europe are included 
as well as being the leading pork importer the united states is 
sixth in the world as an exporter japan is the biggest market for 
us pork mexico is another large buyer 
canada ranks seventh in the world as a pork producer turning 
out much more than it requires domestically shagam said exports 
currently are about 22 percent of canadas production almost 90 
percent goes to the united states and 9 percent to japan canada 
was third as an exporter last year 
as a result of large domestic pork supplies imports by the 
united states will remain fairly steady with canada increasing its 
relative share of the market shagam said 
but shagam added that the mix between hogs and pork from canada 
will depend on relative wage rates in the meatpacking industry and 
us countervailing duties on imports from there

an overwhelming majority of colleges and 
universities are trying to attract and retain more minority 
students but few of their efforts are bearing fruit says a new 
report on campus trends 1989 
eight in 10 administrators responding to a survey by the 
american council on education reported either a lot or some 
activity toward those goals on their campuses but only one in four 
said minority enrollment had increased in the 198889 school year 
we obviously would rather see more progress said elaine 
elkhawas an ace vice president and author of the report its 
encouraging that theres a tremendous level of activity but the 
actual results fall short 
ace surveyed senior academic administrators at 366 colleges and 
universities for its sixth annual campus trends report other 
findings showed that faculty shortages and inadequate physical 
facilities are pressing concerns on campus 
many of the questions on minorities were based on 
recommendations from a recent ace publication called minorities 
on campus a handbook for enhancing diversity 
only 25 percent of the administrators said their enrollment of 
blacks hispanics and asians had risen during 198889 and only 10 
percent reported an increase in american indian students 
the same proportion of institutions reported they were making 
special efforts to increase minority faculty members but only 17 
percent said they offer incentives to academic departments to hire 
minorities and only 25 percent reported a net gain in minority 
faculty over the previous year 
while some studies have predicted overall faculty shortages in 
the mid1990s elkhawas said her survey found that the problem 
already exists 
half of the administrators reported it is taking longer to find 
qualified people for fulltime faculty positions half also said 
they are having greater difficulty getting top applicants to accept 
positions when they are offered up from 25 percent in 1987 
specifically four in 10 institutions reported problems finding 
qualified fulltime computer science professors one in three cited 
similar problems for business mathematics and health professions 
each were mentioned by one in four schools 
the labor market for faculty is tightening right now said 
elkhawas the real dilemmas for colleges are going to be 
starting much sooner than 1995 
elkhawas attributed the problem to a number of factors among 
them an inadequate number of doctorate holders an increasing 
number of phds going into private industry a greater proportion 
of doctoral degrees earned by foreigners accelerating retirement 
of faculty members and expanding student enrollment 
more than 71 percent of the administrators in the survey 
reported increased overall enrollment in the 198889 school year 
and half said the size of their fulltime faculty had grown half 
also said they expect the pace of retirement among fulltime 
faculty to accelerate in the next few years 
the result is bound to be a highly competitive situation 
elkhawas said with universities offering incentives to keep 
people from retiring higher salaries to people in certain fields 
and lures designed to attract professors from other universities 
class size may also increase she said 
other findings 
only 32 percent of the administrators felt their physical plant 
was excellent or very good another third said plant renovation and 
renewal will be a significant problem in the next five years and 
more than half predicted their facilities will not be adequate to 
last the next decade 
about half of the administrators said they believe assessments 
of student learning mandated in large part by states will 
significantly improve undergraduate education but 37 percent 
said that so far the process has resulted mainly in new reporting 
requirements to the state 
basic skills testing is in place at 65 percent of schools and 
another 19 percent are planning such tests 
half of the colleges and universities now assess writing and 27 
percent report that writing assessment is in the planning stages 
close to half of the schools plan to assess students critical 
thinking skills and 14 percent already do so 
ace is the umbrella group for the nations colleges and 
universities its campus trends survey was adjusted to reflect the 
countrys 2500 general institutions of higher education 
seminaries art schools standalone graduate schools and other 
specialized institutions were not included the margin of error for 
the survey was 2 percent

nelson bunker hunt says hes trying to forget 
the spring of 1980 when his silverbuying binge crashed to an end 
and began unraveling one of the worlds greatest fortunes 
he used to be in the oil business in ranching and farming he 
told us tax court judge jules g korner iii lately its 
hiring lawyers and defending lawsuits 
the hunt brothers tax case begins its third week today and is 
expected to last about a month 
bunker hunt is contesting 155 million in 1982 taxes the 
internal revenue services says are owed from the dissolution of a 
partnership set up to pay off the brothers debts 
his brother william herbert is contesting more than 158 million 
in 1982 taxes while younger brother lamar owner of the kansas 
city chiefs football team is contesting 505377 in taxes 
bunker testified friday i dont go around trying to remember 
what happened in the spring of 1980 it caused me tremendous 
losses it caused me tax problems 
banks once eager to lend him money were trying to get their 
arms around as much collateral as possible he said to the 
point of demanding pictures on the wall and even his brothers 
rolex watch 
hunt told the court he could not recall whether one document he 
signed was five or 5000 pages long or whether he signed a 
promissory note for 272 million after silver thursday the day in 
late march 1980 when silver prices collapsed 
bunker and herbert owned onethird of the worlds supply of 
silver bullion from a silvershopping spree that began in 1973 
government attorneys claim 
as the price tumbled to 10 an ounce from 50 an ounce the 
brothers found themselves with debts totaling as much as 2 billion 
and creditors threatening the familys beloved placid oil co 
bank creditors dictated the terms of the partnership with 
placid set up to repay the hunt brothers debts from their soured 
silver investments he said 
the net effect was we didnt have control over our business 
thats why im sitting here in court because of the structure the 
banks put us in hunt said 
since then bunker herbert and placid have filed for protection 
from creditors in us bankruptcy court bunker and herbert have 
been accused of attempting to corner the silver market by the 
commodity futures trading commission and a jury in new york last 
year found bunker herbert and two others had conspired to 
manipulate and monopolize the silver market and defraud investors 
bunker the first of the brothers to testify in the nonjury 
trial recalled one day after silver thursday when he signed 
documents while surrounded by attorneys 
i signed documents for three or four hours just as fast as i 
could he said there must have been thousands and thousands of 
documents i signed they would probably go to the ceiling of this 
room here if they were stacked up end to end 
bunker said he remembers walter fraker placids vice president 
and chief financial officer telling him that the banks were 
calling all the shots it was pretty much their party as they set 
up the partnership to repay the silver loans

like scouts in major league baseball a 
pair of house democrats are looking for talent to keep their team 
winning atop capitol hill 
but figuring out which potential congressional candidates might 
get a contract from the voters is a tricky task of balancing the 
facts such as money with the intangibles appearance and that 
hungry look 
rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee and rep mike synar dokla the 
committees recruiting chairman met this weekend with potential 
candidates in rhode island and new hampshire the two targeted 
congressional districts democrats say they might take from the gop 
in 1988 democrats in the house picked up seats despite the big 
gop win on the presidential level we outhustled and we 
outrecruited the republican party in terms of candidates said 
synar 
on their first trip of the 1990 cycle the democrats task 
wasnt finding the potential candidates it was looking for which 
one was most likely to win 
in rhode island anthony and synar met with four democrats 
interested in trying to unseat freshman rep ronald machtley 
rri who beat longtime incumbent democrat fernand st germain 
after st germains personal finances became the subject of a 
federal probe 
they consider machtley a fluke and the national democrats want 
to mount a strong challenge in 1990 
party rules dont allow the national democrats to take sides in 
a primary so they cant handpick their candidate but they can 
pressure the locals to unite behind a candidate 
scott wolf who nearly beat st germain in the primary last year 
told anthony and synar he was in the race state reps rene 
lafayette and jeff teitz said they also were lookin as did rhode 
island secretary of state kathleen connell 
in separate meetings with each anthony and synar tried to learn 
about the public skills and personal drive of the candidate 
what would get you into it 
how much money can you raise by the end of the year 
what do you think of other democratic candidate 
they ask about local issues and how the national party can help 
and dole out advice 
you realize the easiest way to clear the field is to have the 
money synar tells one and eventually he warns that may 
involve something like mortgaging ones home to stay in the race 
the two congressmen repeated the process in manchester in new 
hampshires first congressional district there incumbent 
republican bob smith has announced for the senate and democrats say 
theyve got a good shot 
wed love to have a toehold up here said anthony new 
hampshire is the only new england state with no democrats in the 
house or senate 
again the democrats would like to avoid a costly and divisive 
primary but it appears one is down the road 
conservative democrat bob stephen a state senator and 
manchester restaurateur has already formed an exploratory campaign 
committee joe keefe an attorney and moderate who lost to smith 
last year says hes in it too 
and two others are looking former state party chairman george 
bruno and stockbroker and party activist jim demers who ran in 
1986 
if all of us go at it i dont think the seat is 
winnable warns bruno urging the national officials to do what 
they can to help avoid a primary

every working day alexander s 
kutlakhmetov boards an orange bus with six shoulderhigh wheels 
that carries him and other miners 43 miles across the rolling 
siberian plateau to the taldinski severni open pit mine 
on friday kutlakhmetov known as sasha boarded the bus for the 
first time in more than a week he sped off to explain to other 
miners the details of a 35point agreement that ended the first 
soviet industrial strike in 60 years 
lurching along the bumpy thinly asphalted road that links city 
and mine the bus passed birch aspen and pine forests tiny 
settlements of log cabins with carved wooden trims and kitchen 
gardens small herds of goats and cows and an occasional horse 
could be seen in the lanes 
as the sun rose slowly burning off a thick morning mist the 
bus arrived at the pits brick headquarters and the miners began 
to slap each others shoulders in greeting and discuss the 
agreement that ended their unprecedented strike 
sasha stepped up to the landing and waving the agreement began 
to explain 
do we get three years maternity leave shouted one woman 
who worked in the mine offices 
thats in there replied sasha 
what about the time it takes us to get here on the bus 
shouted a man 
well get paid from the time we check in but not for 
commuting said sasha 
the session continued for a half hour as miners asked about 
grievances that were advanced at taldinski severni but may or may 
not have been included in the demands of the strike committee 
formed the week before for the kuznetsk coal basin the countrys 
second largest coalproducing region 
at last the workers were satisfied that if they had not won 
every point they had at least seized the right to strike a right 
not guaranteed by soviet law they beamed with newfound confidence 
its a victory over the system that weve had in the soviet 
union for the past 70 years a system in which we work hard but get 
little in return said pyotr a menayev an engineer 
another miner viktor n sizikov agreed that it was a victory 
but it would have been a bigger victory if we had continued the 
strike 
sensitive to the doubts of miners like sizikov the regional 
strike committee renamed itself the workers committee and remained 
in session to pressure authorities to keep the bargain 
if they dont we go back on strike thats in the 
agreement said kutlakhmetov 
mine managers who backed most of the strike demands were 
pleased at the most import government concession allowing mines 
to form local assocations that will have a greater say in running 
the industry which remains under the general control of the coal 
mining ministry 
it is better to be master in your own house said viktor g 
shevnin the main production engineer at the mine the strike 
will improve our lives and the agreement will move us closer to 
real economic independence 
the miners still skeptical of the governments intention of 
keeping the deal boarded the bus once again to drive the final few 
miles to the pit 
deep down in the crater valery e demski clambered into the 
cabin of a giant crane and began using the controls to scoop small 
mountains of coal into oversize dump trucks resuming delivery of 
fuel to the state 
we got little concrete said demski as he operated the 
shovel maybe there will be more 
another worker in the crane cabin yuri v gorlov nodded his 
head and said it was right to strike

more than 80 of the dead in the 19month 
uprising against israeli rule are palestinians killed by their own 
people and arab against arab violence is growing as the revolt 
drags on without a political resolution 
why are palestinians killing palestinians 
most of those killed were accused of being informers or 
otherwise collaborating with israel but some palestinian sources 
say political battles over the direction of the intefadeh or 
uprising have turned violent and bred threats car burnings and 
even murder 
israeli officials claim the slayings support their position that 
the plo fosters terrorism but palestinian sources say at least 
some of the violence is by radicals challenging plo chief yasser 
arafats calls for restraint 
for whatever reason the tempo has accelerated from the start 
of the uprising in december 1987 to the end of last year 22 
palestinians were killed by fellow arabs so far this year at 
least 61 have been slain 
in addition to those slayings the deaths of at least 518 
palestinians have been attributed to israeli soldiers or civilians 
thirtyeight israelis have also been killed 
the uprising aimed at ending israels 22year occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip has employed brute force against 
uncooperative palestinians from its first days even as clashes 
raged between the territories residents and the israeli army 
those who challenged the uprisings efforts to break ties with 
israel were threatened beaten and sometimes had their cars or 
houses set ablaze 
often the political message was clear 
after the plobacked leaders of the uprising called for 
palestinians to stop working as police for the military government 
a arab policeman was stabbed to death in jericho 
his body wrapped in a palestinian flag was dumped on his 
mothers doorstep shortly thereafter several hundred arab 
policemen quit their jobs 
hassan tawil appointed mayor of the west bank town of elbireh 
by israel after it deposed the elected mayor has survived a 
stabbing attack his house was set afire during the uprising he 
now employs bodyguards 
the motives for some murders seem religious or moral especially 
in attacks by the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal a 
nonplo group that has targeted drug dealers and prostitutes 
in other cases motives have been cloudy palestinians say a 
victim was a collaborator while army officials saying he was 
killed in criminal or family feuds palestinians say some of those 
slain were simply thugs who sold their services to anyone 
including israel 
while palestinians have maintained the targets were those who 
thwarted the revolt for selfish reasons some actions have had 
political purposes 
arafat issued a public death threat to mayor elias freij of 
bethlehem after freij suggested suspending the uprising as a signal 
to encourage israeli compromise 
in the west bank city of nablus masked men have twice visited 
and threatened local palestinians who met israeli officials to 
discuss the israeli proposal for elections in the occupied 
territories as a step toward peace 
however the plo announced recently from its headquarters in 
tunis that it approved of the meetings and was getting reports from 
palestinians who were taking part 
signs of disunity surfaced in may with arson attacks on cars of 
wellknown plo supporters in ramallah and nablus and the murder of 
a village leader of arafats fatah plo faction at yaabed in the 
west bank 
plo supporters deny that rifts among palestinians have exploded 
into violence blaming the trouble on collaborators or attempts by 
israel to foster disunity 
one wellplaced source speaking privately derided plo claims 
that the internal debate was not turning violent he said both the 
recent car burnings and the slaying of the fatah leader in yaabed 
village were evidence of a split in arafats own faction 
the victim he said was a plo treasurer who rejected a fatah 
rebels demand for money to escalate the revolt two days later 
the treasurer was found slain outside the village mosque 
the source said the split over tactics reflected both 
differences among plo officials abroad and resentment by plo 
leaders in the villages and refugee camps that have been the real 
battleground of the uprising 
he said many local leaders spent years in prison for 
antiisraeli activities but see the real power for guiding the 
uprising still held by traditional ruling palestinian families in 
arab east jerusalem 
israeli officials have pointed to the dissent and violence among 
palestinians as evidence that arafat is using murder as a weapon to 
rein in those who would be willing to cast off plo leadership and 
accept israels peace initiative 
palestinians deny this charge they note that israel has failed 
to produce one specific case of this type of political murder

the number of aids cases in the united states 
has hit the 100000 mark 
the report for the 100000th recorded case some time in recent 
weeks became part of the data files at centers for disease 
controls where the cumulative number of us aids cases is 
tabulated 
when the monthly total for july is released in late august cdc 
experts are sure that americas official count of total aids cases 
will for the first time officially pass 100000 
many experts have admitted that the aids case total is more of a 
rough estimate than a precise count but the official total 
emphasizes that the dreadful statistical march of aids has not 
retreated or slowed 
by 1992 the cdc expects there will be a cumulative total of 
365000 confirmed cases of aids the agency also predicts that 
within three years the total number of us residents killed by 
aids will reach 263000 
aids is a contagious disease that destroys immune cells and

current system these costs are expected to reach 13 percent of gnp

mexico and its creditor banks finally agree on 
the key points of a debtreduction package providing the first 
victory for the bush administrations effort to ease the 13 
trillion third world debt burden 
the agreement announced late sunday night ended two days of 
intense talks at the us treasury department where mexican 
officials and us bankers were joined by treasury secretary 
nicholas brady and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
in the final package negotiators representing the commercial 
banks agreed to choose from three options for providing assistance 
they can cut the principal on the old loans by 35 percent reduce 
the interest rate they are charging to 625 percent or provide new 
loans to mexico 
us officials predicted that the debtrelief package could 
slash by up to onethird the 45 billion mexico is paying annually 
to service the 54 billion it owes to commercial banks 
however officials said the exact amount of debt relief will not 
be known for some time because each of mexicos creditor banks must 
decide on its own the extent to which it will participate in the 
plan 
still the agreement signified the first tangible result for the 
bush administrations debtreduction plan which was unveiled by 
brady on march 10 the strategy seeks to provide various incentives 
for commercial banks to voluntarily reduce the amount of third 
world debt they hold 
brady who had lobbied intensely for the final agreement hailed 
the package as a major step forward in the implementation of 
the debtreduction effort 
the administration had made mexico the testcase for the brady 
plan believing that an agreement with the developing worlds 
secondlargest debtor would establish precedents for deals with 
other countries 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari went on nationwide 
television sunday night to praise the final package saying 
mexico has opened the way for other nations with similar 
problems 
salinas said the debt reduction plan answered the cry of 
mexicans to return to growth but he cautioned mexican citizens 
dont look for spectacular results overnight 
the bush administration had hoped to have a completed mexican 
debt plan to present to the sevennation economic summit last week 
in paris but even without a deal the final summit communique 
included a strong endorsement of the approach 
in an effort to break the stalemate brady brought the 
negotiators to washington on saturday and sunday to resolve the 
remaining issues 
salinas described the final talks as difficult complex and 
tense mexico had begun the discussions demanding that the banks 
cut mexicos debt by 55 percent 
others participating in the final round of negotiations were 
mexican finance minister pedro aspe and john reed chairman of 
citicorp and head of the 15bank committee which bargains for the 
hundreds of banks to which mexico owes money 
in a joint statement from the mexican government and the banks 
the two sides said they had reached agreement on the main points of 
the financing package with the expectation that it would be 
accepted by mexicos approximately 500 creditor banks worldwide 
the debt reduction options include slashing the principal on old 
loans by 35 percent or reducing the interest rate banks receive to 
625 percent 
banks taking either of these options would be able to get 
guarantees against default on the remaining debt from the 
151nation international monetary fund or its sister organization 
the world bank 
the joint statement estimated that 7 billion will be available 
from the international lending organizations and other sources 
including japan to support the debtreduction and interestrate 
reduction efforts for mexico 
in conjunction with the mexican agreement brady said the united 
states is willing to provide up to 2 billion in shortterm 
financing to mexico to tide the country over until the new loans 
begin arriving later this year he said other countries would help 
in providing this bridge loan 
officials said one of the final issues resolved sunday night 
involved a readjustment clause that would increase debt 
payments once the mexican economy rebounds 
one official who spoke on condition that his name not be used 
said both sides agreed to tie increased debt payments to any 
improvements in mexicos export sales after the year 1996 
according to the joint statement mexico also agreed to provide 
opportunities for the banks to exchange about 1 billion of debt 
annually for ownership of factories and other direct investments in 
mexico under a process known as a debtforequity swap 
the 54 billion owed to private banks represents about half of 
mexicos 107 billion foreign debt the second largest in the 
developing world after brazils

more than a year after former gov evan mecham 
was driven from office in disgrace he casts a shadow over arizona 
politics as he campaigns to regain his old job 
mechams conservative ideas dominate the republican agenda and 
his successor democratic gov rose mofford has been unable to 
marshal support in her own party or win battles with the gop 
majority in the legislature 
mecham was elected in 1986 in a threeway race he got just 40 
percent of the vote that inspired a law requiring the governor to 
receive at least 50 percent of the vote 
some mecham supporters admit he would have trouble winning a 
clear majority but they say he may have enough solid support to 
overcome any moderate republican opponent in the primary 
that leaves many republicans in a quandary what theyd really 
like said freshman state sen jerry gillespie is somebody with 
mechams philosophy but not his cantankerousness at least as hes 
been portrayed 
mecham whose only opponent so far is millionaire developer j 
fife symington iii exudes confidence about the september 1990 
primary and the general election that follows 
im going to win the cottonpicking election he said you 
can mark that on the wall if you wish 
the blunttalking 65yearold auto dealer with four failed 
gubernatorial campaigns behind him stunned arizona republicans with 
his 1986 victory 
from the start he demonstrated a remarkable ability to offend 
many groups in his first month in office he rescinded the states 
martin luther king jr holiday questioning the civil rights 
leaders stature and saying that former gov bruce babbitt had 
lacked the authority to decree the holiday 
mecham also endorsed a book that characterized blacks as 
pickaninnies stated that a political enemy was spying on him 
with laser beams and was reported to have associates with criminal 
records 
he was impeached in february 1988 on charges of misusing a state 
protocol fund obstructing a probe into a death threat and 
concealing a developers 350000 campaign loan 
the senate convicted and ousted him two months later on the 
first two charges before voters could make their own decision in a 
recall election that had been scheduled for may the senate dropped 
the loan concealment charge and a jury subsequently acquitted him 
of wrongdoing 
mecham earlier this month challenged his impeachment and 
demanded the reinstatement of 570000 in expenses 
mecham was succeeded by mrs mofford who since 1975 had been 
secretary of state a largely ceremonial elected post similar to 
the lieutenant governor in other states 
mrs mofford enjoyed popularity and bipartisan support early on 
but she failed to get her way on several key issues during the 
legislative session that ended in june 
moderate republicans sided with conservatives in opposing 
mofford initiatives to increase taxes and spending instead cutting 
the states contribution to government pension funds 
mecham has advocated slashing taxes and state spending 
the legislature also defeated mrs moffords bid to restore the 
king holiday 
rose basically is still trying to find her sea legs said 
state rep peter goudinoff a university of arizona political 
science professor 
mrs mofford 67 said she will run for reelection although 
aides say she hasnt yet begun fundraising no other democratic 
candidate has announced 
the perfect candidate gillespie said would combine mechams 
conservatism with moffords geniality 
some sense the impeachment is unfinished business for many 
arizonans 
i think arizona needs to vote on the mecham situation said 
rep leslie johnson who cast one of the few votes against 
impeachment last year still she added we cannot allow any one 
person to be the issue of the campaign

the resources that were being sent outside the country can now 
be channeled into investment growth and creating jobs president 
carlos salinas de gortari said in a triumphant televised address 
sunday night 
mexicos total debt burden is estimated at 107 billion with 
54 billion owed to private banks and the agreement is expected 
to cut billions from the amount mexico has to pay to service its 
debt to the banks 
mexico got into trouble during the oil boom when developing 
nations and banks thought the price of oil would keep going up 
when the price crashed in 1982 mexico was suddenly left without 
enough money to make payments on the billions it had borrowed 
the result was six years of belttightening under the 
administration of president miguel de la madrid 
the government had to take harsh measures to get the money to 
make payments and that left little for development private 
companies too couldnt borrow money to invest in new plants or 
equipment 
mexicos economy slowed down and inflation went up to over 150 
percent annually some years the peso dropped like a brick against 
the dollar from eight to the dollar in the mid1970s to 2500 to 
the dollar today 
the average mexican paycheck lost about half its buying power 
the austerity affected everything from the peso to pollution 95 
percent of all cars in mexico city are more than five years old 
most bought before the crash 
every day we worked harder but we were worse off salinas 
said 
the country of 85 million was under additional social pressure 
because of demographics one million young people were entering the 
job market every year but the country had trouble creating even 
half that many jobs 
the pressure was also visible in the erosion of the governing 
institutional revolutionary partys power in last years 
presidential election salinas won with barely 50 percent of the 
vote the lowest margin in the history of a party that has given 
mexico 60 years of stable government 
some of the pressure was relieved by emigration which continues 
as one of many factors that gives the united states an interest in 
its southern neighbors stability 
mexico was able to argue that it deserved consideration from the 
banks because it had done everything asked by creditors and had 
worked hard to restructure its economy 
it joined the general agreement on tariffs and trade and stopped 
protecting its economy from foreign competition the idea which 
has been working was to reduce prices in mexico and make mexican 
industry more competitive on international markets 
salinas was careful to get president bush treasury secretary 
nicholas brady and institutions such as the world bank and the 
international monetary fund on board before tackling the private 
banks that were reluctant to write off billions in debt 
he also made dramatic crackdowns on corruption and the drug 
trafficking that had infuriated the united states 
in his speech salinas said that some of the money saved under 
the new agreement will go to building infrastructure roads dams 
communications that he hopes will lay the basis for an eventual 
growth rate of 6 percent a year 
economists say part of what mexico gains will go to buying back 
debt at a discount the rest can be used for investment in 
infrastructure that could prime the pump for the private sector 
with fewer payments to make the government will need to borrow 
less money putting less pressure on domestic credit markets and 
making more available for the private sector at lower rates 
more importantly salinas hopes increased confidence and the 
perception of victory will attract foreign investment and help 
bring back billions invested abroad by wealthy mexicans 
nevertheless salinas warned his countrymen economic recovery 
will not come overnight 
the agreement does not mean that by some magic trick our 
problems will cease to exist he said he promised firm guidance 
of the economy and honest management of the nations resources 
everybody must continue pushing productivity and maintaining 
order salinas said

when sousuke uno became prime minister on june 2 
he was widely expected to be a caretaker who with luck might serve 
until october while his scandalplagued party put together a 
political reform package 
his luck turned out to be very bad 
now he will go down in japanese postwar history as rivaling for 
shortness the twomonth tenure that prime minister tanzan ishibashi 
had from december 1956 to february 1957 
seldom has a respectable political career crumbled as fast as 
unos he was in office less than a week when a weekly newsmagazine 
published a former geishas allegation that he had paid her to be 
his mistress 
publishing the story broke a taboo about revealing details of 
politicians private affairs the 66yearold uno who is married 
was deeply embarrassed facing opposition questions in parliament as 
to whether he was suitable to represent japan abroad when his 
exmistress had complained in print about the way he had treated 
her 
it was about the last thing uno might have expected to happen to 
him 
elders in his liberal democratic party selected him to be prime 
minister because his experience as foreign minister would stand 
japan in good diplomatic stead he was clean of the bribery scandal 
that ruled out all the prime ministerial contenders in the party 
and otherwise uncontroversial 
but allegations against uno widened with publications finding 
other women who claimed sexual relations with him on june 28 
japanese papers reported that uno had asked party leaders to let 
him resign because of the embarrassment 
i didnt become prime minister because i wanted to uno was 
quoted as saying 
but he was persuaded to stay on he attended the summit of the 
worlds seven leading industrial democracies in paris in midjuly 
and led the liberal democrats into what became their worst 
electoral defeat in three decades in sundays voting for half the 
seats in the upper house of parliament 
unos woman problem as japanese media dubbed his personal 
scandal was one of many the liberal democrats faced in the 
election campaign they were distrusted because of the bribery 
scandal disliked because of a new sales tax imposed in april 
suspected because marketliberalization measures were seen 
threatening the livelihoods of farmers 
this morning uno was calm as he faced reporters and said he 
would leave office as soon as the party could replace him 
ultimate responsibility for the election defeat was his he 
said and he hoped the party would choose a new head promptly 
if that process as expected takes three or four weeks uno 
will not go down in history as beating ishibashis record for a 
short tenure but it will be a close call

christian lacroix maintaining his reputation as a 
young creator brought out a collection of fun fantasy lace and 
furs on the first day of haute couture showings for next winter 
as paris sweltered under a rare heatwave top couturiers on 
sunday unveiled their luxurious befurred and feathered models for 
cooler weather 
lacroixs pouf skirt finally ran out of steam but hes kept a 
taste for beautiful opulent fabrics and topheavy outfits full of 
quirky funny ideas 
hes a man who takes chances with these expensive fabrics and he 
usually wins though not always the applause after the show was 
tepid 
bernard arnault head of the agache financial consortium backing 
lacroix waffled when asked if the eccentric creative designer is 
still a hot moneymaker his clothes are beautiful thats all 
that counts he said 
lacroixs clothes with the draped fichu shoulder the big hoods 
or head scarves and collars over tiny skirts are great on the 
runway but perhaps not at every party no matter how splashy 
he used a lot of browns dolling up pinstriped jackets with 
draped satin fronts and sable cuffs sometimes teamed with a 
molecolored velvet skirt mixing up textures with abandon he put 
a tiny lame damasked bolero over a trapeze minidress in shades 
of mustard and burgundy with a quilted velvet panel on the skirt 
some of the luxury fantasy was hilarious till one tried to tote 
up the cost of the enormous sable parka topping chocolate shorts 
with braided silk cornrows flipping over them like a reggae singer 
gone wild a minifantasy well over 30000 
lacroixs violet jersey dress was a soothing contrast to all the 
showoff fabrics his little shortie flared coats in faille and 
satin were wearable there were wonderful moments like the long 
slinky carmine velvet coat with huge sparkling buttons worn over 
slimming pants embroidered with stars 
the brown and khaki silks were always topped up with lively 
shades of coral saffron turquoise or gold 
for evening lacroixs handpainted pink and green tulle 
ballerina fantasies and jeweled tunics looked like a midsummer 
nights dream of luxury other ballerina numbers were in rich red 
velvet and black always sparkling with touches of gold 
the dazzling jeweled boleros and jackets looked like a treasure 
trove of ali babas cave 
and after christian discovered his moms laceedged satin 
slipdress his versions of lace for the runway simply took off in 
a froth of glory 
the heavy guipure effects the lameembroidered dresses in 
khaki cream and gold the damasked and brocade dresses with 
pheasant or ostrichfeather trim harked back to the best of the 
negligee looks in the twenties and thirties but things were always 
a bit on the wild side a la christian lacroix 
japanese couturiere hanae mori celebrating 35 years in the 
fashion business and a new shop in paris showed beautifully 
crafted clothes with more workmanship than fantasy 
her fit and cut are always impeccable and the swirling 
redblackgreen harlequin coat over a pine green short sheath is 
anything but stodgy her fullskirted grey flannel suits with black 
velvet decor and the mori trademark butterfly pins should please 
her faithful regulars 
her true couture details like satin basketweaving basque 
waists in suits testified to her craftsmanship she was lavish 
with fancy fabrics but her lameflecked or sequinembroidered lace 
numbers were demure rather than daring 
the dresses that made one want to weep with joy were the chiffon 
prints in moris old style the featherlight chiffon print 
landscapes with the most delicate japanese prints of flowers trees 
and birds 
torrentes forte is showbiz and she wisely showed plenty of 
spangled numbers to look great onstage or at a gala dinner 
her three full long cashmere wraparound coats in emerald 
cardinal and rust looked light easy and warm her saffron fitted 
spencer jacket over an aubergine long slinky skirt is a good way 
of easing into evening 
and she went all out for lateday glitz a few jet embroidered 
dresses had discreet trains colorful patchwork jackets had fur or 
ostrichfeather cuffs the allsequined slink would be fine for 
midnight at las vegas easier to wear would be the tuxedos with big 
pearl pink satin lapels

all 106 opposition members in 
parliaments lower house resigned today saying a foreign arms deal 
that allegedly involved kickbacks had destroyed confidence in prime 
minister rajiv gandhis government 
they are demanding that gandhi step down and call new elections 
as deputies from deputies from gandhis congress party chanted 
shame shame the lawmakers from the 12 opposition parties 
handed their letters of resignation to speaker balram jakhar 
gandhi quietly looked on 
although opposition politicians have in the past boycotted 
entire sessions of parliament they had never resigned 
still gandhis party holds a solid majority in the 544member 
chamber and the oppositions departure likely will have no effect 
in a rare display of solidarity the usually fractious and 
unruly opposition on sunday announced its decision to resign 
citing an auditors report on inconsistencies in the 1986 purchase 
of artillery from a swedish firm 
by giving up their seats opposition leaders said they hoped 
the billiondollar deal would be a major issue in the next general 
election which gandhi must call by january 
never before has the office of the prime minister been brought 
into disrepute as under the present incumbent said vp singh 
leader of the peoples party we were all elected by the people 
and now we are going back to them for their verdict on this issue 
government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by sing 
who at that time served as finance minister in gandhis cabinet 
singh left the governing party in 1987 
as he left parliament singh denied any wrongdoing but added if 
anyone had proof they should prosecute me 
besides the peoples party the opposition parties include the 
indian peoples party the party of the telugus the two major 
communist parties and seven regional groups 
the rest of the seats are controlled by gandhis congress party 
and independents 
after the auditor generals report was released on tuesday 
opposition members in parliament shouted antigovernment slogans 
called gandhi a thief and demanded his resignation when he 
refused they walked out and stalled the proceeedings for three 
days 
the 14 billion deal has been a major scandal for gandhis 
government because of allegations that the swedish firm ab bofors 
paid kickbacks to secure the contract 
newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting to 
at least 50 million were paid to senior government officials and 
to congress party coffers the allegations have never been proved 
the report by the auditor general said the arms purchase was 
flawed on technical considerations and cost assessment 
opposition parties have been using the bofors issue to try to 
merge and mount a viable challenge to gandhi and the congress party 
in the general election but their efforts have stalled in 
squabbling and widelypublicized power struggles for nearly a year 
nt rama rao leader of the telugus party said the decision to 
resign from parliment proved the opposition could unite on major 
issues 
we are committed to give a clean government to the country 
he said

france the famed french cycling race he staged a miraculous 
comeback to win the 2020mile 23day race by the closest victory 
margin ever eight seconds over laurent fignon of france 
so its no surprise he was greeted by applause at the moulin 
rouge the famous nightclub 
the victory completed a dramatic recovery for lemond from 
misfortune suffered after he became the first american to prevail 
in cyclings most famous race in 1986 
in april 1987 he was accidentally shot by his brotherinlaw 
while hunting then he had an emergency appendectomy followed by 
shin surgery all of which made him miss the tour in 1987 and 1988 
he came back this year with low expectations 
one month ago i didnt think i would be in the top 10 top 
20 lemond said but through the race i got more confident 
confident enough to overcome fignons apparently insurmountable 
50second lead in the final stage a 15mile time trial from 
versailles to paris 
i went all out lemond said i didnt think i was going to 
win the worst thing i could have done was lose by a second the

recovery of five skeletons from a 
115yearold grave in deadmans gulch has given investigators new 
clues about the deaths of confessed cannibal alferd packers gold 
prospecting companions 
scientists removing the skeletal remains sunday found distinct 
scrape marks on bones from two of the skeletons indicating theyd 
been cut and scraped or defleshed said walter birkby curator 
of physical anthropology at the university of arizona 
there were punch marks in one bone which scientists said were 
probably made by a coyote eating the remains after the spring thaw 
of 1874 
on saturday they found a bullet hole in a right pelvic bone 
possible support for packers claim that one member of the party 
killed the other four and that packer shot that man in selfdefense 
packer emerged from the mountains in april 1874 but the remains 
of his companions werent found and buried until that august 
the packer project which includes forensic anthropologists a 
forensic pathologist and an expert on fibers and tool marks on 
bones packed the bones up sunday for detailed laboratory study and 
reconstruction 
they hope their work will determine whether one hatchet was used 
to kill four of the men and another was used on the fifth 
that would support packers story that shannon wilson bell 
killed the first four with a hatchet before packer killed bell in 
selfdefense shooting him in the stomach and hitting him on the 
head with a hatchet

enter san diego harbor went back to work today cutting away massive 
steel plates dangling from the ships hull 
three plates were severed over the weekend from the tanker that 
ran onto a reef in alaskas prince william sound march 24 and 
spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in the nations worst oil

tons and measuring 72 feet long and 68 feet across another cut 
sunday was 30 feet long and 35 feet across said exxon spokeswoman 
jan cool 
the plates wont be salvaged because they are too heavy ms 
cool said 
instead divers allowed them to fall 3000 feet to the ocean 
floor cool said 
some of the plates were hanging 90 feet below the surface and 
san diego bay is only about 40 feet deep in some spots 
the valdez was about 54 miles off san diego and six miles 
northeast of on san clemente island 
california officials worried about possible pollution have yet 
to reach agreement with exxon on terms governing the tankers

prime minister margaret thatcher summoned cabinet 
ministers for private interviews today ahead of what aides called 
changes aimed at halting her conservative governments slide in 
popularity 
a senior thatcher aide speaking on condition of anonymity said 
a freshening of the 22member cabinet would likely be announced 
this evening 
apart from the cabinet changes mrs thatcher appeared virtually 
certain to appoint a new chairman of her conservative party 
following a drubbing by socialists in june 15 elections for the 
european parliament 
speculation of an unexpected change increased after energy 
secretary cecil parkinson a thatcher favorite whose political 
career was interrupted after an extramarital liaison six years ago 
arrived today at her 10 downing st office 
parkinson who is married resigned from the cabinet in 1983 
after news broke that his secretary alleged to be his mistress 
was pregnant mrs thatcher reappointed him when she won a third 
successive fiveyear term in elections in june 1987 
also summoned today were education secretary kenneth baker a 
moderate in the mainly rightwing cabinet who is widely expected 
to replace the current conservative party chairman peter brooke 
and environment secretary nicholas ridley 
ridley chainsmoking scion of an aristocratic family was 
expected to become the new trade and industry secretary replacing 
lord young a noncareer politician who has said he wants to resume 
his business interests 
ridley accused by critics of mishandling the current passage 
through parliament of a controversial property tax is blamed by 
large sections of the party for increasing the governments current 
unpopularity 
but mrs thatcher who has the sole power to appoint cabinet 
ministers has publicly defended him 
changes in about 90 government posts which do not carry cabinet 
rank were expected tuesday 
mrs thatchers government has trailed the revived socialist 
opposition labor party in public opinion polls for several months 
in the latest poll by harris published sunday in the observer 
a liberal weekly labor was seven points ahead of the conservatives 
with 44 percent support the remainder was split among minority 
parties 
the 2000 voters questioned were critical of the government for 
its handling of the national health service public transport the 
new property tax proposals to privatize water supply and rising 
inflation 
no margin of error was given for the nationwide poll conducted 
thursday and friday by telephone 
in the european elections labor garnered 401 percent of the 
vote compared with the conservatives 347 percent 
adding to mrs thatchers problems is a revival of labor union 
militancy including a wave of public transportation strikes 
inflation the cornerstone of mrs thatchers rigorous economic 
policies since she won power 10 years ago is now back among the 
highest in the western world at 83 percent

mikhail s gorbachev told legislators today that 
the strikes that have swept the soviet unions major coal fields 
for nearly two weeks have been the biggest test of his four 
years in power 
he blamed coal ministry and local officials rather than the 
miners for the unrest which halted work at mines in all the 
countrys major coal fields but he said deciding such questions 
by striking will ruin our tasks 
the soviet president said most striking miners have returned to 
work including at least half the 300000 miners in the countrys 
biggest coal basin the 121mine donetsk region in the ukraine 
we are coming out of a very serious crisis the biggest test 
during the four years of perestroika gorbachev told the supreme 
soviet referring to his program of restructuring economic and 
political life 
on sunday gorbachev said in a rare television interview that he 
was inspired by the workers initiative although he disagreed 
with their tactics he also said he understood why the miners 
mistrusted a government that long ignored them 
the strikers in the donetsk basin were among the last holdouts 
from the nationwide coal strike that started in western siberia 
july 11 and spread to the arctic circle and central asia 
the strikes began to ebb friday as the siberia strikers returned 
to work friday after exacting promises of higher pay better food 
clothing and housing and greater control over their industry 
the government said those concessions would apply to striking 
miners nationwide 
strikers in the donetsk have held out for legal guarantees from 
the supreme soviet that the government would keep the promises it 
made to miners in a settlement signed saturday by strike leaders 
and government officials 
a lawmaker from the pechora coal basin in the far north told the 
supreme soviet that miners around the city of vorkuta also remained 
on strike in part due to disinformation by the media 
miner vladimir p lushnikov said staterun media reported 
erroneously that the vorkuta strike ended 
according to recent reports miners remained on strike at 11 of 
the 13 mines in vorkuta and at all 12 mines in chervonograd in the 
western ukraine 
lawmakers speaking at todays supreme soviet session which was 
broadcast nationally with a slight tape delay said the strikes 
showed that the country needed more effective unions 
we have to admit that the trade unions dont have the workers 
faith said lithuanian deputy kazimeras uoka we have to give 
them the right to establish independent trade unions 
soviet unions act as adjuncts of the government handling the 
distribution of various benefits rather than fighting for workers 
rights 
several deputies from mining regions also called for moving up 
local elections from spring to this fall to give voters a chance to 
oust officials who were insensitive to miners needs 
gorbachev responded that decisions on how the local elections 
are run should be taken in the republics not in moscow even if 
that means election laws and schedules will vary from place to 
place 
shall we torpedo and limit this he asked we will hardly 
succeed commanding from here 
gorbachev proposed that instead of waiting for elections all 
local councils around the country hold immediate meetings to 
examine the concrete situations in all regions with the aim of 
activizing the work of our councils everywhere 
alexei boiko from the donetsk appealed to gorbachev and prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov to meet with a delegation of his 
regions miners to hasten a resolution of its waning strikes 
the walkout in the region began on july 15 
more than 5000 strikers continued demonstrating sunday on the 
central square in the city of donetsk 900 miles south of moscow 
and miners at each pit were deciding for themselves whether to 
resume work a strike leader said in a telephone interview 
the settlement in the donetsk included earlier pension 
eligibility pay increases and longer vacations 
gorbachev told the supreme soviet the strikes dealt a serious 
blow to the economy but he reassured his countrymen that our 
perestroika will give results despite the tests we are undergoing 
the labor unrest is the countrys worst in 60 years and would 
have been unthinkable before gorbachev came to power in 1985 and 
loosened restrictions on civil liberties 
at the strikes peak reports indicated half the coal industrys 
1 million workers were off the job

hashemi rafsanjani irans wily 
parliament speaker is so confident he will be elected the islamic 
republics fourth president that he isnt even campaigning 
people dont expect me to put up posters and photos the 
55yearold cleric was quoted as telling the tehran daily newspaper 
jomhuri islami 
polls published by some newspapers indicate that when iranians 
cast ballots on friday rafsanjani will win 86 percent of the vote 
they give his only challenger abbas sheibani a colorless 
former agriculture minister a paltry 11 percent three percent of 
iranians questioned said they would not vote 
the media much of it controlled by the speakers brother 
mohammad and rafsanjanis allies are already speculating about who 
will be in rafsanjanis cabinet little is reported about 
sheibanis campaign 
although he is not stumping rafsanjani has kept a high profile 
through newspaper interviews he has stressed that his priority is 
rebuilding irans sagging economy slashing inflation boosting 
production and creating jobs 
the presidential vote originally scheduled for aug 18 was 
moved up three weeks to accelerate the transition of power 
following the june 3 death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans 
revolutionary patriarch 
that transition has been smooth so far despite bitter rivalries 
within the tehran hierarchy between rafsanjanis socalled 
pragmatists and radicals led by interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi 
rafsanjani is certain to inherit a more powerful presidency than 
his predecessor and ally ayatollah ali khamenei who was chosen 
irans supreme religious leader following khomeinis death 
a national referendum that will be held alongside the 
presidential vote is expected to win approval for proposed 
constitutional amendments that will increase the presidents 
powers making him head of government and scrapping the post of 
prime minister 
the reforms will streamline irans government by eliminating 
competing power centers that have virtually paralyzed 
decisionmaking and delayed the formulation of a sound economic 
strategy following the ceasefire last august in the 8year war 
with iraq 
analysts say that election of the popular rafsanjani would usher 
in a new more liberal era in iran which was dominated for the 
last 10 turbulent years by khomeini and his fundamentalist islamic 
ideology 
it would probably bring new moves to build bridges with the west 
rafsanjani and khamenei have clearly outmaneuvered the radicals 
including khomeinis son ahmad 43 who was known to have had 
presidential aspirations but did not throw his turban into the ring 
the englishlanguage tehran times which supports rafsanjani 
tipped ahmad as rafsanjanis successor as speaker in what was a 
clear hint to khomeinis heir that he would not be left out in the 
cold if he played ball 
hardliners will likely be offered positions in the new 
government but with diminished powers 
presidential elections in iran since the 1979 revolution have 
always been onehorse races the first president abolhassan 
banisadr was elected in january 1980 with 75 percent of the vote 
far outstripping his two nearest rivals 
sheibani 58 a frenchtrained physician ran in the july 1981 
presidential election called when the liberal banisadr was 
forced into exile by islamic hardliners against thenprime 
minister mohammad ali rajaie and two other candidates 
rajaie won with a landslide 13 million of the 147 million votes 
cast and was assassinated by leftist rivals 37 days later 
his successor khamenei won a whopping 95 percent of the 168 
million votes cast his three rivals could only muster 5 percent 
between them 
sheibani has represented a tehran district in the 270seat 
parliament since april 1984 but has no national political base he 
is linked with mehdi bazargans small freedom movement irans 
token opposition party 
he and rafsanjani were the only two of 80 iranians who applied 
to contest the presidency to be approved by the 12member council 
of guardians a constitutional watchdog body 
sheibanis candidacy looks suspiciously like a token tilt toward 
democracy so that rafsanjani will not be elected unopposed 
irans electorate was estimated at around 25 million during last 
years parliamentary elections

hundreds of people remained in temporary 
quarters today as a chemical fire in a derailed tank car burned 
into its third day but officials said they found no dangerous 
levels of toxic chemicals in the area 
residents in a 15squaremile area around the crash site will be 
kept from their homes until the fire burns itself out which was 
expected sometime today said r lindsay leckie senior manager of 
news and media relations for csx transportation inc which owns 
the train 
a team of hazardous material experts checked the fire shortly 
after dawn and found it reduced greatly but still burning leckie 
said officials hope later today to begin allowing people to return 
home 
after safety the top priority for csx and the local officials 
is as quickly as it is possible to reduce the size of the 
evacuated area he said 
even after the fire goes out the evacuation will remain in 
effect in the immediate area as hazardous materials experts examine 
the 14 derailed cars and determine how to handle their contents 
leckie said 
monitoring around the tank cars found no dangerous levels of 
toxic chemicals and no longterm effects to homes or possessions 
were anticipated leckie said 
the burning cars did not threaten other chemicalladen cars in 
the 32car train leckie said earlier 
three tank cars burst into flames after saturdays derailment 
one carload of highly flammable naphtha burned up within an hour 
sending up a fireball and column of smoke 
two homes were destroyed by the fire but no serious injuries 
were reported 
a carload of acrylic acid burned itself out sunday but the 
third tanker containing chlorosilene continued to burn early 
today experts decided the safest way to handle the fire was to let 
it burn itself out 
the chemical is a flammable liquid used in silicon production 
it is made by dow corning corp a joint venture between dow 
chemical co and corning glass works 
unofficial estimates on the numbers of evacuees ranged from 400 
to 2000 but the red cross and tittabawassee township officials 
said theyd been too busy to make an accurate count the saginaw 
county township located about 100 miles northwest of detroit has 
a population of 5000 
investigators from the national transportation safety board 
arrived in freeland on sunday leckie said it would take as long as 
several weeks for the railroad to determine the cause of the crash 
right now the safety of our workers is the number one 
priority he said 
it was the third derailment involving a csx train in michigan 
within a year leckie said the company had found no links between 
the first two derailments and didnt believe there were any 
problems with the way the company conducts its operations 
leckie said the train was traveling at about 37 mph when it 
derailed he said the section of track where the accident occurred 
has been inspected once a week most recently by the federal 
railroad administration and csx engineers last tuesday 
the threemember train crew also inspected the train before it 
left port huron for midland he added

prime minister sousuke uno announced today he will 
resign after his scandalplagued party suffered a stinging 
electoral defeat losing control of a house of parliament for the 
first time in its 34 years 
it was a very difficult election uno told a nationally 
televised news conference 
uno has been prime minister less than two months but he said 
his partys loss of control of parliaments upper house in sunday 
elections ultimately is his responsibility 
the longgoverning liberal democrats have seen their popularity 
plummet over an influencepeddling scandal a new 3 percent sales 
tax and the liberalization of agricultural imports which farmers 
say hurts their livelihood 
uno has been criticized for alleged extramarital affairs 
including with a geisha who said he paid her to be his mistress for 
several months 
he said he hoped a successor could be found promptly 
analysts said the process could take several weeks 
unos resignation will result in the dissolution of the cabinet 
and restructuring of the governing partys leadership 
but some liberal democrats said this would not solve the 
problems 
its a question of why we lost said yohei koono a liberal 
lower house lawmaker if our choice of policies is wrong we need 
to change it 
business leaders urged thorough political reforms from the party 
that guided japans rapid postwar economic growth 
we should not allow this to have an adverse effect on economic 
activity or the peoples lives said eishiro saito chairman of 
the powerful japan federation of economic organizations 
in the balloting for half the 252 seats in parliaments upper 
house the big winner was the japan socialist party led by takako 
doi the first woman leader of a major japanese party 
of 126 seats at stake the socialists won 46 the liberal 
democrats 36 the socialists total strength in the chamber rose 
from 43 to 66 the liberal democrats fell from 142 to 109 
rengo confederation a new laborbased group won 11 seats and 
the centrist clean government party 10 with the rest split among 
smaller parties 
ms doi said her party quickly will call a meeting of opposition 
leaders to form a coalition against the liberal democrats who 
still hold 293 of the 512 seats in parliaments more powerful lower 
house 
any coalition is expected to be fragile while most major 
opposition parties have called for abolishing the new sales tax 
they vary broadly on other issues such as defense policy relations 
with the united states and nuclear power 
with the loss of their majority in the upper house however the 
liberal democrats will face greater difficulties in passing 
legislation 
the upper chamber can vote down bills and delay but not block 
the budget and treaties 
ms doi called her partys victory the peoples verdict and 
said unos decision to step down was only natural 
she said the socialists first priority is to pass a bill in the 
upper house abolishing the sales tax such a bill is unlikely to be 
approved by the lower house however and a standstill over the 
issue could add to pressure for early elections for the lower 
chamber legally they do not have to be held for 12 months 
a loss in the lower house would threaten the governing partys 
34year hold on power since that chamber chooses the prime minister 
about 65 percent of japans 903 million eligible voters cast 
ballots in sundays election reflecting strong feelings over 
issues affecting many peoples everyday lives 
women were particularly unhappy over the new sales tax 
bulldozed through by the governing party despite an opposition 
boycott 
i really believe that this was a peoples revolution coming 
from the kitchen said kazuo shinsaka a rengo candidate who won 
election in nara 
a record 146 women candidates ran for office sunday and a 
record 22 were elected more than doubling female representation in 
the chamber 
one result of the election is that japanese politicians from 
now on will have to pay more attention to women said seisaburo 
sato professor of political science at tokyo university 
though ms doi is immensely popular her party has been widely 
accused of lacking a realistic and constructive platform 
in the past it has called for japan to disband its selfdefense 
forces and scrap the usjapan security treaty under which 64000 
us troops are stationed in japan 
socialist leaders now say they would not immediately do away 
with the armed forces and seek only to revise the treaty 
uno became prime minister june 2 after former prime minister 
noboru takeshita resigned to take responsibility for a scandal in 
which the recruit co a publishing conglomerate allegedly 
distributed millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political 
donations to obtain favors 
the governing party spent weeks finding an unsullied successor 
for takeshita but shortly after taking office uno was linked to 
the sex scandal 
asked how he felt after announcing his resignation uno a poet 
said my state of mind is meikyo shisui meaning tranquil as 
unrippled water

about 60 burmese students waved banners 
and chanted slogans outside their countrys embassy in bangkok 
today to demand that burma release two arrested leaders of the top 
opposition group 
it has been difficult to determine what is happening in burma 
because telephone and telex lines have been cut most of the time 
since wednesday when hundreds of students defied martial law with 
antigovernment protests burmas official radio reported 44 
arrests during those protests in rangoon the capital 
diplomats in bangkok believe burmese authorities are trying to 
limit foreign reporting on their domestic strife 
the military government of burma placed aung san suu kyi and tin 
oo who lead the national league for democracy under house arrest 
on thursday 
the two were accused of trying to destroy the military and 
revive anarchy even though ms suu kyi had canceled a major 
rally planned for wednesday 
in addition british authorities have expressed concern over the 
whereabouts of michael aris ms suu kyis british husband he flew 
to burmas capital rangoon on saturday 
a foreign office spokesman in london said aris was not permitted 
to see a british diplomat who had waited for him at the airport 
aris may also be under house arrest the spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
in the bangkok protest burmese students carried banners 
denouncing military rule and waved a fighting peacock flag 
while chanting slogans of last years thwarted popular burmese 
uprising for democracy 
the fighting peacock was the symbol of burmas battle for 
independence from british colonial rule 
we denounce the arrests and demand the immediate release of 
aung san suu kyi and tin oo said 24yearold moe thee zun who 
until april headed the largest student party in burma he fled 
after a wave of arrests of opposition activists 
gen saw maung seized power in burma in september and his troops 
crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people millions of people 
protested nationwide last year to demand an end to a quarter 
century of military control of the government 
the more oppressive the government becomes the more turmoil 
it will cause and it may lead to a civil war in burma said htun 
aung gyaw chairman of the all burma students democratic front the 
group is a burmese dissident organization operating on the thai 
border

an american airlines dc9 with 27 people 
aboard made an emergency landing early today with no traffic 
controllers in the airport tower and with its primary electrical 
system down no one was injured 
it was the second jetliner forced to make an emergency landing 
in iowa in less than a week 
the pilot switched to his backup electrical system and the 
jetliner en route from chicago to portland ore landed safely 
an american spokesman said 
police and fire units were standing by at the waterloo municipal 
airport but were not needed the plane flight 639 landed just 
after midnight said hagan gibbs area supervisor for the waterloo 
tower 
hagan said the waterloo tower is staffed only until 11 pm and 
no air traffic controllers were on duty at the time of the landing 
he said regional controllers handled the emergency landing 
on wednesday a united airlines dc10 lost power over northwest 
iowa and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at the sioux 
city airport killing 110 people 
john hotard an american spokesman in fort worth texas said 
the backup system allows the planes electrical systems to function 
normally the electrical system does not affect the aircrafts 
steering mechanism which are controlled by hydraulic lines he 
said there were hydraulic problems in the sioux city landing 
once he had a problem the pilot immediately goes to air 
traffic control and declares an emergency hotard said at that 
point they direct him to the nearest airport 
the backup system kicked in immediately after the primary system 
failed hotard said because the pilot did not have a second backup 
system he chose to land the plane 
its a precautionary move hotard said you dont want to 
be flying without a backup

shes angrier at the legal system than at her alleged attacker 
the 22yearold woman who said she ignored court summonses

president bush defending the 
halfbilliondollar b2 stealth bomber and saying the star wars 
missile defense system is critical appealed today to senators to 
keep his defense budget intact 
the president meeting with members of the senate armed services 
committee and other leading senators also said an espionage 
investigation at the state department doesnt help ussoviet 
relations 
bush said the b2 and the strategic defense initiative both of 
which are threatened with deep cuts on capitol hill are essential 
to the us defense and to arms talks with the soviets 
i strongly support what we sent up there to the hill sdi in 
my view is critical said bush 
the b2 he added is a revolutionary plane with revolutionary 
technology again i would strongly urge your support for that he 
also appealed for support for funds for the midgetman missile and 
for making the mx missile mobile 
we need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control 
said bush 
asked by reporters how he could justify the expense of the b2 
costing 70 billion for 132 planes or 530 million apiece bush 
replied i justify it because i think the prime responsibility of 
the president is the national security of the united states 
asked about the investigation of top state department official 
felix bloch as a possible soviet spy bush said it is a very 
serious matter and it will be thoroughly investigated 
the minute i heard about it i was aggrieved because it is a 
very tragic thing should these allegations be true said bush 
asked what impact it might have on ussoviet relations bush 
said it doesnt help any espionage goes on i dont think 
it helps when you have highvisibility cases but i think 
regrettably it says more if its true about an individual who is 
alleged to have passed secrets to the soviets which is very bad 
bush said he was not sure how seriously us security may have 
been compromised bloch was the no 2 official at the us embassy 
in vienna 
on sunday bushs budget chief said the president has ruled out 
any suggestion from democrats that he accept future tax increases 
in exchange for an immediate cut in the capital gains tax 
bush kicking off the week with an unusually hectic schedule 
also planned to meet with south korean foreign minister choi ho 
joong 
another white house visitor was chicagos mayor richard daley

meeting with defense secretary richard cheney 
bush has been negotiating with house speaker thomas foley and 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the ways and means chairman on a 
revenue package 
white house budget director richard darman said sunday we 
believe that right now we have the votes for a satisfactory 
capital gains proposal in the ways and means committee our only 
problem is house speaker thomas f foley and committee 
chairman dan rostenkowski wont actually bring it up for a vote 
darman said the president was not willing to agree to exchange a 
lower capital gains levy now for increases in other taxes next year 
or later 
the president is firmly committed to his pledge not to raise 
taxes darman said on cbstvs face the nation 
asked how long bush intended to stick by his notaxincrease 
pledge darman said for the time being lets assume forever 
but i dont know exactly what that means 
the democratic leaders contend lowering the capital gains rate 
now 28 to 33 percent would hurt the treasury and help only the 
wealthy 
darman said it would stimulate growth and raise treasury 
revenues

movies its the unknown said sheriff charles plummer 
most of the visitors are families with children senior groups

the justice department has no current plans to 
prosecute a former hud official criticized for awarding millions of 
dollars in subsidies to developers who had contributed to a charity 
he helped found a congressman disclosed today 
should you come to obtain information not contained in your 
report implicating mr thomas demery or other hud officials in 
possible criminal violations we would be happy to review that 
information gerald e mcdowell chief of the departments public 
integrity section said in a letter to agency officials 
rep barney frank dmass released the letter as a house 
subcommittee resumed hearings into mismanagement and 
influencepeddling at hud during the reagan administration he also 
charged that many witnesses during the hearings appeared to have 
committed perjury and that the justice department should conduct 
its own investigations instead of relying on congress or hud to 
refer cases for investigation 
frank did not name the witnesses to whom he was referring 
in the letter dated july 19 the justice department told hud 
inspector general paul adams it would not prosecute former hud 
assistant secretary thomas demery in connection with an inspector 
generals report criticizing the selection process hud used to 
award rent subsidies to developers who promised to renovate housing 
for lowincome people 
in the inspector generals report adams and his investigators 
said many of the developers who received subsidies had been major 
contributors to food for africa a michiganbased charity that 
demery helped establish 
frank did not criticize the departments decision on demery but 
complained justice department officials had indicated they would 
not conduct their own investigations into the emerging hud scandals 
the first witness at todays hearing was william taylor a 
member of the republican national committee and former chairman of 
the florida state republican party taylor was criticized by 
committee members but defended his use of his rnc stationery in 
letters to hud officials lobbying for hud projects 
i find nothing wrong with letting people know who i am said 
taylor he said his lobbying business included numerous hudrelated 
clients 
meanwhile the new york times reported today that federal 
housing officials approved more than 16 million in rent subsidies 
for a denver housing project after joseph coors the wealthy 
colorado brewer and a friend of president reagan wrote a letter 
endorsing the project 
the committee also was scheduled to hear testimony from lynda 
murphy a former career hud employee about her dealings with her 
friend deborah gore dean former executive assistant to 
thenhousing secretary samuel pierce 
ms murphy who left hud in 1982 was an attorney for drg 
funding corp a lender which has been indefinitely suspended from 
doing business with the department because of a high incidence of 
loan defaults 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif said the panel is 
seeking to use other witnesses to find out about the role of ms 
dean who has refused to testify based on her constitutional right 
against selfincrimination 
miss dean has chosen to take the fifth amendment and we very 
much hope that she will change her mind lantos said in an 
interview so we will attempt to ascertain through these other 
witnesses to what extent she was calling the shots and to what 
extent it was secretary pierce 
pierce himself has said that he was not involved in many of the 
daytoday decisions at the department and testified that he did 
not personally order funding for any project 
however those statements were contradicted by a later witness 
shirley mcvay wiseman pierce is to appear before the panel again 
in august and september 
lantos has said the panel is not considering granting legal 
immunity for ms dean under which her testimony could not be used 
against her in any future prosecution 
a number of witnesses before the subcommittee have said that ms 
deans support for a project was crucial in any attempt to get 
money from hud 
bigname republicans such as former interior secretary james 
watt or former highranking hud employees used their contacts to 
obtain the funding 
the times report said coors endorsement two years ago came as 
the denver request appeared headed for rejection the paper based 
its report on internal government documents 
it also quoted demery as saying a hud selection committee was 
told that pierce wanted the denver application given very careful 
consideration which it was 
documents showed the denver proposal was originally left off a 
list of 1987 applications to be recommended for financing the 
times said 
on aug 12 1987 coors wrote pierce urging him to look into 
this matter and give it your favorable approval one week after 
the letter was written the selection panel met in washington and 
approved the denver request the times said documents showed 
the times said there was no indication that coors had a 
financial interest in the project characterizing his support for 
it instead as being motivated by civic pride

ethnic unrest in soviet georgia spilled into the 
republics capital today with hundreds of protesters marching 
through the streets and bus traffic disrupted according to 
witnesses and official reports 
mikhail s gorbachev told the national legislature the unrest in 
the black sea enclave of abkhazia spread to tbilisi causing the 
disorganization of transportation this morning apparently 
because of a strike 
the soviet president said the situation became acute in the 
city in the caucusus mountains about 1050 miles south of moscow 
the protest follows clashes between georgians and abkhazians in 
the georgiaruled enclave of abkhazia a popular seaside vacation 
area about 170 miles west of tbilisi since the violence began july 
15 19 people have been reported killed and more than 400 injured 
an editorial assistant at the georgian news agency gruzinform 
said buses failed to appear in some areas of tbilisi this morning 
but were running by midday 
the interruption of bus service appeared linked to a railway 
strike that began over the weekend and ended today the official 
tass news agency reported the walkout stranded thousands of 
tourists 
besides the transit strike several hundred people demonstrated 
throughout the day in central tbilisi against what happened in 
abkhazia the editor nana gelashvili said in a telephone 
interview 
when those abkhazians started to knife georgians it just 
drove us out of our minds she said 
no armed clashes have been reported in the area for the past two 
days tass reported although internal security troops and police 
continued to confiscate weapons from extremists 
activists in tbilisi proposed a general strike for today to 
protest what they called a failure by authorities to protect 
georgians in abkhazia 
as a result of the violence two regional party secretaries were 
fired and two government leaders in abkhazia lost their jobs 
saturday 
abkhazians and georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest 
abkhazians who are a minority in their own region want greater 
economic independence and cultural rights while georgians want the 
fertile enclave retained as part of their caucasus republic 
georgian leaders want to develop a dialogue over problems in the 
region but abkhazians want the kremlin to establish an outside 
body to take control news reports say

the united airlines dc10 crash claimed 
its 106th victim today while investigators using infrared cameras 
searched cornfields 60 miles from the crash site for pieces of the 
planes rear engine 
brent bealer of quakertown pa died early today from injuries 
he suffered in wednesdays crash said rhonda ostrihonsky a 
spokeswoman for st lukes medical center 
thirtytwo others remain hospitalized and five people are still 
listed as missing 
at sioux gateway airport officials on sunday were painstakingly 
reassembling the tail section of flight 232 in hopes of determining 
what caused the jet to lose hydraulic power and tumble out of 
control across the runway in denver meanwhile a united official 
told about 200 people at a service for survivors and victims that 
it was time for healing after wednesdays crash 
there is little to say to ease the sadness we at united feel 
deeply your pain and loss we have lost members of the united 
family and we offer thanks for those who were spared said capt 
william traub uniteds vice president of flight standards in 
denver 
authorities were beginning to return home the bodies of crash 
victims a spokesman for iowa gov terry branstad said more than 20 
bodies had been sent home by sunday 
according to a list compiled with information from united 
relatives and employers 106 people were confirmed dead and five 
were still listed as missing another 185 passengers survived the 
crash united said 
jim burnett a member of the national transportation safety 
board said farmers in a 16squaremile section about 60 miles 
northeast of the crash site were being asked to look for parts 
including the missing engine fan 
nebraska air national guard jets photographed those fields with 
infrared cameras in a search for metal fragments thrown from the 
engine when it exploded 
burnett said the search had been hampered because some pieces 
apparently fell in areas where corn is up to 6 feet high 
we basically plan on being alert were concerned about our 
machines getting a flat tire and so forth said tim anderson on 
whose farm several pieces of the plane fell 
in a separate development burnett said he would ask the ntsb to 
look at the issue of child safety in aviation accidents including 
whether special child safety seats should be used on airplanes 
according to todays editions of the new york times 
if child safety seats are required infants who now sit on laps 
and fly free would need their own seats which could make family 
travel more expensive an unusually large number of children were 
aboard the flight in part because airlines offer free tickets to 
children flying with adults on tuesdays and wednesdays 
at least one infant died in the crash united said a list 
compiled by the associated press shows 24 children under 10 years 
old including seven under 5 were among the survivors 
investigators continued to interview crew members meanwhile 
the flight engineer said that immediately after the explosion in 
the no 2 engine the gauges indicated the immediate loss of fluid 
in all three hydraulic systems according to burnett 
without the hydraulic systems the dc10 is almost impossible to 
fly 
investigators also said they checked maintenance records on key 
sections of the engine 
theres nothing here that gives us cause for concern at this 
point said burnett although i will say that previous 
accidents have led to reductions in cycles so its not to say that 
this is irrelevant 
the age of engine parts is expressed in cycles or one landing 
and takeoff 
ntsb officials said they hoped to end their onsite 
investigation by midweek other investigators gathered personal 
items of passengers stowing them in a hangar to be claimed later 
we are taking great pains to collect everything we can 
identify them and return them said united spokesman james 
guyette he said united would assign specially trained workers and 
give personal phone numbers to families of those who died 
doctors said they were working to stabilize crash victims and 
allow them to move close to their homes 
were moving them home as soon as theyre physically capable 
of the trip said larry foster head of the burn unit at st 
lukes regional medical center full recovery would take much time 
for some he said 
while most burn victims departed this northwestern iowa city as 
soon as they were able some stayed put 
i could leave tomorrow if i wanted to said helen hayes a 
burn victim from denver i really dont feel like traveling for a 
while

israels supreme court ruled today that the 
government must recognize jewish conversions conducted abroad by 
reform and conservative rabbis deciding an issue that has put many 
us jews at odds with israel 
the 41 decision immediately caused friction in prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs cabinet where religious parties protested and one 
faction threatened to resign 
in a second decision the court unanimously rejected an appeal 
to allow reform rabbis to perform marriages in israel that 
decision upheld an orthodox monopoly on conducting religious 
weddings 
both of todays rulings were linked to the issue of who is a 
jew israeli orthodox jews have sought to narrow that definition 
under the law of return 
the law now permits granting israeli citizenship to anyone born 
of a jewish mother or who has converted to judaism and does not 
belong to another faith 
the orthodox want the definition to include only jews born to 
jewish mothers or converted according to jewish law known as 
halacha which would effectively mean by orthodox rabbis 
the change has been fought by conservative and reform rabbis 
whose followers constitute a majority of more than 5 million us 
jews but who have few adherents in israel 
the reform and conservative jews contend the orthodox proposal 
would symbolically excommunicate them from judaism and alienate 
us jews from israel 
rabbis estimate there are more than 10000 conversions a year in 
the united states nearly all nonorthodox 
the supreme court headed by chief justice meir shamgar made 
todays decision in a ruling on appeals by 12 us immigrants and 
one from brazil they were denied israeli citizenship papers by the 
interior ministry which is controlled by the ultraorthodox shas 
party 
the courts 17page ruling said a 1965 israeli law did not 
entitle the government to decide the validity of conversions by 
different jewish groups 
religious affairs minister zevulun hammer reacted to the ruling 
by pledging to renew a political campaign for a narrower definition 
of who is a jew israel radio reported 
menachem porush a legislator of the ultraorthodox agudat 
israel faction said his party may withdraw its support from 
shamirs cabinet such a move could sway other religious parties to 
take similar actions 
we have a secular court interfering in a religious subject we 
must view this very seriously porush told the associated press 
agudat is participating in the government for the first time it 
has traditionally refused to do so to avoid dealing in secular 
affairs 
the party holds five seats in the 120seat parliament its 
executive council scheduled a meeting for later today to discuss 
the issue 
gail moskowitz one of the us immigrants in the court case 
said i have been waiting for this for 2 years thats a long 
time to not know where you stand now i know where i stand on my 
own feet and im jewish 
i believe it is important to separate the issue of church and 
state said elissa benrafael a plaintiff from chicago she 
joined the suit even though she was converted by an orthodox rabbi 
the marriage ruling came on appeals made seven years ago by the 
israeli reform judaism movement israeli rabbi mordechai rotem and 
a rabbi from baltimore moshe zemer 
in the 97page decision the justices upheld three laws which 
effectively give israels orthodox rabbis exclusive rights to 
decide who may preside at marriages 
spokesman for several us groups said they were pleased by the 
decision on conversions 
we believe that the courts action helps to preserve the unity 
of the jewish people so essential to israel at the present critical 
time said george gruen director of israeli and middle eastern 
affairs for the american jewish committee in new york 
i say hallelujah said carmela kalmanson president of 
hadassah a womens zionist organization in america with 385000 
members 
ms kalmanson said that though the numbers of people affected 
may be small it was the perception that was very hurtful

salman rushdie whose novel the satanic verses 
caused worldwide uproar among moslems remains under strict 
security and spends only a few weeks in the same house it was 
reported monday 
rushdie and his american wife marianne wiggins have lived in a 
succession of safe houses since irans late religious leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on feb 14 for the authors 
death for insulting islamic sanctity the independent reported 
the report said the houses are operated by the special branch 
a unit of scotland yard police headquarters concerned with 
political activities and mi5 the secret intelligence unit 
the houses are generally used for spies and intelligence 
contacts the newspaper said 
on the day of the death threat the novelist and his wife were 
taken from their home in londons islington district by special 
branch detectives and have never gone back there together it said 
salman is effectively in prison at the moment it quoted 
playwright harold pinter a friend of the novelist as saying 
the report said rushdie and his wife have dined with literary 
acquaintances and leading political figures such as opposition 
labor party leader neil kinnock rushdie continues to review books 
and is writing a childrens book 
but publishers secker and warburg requested no use of 
photographs of ms wiggins when they sent out review copies of her 
book of short stories herself in love to be published this 
month 
rushdie and his wife are now more alone than ever literally 
no friends acquaintances agents or publishers know where they 
are they cannot receive telephone calls though mail sent through 
a tortuous route via police does reach them and they can then 
respond to messages but it is a slow process the newspaper said 
security for them costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and 
differs little from that accorded to a head of state 
activities like shopping theater or cinema are out of the 
question the report said 
ms wiggins had to cancel a planned us tour to publicize her 
novel john dollar

president corazon aquino told 
legislators monday that most filipinos remain poor despite economic 
gains during her threeyear rule 
in an address to a joint session of the house of representatives 
and senate mrs aquino repeated promises to rid her government of 
tax cheaters and grafters and to purge the police and military of 
criminals who made the crime situation nothing less than 
terrible 
as she spoke about 3000 members of leftwing organizations 
marched to protest corruption and alleged foreign control of mrs 
aquinos government and economic policies 
another group of about 3000 public school teachers demonstrated 
separately to demand salary increases 
mrs aquino said that despite a 20year communist insurgency and 
at least six coup attempts her government succeeded in the past 
three years in reviving the economy increasing investment 
reducing unemployment and nibbling away at mass poverty 
but the recovery has restored old fortunes far more 
significantly than it has touched the lives of the vast majority 
of more than 55 million filipinos mrs aquino said 
poverty has lessened but 53 million households or 29 million 
people remain poor she said unemployment has been reduced 
but try telling that to the 29 million still jobless and the 72 
million underemployed 
even the 500000 families which statistically have crossed the 
poverty line a monthly income of 119 for a family of six feel 
nothing has changed she said i cant blame them liberty is a 
poor substitute for food 
she announced measures to help develop the countryside where 
most filipinos live 
mrs aquino said she is tired of being taken to task for 
continuing corruption and wants to leave clean and honest 
government as her legacy 
to my fellow workers in government specifically involved in 
this area and in all other areas as well let me say that unless 
the public sees results soon it will be goodbye for you she 
said the compassion that marked my administration in the past 
may generate doubts about my resolve in this matter but the 
actions that will be taken by me in the next weeks and months will 
dispel them all

the garden city police department has never really formally

shootings here in garden city there was a shooting overnight in 
new mexico and we have officers en route there now wojdylak 
said 
henry said the slayings were within a days drive and occurred 
on three successive days and the manner of the killing and the 
weapon used appears similar 
meanwhile in merrillville ind police said the slayings of 
two motel clerks earlier this year may be related to the killings 
in kansas oklahoma and texas

president bush said today that reports a 
former top diplomat in vienna may have spied for the soviets are 
very serious but he does not have an assessment of potential 
damage to the united states 
i have known about this matter for some time and the minute i 
heard about it i was aggrieved because it is a very tragic thing 
should the allegations be true bush told reporters in commenting 
for the first time on felix s bloch who is under investigation by 
the fbi 
the president refused to reveal details of the case noting that 
the investigation is still under way but he said any time a 
person is allegedly involved in something like betraying his 
country that to me is a very serious matter 
asked about possible damage to us security bush a former cia 
director replied i dont think anyone could give you a full 
damage assessment at this time he added that the case if true 
doesnt help further better relations between the superpowers 
even though everyone knows that espionage goes on 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said secretary of state 
james a baker iii informed bush of the bloch investigation 
within minutes after he learned of this he declined to say 
when that was 
asked why bush commented on a case still under investigation 
fitzwater replied we normally dont have a situation like this 
the presidents remarks came as blochs onetime superior 
former us ambassador to austria ronald lauder said he did not 
like bloch there was something about him that bothered me 
lauder said on abctvs good morning america program 
lauder now a republican candidate for mayor of new york said 
the more i got to know him the more i realized there was 
something dramatically wrong he said he had bloch who was 
secondincommand for most of his seven years at the vienna 
embassy recalled in july 1987 because of insubordination 
but the new york times today quoted the former director general 
of the foreign service george s vest as saying it was time 
for bloch to go anyway so we brought him back he was not 
pulled back prematurely vest said bloch returned to attend a 
seminar for top diplomats 
a us official said today that lauder was upset that bloch went 
behind his back and lobbied against a justice department 
recommendation to place austrian president kurt waldheim on a list 
of people banned from the united states because of nazi activities 
bloch and austrian foreign minister alois mock a waldheim 
supporter were very tight over that affair said the official 
who spoke only on condition he not be named a year after the april 
1986 recommendation was made waldheim was placed on the list 
stansfield turner who was cia director during the carter 
administration before blochs embassy stint said its not very 
likely bloch would know the specific names and details 
concerning cia agents in vienna because such information is not 
normally shared with officials outside the agency 
however a person in blochs high position could have gotten 
into things that werent normally his business because of his 
access to the embassys cable section turner said on good 
morning america 
bush administration legislative and law enforcement officials 
skirted questions sunday about the inquiry into bloch the 
highestranking us official ever implicated in an espionage 
investigation involving the soviet union 
bloch who has not been charged with any crime reportedly was 
filmed by us officials earlier this year passing a briefcase to a 
known soviet kgb agent in a european capital 
the state department and the fbi are pursuing the inquiry 
thoroughly in order to identify the compromised security which has 
occurred and the appropriate steps the state department said 
blochs building pass and security clearance have been lifted 
my directions are really not to comment on this case an fbi 
spokesman said sunday youre talking about security matters 
although reports remained sketchy the picture was emerging of a 
54yearold career diplomat who was frustrated by his lack of 
advancement while serving in vienna under two political appointees 
vienna because of geography traditionally has been a hotbed 
for eastwest spy activity 
blochs close friend foreign minister mock was quoted sunday 
as saying he heard about the recent allegations of espionage 
through austrian channels three weeks before the news broke in 
washington on friday 
mock said in the austrian tabloid kurier there was a certain 
suspicion on the us side reaching back into the 1970s about 
blochs activities 
bloch also served in the newly opened us embassy in east 
berlin in 1974 as economic counselor having been transferred from 
west berlin 
blochs neighbors in an upperclass neighborhood in washington 
told reporters that bloch who had been under obvious surveillance 
by the fbi until news accounts of the spy probe aired late friday 
had not been seen since then 
abc news reported sunday night he was under the fbis watch at a 
private home north of new york city with his wife and daughter 
by all accounts bloch born in austria had access to sensitive 
intelligence material during his career and officials expressed 
concern he could cause serious damage to us interests if he 
shared his secrets with foreign powers 
the wall street journal reported in todays editions that bloch 
helped shape the state departments policy on transfers of 
sensitive technology to the soviets and actively participated in 
the decision earlier this year to relax us policy on transfers 
one senior state department official who worked with bloch told 
the journal the most sensitive intelligence information on soviet 
and european security matters bypassed blochs office but bloch 
as an office director had access to general intelligence 
information including a morning intelligence summary so sensitive 
officials are required to read it and return it to a waiting 
courier without copying it the official said 
those who knew bloch well ruled out spying for money or 
ideology mock said he was deeply shaken and really shattered 
by the allegations 
sources told abc that bloch claimed he spied because he fell 
into a soviet sex trap but that investigators have discounted the 
story 
some sources pointed to blochs frustration over having been 
passed over for an ambassadorship after serving under political 
appointees in austria and running the embassy in vienna for a time 
one of the ambassadors bloch served was helene von damm an 
austrianborn political appointee by former president reagan who 
caused a scandal in viennese society by marrying peter guertler a 
hotel owner 
she resigned in june 1985 citing speculation that her marriage 
constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties 
bloch ran the embassy after von damm resigned until lauder arrived 
almost a year later

forty years after they lost a civil war 
and thousands were sent to prison or into exile greek communists 
have joined conservatives in a government bent on prosecuting 
official corruption 
an estimated 80000 people were killed in the civil war that 
ended in 1949 and 25000 communists were sentenced to death life 
imprisonment or exile in remote mountain villages or barren aegean 
islands 
the party was legalized 15 years ago and greeces communists now 
are the only ones in a western government coalition 
the communist party endured years of hardship because the 
people at its core were tough and held little regard for their own 
lives said historian tassos vournas they spent years in 
exile in prison many were executed but now we have passed from 
the age of fighting to an age of dialogue 
greeks began fighting each other when the germans retreated in 
1944 and the communists tried to assert their military strength 
with british help the conservative government checked the 
communist army but a truce collapsed in 1946 and fighting resumed 
government forces crushed the communists three years later with 
britains support and aid from the united states which provided 
more than 2 billion under the truman doctrine 
in addition to those executed imprisoned or sent to internal 
exile tens of thousands of greek communists fled to the soviet 
union and other countries in the eastern bloc 
after the communist party was banned in 1947 it stayed alive as 
the united democratic left which was formed in 1951 and won 10 
seats in parliament 
it had become the main opposition by 1958 with 24 percent of 
the vote and 79 seats but its influence declined and ended during 
the military dictatorship of 196774 
the government of premier constantine caramanlis a 
conservative legalized the party after the dictatorship ended in 
1974 
andreas papandreou led his socialist party to power in 1981 on 
promises to pull greece out of nato and close down us military 
bases two cornerstones of communist party foreign policy 
election results indicated the communists had only slight and 
waning popularity the party got 99 percent of the votes in the 
1985 general election down from 11 percent in 1981 
this was one of the most critical periods in the partys 
history said political analyst stelios kouloglou communist 
parties throughout europe were losing influence 
harilaos florakis former leader of the party proposed at its 
congress in may 1987 a coalition of leftists and progressive 
forces 
his invitation was aimed at a eurocommunist faction that left 
the communist party after the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
in 1968 the dissidents turned him on grounds the party toed the 
moscow line 
early this year papandreous government was falling into 
disarray because of allegations that members of the leadership were 
involved in scandals and the two communist groups realized only 
unity would give them a significant role 
in february the coalition of the left and progress was born 
with florakis as its president and its platform appeared to be 
dominated by eurocommunist thinking 
florakis 75 resigned as secretarygeneral of the communist 
party this month but remained as head of the coalition 
although the coalition did not do as well in the june 18 general 
election as polls had suggested 1312 percent of the vote gave it 
28 of the 300 seats in the unicameral parliament and a role as 
power broker 
both the conservative new democracy party with 145 seats and 
the socialists with 125 courted the communists the coalition 
refused to work with the socialists unless they dumped papandreou 
and other officials accused of involvement in banking financial 
and arms scandals 
florakis coalition agreed to join new democracy in a government 
devoted to cleaning up the scandals it was sworn in july 2 with a 
pledge to call elections in three months 
in 1944 seven leftists were given minor positions in a 
national unity government in an attempt to keep the communists 
from seeking power by military means this time the communists 
have the major justice and interior ministries 
premier tzannis tzannetakis a member of new democracy told 
parliament those who bring up the past belong to the past

the bush administration expects close ties 
with japan to continue regardless of who is chosen to succeed the 
fallen government of prime minister sousuke uno the white house 
said today 
marlin fitzwater president bushs spokesman said he had no 
direct comment on the election results in japan simply because 
its an internal matter 
however the united states has long and strong relationships 
with japan we certainly would expect those to continue under any 
successor government said fitzwater 
we dont have any idea who that successor will be but whoever 
it is we look forward to working with them to establishing 
friendly and productive ties of a kind that we have had in the 
past he said 
uno and his ruling liberal democratic party lost its majority in 
the upper house of the diet for the first time in 34 years uno 
announced today he would resign saying he accepted the 
responsibility for this defeat wholly upon myself 
fitzwater said the united states and japan are bound by their 
trading ties and militarily we would expect to maintain all of 
those ties in a solid fashion he said 
but he said the us government would continue to press rather 
vigorously with the new government on trade problems that can 
be done in a positive fashion and thats the way we expect to do 
it he said

a federal appeals court today temporarily 
delayed the irancontra trial of the cias former station chief in 
costa rica 
the appeals court in richmond issued an emergency stay at the 
request of the justice department putting off the trial of joseph 
fernandez in order to address national security issues that are 
threatening to kill the case 
us district court judge claude hilton told a pool of 
prospective jurors to go home saying he would call them back after 
the appeals court has an opportunity to rule on the national 
security questions 
earlier today hilton rejected motions by the prosecutors in the 
case which would have allowed the cia to protect details of some of 
its programs and the names of three of its stations and facilities 
in latin america from disclosure in the courtroom during the 
fernandez trial 
fernandez was to go on trial today on four criminal charges of 
obstructing and making false statements to the cia inspector 
generals office and the tower commission 
fernandez allegedly tried to cover up his assistance to oliver 
norths secret supply effort to the nicaraguan contras 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond will consider 
the justice departments request to intervene in the fernandez case 
and hiltons refusal to bar disclosure of the specifics about the 
cia stations and programs 
in court hilton rejected proposals by the government that would 
have limited disclosures about cia stations and programs at the 
trial of fernandez 
fernandez says he needs to present the information about the 
agencys stations and programs in his defense 
one proposal presented by laurence shtasel who is prosecuting 
fernandez would have referred to cia stations and facilities in 
latin american countries by a series of numbers rather than by 
name hilton rejected that proposal 
the judge also rejected a proposal shtasel made friday in which 
the government offered to drop a portion of the case in exchange 
for not allowing disclosure of three highly sensitive cia programs 
in costa rica hilton said it was important to fernandezs defense 
that he be allowed to refer in open court to the programs 
the justice departments seeking of an appeals court delay was a 
lastditch attempt to avoid filing an unprecedented national 
security affidavit that would kill the case 
fernandez is charged with lying and giving misleading statements 
to the cia inspector generals office and to congress in an alleged 
coverup of assistance to oliver norths secret contra resupply 
network 
us intelligence experts spent the weekend with justice 
department officials drafting an affidavit detailing national 
secrets that they will not alow to emerge in the trial 
independent counsel lawrence walshs office said friday the 
fernandez case would be untriable if the justice departments 
affidavit barred disclosure of too a wide range of material 
if the cias request for a broader affidavit is granted 
the case will be untriable prosecutors said in court papers 
with a justice department affidavit in hand hilton would have 
no choice under federal law but to prohibit the excia operative 
from using in his defense the classified information detailed in 
the affidavit 
that could lead to the judge dismissing some or all the criminal 
charges depending on the scope of the affidavit 
fernandez was charged with two counts each of making false 
statements and obstruction of an inquiry by the congressional tower 
commission and the cias office of inspector general

the major summer film a period piece about 
senior leader deng xiaoping opened monday in beijing and added to 
the clamor of praise for the man blamed by many chinese for the 
recent military crackdown 
the baise uprising has as its hero a 25yearold deng 
leading the peasants of remote baise in southern china to victory 
over nationalist troops in 1929 the nationalists ultimately lost a 
bloody civil war to the communists and retreated to the island 
province of taiwan in 1949 
the movies opening comes less than two months after the 
government called in troops to put down a studentled prodemocracy 
movement killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people many 
chinese say they have lost confidence in the government as a 
result and many hold deng responsible for the killings 
the baise uprising fits neatly into the ideological 
education all chinese are required to undergo 
most of those who attended the opening day showings at two 
beijing theaters were organized by their work units and the movie 
could be required viewing for many chinese it opens nationwide on 
aug 1 the anniversary of the founding of the peoples liberation 
army 
unless chinese are told to see the movie many doubtless would 
not pay the steep admission fee of about 67 cents five times the 
price of most films 
in the onehour 45minute film deng is portrayed as a 
confident levelheaded and charismatic leader with all the 
answers but the film also shows a human side that one rarely sees 
in revolutionarystyle movies 
there are scenes of deng an avid bridge player playing cards 
and telling a young girl that the strategies involved in playing 
bridge and chess are much like fighting a war 
he also is depicted as a music lover who carries a record player 
with him on his campaign to baise when townspeople ask him to sing 
a song from his native sichuan province he brings out the record 
player and puts on music from carmen 
the media has given enormous publicity to the movie which was 
made to mark the 60th anniversary of the baise uprising and the 
40th anniversary of communist rule 
the peoples daily the party newspaper on saturday devoted 
half a page to the film with articles writen by lu qi who played 
deng and chen jialin the director 
staterun tv last week broadcast a story on the movies 
premiere showing vice president wang zhen shaking hands with 
actors wang and other top leaders supervised the movies 
production according to the peoples daily 
despite the buildup the audience at one afternoon showing at 
beijings capital theater seemed unimpressed there was very little 
audience reaction with only laughter during the two times deng 
tells his followers to seek truth from facts a slogan he has 
made famous in the past decade 
comments after the movie also lacked enthusiasm a few people 
said it was ok others just shrugged their shoulders and 
walked away one young woman said it was worth watching but didnt 
say why 
the audience reaction was in stark contrast to another movie 
that opened a month ago in beijing 
during the opening of the towering kunlun about mao 
tsetungs battles with the nationalists in central china 
audiences applauded scenes of students demonstrating they also 
clapped when us ambassador leighton stuart promised money for 
weapons to the nationalists but only if nationalist leader chiang 
kaishek did not to use the weapons against the students stuarts 
comment since has been cut from the movie and the demonstration 
scene has been shortened 
theater employees reportedly informed on those who cheered that 
could explain the muted audience reaction to scenes in baise 
uprising including an incident in which nationalist troops shot 
at student demonstrators

key cabinet ministers and the government later said it asked the 
usled united nations command to warn communist north korea it

cross the sensitive border area 
a spokesman for the command which polices the armistice in the 
southern half of the demilitarized zone said it will not interfere

a seoul newspaper said if ms im crosses the border korean 
soldiers attached to the un command have been ordered to arrest 
her 
there are no physical boundaries in the truce village of 
panmunjom a person allowed access into the joint security area 
from either side would find it relatively easy to walk across 
south korean president roh taewoo said monday that ms ims 
plan is an example of extreme leftist thinking and he warned 
college students not to take their freedom for granted 
also on monday six students armed with firebombs pipes tear 
gas shells and leaflets demanding the withdrawal of american troops 
tried to break into the us information center in seoul 
the students fled as police arrived two were arrested

troops in south korea under a mutual defense pact

summons to kim daejung head of the leading opposition party for 
peace and democracy asking he make himself available for

the white house said monday it expects to 
maintain close ties with japan regardless of who succeeds the 
fallen sousuke uno as prime minister 
marlin fitzwater president bushs spokesman said sundays 
elections in which unos liberal democrats lost control of the 
upper house of parliament were an internal matter 
the united states has long and strong relationships with 
japan fitzwater said we certainly would expect those to 
continue under any successor government 
uno announced monday he would resign as prime minister his 
resignation will open the way to dissolving unos cabinet and 
restructuring the governing partys leadership 
we dont have any idea who that successor will be bushs 
spokesman said but whoever it is we look forward to working 
with them to establishing friendly and productive ties of a kind 
that we have had in the past 
fitzwater said the united states and japan are bound 
economically and militarily and we would expect to maintain all 
of those ties in a solid fashion 
but he said the us government would continue to press rather 
vigorously on trade problems with the new government 
fitzwater also said that a nonbinding congressional resolution 
calling for restrictions on the fsx jet fighter deal with japan 
faces a very heavy veto threat from the president 
several senior advisers have urged bush to reject the measure as 
an intrusion on executive branch deliberations and because it 
compromises the presidents ability to manage foreign affairs 
fitzwater said 
bush has until july 31 to act on the fsx resolution but will 
probably make his decision before then fitzwater said 
regardless of what course bush takes the joint development deal 
will go through because the congressional resolution is 
nonbinding fitzwater said congress never passed a binding 
resolution disapproving the joint venture 
under the fsx deal general dynamics corp and mitsubishi heavy 
industries ltd will jointly develop the new fighter for japan 
based on an improved f16 design japan had been set to develop a 
jet fighter by itself until thendefense secrtary caspar weinberger 
talked the japanese into the joint development which ensures us 
companies 40 percent of the revenues from the project 
critics in the senate and elsewhere have charged the deal will 
give the japanese access to us technology they could use to

businesses that principally serve commercial markets as well as the 
market for military and space controls 
honeywell is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the navy 
and also supplies small medium and large ammunition to the army 
tunheim said 
john mcmanus of thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
said the action could deter a takeover attempt but not guarantee 
independence for honeywell 
they are trying to basically boost the stock price to make it 
more difficult for someone to take them over mcmanus said it 
will also alleviate some of the large shareholders who have been 
pounding on the door 
honeywells stock price has risen sharply in the last two weeks 
following published reports that general electric co was 
considering acquiring the company

five alabama inmates have temporarily 
waived their chances at parole so they can participate in an 
18month prison treatment program for sex offenders 
convicted rapist robert mosley said in an interview last week 
that agreeing to give up a may 1990 parole review his first was 
not difficult 
i need the treatment more than i need my freedom said 
mosley 28 serving a 10year sentence imposed in 1986 
because of his commitment to the program he and the four others 
are next due for parole consideration in january 1991 
samuel gardner in prison for 16 years since being convicted of 
rape said waiving his chance to escape a 99year term was the only 
way he had to help himself he was to have had a february 1990 
parole hearing 
i came to the conclusion that if they let me out on the day i 
was thinking about i would be back here in a month said 
gardner 38 previously denied release in 1986 and 1988 i dont 
want no more victims 
mosley gardner and the other three who waived parole hearing 
dates are among 26 inmates participating in the states sexual 
offender treatment program at the bullock county correctional 
facility said director pamela van wyk the five are the first to 
give up a chance at release to seek treatment 
the five were required to sign away their chance at parole 
during the 18month period to ensure they would be able to finish 
therapy said merle frieson director of mental health treatment 
for the state prison system 
the program includes group sessions and exercises to enable 
inmates to overcome sexual arousal that leads to acts like rape and 
child molestation frieson said 
the treatment is rugged enough that you have to have to be 
highly motivated to complete it he said 
ms van wyk said only inmates who admit to their crimes and to 
having a sexrelated problem are admitted to the program 
for inmate raymond mcloyd confessing that he was the only one 
responsible for his 1978 rape conviction was the hardest part 
i did what i wanted to do my thinking was just so twisted 
distorted a weeping mcloyd said last week he has been denied 
parole three times and put off his next hearing for nine months to 
enter the program 
ms van wyk said the treatment is intended to teach inmates how 
to control their perverse desires when confronted with situations 
they find sexually exciting 
while the men might always be excited by certain images or 
sounds ms van wyk said they can learn to quell their dangerous 
impulses 
were not curing anything were teaching people to control 
their arousal she said 
ms van wyk said officials do not know if the program is a 
success of 26 inmates who have completed the 18month program 
none has gone before the parole board and only one has completed 
his sentence 
and the real test is when they get back on the street she 
said 
a similar program in canada has had a 50 percent to 60 percent 
success rate in steering sex offenders away from more assaults ms 
van wyk said and alabama officials would be pleased with similar 
results 
warren gaston executive director of the state board of pardons 
and paroles said he was unsure how the board would look upon sex 
offenders who have completed the program 
but while the board is reluctant to release rapists and child 
molesters he said the inmates willingness to stay in prison for 
treatment is rather remarkable

high wind created treacherous currents in 
which three tourists drowned off unguarded southern florida 
beaches and miami beach lifeguards made at least 15 successful 
rescues officials said 
beach patrol chief ray sforza said the riptide remained 
dangerous monday its insidious he said 
while the patrol didnt close the beaches sunday swimmers were 
warned to avoid the currents after the first two drownings but 
many stayed in the ocean some within sight of the blanketcovered 
corpses on the beach 
the national weather service said strong easterly wind caused 
rip currents which develop when strong waves bring a lot of water 
close to the shore the water then opens up gaps in sandbars and 
rushes back out to the ocean through channels 
with each days you have same conditions it exacerbates the 
rip currents sforza said you get more and more sandbar breaks 
up and down the coast so you have more rip currents

prime minister sousuke uno said monday he will 
resign because of his partys weekend election disaster and once 
again the liberal democrats seek a leader to rescue them from a 
morass of scandal and unpopular policies 
in sundays election for half the seats in parliaments upper 
house the governing party lost its majority for the first time 
since its formation in 1955 
opposition leaders demanded the liberal democrat party 
relinquish power and elections for the more powerful lower house be 
held early the liberal democrats would be forced out if they lost 
those elections 
uno announced monday he would resign after only two months in 
office to take responsibility for sundays balloting in which 
voters chastised the party for money and sex scandals a new sales 
tax that outraged housewives and more liberal food import policies 
that angered farmers 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
united states has long and strong relationships with japan we 
certainly would expect those to continue under any successor 
government 
socialist candidates were the main beneficiaries of voter 
discontent with the party that has spent 34 years in power 
socialist party secretary tsuruo yamaguchi said monday to avoid 
inviting further confusion the ldp must hand over the government 
to the opposition parties 
takako doi head of the party said she would call a meeting of 
opposition leaders to form a coalition to oppose the liberal 
democrats in the upper house the liberal democrats retain a 
comfortable majority in the lower house which chooses the prime 
minister and has most of the power and elections need not be held 
until july 1990 the governing party has 293 of the 512 seats 
leaders of the liberal democrats said the new party president 
who customarily becomes prime minister should not be chosen 
through the usual backroom politicking that led to unos nomination 
takeo fukuda a former prime minister who opposed choosing uno 
said the next leader should be elected by the partys parliament 
members 
shin kanemaru a former deputy prime minister and powerful party 
elder also was said to favor an election uno was chosen by 
kanemarus protege former prime minister noboru takeshita who had 
been chosen by unos mentor former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone 
takeshita resigned to take responsibility for the scandal in 
which the recruit co publishing conglomerate allegedly tried to 
buy influence with large political donations and cutrate stocks 
it took a month to decide on uno who was foreign minister and 
untouched by the recruit scandal as takeshitas replacement and 
few are willing to speculate about who might be the successor this 
time 
uno a colorless politician with no power base was seen as a 
safe choice after favored candidate masayoshi ito refused the job 
reports arose soon after he took office that he had kept paid 
mistresses and opposition grew among women already angry about the 
3 percent sales tax 
last month uno was said to have declared i didnt become 
prime minister because i wanted to and asked party leaders to 
let him step down 
he did not mention the sex scandal in his televised news 
conference monday but said he was resigning after the election 
defeat because the ultimate responsibility is mine 
it was a very difficult election he said asked how he felt 
after announcing his resignation uno said his mind was meikyo 
shisui a poetic phrase meaning tranquil as a mirror or still 
water 
of the 126 seats at stake in sundays election the socialists 
won 46 and the liberal democrats 36 according to final results 
announced monday evening socialist strength in the 252seat 
chamber rose from 43 to 66 and the liberal democrats declined from 
142 seats to 109 
the socialists ran only 54 candidates 
komeito clean government a centrist party won 10 seats the 
japan communist party 5 the centrist democratic socialists 3 and 
independents and minor parties 26 
rengo no kai confederation group a new party also hurt the 
liberal democrats badly it ran 12 candidates 11 of them won most 
in districts where the governing party usually does well 
most of the new partys backing comes from the rengo labor union 
any opposition coalition is expected to be fragile most parties 
oppose the sales tax but they differ on such issues as defense 
policy and relations with the united states 
in the past the socialists have favored disbanding military 
forces and scrapping the usjapan security treaty under which 
about 64000 american soldiers are stationed in japan 
socialist leaders now say they would seek only to revise the 
treaty but ms doi and others have said us warships should be 
inspected and denied entry to japanese ports if they carry nuclear 
arms

fans of beauty and the beast howled when 
cbs left it off its fall schedule but now the network has 
announced the weekly saga will return with a surprising twohour 
movie 
it is going to be a real corker and i dont want it to get 
out cbs entertainment president kim lemasters said of the movie 
plot saturday during a speech at a tv critics convention 
lemasters said the series about the love between a beautiful 
woman and a manbeast who lives in a subterranean world beneath new 
york city would veer away from the love story and that star linda 
hamilton would have a reduced presence 
miss hamilton is expecting a baby but lemasters would not say 
if she would return fulltime after her baby is born ron perlman 
plays the leonine shakespearequoting beast vincent 
lemasters said cbs kept the show in production because its 
one of the betterdone shows we have on the network he said it 
was initially dropped because executives thought the series had 
begun to implode on itself 
those stories between vincent and catherine just got more and 
more narrow and we were unable to explore issues that we want to 
explore we think that we have corrected the problem and what 
were going to do were going to relaunch it as a twohour movie 
that will have some rather stunning details attendant to it

golubdobrzyn poland ap these may be beleaguered days for 
poland but it does have its knights 
the 15th century came alive this weekend at an international 
tournament recalling the valor and vigor of a period of vast power 
for a day about 25000 people put aside their economic woes 
that beset modern poland to be transformed back to an era of 
pageantry with knights atop their steeds testing their jousting 
skills according to regulations culled from historic records 
it was the greatest age in polands history says zygumnt 
kwiatkowski director of the castle that was the site of an annual 
competition that saw knights from four countries in a pitched 
battle 
poland was independent then and was a peaceful superpower in 
europe he said poland never sought war with anyon and on the 
other hand it could counter any war threat 
the tournament has been staged since 1977 on the grounds of the 
hulking brick castle that rises from a bluff overlooking the 
apartment blocks of the central poland town of golubdobrzyn 
at their aid are damsels recruited from a local high school 
competitors with crossbows hatchets and pronged mallets and 
thousands of common spectators whose murmers of respect and rumor 
someone almost had his nose sliced off spread the spirit of 
the event 
when i see the knights i think about reviving old traditions 
of knighthood said kwiatkowski 
it is not only the clothes but also reviving the spirit the 
old traditions honesty keeping promises honor these are 
features that today have lost their value but without which it is 
hard to live he said 
though bogged down by the demands of a modern knightmanager 
the castle director says he could still get on a horse and defend 
the honor of the polish knight 
those responsibilities fall mainly to the likes of remigiusz 
postolski a 30yearold warsaw art restorer who with his teammates 
bested the knights from italy france and the soviet union 
knight paulo parici of arezzo italy was awarded the golden 
sword for individual performance at the close of hostilities sunday 
almost every boy in poland when he is small reads books and 
watches films about knights and their fights for me it passed into 
a more serious interest postolski said 
most of the weapons armor and costumes are made by hand and 
modern knights must make some accommodations suits of armor ended 
with reebok sneakers and one crossbow champion wore skintight 
leggings of hot pink and black spandex below his coat of mail 
theres also the problem of how to sit on a slatted bench with a 
dagger at ones side 
the castle too has met the modern age the knights pledge of 
princely competition is made by microphone and a tv antenna rises 
from the ramparts flags and tablets mark great dates in castle 
history 1296 1527 1965 
the castle is owned by a government tourist agency much 
reconstructed from the ravages wrought by time and neglect it is 
still in need of defense fortifications against tourists without 
tickets 
but the hobbyists are loyal to the legends starting in 1385 when 
poland united with lithuania under the jagiellonian kings ruled a 
vast swath of central europe from the baltic to the black sea and 
stretching east toward moscow 
it was a time of cultural and scientific advancement when 
nicolas copernicus discovered the earths rotation around the sun 
and the jagiellonian university was established in krakow 
but from a polish knights point of view the eras highlight 
was likely the victory over the infamous teutonic knights a 
germanic order first established in 1191 for the crusades 
the most famous confrontation the battle of grunwald on july 
15 1410 took place about 50 miles from the castle and the victory 
of the polish and lithuanian forces over the teutonic camp after 
a knightly prebattle exchange of swords has lived on into the 
modern history of three nations 
kwiatkowski is an animated and unabashed fan of the 15th century 
what about poverty its exaggerated we have much bigger 
extremes in wealth today 
what about pestilence what about aids he retorts 
we poles have a kind of attraction to tradition and history 
added postolski whose sword bore the nicks of a few friendly 
rounds at that time our country was a european superpower

a selfdescribed freedom fighter says 
his mission to aid the contra rebels fighting the nicaraguan 
government is back on track since a federal judge dismissed treaty 
violation charges against him 
the criminal indictment charging tom posey and five others with 
violating the neutrality act by supporting the contras was 
dismissed july 13 by a federal judge in fort lauderdale fla 
the neutrality act allows prosecution of anyone making war from 
us soil against a nation with which the united states is at peace 
but us district judge norman roettger agreed with the defense 
that the reagan administration waged war against the sandinistas in 
198485 despite congressional votes to cut off funds 
posey 44 a cofounder of civilian materiel assistance said in 
an interview in sundays editions of the birmingham news that his 
legal battles have ruined his produce business and cost him 
100000 in legal fees 
but he said hes not bitter and hasnt abandoned the goal he and 
a few conservatives set for themselves when they created cma in 
1984 fighting communism when where and how they can with 
central america first on the list 
although professing no bitterness posey does express some 
disillusionment with washington after all of his problems 
i look at the white house people as more worried about their 
retirement and reputation than truth and justice he said 
he president reagan is the one who said the buck stops here 
but when it got hot he let it pass on through posey said 
posey is preparing for the annual cma convention in madison aug 
36 where contra leader adolfo calero and at least two top contra 
field commanders will speak he is sending more than 1000 
invitations 
his budget comes primarily from the sale of cma caps shirts 
belt buckles and a recently completed videotape of the contras in 
action 
the tape features a sovietmade hind24 flying tank 
helicopter being shot down by contras armed with us redeye 
missiles 
posey said its the only known footage of the 
topoftheline soviet chopper going down cma literature promises 
that it will get your blood boiling 
posey said cmas activities will remain in the field of of 
supplying nonlethal support to the contra soldiers away from the 
field of battle

health and safety officials have broadened their 
inspection of the plant where the boeing co builds sections of the 
b2 stealth bomber to include virtually all aspects of boeings 
work on the topsecret plane 
state and federal inspectors have been trying to determine if 
chemicals and fiberglasslike composite materials used to make the 
radarevading bomber pose a health threat to boeing employees 
washington department of labor and industries spokeswoman 
barbara dunn said last week that two state inspectors have made 
about five visits to boeings developmental center and expect to 
make more 
two inspectors from us occupational safety and health 
administration also are examining parts of the south seattle plant 
while the original inspection focused on the composite 
materials the states effort has been expanded to all aspects of 
b2 construction including examining machinery and looking for any 
safety hazards ms dunn said 
air samples have been taken inside the plant to check for 
chemical levels and employees are being interviewed about possible 
problems she said 
no complaints have been received from workers at the 
highsecurity plant ms dunn said adding we just want to make 
sure that were covering all the bases 
earlier this year lockheed corp was fined nearly 15 million 
by osha following inspections at its aeronautical systems co plant 
in burbank calif that plant produces a plane technologically 
similar to the b2 the f117a stealth fighter 
boeings work on the stealth bomber is as a subcontractor for 
the main builder northrop corp of los angeles 
by law ms dunn said state officials cannot release results of 
the inspection until it is complete and boeing has been informed of 
the findings she said the work probably will be completed by late 
july or early august 
the plant inspection is being done at the request of rep norm 
dicks dwash who was concerned about the safety of chemicals 
used in aerospace construction 
the inspection began june 6 about two weeks later than 
originally planned the delay occurred when the defense department 
denied the state inspectors access to some of the areas because 
they did not have security clearances and osha inspectors had to be 
brought in ms dunn said 
the boeing co would have allowed us in it was essentially 
the department of defense that denied us entry she said 
the seattle postintelligencer has quoted unidentified plant 
workers as saying the delay was used to clean and fix up shop areas 
in anticipation of the inspection 
the walls were wiped down new tops were put on the tables 
it was nothing like our normal working condititions the 
newspaper quoted one employee as saying 
we did not issue directives to go and do anything unusual 
said john kvasnosky spokesman for boeing advanced systems which 
operates the developmental center the company has safety and 
housekeeping operations that take place continually he said 
richard terrill assistant regional administrator for osha 
declined to say what his inspectors were examining citing security 
reasons but he said oshas role was very limited involving 
only a small portion of the plant 
terrill said oshas work should be finished in about a month 
in the past year dozens of boeing commercial airplanes 
employees at an auburn plant who worked with phenol formaldehyde 
complained of a variety of ailments ranging from dizziness and 
rashes to memory loss the chemical was used to make luggage bins 
and other jet interior parts 
air sampling at the plant found formaldehyde levels well within 
federal standards but boeing discontinued use of the chemical and 
improved ventilation at the plant 
phenol formaldehyde has not been used at boeing advanced 
systems kvasnosky said

the desert tortoise in utah and other 
western states was placed on critical endangered species status 
monday because it is threatened by a fatal respiratory disease a 
congressional aide said 
the action taken by steve robinson acting director of the us 
fish and wildlife service was expected to anger cattle ranchers 
worried about the declarations possible impact on their grazing 
rights on federal land where the tortoise is found 
the designation applied to the mojave population of the tortoise 
west and north of the colorado river including those in southern 
utah southern california nevada and northwestern arizona said 
rick guldan spokesman for rep james hansen rutah 
the sonoran desert tortoise population located south and east 
of the colorado river in arizona and new mexico was not affected 
guldan said 
the emergency designation means all the protections of the 
endangered species act immediately go into effect for 240 days 
fish and wildlife studies found desert tortoise populations in 
the western mojave have declined 58 percent since 1985 because of 
the respiratory disease 
before the designation was announced fish and wildlife 
officials said the agency had been petitioned by environmental 
activists concerned about the outbreak of the disease which had 
been seen before only in tortoises in captivity 
jim middaugh spokesman for the environmental defense fund said 
the disease may have been spread by someone releasing a captive 
tortoise into the wild his group filed a lawsuit in federal court 
for the district of columbia last week seeking to force the 
department of interior to protect the tortoise

the investigation of senior diplomat 
felix s bloch on suspicion he spied for the soviets has again 
turned the spotlight on vienna as a hotbed of eastwest espionage 
and intrigue 
orson welles depiction of harry lime in the 1949 film the 
third man stamped on the minds of millions an image of devious 
dealings in the austrian capital which like berlin was divided 
into british french american and soviet sectors after world war 
ii 
former nazis and refugees from eastern europe struggled to 
survive in the postwar turmoil selling knowledge to any side that 
would pay and helping to weave a net of intrigue 
the soviets withdrew their forces from austria in 1955 but they 
left behind a large embassy and many other offices that western 
intelligence agencies always have viewed as potential helpers of 
the kgb and the gru soviet military intelligence 
intelligence sources in washington say nearly every american 
taken to court on charges of spying for the soviets in the past 
five years had come to vienna to meet kgb officers 
the soviets are as aware as the americans that these trips often 
are part of the evidence used by the fbi some intelligence sources 
believe therefore that one purpose of the trip to vienna is to 
get a blackmail hold over the american threatening exposure of a 
hardtoexplain journey if he wants to wriggle out of his deal with 
the kgb 
americans who have made vienna trips include ronald pelton the 
national security agency officer who tipped moscow to a system that 
hid us submarines from soviet radar and john walker head of the 
family spy ring in the us navy 
court documents in the walker case included written instructions 
from the kgb about how to drop information including a 
detailed description of doing a walking pass on a vienna street 
it was also in vienna that marine clayton lonetree confessed to 
a security breach in the us embassy in moscow 
a soviet defector who worked for the gru in vienna in the 1970s 
described moscows elaborate intelligence network in the austrian 
capital in a 1985 memoir aquarium published in britain 
viktor suvorov not his real name said detailed procedures were 
worked out to avoid immediate identification by austrian and other 
security services in vienna of agents in the embassy 
he estimated about 80 percent of all soviets in vienna where 
moscow has an aeroflot office trade representations and a large 
diplomatic presence at the united nations engaged in other 
work outside their official duties 
part of the elaborate coverup of soviet intelligence work 
according to suvorov was to assign active agents such as himself 
mostly to work outside austria 
but most of the work he said focused on acquiring western 
technology and contingency plans for military or economic crises 
it is not known what information if any bloch handed to the 
soviets during his seven years in vienna where he arrived in 1980 
as head of the us embassys economics section he became deputy 
chief of mission a post he held for years before returning to 
washington in 1987 
however his position would have put bloch a native austrian 
who left the country at age 3 with his jewish parents at the 
center of sensitive usaustrian negotiations over the illegal 
transfer of western technology through vienna to the east bloc 
several viennese shipping agents and firms have come under 
scrutiny in the past decade amid us allegations they helped the 
soviets and their allies to acquire technology that was banned for 
export to the east 
austrian intelligence sources say they do keep a careful watch 
for illegal activities austrian foreign minister alois mock a 
close friend of bloch bristled monday when reporters suggested 
vienna was a hotbed of spying 
these regrettable events are not more numerous than 
elsewhere mock said allowing however that vienna is perhaps 
exposed because of its geographical position just an hours 
ride from the czechoslovak and hungarian borders 
there are tens of thousands of soviet and east european 
scientists emigres diplomats and other officials in vienna 
making blanket surveillance tough 
in 1981 soviet researcher arkady belozerov denied reports he 
had spied but caused a stir when he resigned from a post at the 
prestigious institute for applied systems analysis a 17nation 
project south of vienna that has attracted hundreds of soviet 
researchers since it was set up in 1972 
a neighboring institute in the same town of laxenburg was in the 
news the same year when josef hodic a czechoslovak historian who 
had been granted asylum in austria as a signatory of the charter 77 
human rights appeal suddenly disappeared 
hodic turned up in prague where staterun media said he had 
been working all along as a czechoslovak agent 
one of the most mysterious cases centered on vienna was that of 
nikolai shadrin said to have been a russian defector turned double 
agent for fbi and kgb 
shadrin disappeared when he went to vienna to meet two kgb 
agents in december 1975 the disappearance did not become public 
until july 1977 when shadrins polishborn wife said he had been 
kidnapped and appealed for help to get him back 
the us government pledged its assistance but has never 
disclosed shadrins fate

adding the situation became acute 
most stores and other businesses appeared to be open but irakli 
tseretel a leader of the georgian party of national independence 
and a rally organizer claimed 33 factories were closed including 
two military plants 
tseretels report could not be confirmed and three other

arrests of those responsible for attacks on ethnic georgians in 
abkhazia a separate administrative area within the republic 
an editor at the georgian news agency gruzinform said buses did 
not appear monday morning in some regions of tbilisi but that 
service was normal by midday 
the interrupted bus service appeared linked to a transit strike 
including a railway walkout that began over the weekend and ended 
monday tass the official news agency said the rail strike 
stranded thousands of people 
several hundred people demonstrated throughout the day in 
central tbilisi protesting the violence in abkhazia 
when those abkhazians started to knife georgians it just 
drove us out of our minds said the news agency editor nana 
gelashvili 
tass said no armed clashes had been reported in georgia or 
abkhazia for two days but it reported more confiscations of 
weapons from extremists by internal security troops and police 
authorities seized 104 rifles and more than 500 pounds of 
explosives in the previous 24 hours and found a cache of 130 pounds 
of explosives and 6500 feet of detonating cable near the abkhazian 
village of gvandra tass said 
residents of abkhazia voluntarily turned in 744 firearms the 
agency reported 
nineteen people have been reported killed and more than 400 
injured since july 15 in clashes between warring georgians and 
abkhazians in the seaside resort area 880 miles south of moscow 
two regional communist party secretaries and two government 
leaders in abkhazia were dismissed saturday 
each ethnic group blames the other for the trouble abkhazians 
a minority in their own region want more economic independence and 
cultural rights georgians insist the enclave remain part of their 
caucasus republic 
during the past month at least 132 people have been killed in 
ethnic unrest in the southern soviet republics of georgia

townspeople are collecting money to help 
their parttime police chief who was hurt in the line of duty but 
checked out of the hospital because the town doesnt have insurance 
chief alfred h rodda whose jaw was fractured in three places 
when he was slugged by a man he arrested for refusing to pay a 24 
restaurant tab said monday hes having trouble making ends meet 
things are kind of tough right now because i support the 
family during the summer driving a truck and i cant work rodda 
said in a telephone interview 
rodda 52 was hospitalized for two weeks with a broken jaw 
brain swelling and other head injuries but he checked out july 14 
when he learned the town of 600 in the berkshire hills doesnt have 
insurance to cover officers hurt in the line of duty 
selectmen declined to discuss the chiefs claim at a meeting 
thursday board chairman eleanor patterson instead read a statement 
which said in part certainly the town is grateful for the 30 
years of service mr rodda has devoted to the town 
officials declined to comment on the case on advice of town 
attorney sarah bell ms bell did not return telephone calls to her 
office friday and monday 
residents are pitching in to help the chief 
a can for donations has been set out at town hall and the 
jiminy peak ski resort is organizing a raffle to raise money for 
his medical bills said marketing director larry dubin 
its a small town and we all know that if it was someone else 
in trouble that hed be in the front of the line helping out 
dubin said 
organizers dont know how much money has been raised 
rodda keeps the peace on an oncall basis and for most of 30 
years hasnt charged the town for his services the towns two 
other parttime officers have refused to work since the chiefs 
injury 
the townspeople are all for me rodda said theyll 
eventually get after the selectmen and ill sue if i have to 
roddas attorney francis x spina said monday that state law 
provides little protection for volunteer firefighters or parttime 
police 
people who serve as police and firefighters in small towns are 
at a tremendous disadvantage if they get hurt in the line of 
duty spina said im not sure if they or the towns really 
understand how much of a disadvantage 
if selectmen reject his claim for medical expenses which rodda 
said now exceeds 10000 and time lost from work the chief can 
sue spina said state compensation laws appear to put a 3000 
annual limit on payments for time lost from a regular job by 
volunteer firefighters and special police 
you cant support a family on 3000 a year spina said 
its less than welfare 
rodda still needs surgery to repair his jaw 
when the chief was hit june 30 his head slammed against the 
pavement when he fell 
five witnesses captured the alleged assailant william finn 38 
of pittsfield finn who had been at the berkshire county jail 
awaiting trial was transferred to northampton state hospital for 
psychiatric tests last week after allegedly attacking a guard

la cellesaintcloud france ap cambodian prime minister hun 
sen told resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk on monday that 
there wont be any role for khmer rouge guerrillas in an interim 
government 
at a news conference following four hours of meetings hun sen 
said the discussion failed to produce any results but noted more 
talks were scheduled tuesday sihanouk said there was complete 
disagreement 
the encounter was designed to pave way for an international 
conference toward ending the 10yearold war in cambodia by setting 
up a transition government 
the monthlong conference begins sunday two months before 
vietnamese troops backing hun sens promoscow government are to 
complete their withdrawal 
the meeting between the two leaders at an 18th century chateau 
in this paris suburb is to be expanded tuesday to include hun sen 
and leaders of the threefaction resistance coalition sihanouk 
son sann of the noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation 
front and khieu samphan the nominal chief of the chinesebacked 
communist khmer rouge since the reported resignation of former 
leader pol pot 
the khmer rouge under pol pot was responsible for the deaths of 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians during a threeyear reign that 
ended with the vietnamese invasion in december 1978 
sihanouk continues to insist on including the khmer rouge in an 
interim government made up of the three resistance groups and hun 
sens government he contends that giving the strongest of the 
three guerrilla groups a place in the power structure is the price 
of avoiding renewed civil war 
hun sen disagrees 
we think such a version simply signifies making the cambodian 
people hostage to the khmer rouge he said our position is 
that we are not hostages of pol pot and we will not let the 
interests of the cambodian people be bargained against the pol 
pottists 
hun sen said he and sihanouk took two steps backward at 
mondays meeting but he refused to call it a failure noting 
discussions would continue tuesday 
besides the future role of the khmer rouge other issues on the 
agenda include discussion of a ceasefire and a mechanism to 
monitor the withdrawal of the remaining vietnamese troops in 
cambodia estimated at up to 70000 
the cambodian prime minister blamed the impasse on sihanouks 
insistance that as coalition president he was representing three 
parties in agreements reached at previous meetings sihanouk 
represented only himself 
hun sen said there should be only two cambodian delegations to 
the peace talks his government and sihanouks coalition government 
of democratic kampuchea 
sihanouk has the backing of many western nations including the 
united states and the sixmember association of southeast asian 
nations or asean there has been growing international support for 
reaching a settlement that does not include the khmer rouge 
in washington the state department said secretary of state 
james a baker iii will attend the opening session of the 
international conference sunday and a spokeswoman reiterated us 
opposition to a khmer rouge role in an interim government 
the conference is to include the cambodian leaders plus all five 
permament members of the un security council the united states 
the soviet union china britain and france as well as india 
japan canada and australia and members of asean indonesia 
thailand malaysia philippins brunei and singapore 
as he left the chateau sihanouk said the resistance coalition 
intended to keep fighting 
the exiled prince deposed in 1970 said that after the sept 30 
vietnamese withdrawal 130000 vietnamese troops will remain in the 
country hidden in the cambodian army 
hun sens delegation distributed a copy of a ceasefire protocal 
under discussion however as late as friday sihanouk rejected a 
ceasefire so long as armed vietnamese remain in cambodia

transportation secretary samuel skinner called 
on monday for a revolution in transportation possibly 
including highspeed rail systems but a private analyst said the 
car will remain king 
skinner launched a series of nationwide hearings aimed at 
drawing up a national transportation policy for rail highway air 
and water travel meetings are to be held in large and small cities 
throughout the country through midseptember 
the first one in a washington auditorium featured the heads of 
some of the countrys biggest airline railroad and automobile 
companies and nebraska gov kay orr who said the whole system is a 
handymans special 
if the nations system of roads rails waterways and airports 
were listed in a real estate ad she said it would say lots of 
potential oldstyle craftsmanship with many modern conveniences 
but needs work a real fixerupper 
skinner who moderated the first session and will attend some of 
the other meetings said a decision to build highspeed rail 
systems is one possible result of the effort this could include 
trains that travel up to 300 mph particularly between cities where 
air travel has reached maximum levels 
it is time for a new revolution in transportation and 
hopefully it will be a peaceful revolution said skinner 
in an interview prior to the meeting skinner said the nations 
airports highways bridges waterways and mass transit systems are 
simply wearing out 
were going to have to rebuild it and replace it or were not 
going to be able to rely on it anymore he said 
among the most critical problems skinner said are a lack of 
planning for new airports and neglect of 80 billion worth of work 
needed on deteriorating bridges 
william b johnston senior research fellow at the hudson 
institute told the opening session that no new system is in the 
wings that will revolutionize transportation within the next 25 
years so old systems have to be made more efficient 
he said the fastest growth is in suburban areas as urban density 
continues to decline and automobile use increases the hudson 
institute is a washington think tank that has studied several 
national issues including transportation needs 
the country has become ever more tied to its personal 
ondemand pointtopoint transportation system automobiles 
johnston said 
despite oil shortages and price increases the lamentations of 
many environmentalists and urban planners and multibillion dollar 
federal investments in urban transit nothing has dented the 
dominance of the automobile he said 
general motors president robert c stempel said gm and other 
companies are studying smart cars and smart highways that would 
be computerized for increased safety and efficiency 
in the meantime he said some simple things can be done to 
improve road travel in many areas traffic light coordination 
improved toll road payment procedures and clearer and brighter 
highway signs and markings 
the transportation department is inviting citizens with ideas 
about how to move americans in the 21st century and about how to 
pay for the changes to attend the hearings around the country or 
to send written proposals to the transportation department 
the transportation secretary said he doesnt want the sessions 
to turn into a littany of complaints 
you shouldnt go if youre just going to say weve got 
gridlock somebody ought to do something about it because we know 
that skinner said these are needs and idea sessions 
the first meeting outside washington will be held in moscow 
idaho on tuesday with the focus on rural transportation issues 
the last meetings will be in boston on sept 1112 and will deal 
with drug and alcohol use in the commercial transportation system 
and federal research and development

tommy clack the disabled american veterans 
man of 1989 has spent 10 years trying to do for other veterans 
what some caring people did for him 
clack who will be recognized sunday as the davs outstanding 
disabled veteran for 1989 has worked for the past decade at 
atlantas veterans administration medical center where he spent 
much of his 21month recovery following a battle injury in vietnam 
that claimed both legs and one arm 
to come back here this isnt just a job clack said 
its an opportunity to serve veterans 
its a unique opportunity to work at the level i work at and 
see the continued goodness we do said clack an assistant to the 
director of the atlanta va since 1979 i think we deliver the 
finest health care in the world today i did when i was a patient 
and i still do 
the 42yearold stone mountain man who holds silver star 
bronze star and purple heart medals has spoken about veterans 
issues in all 50 states and isnt shy about discussing much of 
anything including his disability but hed rather talk of 
opportunities ahead than dwell on an injury 20 years ago 
god left me with my brain intact my mouth in gear and my left 
arm to be independent what else do we need in life he said 
were lucky to be alive and lets go forward 
clack was active in politics for several years working in the 
campaigns of us sen sam nunn and georgia secretary of state max 
cleland among others until his job with the federal va forced him 
to curtail his politicking he misses it i always busted my buns 
for whoever i believed in he said 
last year he was cochairman of the committee to erect 
georgias vietnam veterans memorial at the state capitol 
clack who was serving in the armys 25th infantry division in 
vietnam when an exploding shell hit him persevered through a long 
recovery and more than 30 operations 
when i was laid up in bed and not expected to live there 
were many times when id wake up and somebody to my right or my 
left or across from me had died he said obviously ive got 
a lot to be thankful for 
clack will be honored sunday at the dav national convention in 
las vegas 
its nice to be selected but the countrys full of 
outstanding veterans who never get recognized he said 
to me getting awards is not where life really is if we go 
through life doing the best we can do were always going to be 
ahead of the game thats how i play every day of life

luncheon monday night bush and his wife barbara were attending 
a committee dinner 
the committee is working on a bill whose chief aim is to raise 
53 billion in new revenues for deficit reduction next year 
needless to say the democratcontrolled panel chaired by rep

the revolt of japanese voters against the liberal 
democratic party gave a strong boost to the socialists but 
analysts say it was far more conservative than the result would 
indicate 
in sundays election the conservative liberal democrats lost 
their majority in the upper house of parliament for the first time 
since the party was formed 34 years ago 
the socialists gained 24 seats thanks to support from women 
farmers and others disgruntled with the governing partys scandals 
and economic policies 
a record number of women candidates 22 won their races 
socialist party chairman takako doi attracted adoring crowds of 
women who wore pink scarves and applauded her criticism of the 
liberal democrats 
when sousuke uno announced his resignation monday women reveled 
in their role in helping remove him their anger over allegations 
that he had kept paid mistresses hampered unos efforts to restore 
his partys reputation after an influencebuying scandal forced 
predecessor noboru takeshita to quit less than two months ago 
breadandbutter issues appeared to be even more important 
i really believe that this was a peoples revolution coming 
from the kitchen said kazuo shinsaka of the laborbacked rengo 
no kai a new party who won election in nara 
the socialists dont propose nationalizing industries or 
equalizing incomes but talk of restoring faith in politics 
repealing the new 3 percent sales tax reestablishing protection 
for farmers who complain about more open import policies and 
improving the environment 
many women candidates campaigned not as feminists but as 
ordinary housewives defending their homes against the sales tax 
what this vote shows is that people want a return to the 
status quo said seisaburo sato a political analyst it was 
the ldp that tried to change things 
kuniko inoguchi and other analysts said the economic prosperity 
that has characterized more than three decades of liberal 
democratic government may have encouraged the discontent 
when the economy is good people can afford to be critical 
inoguchi said they can afford to worry about issues of justice 
the ldp had modern policies but closed premodern political 
practices they were telling everybody to adjust to change 
economic liberalization and internationalization but didnt make 
an effort to change themselves 
although the liberal democrats still may have a protectionist 
reputation abroad they have made major changes in the past few 
years usually under foreign pressure 
beginning four years ago the government helped the yen rise and 
import barriers fall enough to transform the structure of the 
economy and hurt important groups such as the farmers 
economic growth still robust now comes more from domestic 
consumption and investment than exports 
japanese are richer than ever before and mamanufactured imports 
have increased 78 percent since 1985 protection of agriculture is 
being chipped away 
a tax reform package many experts consider economically sound 
but clumsily introduced has given salaried workers more money to 
spend and may help bring japans economy more in line with those of 
its trading partners the sales tax part has outraged housewives 
however 
women seek change in several areas they have joined the labor 
force in record numbers helped by an equal opportunity law but 
often in poorly paid parttime jobs 
affluence has meant free time and more education but women are 
angered by lingering discrimination exemplified by agriculture 
minister hisao horinouchis recent remark that they are useless 
in politics

extravagant was the name of the game monday as 
couturiers took a trip to dreamland in their winter shows 
with the bicentennial of the french revolution designers seem 
intent on bringing back clothes fit for a queen 
the biggest news was at dior as the italian couturier 
gianfranco ferre nearly brought down the tent in an outdoor show at 
the gardens of the salomonrothschild foundation ferre named in 
may to replace marc bohan was chosen to add excitement to the 
worlds most prestigious label 
ferre obviously made the grade with his opulent collection of 
fitted clothes that led off with a waistcinching fitted black 
crepe redingote topped with a stovepipe hat he finally wound up in 
a dioresque whirl of strapless ball gowns with tulle petticoats 
wrapped sable stoles and jackets plus huge organza bows and 
bouquets of lily of the valley a favorite at dior 
ferre managed to combine all the sumptuous fabrics and furs in 
rigorously constructed clothes that looked both retrospective and 
beautifully modern he did a marvelous job of making red or pearl 
gray persian lamb look like embroidered lace on a sexy strapless 
sheath evening gown he made fitted suits of creamybeige ostrich 
leather look soft and feminine 
ferre showed skirt lengths flatteringly around midknee for 
daytime or opted for dressy trousers above the ankle 
arms were slim under shoulders with a whisper of padding for 
shape whether caped ball gowns satin trousers or tweed suits in 
bold herringbones with sparkly sequins the dior line looked fit to 
win 
hem lengths were irrelevant in most of the dazzling parades of 
lucre 
its a trip abroad a dream said jeanlouis scherrer who 
decked out his daughter and favorite model laetitia like a 
glamorous toy soldier complete with gold tasseled epaulets and 
braidedged cap 
scherrer also was on the road to india which he trod a few 
years ago this time it was richer than ever with lameshot sari 
silks and chiffons galloonedged boleros rich shades of panne 
velvet and persian embroideries worn with silk and gold lame 
turbans 
you could wear this with jeans said scherrer gesturing to 
a richly braided military jacket with gold frog buttons 
chocolate is hot for next winter and scherrer went all out for 
the browns jazzing them up with shades of red from flame and coral 
to cyclamen plus some peacock and royal blue 
balmains designer erik mortensen also used prodigious amounts 
of expensive fabrics in a successful extravaganza the man who 
practically reinvented shorts for couture went in for a 
pedalpusher pants making them extraordinarily beautiful with 
their toppers of bright teal blue pistachio or flameflared 
jackets with bold buttons and funnel collars 
mortensen pulled off a clever trick by covering bodies with full 
tentlike shapes then baring legs clad in tights with gold persian 
embroidery up the sides among the memorable coats were the 
grayblackwhite pyramids in mohair and mongolian goat and the 
redandgreen lacy models tufted with marabout or ostrich fun but 
not very warm 
the gold copper and lame stiffened silk dresses stiffened like 
thin sheets of metal were draped perfectly slit up the leg for 
walking but they also dragged fishtailtrains better for standing 
around than circulating at a cocktail party 
but even with piling on fabrics stiff ruffles and sparkling 
details mortensen made it all look floaty and light 
pierre cardin got an enthusiastic hand for his winter 
collection which sparkled with enough titillating geometric 
details to evoke his old magic 
he obviously was tired of short skirts showing very few he 
preferred a midcalf narrow skirt or else simply no skirt at all 
just a long jacket over tights or slightly flared pants 
shoulders were natural or eclipsed by important collars always 
a strong point with cardin who knows how to play with shapes like 
a kid with cutouts 
the coats often had kimono or handkerchief sleeves and some had 
tiered skirts under a narrow bust 
the favorite waistline was dropped to the hip emphasized by a 
narrow leather belt the coat gathered like a ruffle beneath it 
the fun popped up in highcollared short coats edged at the 
armhole in fake fur or mongolian lamb in leatherbanded sleeveless 
sweatercoats or in caped poncho looks 
evening wear by andre oliver was just as rich using stiffened 
hoops and pleats the basic cardin shapes oliver sculpted some 
dashing ladies of the night in chantilly lace fuschia and 
pistachio taffeta diaphanous chiffon 
and they were topped by funny hats the favorite ones a pillbox 
big as a hatbox wrapped in satin ribbon and a mortarboard tied 
with a scarf

house for a pep talk as lawmakers prepared for congressional floor 
action on military spending measures 
although bush said defense programs are complicated 
expensive he urged full funding for the pentagons fiscal 
program already defense secretary dick cheney has made some 
important cuts in defense bush said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee praised cheney for making tough choices in killing six 
or seven programs 
the committee has been willing to bite a part of that bullet 
too he said adding we hope the senate will stick with us 
because we have basically backed the cheney budget 
among the potential targets of congressional budgetcutters are 
the b2 bomber known as the stealth the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars and how much money to give the 
railmobile mx missiles or the singlewarhead midgetman 
the expensive b2 each plane is expected to cost more than 
500 million has been criticized by some lawmakers but bush 
called the radarevading plane a revolutionary technology that 
is vital to the nations defense 
he said he could justify the b2 expense because when you look 
at the full defense program i want to have maximum flexibility as 
we have arms control negotiations 
the administrations defense outline calls for 132 bombers at a 
cost of 702 billion for fiscal 1990 bush wants to spend 47 
billion but the house armed services committee has already cut 
800 million from the program last week bush made his pitch to 
members of the house panel 
sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee said he is hopeful the 
administration will get money for three bombers in the current 
round the plane made its first flight last week in palmdale calif 
we put fences around the b2 nunn said we want to make 
sure that the plane performs as advertised both in terms of its 
flying ability and also in terms of its stealth characteristics 
which are crucial 
nunn also said the senate panel supports complete research and 
development of the v22 known as the osprey but it wants to 
withhold advanced procurement money until it is determined the 
tiltrotor aircraft can be used commercially 
the senators want to see if someone other than the taxpayer is 
going to put up some money nunn said

the general agreement between mexico and its 
creditor banks offers a glimmer of hope to the debtstrapped third 
world but the success of the plan hinges on how far the banks are 
ultimately willing to go government officials and private bankers 
said monday 
the bush administration which provided a final push over the 
weekend to get the agreement hailed the package as a landmark 
success for its debtreduction initiative unveiled by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady on march 10 
however the banks that will implement the plan were more 
reserved in their enthusiasm with many contending that it was too 
soon to say how much debt relief they will provide to mexico 
because they were still examining the fine print of the agreement 
at the moment were exploring our options fraser seitel a 
spokesman for chase manhattan corp said in a typical comment 
were looking at the entire third world debt package 
the bush administration hopes to use the mexican agreement to 
set a precedent that will facilitate debt relief in other 
countries with venezuela and the philippines considered the two 
leading candidates to follow mexicos lead 
the administration has made debt reduction a key component of 
its foreign policy believing that the only way to insure the 
survival of emerging democracies in latin america is to find a way 
to reverse the decadelong slide in living standards caused by the 
crushing 13 trillion third world debt burden 
the brady plan for debt relief seeks to slash this debt by 
establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily 
forgive a portion of the loans 
however banking analysts said it was unclear whether the 
incentives being offered in the mexican package were sufficient to 
trigger a substantial writedown of the debt 
in the case of mexico the debtreduction package provides the 
commercial banks with three options 
on the debtrelief side the banks can cut 35 percent off the 
face value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce 
interest rates to 625 percent down from about 10 percent 
currently 
banks also have the option of simply providing new loans 
the administration estimated that the various options could save 
mexico about 15 billion annually off the 5 billion to 55 
billion it must pay to service its 54 billion in commercial bank 
debt 
however the administration stressed that this was a rough 
estimate and would vary depending on individual decisions made by 
the 500 commercial banks in the united states japan and europe 
that hold the mexican debt 
rep charles schumer dny and a leading congressional expert 
on third world debt said that the mexican agreement appeared 
seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for 
banks to opt for the two debtreduction options rather than simply 
piling on new debt 
a lot of the banks without the necessary carrots or sticks 
are going to stick with the familiar approach of supplying new 
money to pay old debt schumer said 
schumer said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the 
last seven years since 1982 when the debt crisis first erupted 
third world debt has more than doubled from 600 billion to 13 
trillion 
rep john lafalce dny said the mexican agreement did not 
represent any longlasting breakthrough in mexicos debt 
situation he said that while the amount of debtreduction was 
likely to be small mexico would benefit in the next couple of 
years with an infusion of money to get its economy started again 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgraw hill said that the 
administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as it 
could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to get 
an agreement 
it looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get 
something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work 
she said it is a surface agreement that allows the 
administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered 
questions 
the administration had hoped that president bush would be able 
to present a completed mexican package during the sevennation 
economic summit last week in paris 
when that deadline was missed brady stepped up his lobbying 
efforts he brought the bankers and mexican negotiators to 
washington over the weekend for meetings at the treasury which 
were also attended by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
after two days of discussions at the treasury final agreement 
was reached late sunday in time for mexican president carlos 
salinas de gortari to announce the breakthrough during a televised 
broadcast saying the proposal would answer the the cry of 
mexicans to return to growth

the government monday lifted 
3weekold censorship restrictions on reporting ethnic violence but 
told journalists to censor themselves 
also monday authorities halted a rally by about 600 sinhalese 
buddhist monks who were demanding the expulsion of indian 
peacekeeping troops no violence was reported 
the monks organization which claims to represent 25000 
members said it is prepared to join an armed struggle to oust the 
indian forces monk are an important political force in sri lanka 
the governments announcement that censorship was being lifted 
came 26 hours after the slaying of its chief censor themis guruge 
he was shot to death sunday while walking near his home 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity blamed 
the slaying of guruge who also headed staterun radio on 
sinhalese extremists foreign minister ranjan wijeratne informed 
local newspaper editors that censorship had been lifted but he 
also warned them be more responsible and maintain 
selfcensorship especially on subversive activities and the indian 
issue 
the censorship had taken heavy criticism from both government 
and opposition lawmakers 
the july 6 announcement of censorship on domestic and foreign 
press coincided with worsening ethnic violence and a deepening 
dispute with india sri lanka has demanded that india pull out 
40000 soldiers deployed as a peacekeeping force 
president ranasinghe premadasa has denounced the indian military 
presence in his nation as a threat to sri lankas sovereignty and 
demanded a pullout by the end of july 
indian peacekeepers arrived in sri lanka two years ago at the 
invitation of premadasas predecessor president junius r 
jayewardene 
india has long said it does not intend to keep its force here 
indefinitely but prime minister rajiv gandhi has said a premature 
withdrawal would lead to even more bloodshed 
more than 15000 people have been killed in ethnic violence that 
started with a separatist revolt by ethnic tamil guerrillas in 1983 
about 11000 people have died in the tamil insurrection 
including 1000 indian soldiers according to the government 
sinhalese extremists killed 4000 people mostly sinhalese 
government officials and supporters in a backlash against what 
they perceived as excessive concessions to the tamils 
the militant sinhalese have been led by the peoples liberation 
front 
during censorship most references to the front or to sinhalese 
radicals were removed from news stories 
tamils who make up about 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people say they are discriminated against by sinhalese the 
majority sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population 
dominating the government and military 
during their rally the saffronrobed monks were defying a ban 
on such protests they pushed past a line of police and sat on the 
narrow lane outside the sri mahabodhi temple in the capital 
colombo 
earlier their sri lanka national bhikkhu federation issued a 
statement saying thousands of monks were prepared to join an armed 
struggle to preserve sri lankan sovereignty from what it called 
the indian army of invasion 
before the rally a 25year old monk who declined to give his 
name told a news conference in the temple compound that the monks 
federation had decided to join militant sinhalese extremists and 
student groups in opposing the government and the presence of 
indian peacekeepers 
we do not believe the indian army would go back on just a 
request the monk said we believe that we have to take further 
action and we are prepared to do it 
asked if the monks condoned violence he said if an armed 
struggle is demanded to gain the freedom of the people the bhikku 
federation does approve and will participate in it

the justice department said monday it 
supported a tenfold increase in the maximum fine for criminal 
antitrust violations by corporations to 10 million 
the department noting it is conducting more than 150 grand jury 
investigations of alleged criminal antitrust violations said an 
increase was needed to deter price fixing bid rigging and unlawful 
attempts by corporations to control the market on certain products 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement that he 
supported legislation pending in congress that would increase the 
maximum fine from 1 million to 10 million for corporate antitrust 
violations 
this increase in penalties will send a strong signal to those 
who intend to defraud american consumers or the federal government 
through criminal antitrust conspiracies that the justice department 
takes their criminal conduct most seriously and will see that they 
are appropriately punished thornburgh said 
he issued the statement on the eve of a senate judiciary 
committee hearing on antitrust issues 
the proposal to increase the maximum corporate fine was 
contained in legislation sponsored by sens howard metzenbaum 
dohio and strom thurmond rsc 
james f rill the new assistant attorney general in charge of 
the justice departmentsantitrust division is scheduled to testify 
at tuesdays hearing 
rill noted in a statement that it has been 15 years since 
criminal fines for coprorate antitrust offenders were raised and a 
sizeable increase in fines now is a good way to underscore that 
this criminal activity will not be tolerated 
the fines apply to criminal antitrust violations such as price 
fixing and bid rigging which rill noted is undertaken purely to 
defraud its victims and has no possible economic justification 
rill noting that the antitrust division is conducting more than 
150 grand jury investigations of suspected criminal violations 
said current fines do not appear to be adequately deterring this 
unlawful conduct

staterun tv on monday broadcast the governments 
first documentary account of the events leading up to its bloody 
suppression of prodemocracy protests in early june 
the first hour of the fourpart series a test of blood and 
fire was as remarkable for what it left out as for what it 
included 
it didnt show the students singing the national anthem which 
they did constantly 
it also didnt show posters attacking corruption and nepotism 
or banners proclaiming the protesters love for china 
footage shown in the program unlike earlier official reports 
did show premier li peng hanging in effigy and banners mocking 
senior leader deng xiaoping 
in the first two weeks after the crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators june 34 that left hundreds or perhaps thousands 
dead staterun tv repeatedly showed angry crowds stoning troops 
and setting army vehicles on fire mondays was the first official 
documentary account of the events leading up to june 3 that 
purported to put the student movement into perspective 
some events in the documentary were shown out of sequence 
apparently to strengthen the governments argument that the student 
marches were instigated by anticommunist intellectuals 
dissident intellectuals who remained on the sidelines until the 
last stages of the protests were portrayed as speaking to students 
much earlier than they did 
apparently to support government claims that the studentled 
protests were orchestrated many months in advance by dissidents 
such as fang lizhi the program began by showing students 
discussing democratic reforms at forums last winter 
fang and his wife physics professor li shuxian were shown at 
that time speaking to the students fang and li did not appear in 
public support of the later protests sparked by the death of former 
communist party head hu yaobang in midapril 
after the crackdown however they sought refuge in the us 
embassy in beijing the chinese government has demanded they be 
handed over for arrest 
mondays tv program repeatedly accused hus successor as 
communist party head zhao ziyang of contributing to the 
turmoil of the widespread demonstrations 
zhao who was ousted following the crackdown on dissent has 
been accused of supporting the student protests and opposing other 
party leaders who wanted to quash them 
public criticism of zhao has mounted steadily since his june 24 
ouster from his party posts several reports of comments zhao 
allegedly made at closed meetings have been cited to prove his 
softness on westernstyle liberalism which the government blames 
for the student movement 
an editorial monday in the newspaper liberation army daily 
accused zhao of supporting words and deeds that vilified 
marxism and spreading nonmarxist theories it did not give any 
specifics

president hosni mubarak of egypt 
became chairman of the organization of african unity on monday and 
said his top priority is to seek an end to regional conflicts 
in a speech to the opening session of the threeday summit 
mubarak also urged the 50nation group to work together to confront 
racist aggression by south africa and ease africas debt 
problem 
mubarak called for the enhancement of solidarity for the 
settlement of the current disputes between various states 
he mentioned no specific conflicts but he clearly was referring 
to the border dispute between chad and libya the war between 
morocco and the polisario front over control of the western sahara 
and recent ethnic clashes among residents of senegal and mauritania 
mubarak did not make any reference to the civil wars in sudan 
ethiopia somalia and mozambique that have taken hundreds of 
thousands of lives 
the oau traditionally does not meddle in what are considered the 
internal affairs of its members although many african nations take 
the view that the rebels battling the government in mozambique are 
inspired and backed by south africa 
mubarak was elected by acclamation to lead the oau for the 
coming year succeeding president moussa traore of mali the 
chairmanship alternates each year between arab and black african 
states 
the egyptian president pledged to confront firmly and 
tenaciously the racist aggression of south africa which he 
accused of trying to undermine namibias transition toward 
independence and enslaving its own black people through apartheid 
its policy of racial segregation 
mubarak listed africas economic problems as his third priority 
saying they constitute a serious danger which not only threatens 
to stifle development but also threatens our very existence and 
survival 
as he has before he urged a resumption of talks between the 
impoverished nations of africa and south america and the northern 
industrialized countries 
mubarak also said he would seek greater cooperation between the 
arab states of the middle east and africa saying they share the 
same principles values and goals 
earlier un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told the 
session that he was encouraged by progress toward ending south 
african rule of namibia 
but he said some provisions of the independence plan have not 
been fully respected by south africa he specifically cited the 
incorporation of some members of a disbanded south african 
counterinsurgency force known as koevoet into the legitimate 
southwest africa police force 
he said the un peacekeeping force in the region has clearly 
established that former koevoet members were intimidating 
civilians in an apparent attempt to influence scheduled elections 
this fall 
perez de cuellar said there had been a reduction of 
intimidation in recent days but this is not enough there must 
be full compliance with the independence plan 
he made no reference to an earlier oau call for an increase in 
the un peacekeeping force a call repeated in another speech 
monday by sam njuma the leader of the southwest africa peoples 
organization swapo has been battling south africa for namibias 
independence for 25 years 
perez de cuellar reportedly rejected any increase in the 
peacekeeping force after talks with njuma in lusaka zambia late 
last week 
former president jimmy carter was scheduled to arrive in addis 
ababa at the end of the week to mediate between the ethiopian 
government and eritrean rebels who have engaged in one of the 
worlds longest wars both sides have accepted carter as a 
gobetween and the ethiopian conflict also was expected to be the 
subject of a series of private talks at the oau meeting

despite losing nine military aircraft and six 
crew members to bird collisions over a fiveyear period the 
pentagon still fails to test its planes to see whether they can 
withstand such impacts congressional investigators said monday 
the general accounting office an investigating agency for 
congress reported that from 1983 through 1987 more than 16000 
collisions occurred while most caused only minor damage nine 
planes including a 250 million b1b bomber crashed after 
colliding with birds losses for the period totaled 318 million 
if our military aircraft are not ready for birds how can they 
be ready for combat asked rep john conyers dmich who 
requested the study for the house government operations committee 
which he heads 
the gao did not ask us for a comment and we havent even seen 
it said jan bodanyi a pentagon spokeswoman when asked for 
reaction to the report 
the reports release coincided with opening of house and senate 
consideration of the future of the newgeneration b2 stealth 
bomber at 530 million each the most expensive airplane ever built 
with more expensive aircraft coming into use such as the b1b 
and b2 the value of these losses could become more significant 
the gao said 
the investigators found that specifications are inconsistent for 
the ability of airplanes and engines to withstand bird collisions 
where there are specifications for engines the testing does not 
accurately reflect the sizes and numbers of birds normally sucked 
into jet engines gao said 
the military agency has no testing program to see how well 
airframes the planes body and wings particularly leading edges 
stand up to bird collisions investigators said 
the report suggested requiring in government contracts that 
adequate testing be done and having the pentagon enforce that 
requirement as a way to reduce unnecessary costs

the knifescraped skeletal remains of 
cannibal alferd packers victims have been taken to the university 
of arizona for study in an attempt to shed more light on the old 
story 
packer came out of the rockies near lake city in 1874 and said 
he had subsisted on the remains of five prospecting companions to 
make it through the winter 
the remains of the five were found later that year and buried 
near here 
anthropologists who spent a week recovering the bones from a 
graveyard on deadmans gulch said evidence already indicated that 
one of the men had been shot and several of the bones had been 
scraped with a knife the scholars have taken on the challenge to 
see if they can determine the real story through scientific 
detection and see if packer was wrongly convicted 
the recovery crew left sunday with the remains 
packer who was sent to prison after being convicted of 
manslaughter in the deaths of each man told authorities he shot 
only one of the men and hit him in the head with a hatchet in self 
defense 
packer said the man had killed the four others with a hatchet 
wallace birkby curator of physical anthopology at the 
university of arizona said a bullet hole was found in a right 
pelvic bone saturday supporting packers story that hed shot one 
of the men in self defense the bullet hole indicated that the man 
had been shot from the front 
birkby said two of the skulls were recovered almost complete and 
other damaged skulls would be reconstructed to see if they will 
account for at least a partial fifth victim 
scrape marks on the bones of two skeletons indicated theyd been 
cut and scraped or defleshed birkby said 
punch marks found in a pelvic bone indicated an animal also had 
eaten from one of the remains after the spring thaw of 1874 he 
added 
the project includes forensic anthropologists a forensic 
pathologist and an expert on fibers and tool marks on bones 
birkby said a laboratory study should indicate whether any of 
the scraped bones had been cooked over a fire

an international peace and disarmament 
conference began on a discordant note monday when two chinese 
delegates walked out after soviet physicist andrei sakharov called 
for condemnation of chinas crackdown on student protesters 
we cannot forgive or disregard the conduct of the chinese 
government and we must find ways to demonstrate this attitude 
the 1975 nobel peace prize winner said at the opening session of 
the 39th pugwash conference on science and world affairs 
the chinese delegates waited outside the conference room during 
sakharovs 45minute speech which was largely devoted to soviet 
economic and environmental problems then one of them professor 
shi zhongben of beijing university confronted the 68yearold 
human rights activist 
trembling with emotion shi said sakharov did not understand 
chinese affairs and had chosen an inappropriate forum for his 
criticism sakharov remained impassive 
maybe i dont understand all the complexities of the situation 
in china but i think i was right he said later 
we can build peace through international cooperation not by 
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries said shi 
about 200 scientists and statesmen from more than 30 countries 
are attending the fiveday conference being held in the united 
states for the first time in 19 years 
the pugwash conferences grew out of a 1955 statement by bertrand 
russell and albert einstein calling on scientists of all political 
persuasions to devise ways to avoid nuclear war the first 
conference was held in 1957 at pugwash nova scotia 
most of the sessions are devoted to technical arms control 
issues and are closed to the public sakharov spoke during the 
plenary session which was also addressed by gov michael s 
dukakis and sen john kerry dmass 
sakharov who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb in the 
1950s later spoke out against soviet human rights abuses and the 
war in afghanistan he was banished to internal exile in the 
industrial city of gorky from 1979 to 1986 when he was personally 
called back to moscow by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev only in 
the past year has he been allowed to travel to the west 
after the chinese army crushed the prodemocracy protest in 
beijings tianenmen square on june 34 with estimates of deaths 
running as high as 3000 the new soviet congress issued a guarded 
statement calling it an internal matter 
but sakharov who is a member of the congress told the pugwash 
delegates we cannot pretend that nothing took place the world 
cannot deal with this chinese government the way it has in the 
past 
speaking through a translator sakharov compared the violence in 
china to the soviet armys use of poison gas and sharpened shovels 
to disperse a nationalist demonstration in soviet georgia in april 
killing at least 20 people he said both events showed the dangers 
faced by democracy movements around the world 
shi the senior chinese delegate stood up about halfway through 
the speech as soon as sakharov made the remarks about china he 
was quickly followed by the second delegate niu qiang of the 
chinese peoples association for peace and disarmament 
two other chinese delegates kept their seats in another part of 
the room but it was unclear whether they did so deliberately or 
failed to notice the departure of shi and niu 
despite the incident shi and niu said they planned to attend 
the rest of the conference which will explore ways to convert 
warmer eastwest relations into practical agreements on arms 
control and verification 
m innas ali a nuclear physicist from bangladesh said 
sakharovs confrontation with the chinese did not dampen the 
optimism of most delegates who believe the time is ripe for arms 
accords 
dukakis and kerry urged the delegates to take advantage of the 
sovietamerican rapprochement 
it may be a onceinalifetime opportunity said dukakis 
the unsuccessful democratic candidate for president

talvela the countrys leading opera star who had agreed to take 
over as director 
the 54yearold singer whose bass voice had boomed through 
opera houses from la scala to the metropolitan died saturday one 
colleague on monday called him the father figure of finnish 
opera 
news reports said talvela died during the wedding dance of his 
youngest daughter on his farm in juva near savonlinna in eastern 
finland they indicated he died of a heart attack 
his family refused to discuss the cause of death or funeral 
arrangements 
two months before his death talvela agreed to become director 
of the national opera in 1992 after the opera house is finished 
talvela said his aim would be to make the finnish opera on a 
par with the best in europe 
alfons almi a leading figure behind the plan to build a new 
opera said talvela was the only real candidate for director 
the directorship was tailormade for talvela he is 
irreplaceable almi said in a newspaper interview monday 
roger lindberg a member of the committee to select a new 
director described talvelas death as a catastrophe for the 
national opera it will be very difficult to find a suitable new 
director lindberg said 
talvela born feb 4 1935 began his international singing 
career after winning a contest in vaasa west finland in 1960 he 
had trained to be a school teacher and singing was just a hobby

voices he was particularly acclaimed for his interpretation of the 
title role of mussorgskys opera boris godunov 
talvela was artistic director of the annual savonlinna opera 
festival from 1972 to 1979 he elevated the festival to a major 
international opera event 
walton gronroos current artistic director of the festival said 
talvelas uncompromising nature was precisely the reason why he 
was able to create such great art 
in talvela we have lost a visionary the father figure of 
finnish opera gronroos said 
not long before he died talvela was asked about his reputed 
stubborn streak nobody can ever force me to do anything but i 
am always prepared to negotiate he said 
when not working talvela spent much of his time at his summer 
retreat in juva where he tended a flock of 100 sheep 
talvela is survived by his wife of 32 years annukka and by 
three adult children

pipe bombs blasted an army 
recruiting station and a us post office monday authorities said 
a telephone caller claimed the two bombs were planted by a 
proindependence group 
there were no reports of injuries from the blasts which came on 
the eve of puerto rico constitution day the holiday celebrates the 
37yearold constitution that made the island a us commonwealth 
a series of similar bomb attacks have struck the island in 
recent months 
mondays caller told a radio station the bombs were placed by 
the puerto rican revolutionary forces a littleknown group police 
could not confirm the authenticity of the call 
the male caller who did not give his name said the bombing was

burmese forces launched a fierce 
assault on ethnic karen rebels near the thai border but they were 
forced to retreat thai police said monday at least 44 people were 
reported killed 
the border police and karen sources said the dead included 42 
government soldiers they said only two rebels were killed and one 
was wounded 
the attack was the heaviest and most sustained since burmese 
troops began their assault on the karen base of kaw moo ra in may 
the police said speaking on condition of anonymity 
burmese troops began pounding the base with mortar fire saturday 
before launching the infantry assault police said they pulled 
back sunday after taking heavy casualties they said 
police said the camp about five miles from the thai border town 
of mae sot is defended by about 1200 karens there was no 
indication how many burmese troops were involved in the attack 
the karens with about 8000 fighters are the largest of 12 
ethnic minority groups that have fought a fourdecade war for 
greater autonomy from the central government 
kaw moo ra situated along a curve of the moei river can be 
attacked from burma only with artillery or by a frontal assault on 
a welldefended 250yard strip of land between the two bends in the 
river 
thai gunners fired 15 warning shots at a burmese government 
mortar base in hills near the camp after about 80 mortar rounds 
fell inside thai territory at the village of ban wang kaew police 
said 
burmese troops burned the thai village at the end of may when 
they intruded into thailand to attack kaw moo ra from the rear 
last year the burmese army began a campaign to dislodge the 
karens from riverbank strongholds where they have controlled 
crossborder trade burmese troops have seized five key bases since 
december 
the burmese government wants to clear routes through 
karencontrolled territory to allow the passage of export goods 
mainly timber into thailand 
the karens say the government has paid a heavy price for its 
victories they claim to have killed at least 2000 government 
soldiers and wounded 4000 they gave no total for their own 
casualties 
thai border forces said earlier in the campaign that karen 
casualties were much lighter than those of the government

army investigators monday tried to 
find the cause of a helicopter crash that killed six men during 
desert training exercises 
there was no immediate word on whether the pilot of the uh60 
blackhawk helicopter was wearing nightvision goggles of a type 
that has been criticized as a safety threat said maj john 
wagstaffe a base spokesman 
the helicopter crashed at 4 am saturday as its crew was 
directing other aircraft in a mock attack in the mojave desert 
it is standard procedure for crews to wear night vision 
goggles while on missions of that type here said wagstaffe 
but whether this crew was wearing them will have to be determined 
by the investigation 
the goggles have come under criticism recently because among 
other things they significantly narrow a pilots field of vision 
they were originally designed for ground troop use 
the goggles were used by pilots during crashes that have killed 
150 servicemen and destroyed 69 helicopters since 1978 according 
to one newspaper investigation 
three officers and three noncommissioned officers died in the 
crash a corporal suffered a broken leg the pentagon said 
all the soldiers aboard were from the 1st cavalry division at 
fort hood texas they were at the 1000squaremile base for a 
threeweek exercise that coincidentally ended saturday 
the accident occurred while 1st cavalry troops waged mock battle 
against units posing as soviet forces at fort irwins national 
training center with the blackhawk crew directing two apache ah64 
assault helicopters 
a team from the us army safety center at fort rucker ala 
will be on the scene for at least a week and the investigation 
will likely conclude in three to four months said safety center 
spokesman lt col herb blanks in a telephone interview 
the safety center has the power to ground the 46 million 
uh60 but they remained flying on monday 
the armys fleet of 820 uh60s was grounded twice in may 1987 
once for inspection and once because of a design flaw the entire 
fleet also was grounded in april 1985 and march 1986 after fatal 
crashes in 1985 the army identified a defect in the main rotor 
assembly and ordered it corrected 
blanks said the crash was the fourth of a uh60 since october 
there were five such accidents last fiscal year he said adding 
there is no abnormal trend not when you consider the amount of 
hours they fly 
the colonel said no repeated structural flaws have been found 
the majority of our accidents are human error he said 
the twoengine blackhawk is designed as a utility and assault 
aircraft it normally is operated with a crew of three and can 
carry 11 combatequipped soldiers 
it is made by sikorsky aircraft a division of united 
technologies based in stratford conn 
at the pentagon those killed in the crash were identified as 
lt col william c whittingstall 40 iowa park texas capt

hungarys top communist party leaders arrived 
monday to inform soviet president mikhail s gorbachev about plans 
for multiparty elections according to official reports 
rezsoe nyers and karoly grosz were invited by the soviet 
communist party after a change in the hungarian party leadership 
last month the party set up a fourman presidium dominated by 
reformers and elevated nyers to the newly influential post of party 
chairman grosz maintained his position as party general secretary 
grosz is responsible for internal party matters and nyers is 
responsible for the partys foreign relations 
nyers met with gorbachev this month in bucharest at a meeting of 
the seven warsaw pact countries 
the soviet foreign ministrys deputy spokesman vadim perfilyev 
said the talks were part of an increasingly frequent discussion of 
reforms in the two countries 
in moscow the hungarians will inform gorbachev about hungarys 
decision to allow a pluralistic system according to a foreign 
policy aide to grosz gyula thurmer 
the party is negotiating with the opposition on the first 
multiparty elections since the communists consolidated power in 
1948 elections are due by june 1990 
in budapest thurmer told the party newspaper nepszabadsag the 
visit was aimed at exchanging information on recent developments in 
the soviet union and hungary 
it is worth examining how the processes taking place in the 
two countries strengthen each other thurmer said the soviet 
party shows understanding toward the introduction of a multiparty 
system in hungary 
on saturday the first opposition candidate in more than 41 
years was elected in a local byelection to hungarys 
communistdominated parliament 
grosz and hungarian premier miklos nemeth also elevated to the 
party fourman presidium along with reformer imre pozsgay visited 
moscow in march and returned with assurances of kremlin support for 
hungarys reforms 
reforms began earlier in hungary and have progressed further 
than in the soviet union making it both a laboratory for economic 
and social experiments in the soviet bloc and an occasional source 
of worry for moscow over whether they are going too far 
visiting budapest this month president bush also expressed 
support for hungarys reforms but emphasized that he did not wish 
to interfere 
thurmer said bushs budapest visit would also be discussed in 
moscow

services as well as by businesses conducting polls or giving out 
product and other information none of the 900 numbers on city 
bills was in service when called by the paper

auditor

ago they cut my staff in half she said a continuing cash 
crunch has made it hard for the city to pay salaries and collect 
garbage in recent months 
in a review of bills from march april and may the paper found

president bush still stands behind william 
lucas his embattled nominee to be the justice departments top 
civil rights enforcer the white house said monday 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush chose the detroit lawyer as 
someone who would be a fighter for civil rights a black person 
who understood the black experience 
he said lucas also was someone who knew urban problems 
someone who was willing to take charge in that job and do it with 
aggressiveness and forcefulness we think bill lucas will do that 
the former sheriff of wayne county mich is opposed by many 
civil rights groups who claim he lacks experience to be assistant 
attorney general for civil rights they also have criticized his 
defense of recent supreme court decisions on civil rights 
several members of the senate judiciary committee which could 
vote on the nomination as early as thursday expressed doubts about 
lucas following his testimony at confirmation hearings last week 
a prominent black in the house rep john conyers dmich 
withdrew his support for the nominee following the hearing 
and jesse jackson on monday urged judiciary committee chairman 
sen joseph biden ddel to reject lucas as being unsuitable 
for the post 
jackson in a letter to biden said he considered lucas an 
outstanding person and family man but without qualifications 
to run a major legal operation 
today racial discrimination is defended not by dogs and 
hoses but by onerous burdens of proof severe statutes of 
limitations discovery restrictions and procedural trickery we 
dont need someone who has never performed surgery operating on the 
civil rights of the american people 
jackson said lucas could despite the best of intentions 
seriously harm the cause of civil rights we need an aggressive 
response to the cutbacks in civil rights in my judgment mr lucas 
cannot provide that response 
but supporters countered that lucas stand on civil rights is 
the same as that of bush and attorney general dick thornburgh 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said criticisms that 
lucas does not have a civil rights background or legal expertise 
are unjustified and miss the point 
he said the head of the civil rights division has a battery of 
lawyers to assist him in court and to free him for the task of 
setting civil rights policy 
ninety percent of the complaints filed with the civil rights 
divisions criminal section involve police misconduct who in this 
country is better equipped than bill lucas the former policeman 
fbi agent and county sheriff to deal with these tough issues with 
real experience dole said 
the rev joseph lowrey head of the southern christian 
leadership conference called the opposition to lucas partisan 
and picayune 
i think he is qualified lowrey said as he left a meeting 
monday with thornburgh he has as much courtroom experience as 
bobby kennedy had when he was nominated to be attorney general over 
the whole department of justice 
lowrey said he expected lucas to work to alter and influence 
the administrations position on civil rights once confirmed as 
assistant attorney general 
we still think lucas is a good candidate an excellent 
candidate and should be confirmed on the basis of his experience 
his ability the work that hes done the fact that he has labored 
in the vineyards of law enforcement and civil rights that he knows 
these problems from the inside of a big city fitzwater said 
we stand behind the candidate he said 
asked about a comment by a justice department spokesman david 
runkel that civil rights groups opposing the lucas nomination 
have the most to lose from their stance fitzwater said bush 
did not plan to hold this against them 
the president made this appointment in good faith he thinks 
its a good appointment he expects to maintain good relations with 
the civil rights groups no matter what fitzwater said 
lucas has been nominated to the job that william bradford 
reynolds held in the reagan administration reynolds was reagans 
point man in implementing reagans conservative legal agenda at the 
justice department civil rights groups complained reynolds 
undermined affirmative action

carter high school had a dream football team last 
fall but questions about academic eligibility and the arrest of 
several players for robbery have brought more shame than glory to 
the school 
the talented cowboys were on their way to the state championship 
last fall when they were initially disqualified three weeks before 
the playoffs star senior running back gary edwards had allegedly 
failed algebra 
state education officials and the university interscholastic 
league accused carter principal cc russeau of changing edwards 
grade to passing a charge that russeau and the dallas school 
superintendent repeatedly denied 
with a temporary court order the cowboys went on to win the 
championship and the matter went to court 
then a new bombshell dropped in june edwards and another 
allamerican cowboy teammate derric evans were charged in several 
armed robberies 
next three other teammates were among five more carter students 
charged in the robberies of small businesses and restaurants 
a state district judge ruled last tuesday in favor of edwards 
and the dallas independent school district in the grade dispute 
meaning the high school keeps the football title 
but the criminal charges remain edwards and evans have pleaded 
guilty and await sentencing cases are pending against the other 
players who include members of the basketball and junior varsity 
football teams 
now disbelieving parents students and teammates are struggling 
to figure out why athletes with such promise turned to crime and 
some observers say the students were never prepared to handle the 
attention created by their success in sports 
the 1700student school sits in a middleclass neighborhood 
the dallas morning news reported sunday that friends and other 
students said the arrested players robbed to make up for gambling 
losses and because of a hunger for status and money 
the carter football players slipped from athletics into friendly 
dice games and then into gambling for easy money students and 
adults told the morning news in a copyright story 
when the athletes learned that playing dice was also an easy way 
to lose money some turned to armed robbery the students said 
keith campbell one of the alleged robbery ringleaders said 
friday that gambling probably was the motive for the first 
holdups then he said it went on for kicks 
recouping losses wasnt a motivation for me but it was for 
others another player said through his attorney some of us 
just wanted money for partying and buying things 
gambling was so common among athletes at carter that some 
coaches tolerated it and the student council fearing violence 
condemned it the newspaper said 
patrick pk williams and carlos allen who on friday 
pleaded guilty with campbell to the groups first holdup said 
through their attorneys that they robbed to win acceptance by their 
friends 
he wanted to be held in that high esteem and he had to be as 
tough as they were attorney ted calisi said of his client 
allen he did that to stay with the crowd 
derric evans and gary edwards have publicly apolgized for their 
deeds 
when i put myself in the position of those i robbed looking 
at a weapon i can imagine how terrified they felt evans said at 
a news conference 
edwards directed part of his statement to his mother and father 
you dont deserve the disappointment the embarrasment and the 
shame that ive brought on you i dont expect you to stand behind 
me for what ive done but please find it in your heart to forgive 
me he said 
kimberly vaughn student council president said she hopes 
students can put the dark clouds behind them this school year 
if everybody would just let it die it would make things a lot 
easier we were and still are the brunt of a lot of jokes she 
said 
carter parent milton watkin said the crimes are very 
unfortunate but dont merit the incessant barage of media 
attention which he called sensationalism 
coach freddie james was vacationing in california last week and 
could not be reached by the associated press russeau did not 
return phone calls to the ap 
linebacker jessie armstead said james was tough on academics and 
discipline as well as football and couldnt be blamed for the 
misbehavior of his players 
edwards attorney royce west said he thinks the 17yearold 
got involved in the robberies because of pressure over the grade 
dispute 
when this controversy started gary should have received some 
counseling west said 
he said edwards is working at a mcdonalds restaurant getting 
his life back together because of the criminal charges edwards 
lost financial aid offered by the university of houston 
dallas sports psychologist tom mcgaffey said the entire team 
could have used counseling 
prominence gives a feeling of power and if it happens 
suddenly and without the development of discipline and 
responsibility theyre in for trouble mcgaffey said 
we forget the fact that a 17yearold or 18yearold is still 
a kid in our culture he said

to visit since moscow severed ties with israel after the 1967 
middle east war terasov is foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadzes new adviser on middle east affairs 
the reports alleging shamir is meeting proplo activists came as 
the premier faces a challenge from hardliners in his likud bloc 
who fear he will make too many concessions to win approval to hold 
elections in the territories to calm the uprising 
they also surfaced as palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat was quoted in the rome daily il messaggero as saying 
the israeli government has opened direct contacts with his group

could not be reached for comment 
shamir in april announced a peace plan calling for elections in 
the occupied territories to select palestinians to open talks to 
negotiate an interim solution 
the plan was seen as a vehicle around the government ban on plo 
contacts since many elected undoubtedly would be plo backers 
us officials are trying to persuade arafat to approve the plan 
arafat told il messaggero that the plo approved meetings with 
israeli officials and has been receiving reports on the contacts 
however underground leaders of the uprising condemned them 
the unified leadership confirms its rejection of holding any 
communications with any official representatives in the israeli 
government and confirms that not one of the national personalities 
met with any government officials they said in a leaflet sunday

federal spending on major commodity programs 
is down from what administration budget analysts forecast in 
january an agriculture department analysis showed monday 
total outlays in the fiscal year that began oct 1 are now 
projected at less than 135 billion about 360 million below the 
january prediction 
programs include payments to farmers for participating in annual 
crop programs in the case of major crops such as wheat corn and 
cotton the programs provide price supports and other benefits in 
return for taking land out of production 
but some other commodities also are covered including price 
support operations for soybeans peanuts tobacco honey sugar 
dairy products and wool 
outlays for corn and other feed grains in 1989 were indicated in 
january at about 304 billion the new midsession review 
raised the estimate to 417 billion at the same time spending 
for wheat rice and upland cotton programs was reduced by more than 
13 billion from the january forecast 
allowing for adjustments in other programs administered by the 
departments commodity credit corp total spending for the various 
agricultural commodities was reduced a net of 86 million to less 
than 703 billion for this fiscal year 
other ccc spending including 375 billion for aid to farmers 
who suffered severe losses from the 1988 drought put the fiscal 
1989 total at just under 135 billion compared with the january 
estimate of more than 138 billion 
looking at 1990 the report said total ccc spending could drop 
to just over 113 billion down 231 million from what was 
projected in january 
scott steele an agriculture department budget analyst said the 
boost in feedgrain outlays from the level initially projected was 
a result of new quarterly grain inventory figures in january those 
showed more feed grain on hand than had been indicated previously 
it was this larger inventory that we did not take into account 
when we did the budget that was published by the outgoing reagan 
administration jan 9 and later adopted by president bush he said 
steele said in an interview that the jan 9 projections were 
based on supplyand demand readings last november the new review 
took into consideration the grain figures that were issued jan 13 
looking at fiscal 1990 which will begin oct 1 the new report 
showed total ccc outlays at less than 114 billion down about 
231 million from what had been projected in january 
spending on feed grains in 198990 was indicated at nearly 707 
billion up from the 556 billion projected in january declines 
from the january projections were shown for wheat rice and cotton

the governors of eight atlantic coast states 
met with congressional environmental leaders monday and then signed 
a broadly worded agreement to work for clean oceans 
rep gerry e studds dmass acknowledged that the document 
which was passed from governor to governor while homestate 
television cameras rolled probably will not take its place 
between the magna carta and the mayflower compact 
but he joined other participants at a news conference following 
the closed meeting in saying the agreement was a symbolic 
achievement that signaled the governors were determined to work 
among themselves and with federal officials to solve environmental 
problems 
standing behind massachusetts gov michael dukakis last years 
democratic presidential nominee studds said it will take billions 
of dollars just to clean up boston harbor alone and that the main 
measure of success for the governors coastal agenda will be 
the number of dollars we are able to put behind them 
the bipartisan meeting attended by about a dozen members of 
congress was arranged by senate majority leader george mitchell of 
maine and maryland gov william donald schaefer also a democrat 
the governors of connecticut rhode island delaware virginia 
north carolina and south carolina also attended the ceremony 
the document specifically did not endorse any of the many pieces 
of federal legislation pending on environmental issues and 
purposely was worded vaguely enough to ensure unanimous support 
for example the first section of the fivepart plan create 
an environmental ethic says federal and state policies must 
reflect the need for strengthened environmental protection and 
education and public participation must be strenghtened to show 
how everyone can participate in the solution to coastal pollution 
problems 
the document also called for strengthening research and 
monitoring of coastal waters reducing coastal nutrient and toxic 
pollution protection of marine and coastal sediment quality and 
expansion of government authority for oil spill prevention and 
response 
this is the beginning schaefer of the meeting 
sen john f kerry dmass said the most important aspect of 
the agreement was its call for creation of an environmental ethic 
because significant progress will not be made until the ethic 
becomes strong enough for force funding 
pressed to estimate how much money would be needed to accomplish 
the goals of the group mitchell said there is no single overall 
figure and i think it is a mistake to view it in the context of 
those kind of questions 
he emphasized that there was no attempt to get the group to 
agree on specific legislation and added i think it is very 
significant that we got started and got the agreement that we did

the justice department has declined to 
prosecute a former department of housing and urban development 
official in connection with his activities for a charity whose 
donors included many developers who did business with hud 
the decision was made last week but not disclosed until monday 
when a copy of a justice department letter informing huds 
inspector general of the decision was released by a congressman 
in the letter the department said it has declined to prosecute 
thomas t demery for any actions detailed in the inspector 
generals april report on the agencys section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program 
the report detailed numerous instances in which former hud 
officials have reaped benefits from the program either as 
developers or consultants and said many other developers who won 
lucrative subsidies under the program were donors to food for 
africa a michiganbased charity demery helped found 
hud inspector general paul a adams told congress recently that 
he found no evidence of criminal activity during his offices 
review of the program 
but the inspector general referred the report to the justice 
departments public integrity section for a review of whether 
demery violated huds conduct standards by associating himself with 
the charity including occasional references to his official 
position on invitations to food for africa events 
demery has repeatedly denied any connection between his hud 
decisions and donations to the charity attempts to reach him 
monday for comment were not immediately successful 
in releasing the july 19 letter rep barney frank dmass 
said he was not criticizing the department for declining to 
prosecute demery but took issue with a passage in the letter he 
said indicated the department would not independently investigate 
abuses at hud during the reagan administration 
should you come to obtain information not contained in your 
report implicating mr demery or other hud officials in possible 
criminal violations we would be happy to review that information 
public integrity section chief gerald e mcdowell said in the 
passage frank referred to 
call me if you find anything wrong frank said was the 
attitude the justice department was adopting 
he praised new hud secretary jack kemp for seeking to reform the 
agency but added elsewhere in the bush administration we are not 
getting the same kind of commitment to clean this mess up

a special team of investigators is looking 
into how so many passengers survived the dc10 crash in iowa with 
an eye to increasing the chances of both adults and children of 
living through a crash 
the survival factors team led by national transportation 
safety board investigators has interviewed 26 of united airlines 
flight 232s passengers so far ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
said monday 
most were among those still hospitalized after wednesdays crash 
landing in sioux city that killed 111 people lopatkiewicz said 
questionnaires will be sent to all adults among the 185 
survivors the investigation spokesman said in a telephone 
interview from sioux city 
lopatkiewicz said the team will document the survivability of 
the accident and try to find out what precautions were most 
effective in preventing injury and death when the jetliner burst 
into flames flipped over landed on its back and split apart in a 
cornfield near the sioux city airport 
the team will try to interview all adults traveling with 
children to see what happened to the youngsters after the pilot

several infants were traveling free in their parents arms without 
assigned seats a common practice on domestic flights

many of the passengers on flight 232 from denver to chicago were 
children or infants or how many children were among the dead

chinas ambassador to the united 
states appealed monday for patience and understanding of turmoil in 
his homeland but warned that china doesnt tolerate pressure or 
interference 
at present the important thing is not to interfere in chinas 
internal affairs particularly when it is in difficulty do not 
make things more difficult ambassador han xu told a packed 
luncheon meeting of the forum club of the palm beaches 
han said the public comments were his first since those 
terrible developments occurred in china referring to bloody 
student uprisings in tiananmen square seven weeks ago 
he also said they would be his last public comments as 
ambassador at age 65 and after two decades of active involvement 
in uschina relations he said he is retiring and will soon retur 
to beijing 
han said he would leave the united states with mixed feelings 
but remained confident that the dramatic progress in relations 
between the two countries would survive the current strain he said 
beijing has shown restraint in reacting to us sanctions over the 
chinese governments quelling of the protests 
chinese officials have said 300 people died during the 
crackdown but witnesses and western intelligence sources say the 
number was in the thousands the government has also executed 
dozens of people who allegedly participated 
where the question of state sovereignty is concerned china 
always stands firm to put pressure on china is not the way to talk 
business 
it is unwise it never works and it can only end up hurting 
the mutual interests of both countries han said 
there is much talk of imposing further economic sanctions 
against china he added such sanctions must be firmly 
rejected they hurt the united states as much as they hurt china 
the only effect on china that i can think of is that would push 
back china into the isolation of the old days i am sure that it is 
not a prospect that you want to see 
han ambassador since 1985 said he didnt expect to make many 
converts to his governments view of the uprisings which it 
characterizes as the work of a very small traitorous mob 
han said americans and others should look at the context of the 
turmoil china is undergoing massive economic reforms trying to 
overcome backward industry illiteracy problems lack of arable 
land for its 11 billion people and new problems of bureaucratic 
corruption and speculators china has made great economic progress 
in the past decade he said and that has led to inflation 
increased expectations and economic disparities that also create 
political turmoil 
because of the changes it is attempting the chinese government 
places so much emphasis upon the maintenance of order and unity 
and must respond vigorously to signs of chaos and turmoil he 
said 
han said the friendship between americans and chinese is 
historical and is important to both countries 
lets be guided by the forces of history and reason from this 
time forward an ancient chinese wise man once said spilt water 
cannot be gathered up 
han drew 548 people by far the largest crowd in the forum 
clubs 17year history said executive director rj kirkpatrick 
florida atlantic university and the university of miami and other 
nearby colleges all have chinese student contingents and the club 
hired several security guards for possible protests 
we have not had even a hint of protest said kirkpatrick 
not oral or otherwise 
henry feustel of the local chapter of the chineseamerican 
friendship association said displeasure with the tiananmen square 
violence shouldnt be allowed to ruin relations 
we are all mad boiling mad he said but you have to look 
to the future

the chairman of the senate appropriations 
committee proposed a plan monday he said could prevent 
influencepeddling situations such as those under investigation at 
the department of housing and urban development 
sen robert byrd dwva wants all those requesting federal 
funds to report the name of any lobbyists paid to help get the 
government grant contract cooperative agreement loan loan 
guarantee or loan insurance 
if any of the federal money is used to pay someone for personal 
influence unrelated to the merits of the project the grant or 
loan recipient would be fined 100000 
had this legislation been in place it would have been a 
deterrent in relation to things that happened at hud said byrd 
his proposal was approved monday by a senate appropriations 
subcommittee as an amendment to the appropriations bill for the 
interior department and related agencies 
it still must be approved by the full committee the full senate 
and go through a conference committee including members of the 
house it was not part of the house legislation 
this is not an antilobbying bill said byrd 
it doesnt prohibit payments to consultants for professional 
or other technical services in connection with meeting 
requirements for receiving the grants or loans he said 
but when the consultant goes beyond that to get the contract 
there will be trouble said byrd 
he spoke critically of information he had received about 
consultants who are knowledgeable about government programs design 
grant proposals and then go shopping for a university or other 
institution willing to apply for the money and pay them for the 
proposal 
byrd said his plan would affect all government agencies 
he called the reporting aspect the best part of the plan 
it will alert people up and down the line he said it 
establishes a data base that can be analyzed 
twice a year the federal agencies granting money would be 
required to file with the secretary of the senate and the clerk of 
the house complete lists of the lobbyists names addresses 
amounts paid and the purposes for which they were paid 
the lists would be available to the public and will be examined 
by the inspector generals office byrd said

transportation secretary samuel skinner called 
on monday for a revolution in transportation possibly 
including highspeed rail systems but a private analyst said the 
car will remain king 
skinner launched a series of nationwide hearings aimed at 
drawing up a national transportation policy for rail highway air 
and water travel meetings are to be held in large and small cities 
throughout the country through midseptember 
the first one in a washington auditorium featured the heads of 
some of the countrys biggest airline railroad and automobile 
companies and nebraska gov kay orr who said the whole system is a 
handymans special 
if the nations system of roads rails waterways and airports 
were listed in a real estate ad she said it would say lots of 
potential oldstyle craftsmanship with many modern conveniences 
but needs work a real fixerupper 
skinner who moderated the first session and will attend some of 
the other meetings said a decision to build highspeed rail 
systems is one possible result of the effort this could include 
trains that travel up to 300 mph particularly between cities where 
air travel has reached maximum levels 
it is time for a new revolution in transportation and 
hopefully it will be a peaceful revolution said skinner 
in an interview prior to the meeting skinner said the nations 
airports highways bridges waterways and mass transit systems are 
simply wearing out 
were going to have to rebuild it and replace it or were not 
going to be able to rely on it anymore he said 
among the most critical problems skinner said are a lack of 
planning for new airports and neglect of 80 billion worth of work 
needed on deteriorating bridges 
william b johnston senior research fellow at the hudson 
institute told the opening session that no new system is in the 
wings that will revolutionize transportation within the next 25 
years so old systems have to be made more efficient 
he said the fastest growth is in suburban areas as urban density 
continues to decline and automobile use increases the hudson 
institute is a washington think tank that has studied several 
national issues including transportation needs 
the country has become ever more tied to its personal 
ondemand pointtopoint transportation system automobiles 
johnston said 
despite oil shortages and price increases the lamentations of 
many environmentalists and urban planners and multibillion dollar 
federal investments in urban transit nothing has dented the 
dominance of the automobile he said 
general motors president robert c stempel said gm and other 
companies are studying smart cars and smart highways that would 
be computerized for increased safety and efficiency 
in the meantime he said some simple things can be done to 
improve road travel in many areas traffic light coordination 
improved toll road payment procedures and clearer and brighter 
highway signs and markings 
the transportation department is inviting citizens with ideas 
about how to move americans in the 21st century and about how to 
pay for the changes to attend the hearings around the country or 
to send written proposals to the transportation department 
the transportation secretary said he doesnt want the sessions 
to turn into a littany of complaints 
you shouldnt go if youre just going to say weve got 
gridlock somebody ought to do something about it because we know 
that skinner said these are needs and idea sessions 
the first meeting outside washington will be held in moscow 
idaho on tuesday with the focus on rural transportation issues 
the last meetings will be in boston on sept 1112 and will deal 
with drug and alcohol use in the commercial transportation system 
and federal research and development

a former federal housing official said monday 
that after joining a private law firm she was shown a hud internal 
document affecting one a client but she denied receiving special 
treatment because of her friendship with a top aide to thenhud 
secretary samuel pierce 
deborah gore dean asked someone to show it to me lynda 
murphy told a congressional subcommittee when asked how she was 
able to read a sensitive department of housing and urban 
development document before it was signed by pierce 
but when asked whether it would be fair to say her close 
friendship with ms dean helped her receive access to internal hud 
information ms murphy angrily replied i dont think thats a 
fair characterization 
a republican member of the subcommittee rep christopher shays 
rconn criticized ms murphy for hiring ms dean as a consultant 
not long after ms dean left the housing agency 
im beginning to feel there is a quid pro quo shays said 
ms murphy said she did not believe there was anything improper 
about hiring ms dean she was a good friend she said later 
when asked about their personal relationship 
ms murphy was one of two witnesses appearing before the house 
government operations subcommittee on employment and housing which 
is investigating allegations of fraud abuse mismanagement and 
influence peddling at hud during the reagan administration 
influence was the central topic monday with panel members ms 
murphy and a second witness republican national committeeman 
william taylor sparring in combative verbal exchanges often laced 
with sarcasm and cynicism 
taylor former chairman of the florida republican party 
detailed at length his lobbying on behalf of the city of 
jacksonville and a variety of developers and he defended his use 
of national party stationery to write letters to hud officials 
seeking funding for his clients 
i found nothing wrong with letting people know who i am 
said taylor when shays said the panels goal was to rid washington 
of such influence peddling taylor retorted good luck and 
added i didnt invent it 
i wish you were a democrat republican shays said i am 
embarrassed you cashed in on your party 
among those taylor wrote to were pierce and ms dean pierces 
executive assistant who according to testimony to congress and 
former hud officials was considered by many as de facto 
secretary as far as many funding decisions were concerned in her 
more than three years in the post 
notes from ms dean that have been obtained by the subcommittee 
show that a georgia project for which taylor had lobbied was on her 
list for funding under the agencys section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program 
also on ms deans approval list for the date april 7 1987 
according to the notes released by the subcommittee were 200 units 
for boston ed brooke brooke is a former republican senator 
who as an attorney has lobbied hud on behalf of developers 
ms murphy is a washington attorney who since leaving hud in 
1982 has had extensive dealings with the agency 
she said that in the summer of 1985 while her law firm was 
representing a client in hudrelated matters she was shown a draft 
of a letter pierce was preparing to send to drg funding corp a 
major lender in a hud coinsurance program that had been placed on 
probation because of numerous problems with its loanapproval 
practices pierce criticized the firm for most of a ninepage 
letter but in the nexttolast paragraph announced he was lifting 
restrictions hud had placed on the company 
at the time drg was on hud probation and had to have all its 
loans approved in advance ms murphys client was applying to drg 
for financing and its project was stalled because drg had to get 
hud approval of the loan 
ms murphy said she made comments about the draft letter but 
that it was not changed to reflect her position and she disputed 
contentions that she should not have been shown the document before 
it was made public saying there frequently was such give and 
take about the language between hud officials and representatives 
of major firms doing business with the agency 
subcommittee member however did not accept her justification 
i think you are being evasive shays said after ms murphy 
said she could not respond in detail to his question about ms 
deans role in a later decision involving drg this one an 
ultimately unsuccessful attempt to help a houston development on 
which hud coinsured a mortgage that was issued at several times the 
propertys value 
the exchanges with taylor were at times humorous 
when taylor told rep barney frank dmass that he had great 
respect for the congressman and his knack for crafting catchy 
phrases frank responded why do i feel i should hold on to my 
wallet at this moment mr taylor

the nations top antidrug official william 
j bennett said monday that higher taxes may be needed down the 
road to fight the war on drugs 
ill go on record crack is worse than taxes bennett told 
reporters after a closed meeting with representatives of the 
nations mayors who want more federal antidrug aid flowing to 
cities 
bennett after hearing the mayors request told reporters 
i dont think we immediately have to say well were going 
to have to raise taxes maybe down the road we will but i think 
there are other choices its facing priorities 
bennett the director of the office of national drug control 
policy also said that crack a potent highly addictive form of 
cocaine is a hell of a lot worse than pork too 
referring to unspecified pork barrel projects members of 
congress like to bring to their districts he said if were 
going to spend more money on the war on drugs we have got to 
decide where were going to get the money to do it 
earlier bennett heard the mayors push a 16point plan they want 
included in the national drug control strategy he is to produce by 
sept 5 
one point calls for increased aid for state and local antidrug 
programs with a significant portion of the funds going directly 
to local governments bypassing highlevel bureaucracies 
houston mayor kathryn whitmire president of the us conference 
of mayors commented after the meeting that most of us have had 
to raise taxes in our local communities already to deal with the 
drug problem so were not afraid to recommend that 
whitmire said bennett made no commitment to back a tax increase 
new york city mayor ed koch said the people are ready to 
accept an increase in taxes if they knew that the taxes were going 
solely to interdict drugs and not for some social program which 
they may or may not agree with 
the slogan crack is worse than taxes koch said means 
that people will pay to have this monster lifted from their 
shoulders so their kids can be protected 
boston mayor raymond flynn called for 3 billion in federal 
funds to be distributed to states and cities to fight the drug war 
and said people will support tax dollars targeted to the war on 
drugs 
flynn said he asked bennett whether he would support an 
appropriation of 3 billion for the states and cities and was told 
it depends on what congress does 
asked if bush would support such a plan if thomas s foley the 
speaker of the house supports it flynn said 
i didnt get an answer out of mr bennett he said maybe we 
could rearrange money someway from here to there 
thats not what were talking about we dont want to take 
money from the homeless or infant mortality or from child care 
or from affordable housing

the justice department citing national 
security concerns won a delay monday in the irancontra criminal 
case against the cias former station chief in costa rica 
a 4th us circuit court of appeals judge in richmond va 
issued an emergency stay to temporarily block the trial of joseph 
fernandez 
the excia operatives trial was to have started monday but the 
cia wanted to stop fernandezs lawyers from identifying as part of 
his defense three cia programs in costa rica and locations of three 
cia stations and facilities in latin america 
the justice department sought the emergency stay after us 
district court judge claude hilton rejected prosecutors proposals 
to substitute numbers for the three cia locations and to drop 
portions of one criminal charge against fernandez to avoid 
mentioning the cia programs 
hilton said fernandez must be allowed to mention the names of 
the cia programs and that substituting numbers for names of the 
three cia locations was not acceptable 
ron noble a deputy assistant attorney general told the judge 
the department would seek a delay of the trial 
with a pool of prospective jurors waiting in a room adjacent to 
the court the judge obviously irritated asked noble why the 
justice department didnt take action a week ago 
this is a very difficult thing for the department to do 
replied noble he said the proposals from the prosecutors would 
allow this trial to go forward we have no alternative 
at the appeals court the justice department is seeking to 
formally intervene in the case and wants the court to reconsider 
hiltons denial of the prosecutors proposals 
fernandez is charged with lying about his involvement with 
oliver norths contra resupply network he faces two counts of 
obstruction and two counts of making false statements in his 
responses to the cia inspector generals office and the tower 
commission in 1987 
the justice department went to the appeals court instead of 
taking an unprecedented step of filing a national security 
affidavit with the court such a document would categorically bar 
disclosure of certain classified information and could kill the 
case 
fernandezs lawyer thomas wilson called the justice 
departments trip to the appeals court unconscionable 
we dont even know what case were trying complained 
wilson he said the government has known since charges were first 
brought against fernandez last year that his defense would involve 
significant disclosures of classified information 
saying that enough is enough wilson called on the justice 
department to file a national security affidavit 
in a letter to the justice department that was filed in court 
monday independent counsel lawrence walsh said that the cia was 
trying to protect a fictional secret by objecting to the 
release of certain classified documents the fernandez case he 
said would be untriable if the department blocks disclosure of the 
names of cia stations as well as of the three cia costa rican 
programs 
walsh added that if the cia action to protect documents prevents 
the trial from going forward i believe that there must be a 
broad reevaluation of the standards under which such power is 
exercised 
with a justice department affidavit in hand hilton would have 
no choice under federal law but to prohibit the excia operative 
from using in his defense the classified information detailed in 
the affidavit 
that could lead to the judge dismissing some or all the criminal 
charges on grounds that the prohibited information was vital to 
giving him a fair trial

house speaker thomas s foley spoke monday 
against lightly and frivolously amending the constitution to ban 
flag burning 
i cannot imagine why anyone in this country the president or 
anybody else should favor amending the constitution unnecessarily 
without reason if a statute can accomplish all the objectives that 
the president or others seek the washington democrat said in his 
first appearance as house speaker before the national press club 
foley and other democratic leaders contend it is possible to 
draft a statute banning flag burning that will meet the standards 
of the supreme court which ruled last month in a texas case that 
flag burning was a protected form of free expression 
president bush and house and senate republican leaders are 
backing a constitutional amendment arguing that a statute cant 
work 
the issue has raised political tensions in congress with 
democratic lawmakers opposed to the amendment worried that the gop 
campaign organization will flog them as less patriotic unless they 
vote for it 
i think to lightly frivolously almost rush forward and amend 
the constitution out of political or partisan or legalistic reasons 
when there is an opportunity to consider a statute achieving 
the objectives is something that we should all be concerned 
about foley said 
the congress would be wise to draft a statute and see what the 
courts do with it he said 
congress can include with the statute a provision that would 
speed court review he said 
the house judiciary committee is expected to meet on flag 
legislation later this week and foley said he still intends to 
bring a statute to the full house before the august recess 
foley said he might not be able to block a house vote on the 
constitutional amemdment but indicated hed at least like to let 
the senate act first which it is now scheduled to do in october 
the danger is not only amending the constitution without 
necessity its lowering the level of resistance in the congress 
and the country to amendments to the constitution and most 
particularly to the first amendment which is the basis as we all 
know of speech religious and press liberty he said

lyme disease a tickborne illness that is 
difficult to diagnose has been reported in 43 states and will soon 
reach five more a panel predicted monday 
lyme disease is one of the most rapidly growing diseases in 
the united states that are spread by carriers other than humans 
said dr steven hausman who is with the national institute of 
arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases 
hausman spoke at a news conference along with two members of 
congress and a connecticut family struck by the illness to mark 
lyme disease awareness week which began monday 
lyme disease which is caused by a bacterium is spread by the 
common deer tick symptoms usually start with a circular rash and 
include fever chills fatigue aching and stiffness paralysis may 
follow 
while most of the known cases have been concentrated in the 
northeast particularly connecticut and suffolk and westchester 
counties in new york lyme disease was reported last year in every 
continental state except montana wyoming nebraska arizona and 
new mexico 
we wont stop the ticks theyre in 43 states already and 
soon theyll be in 50 said rep george hochbrueckner dny 
there were nearly 14000 reported cases in 1988 but we fear 
this is a very low number said sen joseph lieberman dconn 
in 1987 there were only 5800 reported cases but much of the 
jump was due to better reporting said dr stephen heyes director 
of the office of disease prevention at the national institutes of

president bush appealed to congress monday to 
accept his call for billions of dollars for the b2 bomber and star 
wars as lawmakers squared off in initial skirmishing on a defense 
blueprint for the year 
speaker thomas foley predicted the house would pare bushs call 
for 47 billion for the socalled stealth bomber for the fiscal 
year that begins oct 1 he said the plane will survive in some 
form of limited procurement 
bush summoned lawmakers to the white house and foley offered his 
prediction as both houses began work on differing versions of 
defense legislation debate was expected to consume several days in 
both houses 
facing growing opposition to the stealth bomber bush personally 
lobbied members of the senate armed services committee and other 
leading senators urging support for the revolutionary plane with 
revolutionary technology 
we need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control the 
president said dismissing complaints about the bombers high price 
tag 70 billion for 132 planes or 530 million a copy 
on capitol hill vice president dan quayle conceded that the 
pentagon should have released the cost estimates on the bomber 
earlier than it did the bomber program shrouded in secrecy for 10 
years has become more public with the release of figures last 
month and the aircrafts first flight last week 
those numbers should have been revealed publicly a lot sooner 
than they were quayle told reporters during a meeting in his 
congressional office it would have made the political battle a 
lot less complicated and much easier 
the vice president who plans to spend tuesday lobbying for 
bushs version of the defense budget indicated that the 
administration faces a tougher fight in the house than in the 
senate 
while house members clashed in general debate over the b2 and 
star wars the senate approved by a vote of 91to0 an amendment to 
add 5968 million in fiscal 1990 and 3368 million in fiscal 1991 
for tactical missiles which includes the stinger and tow 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the senate could expect a difficult conference 
fight with the house over the defense budget 
at the start of senate debate sen james exon dneb a member 
of the armed services committee proclaimed that the unchecked 
defense budget is history 
sen strom thurmond rsc a member of the armed services 
panel said that although bushs budget is not ideal it 
represents the best compromise given the budget problems in our 
nation 
house debate got off to a rocky start as republicans criticized 
a decision by the democraticcontrolled rules committee to vote on 
the fate of the v22 osprey and the f14d tomcat in a single 
amendment 
defense secretary dick cheney in crafting a 295 billion 
defense budget has proposed eliminating the marine corps v22 a 
tiltrotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can fly 
like a plane and the f14d jet fighter 
after a few hours of behindthescenes wrangling rep david 
bonior dmich a member of the rules committee offered a 
provision to allow the house to vote on separate amendments to 
eliminate money for the v22 and f14d the procedural rule then 
was approved by voice vote 
rep william dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the 
house armed services committee plans to introduce an amendment to 
accept cheneys budget dickinson also had sought separate 
amendments on whether to fund the v22 and f14d 
but the rules committee had decided to combine the two in a 
single amendment and the panels minority members approved the 
decision 
the house plan was to complete the defense bill by the end of 
the week the house planned to take up star wars on tuesday the 
stealth bomber and icbms on wednesday and other aspects of the 
defense bill on thursday 
the stealth bomber remained the most controversial and uncertain 
issue in the bill 
reps les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee and mike synar dokla will introduce an amendment to 
freeze funds for the bomber until congress receives more 
information the bill also would include money for production of 
only two bombers in 1990 and 1991 when the administration wants 
eight bombers 
another amendment by reps ron dellums dcalif john kasich 
rohio and john rowland rconn proposes stopping production 
after the 13 planes now in construction and mothballing the line 
rep ike skelton dmo will propose accepting the decision of 
the house armed services committee which cut 800 million from the 
47 billion the pentagon requested for the b2 in the fiscal 1990 
budget 
house majority leader richard gephardt of missouri told 
reporters monday that he didnt sense a republican or democratic 
position on the b2 
on star wars the house armed services committee slashed 11 
billion from the bush administrations request of 49 billion for 
what is formally known as the strategic defense initiative 
a series of house amendments would eliminate all funds for the 
program cut it to 13 billion reduce it to 31 billion or 
increase it to 41 billion 
bush told lawmakers monday i strongly support what we sent up 
there to the hill sdi in my view is critical

the national endowment for the arts would be 
forbidden to award taxpaid grants to sponsors of two controversial 
photographic exhibitions for the next five years under legislation 
approved monday by a senate appropriations subcommittee 
the panel also endorsed a houseapproved proposal to trim the 
endowments proposed 1714 million budget next year by 45000 
the exact amount the agency gave for the two controversial shows by 
photographers robert mapplethorpe and andres serrano 
in addition the senate subcommittee voted 100000 to hire an 
outside consultant to review the arts endowments grantmaking 
procedures which have come under fire recently from several 
conservative members of congress 
the senate panels action drew a fast protest from hugh 
southern acting chairman of the endowment an independent federal 
agency that currently awards 169 million annually to a wide 
variety of artists and arts institutions from theaters and 
symphony orchestras to painters and poets 
enactment of this provision would be the first instance since 
the endowments founding nearly 25 years ago of direct 
congressional involvement in awarding or prohibiting specific 
grants southern said 
banning funding for specific institutions establishes a 
dangerous precedent which goes against the long and widely 
respected system of federal support for the arts through a 
competitive peer review process he said 
the bill would impose a fiveyear ban on nea grants to the 
institute of contemporary art at the university of pennsylvania 
which organized the mapplethorpe exhibition and the southeastern 
center for contemporary art in winstonsalem nc which awarded 
nea funds to serrano 
the nea had given 30000 to underwrite a national tour of the 
mapplethorpe show which included homoerotic and sadomasochistic 
pictures and several photos of nude children the corcoran gallery 
of art in washington canceled plans to display the mapplethorpe 
photos to avoid becoming involved in a political battle over 
congressional financing of the endowment 
serrano received a 15000 nea grant through the southeastern 
center for his work which included a widely criticized photograph 
of a christ figure submerged in a container of the artists urine 
the house in its action on the arts endowments budget on july 
12 did not propose banning grants to the two photographers 
sponsors but did include language intended to make the endowment 
more accountable for grant funds that are dispensed by a local 
institution 
the rev donald e wildmon a methodist minister from tupelo 
miss urged congress to eliminate all funds for the arts endowment 
to halt what he called government subsidies for pornography and 
antichristian bigotry 
wildmon executive director of the nonprofit american family 
association held a news conference monday outside the endowments 
headquarters here to protest the neas indirect support for 
mapplethorpe and serrano 
wildmon called their photographs extremely offensive 
demeaning and pornographic

leaders of nicaraguas contra 
rebels said monday they were meeting with central american 
presidents to explain their reluctance to disband before before 
nicaragua achieves democracy 
nicaraguas embassy in san salvador issued a statement monday 
rejecting allegations that its diplomats helped leftist salvadoran 
guerrillas and were guilty of subversion 
the seven members of the political and military commission of 
the nicaraguan resistance as the contras call their organization 
told a news conference they met earlier monday with president 
alfredo cristiani of el salvador 
they conferred saturday with president oscar arias of costa rica 
and planned meetings tuesday with presidents vinicio cerezo of 
guatemala and jose azcona of honduras 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua and the four other central 
american leaders are to meet aug 57 in tela honduras about 
implementing a central american peace plan that includes disbanding 
the ussupported rebels 
contra leaders said they want demobilization delayed until 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government guarantees national 
elections scheduled for feb 25 will be honest and fair 
our army must remain intact to act as guarantors of any 
accord to make nicaragua democratic said israel galeano one of 
the contra leaders 
galeano said his commission believed arias and cristiani would 
present the contra point of view at least partially at the 
honduran summit 
washington ended military aid to the antisandinista rebels in 
february 1988 but the contras continue to receive nonlethal 
assistance 
the nicaraguan embassy statement responded to accusations friday 
by a woman student arrested on charges of taking part in rebel 
activities who claimed an embassy officer provided salvadoran 
guerrillas with money and training 
it described the allegations as part of a campaign to undermine 
the central american summit 
zoila marroquin a student at the national university who said 
she had been a member of the farabundo national liberation front 
guerrilla organization since 1986 spoke to reporters at treasury 
police headquarters she is being held for sedition 
ms marroquin said nicaraguan consul alberto leal channeled 
money from nicaragua and its soviet bloc allies to guerrilla fronts 
at the university and gave students grants for political and 
military training in nicaragua 
the embassy denied any staff members had met with ms marroquin 
and declared her statements lack any element of truth because 
they refer to events that did not occur 
cristiani has said he will present evidence at the summit that 
nicaragua has supplied weapons to the salvadoran rebels 
human rights groups estimate more than 70000 people have been 
killed since guerrillas began fighting in el salvador in october 
1979

in 1975 the rebel war combined with mismanagement and a weak 
infrastructure left by the portuguese has made mozambique one of 
the worlds poorest countries 
in his opening address chissano appeared to hint at better 
relations with businessmen and others who have had little influence 
in the past 
since our essential task is to combat the destabilization of 
which the country is a target all mozambican classes and social 
strata are equally involved in the project of rebuilding the 
country he declared 
among changes to be considered are admission of property owners 
businessmen shop owners and the religious faithful to frelimo 
membership 
chissano said however that religious believers would have to 
accept that the implementation of the party program is no less 
important than their beliefs the country has a mixture of 
christians moslems and animists 
another proposed change would lift restrictions on the number of 
workers who can be employed by farmers belonging to frelimo which 
the official news agency aim said is justified by the need to 
increase food production and for party members to lead this drive 
it added however that a party central committee report to be 
discussed at the congress makes clear its preference for party 
members to work in cooperatives 
vigorous debate is expected on economic policy and government 
efforts to end the war which has cost hundreds of thousands of 
lives and half the countrys 147 million people wholly or partly 
dependent on food aid 
the government has been moving to end central control of the 
economy since 1983 it has met conditions set by the international 
monetary fund and the world bank and has experienced modest growth 
in recent years after a decade of decline

underwater sections of the hull of the tanker 
exxon valdez ripped open on a reef that caused the nations worst 
oil spill have increasingly buckled and loosened officials said 
monday 
i want to stress and emphasize we are not yet in a critical 
situation coast guard lt larry solberg said were still 
optimistic the ship will be able to come in for repairs 
solberg said the ship remains seaworthy but its fate 
increasingly is at the mercy of weather and ocean conditions as it 
waits off san diego to be declared free of environmental and 
navigational hazards 
the valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude into 
alaskas wildliferich prince william sound on march 24 after it 
went off course and rammed its hull across bligh reef 
preliminary repairs were made before the ship was towed 2500 
miles to san diego for repairs in drydock but during the voyage 
huge sections of underwater hull plating pulled away and dangled 
beneath the hull 
working four to six miles off san clemente island divers 
through monday had cut away five of seven jagged steel plates they 
began the interim repairs friday and expect to take three to four 
more days to finish 
the dangling plates must be removed so the valdez can navigate 
san diego harbor shallows en route to the national steel and 
shipbuilding co yard for a ninemonth 25 million repair job 
signs of further hull buckling have been spotted however 
as these plates loosen and there are signs more are 
loosening it eventually could reach a point where the 
salvageability of the vessel could be in doubt solberg said 
the reason being it might not have enough bottom for adequate 
support while the ship is in dry dock 
exxon shipping co spokeswoman jan cool said the company was 
confident the ship will make it to the nassco shipyard 
we feel pretty confident that were going to arrest any 
further deterioration of the hull by cutting the plates which are 
hanging down and cutting small pieces of plate before they pull 
away any further cool said 
cool acknowledged a worsening of ocean conditions could 
exacerbate the buckling of the ships hull 
obviously at some point i dont know where that point is 
the ship would have difficulty in dry docking because you need a 
bottom to support her said fred hallet nasscos vice president 
of finance and public relations 
cool said no one has calculated just how much of the damaged 
hull needs to be removed

state environmental officials said monday 
they are unhappy with exxons plan to withdraw its oil spill 
cleanup forces from prince william sound by midseptember but the 
company says the pullout is not negotiable 
weve been saying all along we would operate until about sept 
15 when we have to shut down because of the weather said exxon 
spokesman henry beathard none of that has changed 
generally sept 15 is an average date sometimes bad weather 
starts before that sometimes after that 
a july 19 memo from otto harrison exxons general manager in 
valdez to company officials indicates exxon is adamant about a 
midseptember pullout 
he said exxon will conduct no winter cleanup operations because 
of safety and operational reasons and the companys only commitment 
for next spring is to survey the shorelines 
these are not negotiable points he wrote in the memo a 
copy of which was provided to the associated press 
the memo was dated the day before exxon president bill stevens 
testimony to the national ocean policy study subcommittee of the 
senate commerce science and transportion committee he reluctantly 
committed the company to resuming operations next year if more work 
needs to be done 
but steve provant onscene oil spill coordinator for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation said his agency wants 
exxon to leave a contingency force behind to deal with oil that may 
wash off beaches and cause problems during the winter 
were not asking them to do any beach cleaning or anything 
like that in the winter he said 
an army of 11000 people 1000 vessels and more than 70 
aircraft has been trying to clean beaches stained by the nations 
largest oil spill the exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 
spilling about 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sounds 
pristine waters 
you cant work up to the last day and pull them all out 
beathard said were working on a plan that gets them out by 
sept 15 thats the average date of when the winter storms set in 
and you can no longer operate out there 
he said studies to determine the exact day the last exxon 
workers would be withdrawn should be completed in about two weeks 
exxon on monday announced that the cleanup costs stemming from 
the spill had reduced its secondquarter profit by 850 million 
provant said his agency believes the sept 15 date is 
arbitrary and that it might be possible to have some crews 
continue working in the sound until oct 1 
we would like to see that they still maintain come capability 
to continue working as long as the weather is nice plans to have 
everything out of here by sept 15 just seems too rigid to us 
provant said the dec plans winter activities such as 
overflights mapping beach monitoring and collection of water 
quality data 
but beathard said that was out of the question we have no 
intention of doing that we think its a safety factor weve never 
talked about operating in the winter on the cleanup he said 
the memo also said exxons discussions with federal or state 
agencies is for the purpose of keeping them informed and is not 
requesting approval in discussions on these matters you should 
stress the safety and operational factors we are willing to 
discuss these factors we are not willing to discuss the 
decisions 
beathard said a shoreline assessment would be undertaken in the 
spring 
were saying we do not think that any cleanup operations will 
be needed because we plan to work on all the shorelines before we 
pull out he said there will be some oil that remains on some 
shorelines or down in the gravel 
but we believe six months of winter storms and tidal action 
will remove most if not all of whats remaining beathard said 
if there is remaining oil next spring it will be asphaltic in 
nature and it would be more environmentally damaging to remove it 
than to leave it there it poses no environmental threat

standardized literature tests are so poorly 
written they encourage students to read condensed versions of 
classics a study released monday concluded 
multiplechoice exams are more apt to test students on memorized 
facts than on ideas said the study by researchers at the state 
university of new york at albany 
the reading of a poem is treated like reading an encyclopedia 
what are the facts its the joe friday approach to education 
said alan purves codirector of the universitys center for the 
learning and teaching of literature 
purves recommended that standardized tests like the scholastic 
aptitude test for collegebound students also use essay questions 
to make students think about what theyve read he said students 
can easily get by reading commercial plot summaries 
multiple choice tests satisfy school districts needs for 
accountability without truly measuring competence purves said 
they arent particularly interested in how good the 
measurements of accountability are just so they can have a number 
they can throw in front of their school board he said 
educational testing service which produces the scholastic 
aptitude test has written multiplechoice test questions that 
measure analysis and interpretive abilities spokeswoman janet 
waanders said 
it is true that there can be good multiplechoice questions 
about interpretation purves said what we found was that there 
were very few of them on these tests

police were stationed to guard post 
offices and banks monday as zambians clamored to exchange the old 
paper money for new currency finance ministry officials reported 
the old currency must be traded for the new by aug 3 it will 
be without value after that deadline 
monday was the first day of business since the government 
announced saturday the currency would be replaced in a move to curb 
forgery smuggling and black marketeering 
the oficials reported scenes of panic at banks and business 
centers in lusaka and elsewhere in the country but there were no 
reports of violence 
a police spokesman who by custom was not identified said money 
traders from neighboring zaire attempted to pass through at least 
three border posts in northwestern zambia early monday he said 
they were repelled by armed frontier guards but gave no further 
details 
in lusaka about 75 percent of the capitals shops and exchange 
centers remained closed despite government appeals that they accept 
the old bank notes until the aug 3 deadline 
it is believed that zaireans possess millions of kwacha the 
zambian currency with much of the money gained from illicit 
trading along the border 
in the northwestern town of solwezi provincial official 
alexander kamalondo urged zambians not to help zaireans cross the 
border to change currency 
zambia in the announcement saturday on the currency change 
also ordered the closing of all landborder crossings until aug 3 
the finance ministry announcement said the government was 
replacing the 16 billion kwacha 100 million in circulation 
the currency change is one of the economic reforms ordered by 
president kenneth kaunda 
under the measure zambians will be able to exchange up to 2000 
kwacha 125 without providing proof of the source of the money 
amounts over 10000 kwacha 625 will be subject to a 50 percent 
tax 
the government has said it believes millions of the old currency 
bills have been accumulated by individuals through tax evasion 
illegal money deals and smuggling especially between zambia and 
zaire

low salaries and tempting offers from the 
private sector are making it increasingly difficult for the 
government to recruit and retain senior scientists the director of 
the national institutes of health said monday 
dr james wyngaarden told the senate labor and human resources 
committee that the intellectual stimulation prestige and research 
freedom offered by the government institutes is not enough to 
attract and keep top scientists 
a change the nih director said is essential to restoring nih 
to a fully competitive posture and demonstrating the commitment of 
the federal government to maintaining a firstclass biomedical 
research program 
of the 176 nih staff who are members of the senior executive 
service 53 are physicians and 104 have doctorate degrees he said 
senior executive service physicians are paid about half as much 
as their counterparts at university research centers and those 
with doctoral degrees are paid 19 percent less than those in 
comparable academic positions he said 
additionally the gap between nih physician salaries and the pay 
they would receive at a us medical school has widened to about 
99000 he said 
many of our senior scientists are considering whether to 
remain with nih because of these salary considerations said 
wyngaarden who was appointed by thenpresident reagan in 1982 and 
is leaving nih at the end of the month a replacement hasnt been 
nominated by president bush 
wyngaarden said he is encouraged by president bushs recent 
proposal to raise salaries for employees in senior positions 
requiring specialized and critical skills under his plan pay for 
senior government workers generally would go up by as much as 25 
percent 
at nih top pay for a senior doctoral scientist is 76400 
before bonuses the ceiling for a senior physician is 96400 
bonuses can boost that to a maximum of 99000 said nih spokesman 
storm whaley 
according to a recent nih survey to which a quarter of its phd 
scientists and science managers responded 83 percent reported 
receiving one or more employment offers ranging from 100000 to 
500000 wyngaarden said the average offer was 166000 he said 
with offers of this magnitude nih can expect to lose a 
substantial number of key senior research scientists and science 
managers he said 
low pay has also hampered recruiting efforts he said 
since 1980 nih has not been able to recruit a single research 
scientist into the senior executive service from the private or 
academic sectors to engage in the independent conduct of a clinical 
or basic biomedical research program the director said

most teenagers who smoke do so because their 
friends light up or because they feel peer pressure a survey 
conducted by teenagers indicates 
the poll commissioned by a trade association of vendingmachine 
operators also indicates that teenagers mostly buy cigarettes 
over the counter not from machines 
the poll results were released monday a day before the chief 
counsel for the chicagobased national automatic merchandising 
association was to testify before a congressional hearing on 
regulating tobacco sales through vending machines 
we in the vending industry have long been aware that our 
machines are not a significant source of cigarettes for minors 
because the majority is located in bars cocktail lounges and 
places of employment were teenagers are not present said the 
attorney richard w funk 
the survey involved interviews of 1015 people ages 13 to 17 
the interviews were conducted at 40 shopping malls in 20 major 
cities 
the study found that 42 percent of the teenagers questioned 
started smoking because their friends used tobacco thirty percent 
said peer pressure was the cause 
association spokesman walter w reed said he could not 
distinguish between those responses but said they are based on the 
respondents words 
an additional 15 percent of those surveyed cited smoking by 
parents or other relatives as the reason they started using tobacco 
on the vendingmachine issue 78 percent of the teenagers who 
often or occasionally buy cigarettes said they seldom or 
never used vending machines 
among teenagers who buy over the counter 43 percent said they 
get cigarettes at convenience stores 29 percent from gas stations 
11 percent from grocery stores and 6 percent from drug stores the 
rest said they got them other places 
the poll was conducted by response research of chicago which 
reported a margin of error of 32 percent 
the company said it used teenage interviewers in the belief 
that answers would be more frank than if adults did the polling

a 60 million federal attempt to detail 
environmental problems at nuclear weapons plants may not be 
reliable because energy department staff members didnt keep good 
notes the departments inspector general reported monday 
the department said it disagreed with the igs assessment 
aides who conducted the threeyear survey of environmental 
problems at the plants produced poorly organized supporting 
documents said the report by inspector general john c layton 
the supporting documents were mainly log books with notes taken 
in the field they generally were not recorded in complete 
sentences and were not detailed enough to function as a memory aid 
even to team members who may be involved in hundreds of findings 
at dozens of locations the report said 
the notes were neither indexed nor organized in a way that 
would allow anyone to trace facts or conclusions in the reports 
back to the source team members acknowledged that it would be 
difficult and time consuming to locate information in the backup 
documents 
the 60 million inventory was ordered under secretary john 
herrington in the reagan administration it was not immediately 
clear whether it will be used to set cleanup priorities for the 
highly contaminated nuclear weapons plants 
layton said the shortcomings in the way the plants were 
evaluated undermine the credibility of the process and call into 
question the usefulness of the surveys 
decisionmakers cannot be assured that the 60 million effort 
provides a sound basis for prioritizing environmental problems 
layton said in a memo to energy secretary james watkins 
the energy departments response included in the report said 
the poorly organized records criticized by the inspector general 
werent intended to be reference materials 
the preliminary reports produced by the field staff were sent to 
the various plants where they were not found to be deficient 
the department said 
layton said theres a chance some contamination may not be 
adequately indentified and theres a chance critical projects may 
lose limited cleanup money because they werent put in the right 
place on the priority list 
but the department said the inspector general extrapolated 
beyond what is reasonable 
layton briefly mentioned his findings during a congressional 
hearing last week but details were not available until the report 
came off the press

the supreme court decided monday that the 
government must recognize conversions to judaism by reform and 
conservative rabbis abroad starting a new round in a controversy 
that has angered many american jews 
in another decision a fivejudge panel of the court upheld an 
orthodox monopoly by rejecting an appeal that reform rabbis be 
allowed to perform marriages in israel 
the 41 ruling on the who is a jew question prompted leaders 
of the ultraorthodox agudat israel party to meet monday night and 
discuss whether to to withdraw support from prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs coalition government we have a secular court 
interfering in a religious subject said agudat legislator 
menachem porush the party has five seats of the 120 seats in 
parliament 
orthodox rabbis echoed religious affairs minister zevulun 
hammers pledge to renew the campaign for a narrower definition of 
who is a jew israel radio reported 
the problem remains as an open wound and will not be solved 
until it is solved at its roots that a jew is a jew only according 
to halacha chief rabbi avraham shapira of israels european 
jewish community said on israel radio halacha is orthodox jewish 
law 
interior minister arye deri of shas an ultraorthodox party 
said he would stop signing identity cards issued by his ministry 
my signature means that information in the identity card is 
true he said if the court says i cannot decide about that i 
shall not sign 
israel radio said identity cards would carry a sticker saying 
data contained in the nationality and religion sections 
could not be verified 
in washington rabbi eric yoffie of the association of reform 
zionists of america said were very pleased what it means is 
that the law that currently exists will now be enforced 
phil baum associate executive director of the american jewish 
congress said at a time when there appears to be dissension and 
division this is a welcome affirmation that the common bonds of 
jewish history and fate have endured and continue to bind us into 
one people 
the court ruling revives an argument over orthodox efforts to 
amend israels law of return to limit those automatically entitled 
to israeli citizenship 
orthodox jews want to include only jews born to jewish mothers 
or converted according to halacha which in effect would mean by 
orthodox rabbis 
current israeli law also grants automatic citizenship to anyone 
who has converted to judaism and is not a member of another faith 
the change has been fought by conservative and reform rabbis 
whose followers constitute a majority of more than 5 million us 
jews but who have few adherents in israel they say the orthodox 
proposal would symbolically excommunicate them from judaism and 
alienate us jews from israel 
rabbis in the united states make about 11000 conversions a 
year while orthodox rabbis perform about 1000 
the supreme court favored appeals from eight american immigrants 
and one from brazil who were denied israeli citizenship by the 
interior ministry 
the courts ruling said an israeli population register law of 
1965 did not entitle the government to decide the validity of 
conversions outside the country 
on this matter it has no bearing on whether the community 
conducting the conversion is orthodox conservative or reform 
the court said 
the marriage ruling came on appeals made seven years ago by 
rabbi moshe zemer of baltimore and an israeli rabbi mordechai 
rotem 
the judges upheld three laws that give israels orthodox rabbis 
exclusive rights to decide eligibility for presiding at marriages

commerce secretary robert mosbacher on monday 
temporarily suspended regulations requiring shrimpers to use new 
devices intended to protect endangered sea turtles from getting 
entangled and dying in their nets 
mosbachers decision came on the heels of weekend protests by 
angry shrimpers who blocked ship channels along the texas gulf 
coast and threatened violence if the regulations were not changed 
or reversed on use of socalled turtle excluders 
we have worked out what i think is a good compromise that 
indicates sympathy to the shrimpers and their families as well as 
caring about the endangered species in general and the kemps 
ridley turtles in particular mosbacher said after meeting with 
gulf state lawmakers 
mosbacher said enforcement of the turtle excluder regulations 
would be suspended for 45 days at the end of the period shrimpers 
would be required to pull their nets every 90 minutes but would not 
have to use the turtle excluders 
according to lawmakers turtles can live for 90 minutes 
underwater if trapped in a net 
after the 45day period is up however the commerce department 
enforcement staff would issue warnings to shrimpers caught not 
pulling their nets after 90 minutes the agency would reevaluate 
the regulations next year a study by the national academy of 
sciences is expected to be completed in february 
in galveston texas hundreds of shrimpers awaiting word of 
mosbachers action at the galveston coast guard station broke into 
cheers when they heard the news 
this is a lot more than we though wed get said richard 
santini of galveston who estimated he lost 6000 to 7000 during 
the ship channel blockade we can make a living now 
in cameron la boat owner ashful authement said if they go 
for 90 minutes i can relate to that but there are some times 
when it might take you that long to find a good fishing spot and 
then you have to stop and pick up 
at the end of 45 days it seems like were facing the same 
thing again said cameron deck hand paul miller 
we got a good deal said sen phil gramm rtexas i think 
it is a reasonable compromise it represents a sound way to 
approach the problem 
but one environmental group planned to organize a national 
boycott of shrimp as a result of mosbachers action 
the radical action of the secretary of commerce has convinced 
us that we need to take some radical action said mike weber 
vice president of programs for the center for marine conservation 
webers organization also planned to seek a temporary 
restraining order against mosbacher 
the shrimpers had contended their business would be ruined by 
the turtle excluder regulations 
in galveston texas on monday shrimpers met with 
representatives of the coast guard the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration and the national marine fisheries 
service about the rule which was issued under the federal 
endangered species act 
about 200 shrimp boats on saturday crowded the deepwater 
houston ship channel and about 300 shrimpers jammed port aransas 
gateway to the port of corpus christi texas those blockades as 
well as similar actions at smaller texas and louisiana ports ended 
sunday pending the outcome of the meetings monday 
ship traffic was reported normal monday coast guard officials 
said 
the turtle devices are intended to save many of the 11000 
turtles that conservationists estimate are killed each year in 
shrimp nets the devices which cost from 60 to several hundred 
dollars each are made of wire mesh and have hinged doors to allow 
turtles to swim out before the net is pulled aboard a boat 
shrimpers say the devices allow valuable shrimp to escape as 
well the shrimpers also complain that the hinged devices are 
bulky dangerous and expensive to operate 
the rule requiring the devices was to take effect may 1 but its 
enforcement has been sporadic 
failure to use the devices which federal officials say cost 
shrimpers 6 to 7 percent of their catch could result in fines of 
up to 25000 and six months in jail

the united states cautioned the soviet union 
against trying to smuggle felix s bloch out of the country weeks 
before reports surfaced that the veteran american diplomat was 
suspected of being a spy it was learned monday 
president bush described reports of spying by bloch as very 
serious but did not offer an assessment of potential damage 
two us officials said bloch had been videotaped handing a 
briefcase to a soviet agent in paris earlier this year government 
sources also disclosed an unusual level of soviet interest in 
blochs case 
bloch stripped of his official passport and state department 
credentials spent the day with one of his two daughters in a new 
york city suburb state department officials said he remains on the 
payroll though on leave and he has not been charged with any 
offense 
it was also learned that bloch when stationed in vienna had 
lobbied to keep austrian president kurt waldheim off the list of 
people banned from the united states for past nazi activities 
bloch is refusing through his attorney to be questioned by the 
fbi and only submitted to a short interrogation early in the 
investigation by state department security officers according to a 
government source familiar with the case 
the soviets were informed through diplomatic channels in a 
message described as discreet that us relations with moscow 
would be damaged if they tried to make off with the 54yearold 
diplomat a us official disclosed 
so far they have observed the admonition said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the soviets were cautioned even as us investigators 
were compiling evidence against bloch but before they had all the 
material eventually amassed 
another government source familiar with the case told the 
associated press that the soviets have exhibited extraordinary 
interest in the bloch case 
fbi agents tailing bloch on saturday as he drove to his 
daughters home outside new york city were followed in turn by 
soviet embassy personnel according to this source 
it could not be learned how many soviet agents followed the 
caravan of fbi agents driving behind bloch and his family as he 
traveled from washington to chappaqua ny saturday afternoon 
this source who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
unusual soviet surveillance of the caravan shows they have a lot 
invested in this 
meanwhile abc news reported that a soviet agent gave bloch a 
warning that he had come under suspicion the network said us 
agents monitoring blochs telephone calls heard the same agent who 
received the briefcase in paris advise bloch by telephone a bad 
virus is going around and we believe you are infected 
that telephone call came before the fbi first tried to interview 
bloch on june 22 the day he was placed on leave the network said 
the state department did not impose restrictions on his travels 
and doubts were raised that bloch would ever come to trial 
administration sources said us government investigators had 
not uncovered any accomplices within the state department nor were 
the soviets likely to come forward and implicate bloch a 
54yearold native of austria 
he might just end up being retired and put out to pasture 
an official who spoke on condition of anonymity suggested 
bloch himself has been staying at the home of his daughter 
kathy swenson in westchester county north of new york city local 
police said 
on monday he walked through woods behind the house in 
chappaqua jumped into a car she was driving and the pair headed 
south toward new york city followed by a parade of federal autos 
police said she later returned alone 
police chief steve fuchila of new castle which includes 
chappaqua said the fbi had notified him of a surveillance 
operation in the area blochs home in washington also had been 
under surveillance for some time before news of the espionage 
investigation came out friday night 
bloch discussed the waldheim case extensively with foreign 
minister alois mock said the government source who disclosed 
blochs lobbying 
they were very tight from the days in the 1950s when mock 
and the austrianborn bloch studied together in italy said the 
source who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
in a move that infuriated many austrians waldheim was placed on 
the list in april 1987 a year after the decision was first made to 
do so 
bloch who is jewish attended the waldheim inauguration with 
approval from the state department 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman 
acknowledged that bloch had been back to the department under 
escort at least once to collect personal items and to close his 
credit union account 
she said bloch who was director of the office of regional 
politicaleconomic affairs in the european bureau probably had 
returned on other occasions as well visitors are generally 
admitted to the state department if officials in the building vouch 
for them 
before his suspension ms tutwiler said in response to 
questions bloch participated in a decision announced by the 
commerce department last tuesday to permit the sale of a broad 
range of personal computers to the soviet union and easternbloc 
countries 
but the spokeswoman added i would not characterize him as a 
key player 
the state department lined up with the commerce department in 
recommending the easing of export controls defense secretary dick 
cheney strenuously objected to the decision on security grounds 
bush in his first comments on the spying issue told reporters 
at the white house i have known about this matter for some time 
and the minute i heard about it i was aggrieved because it is a 
very tragic thing should the allegations be true 
the president declined to discuss details of the case but he 
said any time a person is allegedly involved in something 
like betraying his country that to me is a very serious matter 
asked about possible damage to us security bush a former cia 
director replied i dont think anyone could give you a full 
damage assessment at this time he added that the allegations if 
true would not help improve relations with the soviet union even 
though espionage goes on all the time 
after returning from austria in 1987 after an unusually long 
sevenyear stint as deputy ambassador bloch was assigned to the 
senior seminar program at the state department 
but an official who spoke on condition of anonymity questioned 
reports that bloch was disappointed he had not been named an 
ambassador and that the job amounted to a step down 
its not a parking lot kind of job the official said 
he said of the bloch case there has to be a presumption of 
innocence

president mikhail s gorbachev said monday the 
strikes in soviet coalfields were the biggest test of his fouryear 
economic reforms worse than the chernobyl disaster and he 
called for a shakeup of local councils often blamed for blocking 
progress 
gorbachev appealed last week for a renewal of communist 
party ranks from top to bottom and his suggestion that local 
governing bodies also be transformed could mean sweeping leadership 
changes 
local elections scheduled in the spring throughout the soviet 
union involve multiple candidates and for the first time offer 
serious challenges to entrenched officials 
some members of the national legislature the supreme soviet 
said monday the elections should be held earlier gorbachev said 
each soviet republic should decide when and how to hold the 
elections 
he said party and government bodies as well as official trade 
unions should meet urgently to analyze the twoweek strike that at 
its peak idled half the soviet unions 1 million coal industry 
workers and deprived vital factories of fuel 
the kremlin chief told legislators almost all the miners have 
returned to work 
we are coming out of a very serious crisis the biggest test 
during the four years of perestroika gorbachev said 
he said the test was even more severe than the april 1986 
explosion and fire at the chernobyl nuclear power plant that killed 
31 people cost millions of dollars to clean up and sparked a 
nationwide environmental protection movement 
the strikes dealt a serious blow to the economy gorbachev said 
but he reassured his countrymen that our perestroika will give 
results despite the tests we are undergoing 
he blamed coal ministry and local officials rather than the 
miners but warned deciding such questions by striking will ruin 
our work 
communist maverick boris n yeltsin told the supreme soviet that 
local party and government leaders have been inactive and 
insensitive to peoples needs because they know they wont be 
reelected 
gorbachev said that because of the strike governing councils 
should not wait for elections to make changes 
ripe questions require sessions without delay to discuss 
reports of regional executive committees and where it is necessary 
to take personnel decisions they must be taken without waiting for 
elections he said 
several heads already have rolled tass official news agency 
reported it said the party chief and mayor of stakhanov in the 
donetsk basin were forced to leave their posts apparently 
under pressure from strikers 
one legislator suggested strike committees be absorbed into 
local governing councils because they proved they can get things 
done 
in a meeting last tuesday with party officials gorbachev said 
the party also needs a flow of fresh blood and to be renewed 
at the level of the work place the locality the city the region 
the republic the central committee and the politburo 
he said monday that party bodies should analyze reasons for the 
strikes which miners started to press for better supplies of food 
consumer goods and housing as well as higher pay and better working 
conditions 
he balked at calls for independent unions suggesting instead 
the official unions think over what happened and what to do to 
make sure unions carry out their role 
deputies speaking at mondays nationally broadcast session said 
the country needs better unions 
we have to admit the trade unions dont have the workers 
faith said lithuanian deputy kazimeras uoka we have to give 
them the right to establish independent trade unions 
soviet unions act as djuncts of the government handling 
distribution of benefits rather than fighting for workers rights 
several deputies from mining regions also called for moving up 
local elections to this fall to give voters a chance to oust 
insensitive officials 
gorbachev said such decisions should be taken in the 15 soviet 
republics not in moscow even if it means election laws and 
schedules will vary 
shall we torpedo and limit this he asked we will hardly 
succeed commanding from here 
the soviet president said at least half the 300000 striking 
miners in the donetsk basin the countrys biggest coalproducing 
area have returned to work tass said about 50 of the regions 121 
mines remain idle 
donetsk strikers were among the last holdouts from a nationwide 
coal strike that started july 11 in western siberia and spread from 
the arctic to central asia last week the government granted 
concessions and siberian miners returned to work 
a strike leader in donetsk in the ukraine 550 miles south of 
moscow said by telephone that workers are awaiting decisive 
guarantees from the supreme soviet that the government will keep 
promises made to miners saturday the supreme soviet took no action 
monday to guarantee the pact instead juggling legislation to give 
priority to strike issues 
a deputy from the pechora coal basin in the arctic told the 
supreme soviet that miners around the city of vorkuta remain on 
strike partly because of media disinformation miner vladimir 
p lushnikov said state media reported erroneously that the vorkuta 
strike had ended 
reports said miners remained on strike at 11 of 13 vorkuta mines 
and all 12 mines in chervonograd in the western ukraine 
viktor g kucherenko head of the supreme soviets planning and 
budget commission said the strike settlements probably will cost 
between 46 billion and 86 billion

a test model of a craft that could be used to 
return astronauts from space station freedom will be tested in a 
suborbital launch in august by a private california firm an 
official said monday 
james c bennett acting president of the american rocket co 
headquartered in camarillo calif said his firm will launch a 
single stage rocket to an altitude of 100 miles carrying a model of 
a space station crew return craft developed by the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
he said the model about a onethird scale will test a novel 
experimental concept called a parashield 
the device shaped rather like an umbrella will be used to 
protect the model during the highspeed portions of its return to 
earth and then will turn and act as an airbrake as the atmospheric 
thickens 
bennett said the primary purpose of the mission was to test the 
parashield behavior during its fall toward earth 
the experimental craft weighs about 600 pounds and will be 
recovered after falling into the sea about 135 miles off shore from 
the vandenberg air force base launch site 
data will be collected by instruments on board and through the 
use of longrange photography he said 
a secondary payload on the flight will be a department of 
defense experiment 
the department of transportation announced monday that it was 
granting a commercial license to american rocket for the launch 
bennett said the launch will use an unusual hybrid rocket engine 
developed by the company the rocket is powered by a solid fuel 
but uses liquid oxygen as the oxidizer in this way he said the 
rocket design has the safety advantages of a liquidfueled rocket 
with the dependability of a solid rocket 
hydrid rockets he said can be turned on and off like a liquid 
rocket by controlling the flow of oxygen but the hybrid is safer 
than a solid fuel rocket because the propellant is not explosive 
the launch will be the first by the american rocket co and the 
first commercial launch from vandenberg a center used by the air 
force to launch polar orbiting craft and to test intercontinental 
ballistics missiles 
four earlier commercial launch licenses have been granted by the 
dot and the department is reviewing eight other applications the 
announcement said 
space station freedom a permanent laboratory and crew quarters 
to be assembled in orbit in the mid1990s is to include a craft 
that can be used by astronauts for an emergency return to earth 
the mit model is to test a concept for that craft

lawmakers unveiled draft legislation monday to 
impose a ceasefire in the battle over logging in the ancient 
forests of the pacific northwest but objections from a vermont 
senator sidetracked plans for immediate subcommittee action on the 
bill 
sens mark hatfield rore and brock adams dwash planned 
to ask the full senate appropriations committee to approve the 
legislation tuesday despite concerns from sen patrick leahy dvt 
leahy both at the beginning of the interior appropriations 
subcommittee meeting and in a letter to full committee chairman 
robert byrd dwv said he was deeply disturbed that 
provisions in the bill might preempt the right of environmentalists 
to appeal timber sales to the courts 
leahys skepticism dampened the excitement of the bills 
sponsors who hope to ensure an adequate supply of logs to keep the 
regions mills operating over the next 14 months as well as 
protect some of the oldgrowth forests that are prime habitat for 
the northern spotted owl 
the bill calls for the sale of 10 billion board feet of timber 
off of the national forests and bureau of land management lands in 
oregon and washington over the next 14 months 
hatfield said that is about 10 percent less than the amount of 
timber that would be sold if some sales werent blocked by lawsuits 
to protect the spotted owl 
in addition the plan discourages logging significantly large 
blocks of oldgrowth forests a policy known as minimum 
fragmentation 
under the proposal significant stands of oldgrowth would have 
at least eight trees per acre that are at least 300 years old or 
are 40 inches in diameter environmentalists would be allowed to 
release 125 billion board feet of the almost 2 billion board feet 
of timber sales currently enjoined by federal courts in portland 
and seattle 
i am concerned that an appeal and judicial exemption process 
that started with isolated sales could expand to a region and may 
soon become national in scope said leahy who also is chairman 
of the senate agriculture committee which has jurisdiction over 
the us forest service 
leahy who has close ties to environmental groups said he was 
well aware that forest products were essential to the economic 
health of the region but added the right of appeal was also of 
vital importance 
hatfield agreed to postpone consideration of the bill until the 
full committee meeting 
the sales have been temporarily enjoined by pending lawsuits 
that claim overlogging in oldgrowth forests is threatening the 
northern spotted owl with extinction the owl hunts and nests 
almost exclusively in ancient forests 
the agreement would prohibit environmentalists from using 
injunctions to block timber sales in the next fiscal year which 
starts oct 1

forest fires raging through northern 
manitoba have forced the evacuation of more than 18000 people and 
smoke and flames threatened to block some escape routes 
the airport in thompson was reopened monday after radar 
equipment was flown in to help guide airplanes pilots were unable 
to locate the runways because of the dense smoke 
convoys of trucks loaded with food and fuel and escorted by 
police drove north from winnipeg to reach thompson about 470 miles 
away some 4000 evacuees were being sheltered in thompson a 
mining town with a normal population of 15000 the fires were 
several miles away from thompson and there was no immediate threat 
to the town 
just east of thompson firefighters sprayed water on a wooden 
bridge of a railroad used to move evacuees 
if that bridge goes out then that escape route is cut off to 
churchill manitoba natural resources minister harry enns told a 
news conference 
churchill is a hudson bay port city 260 miles northeast of 
thompson the railroad also links thompson to the south 
enns said all available equipment was being used to evacuate 
people and to block flames from sweeping through communities 
officials said only a few houses have burned and they had no 
reports of injuries or deaths 
scores of fires have broken out in parched northern manitoba in 
recent weeks but winds fanned the blazes last week and they now 
form a belt more than 200 miles wide beginning about 240 miles 
north of winnipeg evacuations started thursday as flames 
threatened communities 
officials said fires in northern saskatchewan forced 1200 
residents of sandy bay to flee their homes saturday they said that 
in northwestern ontario 400 people living at bearskin lake were 
flown out thursday 
the fires have swept through at least 2 million acres of brush 
and timber in a mainly flat area 
military transport planes trains and private vehicles were 
being used to remove people from threatened towns in manitoba in 
what is believed to be the largest evacuation in the provinces 
history officials said 13 towns have been completely evacuated 
since thursday and a number of other towns were either partly 
evacuated or the residents were on standby 
about 8500 people were evacuated when floods ravaged manitoba 
in 1950 
manitoba officials estimated there are about 250 fires in the 
fire belt but they said the figures are uncertain 
there is too much smoke we cant even see the new fires 
said karin batke of manitobas natural resources department 
manitoba officials said at least 1500 firefighters 53 
helicopters 11 waterbombers nine fixedwing aircraft and heavy 
equipment including bulldozers have been thrown into the battle 
a state of emergency was declared sunday by albert driedger 
manitobas minister of emergency measures retired or vacationing 
civil servants were asked to report for duty as exhausted relief 
workers toiled around the clock 
virtually all of northern manitoba is on fire and were just 
hoping some of our major centers are not going to be affected 
driedger said once you get 15 minutes out of winnipeg all you 
see is smoke 
lightning is blamed for most of the fires but police believe 
people started at least two 
weather forecasts said there could be thundershowers in the 
areas but the storms could cause more lightningset fires

the hunt brothers bank creditors sought 
control of their business empire after the silver price collapse of 
march 1980 left the texas investors up to 2 billion in debt lamar 
hunt owner of the kansas city chiefs testified monday 
i was told that the banks wanted to put their arms around all 
of the hunts hunt told us tax court judge jules g korner iii 
and by the hunts i mean bunker herbert and me and they wanted 
to control all of the operations of the hunts 
lamar and his other brothers nelson bunker and william herbert 
are in us tax court contesting a total of more than 300 million 
in taxes the internal revenue services says is owed from the 1982 
dissolution of a partnership set up to repay their debts after 
silver price collapse 
under the partnership agreement the familys placid oil co 
contributed 824 million of a 11 billion loan it obtained from a 
consortium of banks under a federal reserve directive at the time 
banks were not allowed to lend on silver investments 
the brothers in turn contributed silver gold stocks and coal 
properties in north dakota 
lamar testified the banks insisted he be included in the 
partnership with his brothers as well as serve as a guarantor 
although he said he had no outstanding bank debts on silver at the 
time 
the banks were insisting i be in the partnership lamar 
said the banks wanted to put their arms now only around herbert 
and bunker but they wanted to put their arms around me and that 
was the way it was presented to me 
i was told the banks were dictating the wording and the terms 
of the agreement hunt said 
asked if he had pledged all his assets including his rolex 
watch hunt said yes the famous watch 
bunker testified last week that the banks had demanded as 
collateral paintings on the wall and his brothers rolex 
bunker and herbert each are contesting more than 150 million in 
1982 taxes while lamar is contesting 505377 in taxes 
lamar said he lost about 15 million on his silver investments 
which began in 1974 at the height of his silver investing hunt 
said he had 1600 futures contracts each for 5000 ounces of 
silver 
lamar like bunker blamed restrictions on silver investors by 
the commodities markets for the silver price collapse 
in a pending case however the commodity futures trading 
commission has accused bunker and herbert of attempting to corner 
the silver market it says they owned onethird of the worlds 
silver bullion when prices collapsed a jury in new york last year 
found bunker herbert and two others had conspired to manipulate 
and monopolize the silver market and defraud investors 
the two exbillionaires now owe 250 million in fines and 
interest in that lawsuit brought by minpeco the peruvian silver 
mining company

a circuit judge on monday rejected efforts to 
block a new trial for a convicted rapist who is on parole and whose 
victim recanted her charges four years ago 
cook county circuit judge thomas r fitzgerald ruled that 
genetic test results obtained by gary dotsons attorneys constitute 
important new evidence he denied two motions by prosecutors to 
dismiss a petition for a new trial 
defense attorney thomas breen said the ruling paves the way for 
a trial that will finally vindicate dotson 
its great breen said after the hearing were 90 percent 
there 
but assistant states attorney gayle shines said it was 
speculation to talk of a new trial she said the state will outline 
its position at a hearing aug 14 at that point fitzgerald will 
schedule a hearing that likely will determine whether a new trial 
will take place 
ms shines said prosecutors have not decided what approach to 
take regarding the evidence that dotsons attorneys say proves he 
did not rape cathleen crowell webb 
breen said genetictest results prove that semen found on the 
underpants worn by ms webb the night in july 1977 when she said 
she was raped was not dotsons 
but ms shines said the defense has failed to prove the test 
results have a substantial probability of changing the outcome 
of the original trial a requirement for granting a new trial based 
on new evidence 
and under state law evidence of semen is not required to prove 
that a rape occurred she said evidence that gary dotson was not 
the seminal donor cannot by itself change the results of the 
trial ms shines said 
she also argued that the statute of limitations on a bid for a 
new trial expired two years after dotsons 1979 conviction on 
charges of rape and aggravated kidnapping 
fitzgerald rejected the argument noting breens petition 
contends that some evidence in the case was fraudulently concealed 
which would override the law 
dotson was not present but a sister attended the hearing 
were going to prove once and for all that he didnt do it 
said laura dotson 26 
dotson was sentenced to a 25 to 50year prison term after his 
conviction but in 1985 ms webb recanted her testimony now a 
jaffrey nh homemaker she said she made up the attack because 
she feared she had become pregnant by her boyfriend 
gov james r thompson granted dotson clemency saying his 
punishment had been sufficient but the governor said he did not 
believe ms webbs aboutface and has refused to pardon dotson 
dotson 32 remains in an alcoholism treatment center as a 
condition of his parole last august he had been returned to prison 
in december 1987 for a parole violation 
since his 1985 release dotson has had recurring minor problems 
with the law mostly driving violations he also had faced two 
misdemeanor battery charges one stemming from an altercation in a 
bar and the other prompted by an allegation of abuse from his wife 
both charges were dropped 
dotson married shortly after his release the couple have a 
daughter

a man suspected of spying for the soviets 
walked through the woods behind his daughters home monday jumped 
into the car she was driving and headed south followed by a parade 
of federal autos 
we knew he was there and that he left said new castle 
police chief steve fuchila he would not give details of the 
departure but other officers who were at the scene said felix 
bloch left the house by the back door and went through the woods 
where he was picked up by his daughter kathy swenson 
the car headed south on the saw mill river parkway the federal 
cars in tow said the officers who declined to be identified the 
parkway leads south to new york city 
the daughter returned alone at 6 pm carrying shopping bags 
she entered a nextdoor neighbors house 
when bloch drove to his daughters house on saturday fbi agents 
tailed him and were followed in turn by soviet embassy personnel 
according to a government source familiar with the case 
the local police chief said the fbi had notified him of a 
surveillance operation in the area but did not disclose details 
however a police source said the hamilton road residence had been 
under federal observation for several days before friday when 
reports surfaced that bloch a 30year veteran of the state 
department had been filmed last spring exchanging a briefcase with 
a known kgb agent 
there are no formal charges against bloch and us officials 
have declined to go beyond confirming that he is the target of an 
intelligence investigation and no longer has access to the state 
department building 
joseph valiquette the new yorkarea fbi spokesman would not 
comment

a federal appeals court is reconsidering brown vs 
topeka board of education after withdrawing a recent ruling in 
which it revived the historic case a court official said monday 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals in denver last week 
withdrew its june 2 decision in the desegregation case without 
explanation 
its as if there had been no opinion ever filed said robert 
hoecker the courts clerk they will reconsider the case 
hoecker said he did not know if the court would hold new 
hearings or base the new decision on existing testimony and 
evidence he also said he did not know why the decision was made 
attorneys in the case said they found out about the withdrawal 
friday and were unsure what the action means for the topeka kan 
school system 
this is purely my speculation i think somewhere in the 
dissent someone is criticizing somebody else and the majority 
wants an opportunity to respond to that criticism said rich 
jones a topeka lawyer who represents the plaintiffs in the 
35yearold case 
in 1987 us district judge richard rogers of topeka ruled that 
topekas public school district no longer had any illegal or 
intentional separation of races 
in june the appeals court overturned rogers ruling saying the 
topeka school system had not done enough to overcome remnants of 
the segregated school system that existed before the us supreme 
court decided the landmark brown vs topeka board of education case 
in 1954 the appeals court ordered rogers to devise a remedy for 
what it called the racially identifiable schools in topeka 
topeka superintendent gary livingston said he and his staff are 
still unsure what the appeals court action means and he will be 
meeting with attorneys 
the 1954 supreme court decision held that the separate but 
equal concept for public schools was unconstitutional 
the case was reopened in 1979 when the parents of 17 topeka 
public schoolchildren sought a decision on whether the schools had 
eliminated traces of the segregated system the parents included 
linda brown buckner who as a student in 1954 gave the case its 
name

abc news made a terrible mistake when it 
did not clearly label photos shown on its evening news show as a 
staged reenactment of a spying investigation a network official 
said monday 
the blunder in fridays world news tonight segment on 
veteran american diplomat felix s bloch might have led some 
viewers to believe that they were watching videotaped frames of 
bloch giving a briefcase to a soviet agent 
but the networks two still pictures of the transaction were 
created by abc news staffers and were not taken from fbi footage of 
an alleged bloch encounter with a soviet agent in paris abc news 
officials said monday 
bloch has not been charged with any wrongdoing but he has been 
placed on leave and has had his diplomats building pass and 
security clearances revoked 
it was a terrible mistake not to identify clearly the news 
simulation as such richard wald senior vice president of abc 
news said monday in a telephone interview i regret it 
nonetheless wald defended reenactments in general saying they 
should be seen as extensions of courtroom sketches 
at least one media critic took a different point of view 
i think that recreations are pure poison said ben 
bagdikian the former dean of the graduate journalism school at the 
university of california berkeley since the fox network got its 
ratings with americas most wanted its clearly an imitation of 
that its docudrama as news 
the abc simulation lasted about 10 seconds and included two 
grainy still shots of one man handing a briefcase to another 
abc correspondent john mcwethys narration at the time said it 
was not until earlier this year that bloch was videotaped handing 
over a briefcase to a known soviet agent on the streets of a 
european capital 
the sequence failed to include a simulation advisory in the 
upper left corner of the screen as is customary and required 
practice of the network 
the staged frames were followed by a brief videotape of a street 
scene with two men walking across an intersection the video 
featured a running time code in the lower right corner and a 
blinking cross hair suggesting real surveillance footage that 
scene was clearly labeled as a simulation 
later that same evening in a subsequent transmission of the 
peter jenningsanchored newscast the simulation credit was 
present for all of the newscasts reenactments 
wald said that the majority of abc affiliates used the first 
version without the simulation notice 
abc newsroom guidelines say it should be made explicitly clear 
that the audience is watching a news simulation according to abc 
spokeswoman elise adde

police said monday they are investigating the 
reported theft from londons heathrow airport of a paul gaugin 
painting owned by the beadlestone gallery of new york 
the london daily mail newspaper said the painting was valued at 
more than 19 million and was stolen from a cargo hangar at the 
airport 
it said the watercolor measuring nine inches by four inches is 
titled tahitienne en pareo rouge tahitian woman in a red 
skirt

the delaware supreme court on monday 
allowed time inc to proceed with its 14 billion offer for warner 
communications inc and paramount communications inc dropped its 
122 billion hostile bid for time 
the ruling paves the way for time and warner to create the 
worlds largest communications concern time warner inc 
paramount and some of times shareholders had asked a 
threejustice state supreme court panel to overturn a ruling by 
chancery court judge william t allen 
like many of the other biggest us corporations time warner 
and paramount are incorporated in delaware and subject to its laws 
allen had ruled that the proposed timewarner deal announced in 
march three months before paramount launched its bid was the 
result of longterm business planning and that paramount and times 
shareholders could not interfere 
michael klein an attorney for some of the time shareholders 
said that because mondays ruling upholding allen was unanimous 
the decision would not be appealed to the full state supreme court 
which has five justices 
paramount issued a statement saying it was ending its bid for 
time but would continue to try to expand 
we believe in making bold moves when they are in the best 
interest of paramount communications shareholders paramount 
chairman martin davis said we have just demonstrated that in our 
offer for time 
times 70ashare tender offer for warner expired at 5 pm edt 
and time announced it held more than 117 million warner shares or 
about 58 percent of the companys outstanding common stock time 
said it would announce tuesday the exact number of shares tendered 
under its offer 
under the offer time was to purchase slightly more than half of 
warners common stock and exchange a combination of cash and 
securities valued at 70 a share for the rest time said it would 
begin paying for the tendered shares on july 31 
investors sold off time stock during mondays hearing which 
was televised live by cable news network the companys shares were 
down 125 to 13725 a share in new york stock exchange trading 
after the decision was announced warner rose 1 to 6650 a share 
and paramount was up 87 cents to 5837 a share 
time said its plans to merge with warner would give shareholders 
greater value in the long term than paramounts 200ashare offer 
paramount argued that the warnertime deal was economically 
inferior to its offer and detrimental to time shareholders 
the justices closely questioned paramount and time shareholder 
attorneys during the hearing 
justice andrew gt moore asked michael klein an attorney for 
some of times biggest shareholders if they were demanding that 
we must hold that a board is hostage to any person who walks in 
and makes a bid no matter what the longterm plans are 
the justices asked time attorney robert joffe why the 
70ashare offer for warner which replaced an earlier stockswap 
merger plan was not submitted to a vote by time shareholders at 
the companys annual meeting in june 
joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not 
involve the issuing of new time stock 
paramount attorney melvyn cantor contended that delaware law 
required times board to inquire into paramounts bid and noted 
the supreme court in a previous case had held that the failure to 
inquire is gross negligence 
time defended the right of its directors to determine the 
companys future course and said previous delaware supreme court 
cases allow a board to refuse to consider offers that threaten 
longterm plans 
time will pay 70 per share for half of warners 200 million 
outstanding shares time will later exchange 70 in a combination 
of cash and securities for the remaining shares 
separately the wall street journal reported that about 500 
warner executives and employees would be paid a total of about 677 
million under stock option and bonus plans if the deal with warner 
goes through 
the journal said the payments disclosed in minutes of a warner 
board meeting june 15 amounted to the largest compensation package 
for employees of a company involved in a takeover 
warner chairman steven ross would receive 193 million in 
payments and would also receive options on 18 million time warner 
shares the journal said

hazardous materials experts reassured 
hundreds of displaced families monday that fumes from a chemical 
fire wont hurt their homes and one official said even garden 
vegetables will be edible 
the experts were monitoring a burning tank car that forced 
officials to keep a 15 squaremile area cordoned off for a third 
day monday 
meanwhile a csx railroad spokesman reported that the brakeman 
on the csx freight train which derailed saturday checked himself 
into a local hospitals substance abuse program that night 
within hours of the derailment the brakeman and other crew 
members submitted blood and urine samples for federally required 
drug and alcohol testing said r lindsay leckie senior manager of 
news and information for the railroad the brakeman later told 
railroad officials he wanted to enter the hospitals drug and 
alcohol abuse program leckie said 
leckie emphasized that human error had been ruled out as a cause 
of the derailment and that brakemans decision wasnt expected to 
alter that 
the brakeman was riding in the first of two locomotives pulling 
tank cars on a run from port huron to midland and was not at the 
controls when the train derailed said leckie and william loftus 
executive director of the federal railroad administration 
test results on the entire crew were expected later this week 
leckie said 
some people forced from their homes by the fiery derailment 
meanwhile said they wanted to move even if everything is ok 
ive always had a gut feeling something would happen ive 
always looked at those tank cars and wondered what kind of poison 
was in them said stanley siminski 77 who lives near the 
railroad tracks 
my wife and i are talking about getting out i dont know if 
well be able to sell now 
gladys gott who lives threequarters of a mile from the 
derailment said she also wants to move i dont think ill feel 
safe she said you dont know what that stuff is 
the tracks where the derailment occurred have been used for more 
than 10 years to carry toxic chemicals between freeport texas and 
nearby midland on a regularly scheduled run known as the unit 
train 
experts decided monday to speed up the burning of the chemical 
by pumping air into the car and boosting the fire which burst from 
a gash in the car 
the chemical chlorosilene emits hydrochloric acid as it burns 
but steve buser director of hazardous materials for csx said the 
amounts were low and were dissipating into the air 
buser said it was impossible to tell how long it would take the 
chemical to burn away but he said he believed little was left in 
the tank car 
at the car the amount of acid in the air was within safety 
limits and 150 yards away monitors detected none he said adding 
that houses cars and other personal possessions wouldnt be 
damaged 
food from gardens would be safe after it was thoroughly washed 
said rod jordan of the michigan department of agriculture 
leckie said 250 to 350 people had registered with the red cross 
to get the railroad to pay for motel rooms meals and clothing 
other evacuees had gone to stay with friends and relatives 
leckie said the railroad also will pay businesses forced to close 
by the evacuation and reimburse pay lost by those unable to go to 
work he added 
investigators from csx the national transportation safety 
board and the federal railroad administration said it was too 
early to determine the cause of the crash 
calls for slower speeds for trains carrying hazardous materials 
were answered by the state government monday 
train speed is just one factor you could have equipment 
failure contributing to it also you cant say that speed whether 
its going 25 or 40 mph would be a contributing factor the track 
condition is good for 40 mph said don riel assistant 
administrator of the rail safety and traffic division of the 
michigan department of transportation 
the train was traveling at 37 mph when it derailed officials 
said

the turkish cypriot government released 
early tuesday all 82 greek cypriot women who were jailed six days 
ago for staging an antiturkish demonstration 
hundreds of greek cypriots including president george 
vassiliou welcomed the women at the police academy in the greek 
cypriot sector of the divided capital 
sobbing with relief the freed women sang the greek national 
anthem to the cheers of the welcoming crowd 
the women were driven to the academy in a convoy of united 
nations peaceforce buses following their release from a prison in 
the turkishoccupied zone of nicosia 
a total of 108 greek cypriots 98 women and 10 men were 
arrested wednesday on the 15th anniversary of the turkish invasion 
while demonstrating in the unbuffer zone dividing the east 
mediterranean island 
they were charged with violating the border of the turkish 
cypriot state which is recognized only by turkey 
sixteen girls all under the age of 18 were released sunday and 
monday the 10 men including bishop chrysostomos another greek 
orthodox priest a doctor and two journalists are still held 
the release of the women followed mass demonstrations by greek 
cypriots and a 5day sitin blocking the main entrance to the un 
headquarters by hundreds of women 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on thursday 
called for the release of all of the prisoners 
he also cricized both the greek cypriot demonstrators and the 
turkish cypriot police for entering the un buffer zone 
eleni vrahimi a lawyer and one of the organizers of wednesdays 
demonstration said she and all of the other prisoners had been 
severely beaten by turkish cypriot police 
the trial before a turkish cypriot court was a mockery and a 
parody of justice she said there are no borders in cyprus and 
we were protesting the turkish occupation in the yards of a greek 
cypriot school and a church when the turkish forces seized us 
vassilou told the crowd the release of the women shows that 
humanity is not prepared to accept the violation of human rights 
he expressed hope the 10 men would be freed soon 
the conflict caused by the demonstration and arrests threatened 
to wreck the 11monthold unsponsored peace talks between 
vassiliou and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash on reunification 
of the island 
cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkish troops invaded 
and seized 40 percent of its territory turkey said the troops were 
sent to protect the turkish cypriots who comprise 17 percent of the 
islands population 
turkey launched the invasion after a shortlived coup by greek 
cypriots seeking a union with greece

republican campaign warriors in the house are 
trying to open a second front in their bid to cut the clout of 
incumbents hoping that voter cynicism about congress itself will 
work against democrats in 1990 
demanding campaign finance reforms that would undo some of the 
advantages incumbents enjoy when they seek reelection rep newt 
gingrich the gop whip and his deputies say they are not going to 
settle for less than a full overhaul of campaign and ethics laws 
just to get an agreement with the democratic majority 
since the parties dont and probably wont agree on what to do 
and exactly how to go about it that makes democratic support 
unlikely that would make legislation improbable if not impossible 
leading to phase two of the gop battle plan which is to try to 
identify republicans with reform and to make that a major national 
issue in the 1990 congressional campaign 
there are certain flaws in the plan 
one is that the top democrat in the house speaker thomas s 
foley is publicly committed to action this year on ethics and 
campaign reform that hardly gives the republicans a bye on the 
issue 
but gingrich contends that what the democrats would do is not 
adequate and would be more public relations than real reform 
then too the gop is not without its own problems on ethics and 
reform a republican administration produced improprieties and 
influence peddling in federal housing programs now under 
congressional investigation in addition gingrich himself faces a 
possible investigation by the house ethics committee in connection 
with a 1984 book promotion deal 
gingrich who lodged the ethics charges that led to the downfall 
of house speaker jim wright said the accusations against him are 
baseless he called them an attack on me for blowing the whistle 
on jim wright 
he said neither party had the franchise for hud scandals 
but testimony about influence peddling by bigname republicans 
can hardly be helpful in a gop quest for the reform mantle in the 
next campaign 
we still believe that the issue of reform is our issue said 
rep steve gunderson rwis who serves on a bipartisan house task 
force that is considering campaign finance and ethics reforms 
gunderson said surveys reflecting widespread mistrust of congress 
as an institution are an indication that incumbency could carry 
liabilities in 1990 
in a house controlled by democrats 257 to 175 with three 
vacancies the gop theory is that the majority suffers most 
that theory will get preview tests this summer in special 
elections to fill the seats left open by the death of rep claude 
pepper of florida and by the resignations of wright and rep tony 
coelho of california the democratic whip 
the real push for position on the reform issue will come later 
foley has said he will press the reform quest after leaders of 
both parties get the recommendations of the special task force 
but those recommendations wont mean much if there is partisan 
stalemate on major campaign finance questions while gingrich 
contends that any real reform hurts the democratic party the 
gop whip and his deputies do not sound as though they would be 
dismayed to have an issue rather than a bill 
their tactics illustrate a generation gap among house 
republicans the old gop school was one of negotiation and 
compromise with the controlling democrats thats the only way a 
chronic minority can shape legislation 
gingrich contends that his more confrontational style is the way 
out of minority status toward capturing the control republicans 
have not had in 35 years 
the democratic party is the party of the entrenched 
incumbent he said at a luncheon with reporters and deputy gop 
whips it is truly dangerous for the country to have this 
kind of incumbency advantage gingrich said real reform 
legislation will change that and republicans will not make a deal 
for anything less 
gingrich rejected any partial approach to reform arguing that 
the democrats could use that to defuse the ethics issue in the 1990 
campaign were not going to give them an inexpensive ticket to 
masquerade behind he said 
he said that unless there is fundamental reform in congress 
president bush should veto the legislative appropriations bill that 
provides funds to the house and senate that wouldnt settle 
anything but it certainly would fuel the debate on reform as a 
congress heads into the 1990 campaign season 
and that fits the gop game plan 
the democrats are conceding the issue to us gunderson said

arthur and marion vassmer ordered a shipment 
of woodstock key chains and cigarette lighters for their general 
store in plenty of time for any crowds this year 
its what they didnt order 20 years ago this summer that still 
causes a few pangs of regret 
the shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare 
that august 1517 when about a half million youngsters camped out 
nearly two miles away at the woodstock music festival 
for one long weekend vassmers open since 1911 on the shores of 
white lake to serve residents of this 6000population town 
operated like an exclusive nightclub bouncers stood at the front 
door and let customers in a few dozen at a time to shop 
if id known i would have had 50 cases of peanut butter up 
front and said there you go take all you want said arthur 
vassmer 
the vassmers never made it up to yasgurs farm during the 
woodstock festival in 1969 when flower children frolicked in the 
mud and listened to the who jimi hendrix santana and others they 
were too busy 
but they could hear the music wafting through the air at all 
hours of the day and night i didnt believe it would come off 
marion vassmer said and i still dont believe it was here 
the vassmers remember kids abandoning their cars in town late 
thursday night sitting on hoods and playing guitars and camping 
out in the streets and nearby fields at night 
vassmers the closest store to the festival site hadnt even 
ordered any extra provisions all of their canned goods were prized 
items along with the peanut butter despite the crowds arthur 
said he doesnt remember any shoplifters and none of the 25 checks 
he cashed bounced 
they didnt bother anybody marion said they were no 
problem im sure a lot of them were on drugs but they helped each 
other out if one kid didnt have enough money someone else would 
give him some 
arthur vassmer said he dropped about 12 pounds over three days 
mostly because he couldnt bear to turn on his light and cook 
something in his apartment above the store with so many hungry kids 
on the street below 
the couple love reminiscing about the festival with visitors 
but they know enough not to bring up the name woodstock to 
longtime bethel residents 
its not a good topic for conversation because people who were 
against it they still feel the same way they did then said 
marion vassmer 
bethel and the surrounding catskill mountain region has let it 
be known theyre not particularly sentimental for the 20th 
anniversary bethel refused offers from promoters to be host to an 
anniversary concert even when businessmen dangled enticements such 
as paying for a new town sewer system 
town officials are expecting several thousand people to show up 
at the former yasgur farm for the anniversary 
the concert was originally planned for the town of woodstock 
about 50 miles away but moved when promoters couldnt get 
permission to hold it at woodstock today cynical store owners 
sell tshirts with a map of the area making clear the festival took 
place in bethel not in the famous arts colony 
the vassmers are part of a contingent of bethel residents who 
wish the town could cash in on its place in history by more 
actively seeking tourists but antifestival opinion has held sway 
arthur vassmer said some people still wander into the general 
store and recognize him from the movie woodstock in which he 
was interviewed some even ask for autographs which still leaves 
him tickled his store with the worn wooden floorboards hasnt 
changed much since 1969 
times have though and thats why he cant see a repeat 
performance of woodstock 
today you couldnt do it he said its a different 
attitude these people were the peace people they came up here for 
love and peace and music and thats what they got

although much has been made of the woodstock 
generations aging the heroes of the festival are for the most 
part doing now what they did then 
in the order they appear on a monument at yasgurs farm heres 
who are and what became of them

editors note jean shiner has been blind from birth her 
husband franklin can see a little but is legally blind youd 
figure that bringing up two lively normal daughters aged 3 and 5 
would prove an overwhelming burden read on 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
now and then when her daughters were 
babies jean shiner would wander the landscapes of their bodies 
with her hands i could feel them and know exactly who had a 
short nose and who had long fingers it was neat 
now esther is 5 and judy 3 too big to sit still for such 
things but the memory came back recently as jean applied calamine 
lotion 
the actual location of their chicken pox rash eluded her but 
i just put it all over them that way i figured id hit it 
which pretty much sums up the common sense humor and love jean 
shiner brings to raising two children she cannot see 
shes been blind all her life but that never stopped her from 
learning to bicycle ski or sail it never stopped her from going 
to college graduating with honors or earning a masters degree 
nor did it stop her from falling in love with a deepvoiced 
articulate man eight years her senior 
at the perkins school for the blind outside boston where jean 
boarded from age 5 you were encouraged to date sighted guys 
we had socials they would bring in sighted kids but then 
youd never see them again the idea was you should marry someone 
with a pair of eyes to drive you around and read to you and take 
care of you 
jean married franklin shiner legally blind from birth which 
pretty much sums up her attitude about being cared for 
the shiners snug redshingled house has an ambiance any parent 
can appreciate from the crunch of a stray cheerio in the kitchen 
to the deflating balloons strewn about the living room stragglers 
from judys birthday party counting the shiner kids the guest 
list numbered nine 
outside is the timeless smalltown summer symphony of chattering 
children barking dogs and hissing lawn sprinklers punctuated by 
slamming screen doors 
each time the shiners door opens a bell rings on the first 
warm day of the year when we all opened our doors for the first 
time judy kept running out jean explains 
today theres also the steady drone of the tv in the shiner 
living room a rare concession to chicken pox by a mother faced 
with entertaining two housebound kids a visitor and a bored 
german shepherd 
she serves coffee to the visitor cheese puffs and juice to the 
girls then pours herself a cup of tea and sinks into a kitchen 
chair 
frank shiner has already strapped on his backpack and set off 
for montpeliers lone supermarket a twomile round trip he makes 
every other day jean likes to cook and has a wellstocked freezer 
with a braille map 
on a normal day esther and judy would be outdoors by now 
riding bikes blowing bubbles or playing with other kids lunch is 
a prelude to quiet time followed by outings to the pool or the 
library with seltzer the guide dog in the lead jean grips 
seltzers harness and esther pushes judys stroller a formation 
perfected over time 
esther will help me report stores as we walk downtown if i go 
past where i wanted to go says jean 36 a slender woman with 
youthful good looks and a friendly confident manner 
other animals tend to be seltzers downfall and esther has 
learned to spot them a block away shell yell i see a dog i see 
a cat 
probably 10 years from now ill look back and say how did i 
do it for the time being however jean would much rather be 
called ordinary than amazing as in isnt she amazing 
she can walk down the street with her kids and her dog 
esther and judy find jean and frank every bit as ordinary as 
most small children regard their parents mommy is blind and she 
cant see and daddy is blind and he can see a little esther 
explains in the slightly exasperated voice of big sisters 
everywhere the interview ends abruptly as the subject loses 
interest and wanders back to sesame street 
esther immaculate in oshkosh overalls is the studious one 
with thoughtful dark eyes a neat cap of brown hair and dimples 
like her mothers judys a disheveled escape artist hazeleyed 
roundfaced and rambunctious 
both girls report each others mischief except in cases of 
conspiracy as when in the interest of science they snuck a 
little extra baking powder into their mothers cookie dough they 
were really yucky jean says cheerfully we ate them anyway 
in the living room the sound of crunching cheese puffs stops 
abruptly and esther pipes up right on cue 
judys stuffing her cheeks mommy 
dont stuff your cheeks judy 
jean relies on a combination of intuition and hearing to tell 
her when her kids are up to something like most mothers shes 
seldom wrong 
they get sat in the chair when i think theyre doing 
something the most common chairsitting offense at the moment 
looking out the window at neighbors who dont go to bed when they 
do 
esther wanders into the kitchen scrunching a brown paper bag 
sometimes i do this to bags she says solemnly then dissolves 
into giggles as her mother swoops down and scoops her up in a hug 
sometimes i do this to little girls jean tells her

time to color esther and judy sit at the table while jean 
fetches their coloring books and crayons stored along with 
puzzles games and cards in separate bags in her bedroom closet 
the kids clothes are neatly folded in their dressers jean pins 
the shirts and pants together before she washes them to keep her 
girls color coordinated 
as the girls grow so does the shiners library i spend half 
my time figuring out how to get books jean says im really 
envious of mothers in the library who can just pick up any book and 
read it to their kids 
she also envies parents who can follow the puppet shows finger 
plays and craft demonstrations at play groups and story hours 
group situations are real hard everyone can look at the teacher 
and i cant 
jean uses a leash to keep track of judy in the pool during 
swimming lessons esther is more compliant but we talk to judy a 
lot about boundaries shed wind up in east calais if we didnt 
plans for a new fence in the back yard attest to the wanderlust of 
the youngest shiner 
lunchtime jean fixes tuna sandwiches scraping carrots to serve 
on the side everything has its place in her kitchen pots pans 
utensils temperature settings on her oven dials are specially 
marked as are the microwave and egg timer spices are labeled in 
braille 
joining hands for grace is a shiner ritual so is the story hour 
that follows the meal the girls cuddle next to jean on the sofa 
seltzers tail thumps the carpet as she curls up at their feet 
a guide dog is like another child says jean who rises 
early to put the big shepherd through her paces her training is 
very intensive and i have to keep up with it boredom is an 
occupational hazard for a dog trained in bigcity traffic then 
assigned to vermont 
jean is skilled at using a cane but a cane is an extension of 
your hand for half the year in vermont all your landmarks are 
covered up a dog is a living partner at the shiners shes 
also a pet 
for the next halfhour jean reads bible stories to judy esther 
has her own copy of the book and follows along mouthing the words 
her fingers brushing the print as her mothers skim over the 
braille 
frank returns from the market laden with provisions im 
putting the girls shampoo under the sink he calls wheres 
lunch 
on the counter to the right of the sink 
the story continues followed by a token attempt at a nap 
finally jean relents the girls may play quietly in the yard 
raising two children without benefit of ones sight might seem 
overwhelming to some people but jean says it never really fazed 
her much we worried some but we tend to face problems as they 
come up one day at a time one stage at a time 
if i could see id have to figure out from scratch how to be 
a sighted person im used to listening to using my other senses 
if i could see for a day id like to see what colors look like 
what a sunset looks like then i would give it up 
jeans blindness was caused by too much oxygen given her and her 
twin sister joan following their premature birth some of joans 
sight was saved since she was slightly bigger and was removed from 
the isolette first jean suffered optic nerve damage and sees only 
darkness 
nevertheless as a child growing up in framingham mass jean 
didnt miss out on anything says her mother helen harbberts 
if joan got a coloring book and crayons jean got a coloring book 
and crayons when joan got a twowheeler jeannie did too 
dorothy shiner franks mother thinks the antinausea medicine 
she took during pregnancy may have caused her sons blindness two 
months after his birth her sighted husband abandoned the family 
mrs shiner who also is blind earned a living managing a snack 
bar in a vermont state office building mainstreaming had not yet 
been envisioned but frank was allowed to do whatever the other 
kids did i brought him up to be independent 
it never occurred to jean and frank not to have children though 
jean waited until she was pregnant to tell her mother both 
families shared the new parents joy and relief when esther and 
judy were born fully sighted 
jean quit her job counseling disabled people to be a fulltime 
mother and frank took paternity leave from his job producing a 
radio show for the governors committee on employment of the 
handicapped a public health nurse supervised esthers first bath 
and feeding but then the shiners were on their own 
despite all the baby books jean studied during pregnancy i 
discovered that i didnt know anything about raising a child before 
i had one and neither did a lot of sighted people 
for all its joys parenthood is also a time of great 
vulnerability for the shiners because they walk everywhere they 
go jean keeps the girls indoors when the temperature drops below 
zero but otherwise we are out there visible whatever the 
weather frank says 
most people ride by in their cars and their kid is in a car 
seat strapped into the back with the door locked and the window 
rolled up 
despite his communications degree and experience steady work in 
radio has eluded frank during the 10 years since the state stopped 
funding his show in the past ive sold myself short working 
just to say i have a job 
the shiners get by on disability benefits and frank keeps busy 
with various disability rights organizations but he struggles with 
the toll joblessness has taken on his confidence 
rather then take another survival job hes chosen to help 
raise his daughters until satisfying work comes along i read 
with them i take time with them i try to make the most of it 
its an opportunity a lot of guys dont get 
for jean acceptance by other mothers is an ongoing struggle 
they can put their kid in someones car but they think twice 
about letting me pick up their child im always having to earn 
their trust to remind people im blind but im a person just 
like you

the remains of the airplane lay 
rotting in the slimy thicket of a gulch wings clipped tail shorn 
body stove in a sorry looking carcass guarded by squadrons of 
bloodthirsty mosquitoes 
to ted spencer it shone like a jewel 
it can be restored spencer was saying stalking the 
remains nodding yes it can his boots made sucking sounds as 
he bounded around in the muck snapping pictures oblivious to the 
mosquitoes his glee obvious 
i heard about this airplane last year and didnt believe it 
was true when i came and saw it for myself saw ptarmigan ii 
painted on its nose my heart leapt look you can still read it 
ted spencer is the director of the alaska aviation heritage 
museum which occupies a corner of the anchorage airport 
at 42 he couples a childlike exuberance for airplanes with a 
professorial knowledge of them especially airplanes of the 
ptarmigan ii vintage 
his aim is to document through records and artifacts one of 
the most colorful periods in american history the 20 years before 
world war ii when the aviation as it was called came to 
alaska 
the old airplanes themselves of course are the prime 
artifacts a proud array of them restored to look like new 
contrast handsomely with their modern counterparts flying overhead 
what those aviation pioneers did in alaska was no less 
extraordinary says spencer than men landing on the moon what 
they accomplished had immediate effects and they were more 
significant in alaska than the advent of aviation in any other 
state they liberated americas last frontier 
flying out to willow creek recently there being no other way 
to cover the 275 miles from anchorage spencer pointed out the 
window to a beach on the kuskokwim river near the village of 
mcgrath as if to document his own claim he scribbled a note to 
his fellow passenger 
carl ben eielson flew first airmail to that spot feb 1924 
singleengine dehavilland dh4 open cockpit came from fairbanks 
threehour flight in winter 
before eielsons flight it took 20 days to make that 300mile 
mail run by dog team you can see a photograph of eielson and his 
airplane at the heritage museum 
more out of continuing necessity than nostalgia for those glory 
days of epic feats alaska has remained by far the flyingest state 
in the nation 
according to federal aviation administration figures alaska 
per capita has eight times as many pilots and 15 times as many 
planes as the us average it works out to one pilot for every 55 
alaskans and one plane for every 57 alaskas 9682 licensed pilots 
average 132 flying hours a year compared with a national average 
including alaska of 49 hours 
hood lake in anchorage is the worlds largest seaplane base 
merrill field which handles only general aviation light planes 
for personal and charter use is busier than the international 
airports in seattletacoma salt lake city and orlando fla 
its hard for people who havent experienced alaska to 
visualize its vastness and its terrain said the faas paul 
steuke 
we have only about 533000 people most of them scattered in 
settlements that would be utterly isolated without the airplane 
our few roads very few are like streams without tributaries you 
cant get to them even if you could theyre often impassable in 
winter 
add to that four huge mountain ranges and unpredictable 
weather systems boiling out of the pacific even skilled pilots 
have to stay on their toes in alaska 
how much more so says spencer for the aviation pioneers who 
established that almost mythic breed known as bush pilots during 
the 1920s and 1930s they became the most popular and honored men in 
alaska

imagine flying out over uncharted territory through narrow 
mountain passes in open cockpits with no maps no weather reports 
no radios no landing strips no places to refuel 
eskimos saw airplanes long before they saw automobiles and came 
to regard the pilots as paracletes they brought medicine to the 
villages fresh fruit locations of caribou herds news of 
relatives in other settlements 
they took trappers into the bush and came back on appointed days 
to fetch them they hauled miners and supplies to gold camps 
hauled the sick to hospitals 
a pilot named leo moore hauled a cow from anchorage so an ailing 
baby in mcgrath could have fresh milk a pilot named sig wien 
hauled a chessboard on his 90mile trips between point lay and 
wainwright so two distant friends could have a game 
by 1939 alaskas small airplanes and hearty pilots were hauling 
23 times as many passengers per capita as the airlines of the 
united states and 1000 times as much freight 
empty wooden boxes labeled stanavo gas each of which held two 
fivegallon cans of airplane fuel littered the countryside 
stacked in outposts and trappers cabins they came to be known as 
alaska cupboards 
on a stopover at flat on the way to willow creek spencer found 
a stanavo box in good shape and brought it back with him 
if i dont find things like this myself they might not be 
found he said we dont have much help and the museum is 
practically broke were in a constant financial crisis 
john miscovich who is 71 was born in a mining camp at flat 
about eight miles from willow creek and remembers when the 
aviation reached there it opened up a whole new era 
he also remembers when wiley post crashlanded there in 1933 
safely but it was a close call spencer videotaped miscovichs 
recollection of the episode 
it was miscovich who told ted spencer about the abandoned 
remains of the plane at willow creek how the pilot had salvaged 
the planes engines after a crash and left the rest the boxy 
fuselage miscovich said had for a time served as a makeshift 
toolshed before it finally wound up in the gulch 
spencer has in his museum files the history of very nearly every 
bush plane the pioneer airmen flew 
i knew the ptarmigan ii was a ford trimotor probably the 
first in alaska in fact i had a picture of it and of its pilot 
frank dorbandt 
dorbandt bought it from an air service in the states which had 
named it west wind ii it was built in 1928 dorbandt bought it in 
1934 brought it to alaska and renamed it ptarmigan ii there never 
was a ptarmigan i 
dorbandt was one of the really early pilots he participated 
in the search for eielson 
eielson at age 32 had crashed in a storm over siberia his 
fellow bush pilots mounted a search and one of them joe crosson 
found the wreckage and eielsons body weeks later soviet airmen 
had also joined in the search and a soviet ship returned the body 
to alaska wrapped in an american flag sewn from red and blue 
muslin and white ship canvas 
beginning with eielsons crash in 1930 fully twothirds of the 
planes in alaska were wrecked beyond repair over the next 10 years 
less serious crackups were commonplace in fact pilots came to 
expect some minor damage on every landing 
but they persevered spencer says as a result we now have 
a fairly intricate network of air travel that unifies the whole 
state 
spencer has arranged with the national guard to fly out in a 
helicopter the first week in september and lift the remains of 
ptarmigan ii from the gulch at willow creek 
it will join its brothers in that panoply of history each in 
flying condition each with its own contribution to a storied era 
that opened up a hostile land 
ptarmigan ii will have a place of honor spencer says it 
will fly again

editors note shortly after they arrived at the remote valley 
in colorado called the baca a local mountain man and prophet 
came down to visit maurice and hanne strong he told them they were 
on sacred ground where all the worlds religions would gather to 
work for greater spiritual understanding today the strongs are 
working to fulfill that prophecy

hanne strong unrolls her blueprint of a 
global village for spiritual leaders and environmentalists and 
pins its corners down on her kitchen table with an expensive tea 
set 
it shows a band of temples and churches gardens and small 
selfsufficient communities laid out along the foot of the sangre 
de cristo mountains here 
some of whats in the plan already has been realized some is in 
the works and some exists just in prophecy strong says 
like strong who travels the areas back roads in skirts and 
silk blouses as comfortably as in jeans the plan is at once earthy 
and elegant serious and a little spacey embracing the 
disadvantaged one minute and industrial magnates and movie stars 
the next 
unenlightened confused minds are ruling the world and 
destroying the environment strong says there needs to be a 
major shift in the way people think 
strong and her husband canadian oil developer and united 
nations diplomat maurice strong hope to turn several thousand 
acres of desert and mountains in southern colorados san luis 
valley into a repository of spiritual truth and environmentally 
sound living a place where political and business leaders can 
come to be taught how to care for themselves and the earth 
they dont want a lot of people who would tax the areas 
fragile natural balance 
the place originally part of the 160000acre baca spanish 
landgrant ranch is called just the baca area indians 
believed it to be sacred neutral ground where tribes could 
come together hanne strong believes it has kept that power intact 
the strongs already have given away hundreds of acres to 
carmelite catholics tibetan buddhist monks zen monks american 
indian tribes and the yogabased sri aurobindo learning center 
they have put up chapels hermitages temples sweat lodges 
community buildings and gardens 
on the blueprint hanne has set aside 2000 more choice acres 
for other religious groups she believes will come to the baca 
someday as earlier groups did on their own she does not recruit 
a native of denmark who personally feels closest to the american 
indian spiritual tradition strong says she respects all 
spirituality but intends the baca to be for religions with an 
unbroken lineage not the socalled new age groups 
this is old age she says with a laugh very old 
the strongs have sold land at the baca to lessestablished 
spiritual groups although not yet to actress shirley maclaine a 
friend of strongs who visits the baca often and wants to set up a 
spiritual community here 
one such group that bought land at the baca is the haidakhandi 
ashram which is building a vedic temple and small community on 46 
acres to follow the teachings of haidakhan babaji a hindu mystic 
other projects under way include an experimental garden and seed 
bank for highaltitude crops an educational center for american 
indian youth a world nutritional center and various healing 
centers 
scattered among the spiritual groups and projects are about 100 
homes the beginnings of the baca grande retirement community that 
was cut short when the strongs came to the area in 1979 
most of the baca development remains a virtual wilderness where 
a visitor sees more deer than people and signs of mountain lion 
and bear 
its a complete ecosystem strong says its still in a 
pure state 
the baca elevation 7800 feet can only be reached from the 
west to the east rises a wall of craggy snowcovered peaks rising 
to more than 14000 feet the sangre de cristos 
compared to the arid valley a traveler crosses to get here much 
of the baca is lush traversed by creeks and shaded by tall trees 
some of the spiritual groups that have moved here actually were 
directed to the baca by hopi indian elders cree blackfoot ute 
and sioux tribes have built ceremonial lodges at the baca and 
navajos and hopis make pilgrimages here 
this is a sacred place for hundreds thousands of years 
says mike sierra a lakota sioux from the pine ridge reservation in 
south dakota who travels to the baca occasionally as an apprentice 
to a sioux medicine man its a place of power 
the areas beauty inspires all the spiritual groups that have 
settled here 
the desert and the mountains are deep religious symbols for 
every spiritual community and right at the heart of the carmelite 
philosophy says sister sharon doyle at the carmelite monastery 
where the buildings blend into the landscape and are invisible from 
a distance aesthetics are very important to us for creating a 
contemplative climatebeauty uplifts the soul its part of the 
whole consciousness of this area respect or reverence for the 
earth 
the carmelites who moved to the baca from sedona ariz in 
1983 because of encroaching development have 104 acres including 
a mountain hermitage nine fulltime hermits both men and women 
live at the baca and their numbers are growing the order is 
negotiating to buy more property and has a waiting list of 
retreatants 
the baca is bordered on the north by crestone a tiny 
goldmining town gone bust and on the south by the great sand 
dunes national monument to the west is the baca grant ranch with 
more than 4500 head of cattle maurice strong is the ranchs board 
chairman 
crestone is an hour from the nearest supermarket in alamosa 
and half a days drive from denver northeast over a couple of 
mountain ranges 
crestones post office was about to close in the early 1970s 
when the subdivision came along followed several years later by 
the strongs now about 200 people live in the town and adjoining 
development yearround 300 in the summer 
residents include ranch hands and a handful of oldtimers as 
well as retirees and those attracted either by the spiritual groups 
or by the chance to live in a small town with an international 
flavor 
the tiny crestone phone book is riddled with such entries as 
crystal sojourns and ahimsa lifestyle 
it also includes some of the rich and famous the strongs have 
brought to the area including robert o anderson former chairman 
of atlantic richfield and najeeb e halaby former head of pan 
american airlines and father of the queen of jordan

halaby has built a home and ziggurat an ancient type of 
assyrian temple on land he bought from the strongs near the sand 
dunes 
it is one tract in an area the strongs divided into several 
tracts and allowed the nondenominational lindisfarne association 
to sell to wealthy friends and acquaintances one of them aziz al 
hamdan of kuwait is inviting hundreds of family members to set up 
a bedouin camp on his land strong says 
maurice strong the first chief of the united nations 
environment program among other environmental credentials sees 
the baca as an attempt to harmonize the people who affect the 
environment who are the economic practitioners 
the strongs first came to the baca in 1978 when maurice took 
control of azl resources inc which owned the 146000acre baca 
grant ranch and the 14000acre baca grande development on which 
azl had tried unsuccessfully since 1971 to develop a retirement 
resort 
they were struck by the areas beauty and halted the retirement 
development 
under strong azl began consolidating tracts of land giving 
some to spiritual groups and selling some the company merged with 
los angelesbased tosco in 1983 and tosco sold the baca in 1986 to 
a group of investors led by strong 
other investors include former us environmental protection 
agency chief william ruckelshaus canadian financier sam belzberg 
anderson and his son robert b anderson and others 
that group still owns the ranch but sold the development in 
1987 to local developers 
the strongs own 20 percent of the ranch and hanne strong has 
her 2000 key acres along the mountains in a foundation called 
manitou 
in 1981 the aspen institute set up a conference center 
complete with restaurant town houses and jogging trail on 320 
acres donated by the strongs and azl 
the remoteness of the area prompted the institute to discontinue 
its programs there in 1984 but now colorado college located 130 
miles away in colorado springs leases some of the town houses as a 
field school and dormitories 
the strongs who are building a new solarenergy home own one 
of the town houses in which hanne lives most of the year 
the prophecy hanne strong follows is chiefly that of glen 
anderson a local mountain man and prophet who came down into 
the valley and visited the strongs two months after they arrived at 
the baca 
she says he told them they were on sacred ground where all the 
worlds religions would gather to work for greater spiritual 
understanding 
he said thats what youre here for to do this she 
says anderson has since died 
strong asked elders from nine american indian tribes to come to 
the baca and hold a council on the prophecy after four days she 
said they said the prophecys correct 
of all the projects under way at the baca strong herself is 
most excited about the fledgling redsun institute an 
international educational center for indigenous peoples and 
the 200acre tibetan center along with the agricultural research 
many indian elders have been coming to this area for a long 
time says redsun director pat caverly 38 who is seeking grants 
to get the institute going 
she sees it as a gathering place for the traditional teachings 
to be passed on to the youth 
initial projects include building a village where students can 
come to learn about indian spirituality and community development 
and creating a sustainable development youth corps dedicated to 
restoring and protecting the earth 
strongs ties to the tibetans run deep she says her grandson 
jason mayo born in alamosa in 1979 was recognized by the high 
lama in 1981 as the reincarnation of an 11thcentury tibetan saint 
named rechung dorje drakpa 
four tibetan monks currently live at the baca planning the 
construction of retreat centers a monastery a holistic medical 
institute and a lay village for about 300 people 
the san luis valley tibetan project began nearly a decade ago 
when followers of the dalai lama refugees from the chinese 
invasion of tibet in 1959 came to the baca at strongs invitation 
she says they vowed to bring their most sacred texts and artifacts 
to the baca believing the tibetan buddhist tradition may perish in 
the himalayas under chinese occupation 
ground will be broken this summer on the first three buildings 
of the project estimated to cost nearly 1 million money is being 
raised through donations and pledges strong says 
altogether only a couple of dozen people live permanently at 
the bacas spiritual communities visited by numerous retreatants 
strong herself is reluctant to publicize the baca 
its not ready yet she says i dont want this to be put 
on the map as a kooky place 
but many of the spiritual groups depend on donations or 
retreatants fees to pay their way they want the world to know 
they are there 
two people live fulltime at the 300acre zen center plus a 
couple of nondenominational retreatants at any given time and 
roshi richard baker who heads the group and spends about half the 
week there 
baker took over operation of the mountain retreat center from 
lindisfarne founded by new york writer william thompson to study 
religion and the humanities with land donated by the strongs 
thompson lived there until illness caused him to return to new york 
in 1983 
says gerald weischede a west german native turned zen monk and 
director of the crestone mountain zen center its nice that 
people at the baca are more open for some kind of spirituality the 
decision to go into the desert more or less means youve decided to 
support each other 
once a week the bacas spiritual communities have a joint 
silentprayer meeting open to the larger community as well 
the bacas a place where all the great traditions can find 
nurture not in isolation but in community says seyril schochen 
director of the sri aurobindo center dedicated to the teachings of 
sri aurobindo a mahayogi of india who died in 1950 
its unity through diversity

hanne and maurice strong come off a 
faster more international track than just about anyone in crestone 
maurices early years sound like a jack london story born in 
manitoba in 1929 he ran away at 13 after graduating from high 
school five years early he stowed away on a ship to alaska where 
at 17 he became an apprentice fur trader 
he soon started his own mining company and his business 
interests proliferated by age 23 he had made his first 1 million 
strong was the first head of the canadian international 
development agency from 196670 and the first head of petro 
canada from 197678 
but he soon began augmenting his business expertise with 
environmental experience and served as executive director of the 
united nations environmental program based in nairobi in the 
mid1970s in 1985 he was named executive coordinator of the 
united nations african emergency relief operations 
an unusual mix of capitalistdeveloper and as the new york 
times called him in 1975 custodian of the planet maurice says 
it is important to forge links between business and 
environmentalism 
i believe you have to be in the middle of these things he 
says in our system the market system you affect the 
environment and the only way to affect the environment positively 
is to make sure that you have environmental considerations built 
right into your business 
when maurice strong first came to the baca in 1978 after 
acquiring an interest in azl resources which owned it he says he 
knew he wanted to save it from routine development 
we were attracted by the qualities that make it so special now 
the beauty the space the fact that its not a ski resort he 
says 
strong does want to develop the areas water however and he 
and a group of investors currently are embroiled in a heated 
dispute with valley water users over the investors claim on what 
they say is a huge untapped aquifer 
valley residents are skeptical of strongs claim that the valley 
would benefit if his company sold the water to outside cities 
hanne strongs interests stick closer to the baca and she says 
she and maurice complement each other 
im the mystical one she says hes the manifester he 
gets things done 
she was born hanne marstrand in copenhagen denmark in 1941 
her father ran a fleet of salmon ships and both her parents were 
active in the resistance to the nazis she says 
born a lutheran but raised catholic hanne says she had mystical 
experiences early on including seeing angels 
i knew from a very young age that i wasnt danish that i was 
indian she says and i knew that one day i would be with my 
people 
after studying industrial and interior design in denmark she 
moved to new york city in her early 20s and set up a design firm 
in 1972 hanne left her business and moved to nairobi where she 
had been hired to design the countrys united nations headquarters 
there she met maurice strong 
the couple moved to calgary alberta in 1972 where hanne 
became involved in indian political issues 
when she first came to the baca she says i knew i was home 
hanne believes she and the baca are creatures of both luck and 
destiny 
i like luck i feel ive got a lot of it she says but 
far greater forces are at work and i know it will happen it was 
meant to be were just tools and we have to perfect ourselves

editors note the freetrade agreement between the united 
states and canada has opened the floodgates to bargain hunters 
crisscrossing the border at places like sault ste marie but as 
residents of the michigan city and its sister city in ontario have 
learned shoppers need to master border math 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
foreign trade couldnt be much 
freer than in the twin saults the two cities with the same name 
separated by the 2mile breadth of the st marys river and flying 
different flags 
americans and canadians go back and forth across the border in 
droves to buy bread have babies or drink beer without a worry 
about tariffs or quotas 
we call it jumping across the big ditch says canadian steel 
worker richard shurtliffe 
on wednesdays after work shurtliffe and his buddies hop the st 
marys from sault ste marie ontario to the 1abeer bars in 
sault ste marie mich canadian brew tastes better but american 
suds are cheaper shurtliffe says 
beer isnt the only bargain 
canadas dairy prices for instance are jacked up by a farm 
support system that is unlikely to change even under the countrys 
freetrade agreements with the united states no matter shurtliffe 
says he buys american 
not only does he buy us milk for his grandchildren he fills 
his pickup truck with us gasoline and his refrigerator with us 
steaks 
even canadian cigarettes are cheaper in us stores 
its an awful savings shurtliffe says it seems 
everythings cheaper in michigan 
its a commerce without national loyalty in the sault 
pronounce it soo many american women have their american babies 
in canada and tourists buy their canadian souvenirs in the united 
states 
the biggest traffic jams at canada customs are at 230 am 
when the us bars close and canadians go home 
customs agent giacomo pastore has seen the happy drivers line up 
for as long as 45minute waits at the border crossing into canada 
its a ritual pastore says 
its an awful pile of canadians shurtliffe says 
locals call them the twin saults or the two saults but these 
cities on opposite sides of the soo shipping locks are anything but 
identical 
historical markers on the us side tell of the treaty taking 
northern michigan from the chippewa indians a plaque on canadian 
soil remembers the shameful chicoro incident of 1870 when the 
united states refused a canadian military ship passage through the 
us locks the canadians had to walk around the st marys rapids 
sault ont is six times the size of sault mich the ontario 
town of 83000 has a steel mill paper mill and a large shopping 
mall its downtown queen street is dotted with upscale china shops 
sault ont also has more movie theaters a lower drinking age 
and two strip clubs says michigan teenager dean newcomb 
michigans sault is a quiet home to 14500 people many of whom 
dont lock their doors summer tourism is the major industry 
winter snow is the biggest occurence from a threeblock drive of 
kitsch shops visitors can buy blue wind chimes from taiwan and 
tshirts that say canada 
canada 
its hard to buy a canadian souvenir in their sault 
explains bob smith owner of a block of such tourist emporiums as 
ships ahoy captains quarters and the anchor and seven seas motels 
this is where the tourists shop 
since the signing of the freetrade pact between the two 
countries the easy commerce between the saults has become even 
freer and easier 
it seems to have opened up the gate says patrick shannon 
the chippewa county prosecutor on the michigan side trade hasnt 
changed but all of a sudden the canadians have realized they can 
go shopping on our side crossing the border isnt such an issue 
anymore 
thats a problem law enforcement in sault mich used to be a 
personal matter you knew who was having a family fight and who was 
driving home from the bar 
with so many people crossing over these days the town is full 
of strangers we dont know who were dealing with anymore 
shannon says 
not all of the foreign trade is faring well 
american insurance companies have put a crimp in the 
oncebooming business of delivering babies in ontario ten years 
ago as many as 20 percent of the women patients of an ontario 
obstetrician dr t orr were americans drawn by the 
morespecialized services available in ontario 
now with us medicare and many insurance companies refusing to 
pay for health care outside the united states foreigners make up 
only 8 percent of orrs practice 
because the banks and bars tourist centers and tollgates all 
set their own exchange rates commerce between the saults can get 
complicated those who cross frequently must master border math 
shurtliffes wife ruth for example can figure which is 
cheaper gasoline at 54 cents canadian per liter or 121 american 
per gallon that is considering also that her canadian dollar 
currently buys only 80 cents american and she has to pay 150 to 
drive across the international bridge 
it can get so confusing many businesses accept the other 
countrys currency even if it isnt legal tender a canadian 
dollar will buy as much beer at david dears back door bar as a 
us greenback 
after all we are the twin saults dear says more than half 
of his customers are canadians 
with the american dollar worth more at the moment us 
residents forgetting to exchange their money for canadian suffer a 
double whammy not only do most canadian businesses take us 
currency at the lower canadian value but canadian prices often are 
higher 
there is an advantage of having the right money on the right 
side at the right time says linda sumner a michigan tourist 
from livonia 
grant putman a farmer from williamston mich got caught in a 
canadian restaurant with hungry kids and only us cash in his 
wallet he paid american and bought his food for 15 percent more 
than true cost 
of course the waitress gave me my change in canadian so i 
was out there too putman said 
i got even i tipped her in canadian

ancient angkor the international community is mobilizing to rescue 
from decay one of civilizations greatest artistic achievements 
the hindu and buddhist edifices dating from the ninth through 
12th centuries have been assaulted by jungle growth monsoon rains 
and thieves as armies clashed around them over the past two decades 
india the only noncommunist nation to recognize the prohanoi 
government in phnom penh is already restoring the colossal angkor 
wat the crowning jewel but hundreds of other temples and 
architectural relics from cambodias golden age remain untended 
security has been a major problem in recent years with the 
khmer rouge and other antigovernment guerrillas within striking 
distance of angkor and diplomatic isolation of the phnom penh 
government has prevented most international assistance 
while the guerrillas remain a potential threat there is 
optimism that a peaceful political solution may be reached 
following the promised withdrawal of vietnamese troops from 
cambodia in september 
we are waiting for the first available opportunity to restore 
the magnificent monuments says mahfuz anam regional spokesman 
for the un educational scientific and cultural organization 
unescos director general is hopeful of a political solution 
although it is restricted from working with the phnom penh 
government which the united nations does not recognize unesco 
this spring quietly dispatched two experts for a preliminary 
onsite diagnosis of angkors ills 
unesco may help organize an international symposium on angkor 
and eventually launch a worldwide fundraising campaign such as 
those which helped resurrect egypts pyramids indonesias 
borobudur temple and the ancient north african city of carthage 
everyone wants to get involved in angkor said one western 
aid official in phnom penh 
ung von who heads cambodias conservation effort here says the 
poles will arrive late this year to begin work on the bayon an 
intricate 800yearold shrine of mysterious galleries and 54 stone 
towers sculpted with the faces of smiling dieties 
the wondrous structure is currently looked after by two old 
sweepers and guarded by two teenage policemen its eastern gate 
caved in like a deck of cards several years ago green algae and 
white fungi mar its friezes of ancient battles and court life 
the french who hacked angkor out of the jungle in the last 
century and became its most expert overseers refuse to provide 
valuable archival material to phnom penh but have asked to restore 
the 11thcentury baphuon ung von says 
the indians are midway through their sixyear 1o million 
project to renew angkor wat a massive representation of the hindu 
cosmos in stone which rises in three successive flights to five 
central towers that have become the symbol of cambodia 
the work by 13 indians and more than 400 cambodians has included 
cleaning the friezes dismantling and reassembling the gateways 
and the excavation of ditches to allow drainage of water within the 
moatgirded complex 
the work on angkor wats nearly 1440 square yards of friezes is 
painstaking brushes are used to scrub off moss insect nests and 
clinging vegetation the latter sometimes requiring injections of 
weed killer in a syringe other chemicals are used to attack fungi 
microvegetable matter and corrosive bat droppings before a 
protective coating is applied 
heavy machinery is limited to the occasional use of a borrowed 
crane while obtaining construction supplies like cement is a 
logistical nightmare work proceeds with the use of hands hoes and 
bamboo baskets not unlike the way angkor wat was probably 
constructed 
some old expert craftsmen who had worked with the french have 
returned but ung von says local expertise was decimated during the 
khmer rouge rule and by lack of training since some also criticize 
the indians 
they need our help ung von says sometimes they dont 
have the experience they have done their job well but their 
technique is different from the french 
some cambodians and westerners say privately that the indian 
team uses inferior chemicals is reassembling galleries in a way 
that allows water seepage and is stubbornly clinging to some 
techniques abandoned by international leaders in conservation 
but an expert independent evaluation of their work has yet to 
be made and the cambodians are publicly reluctant to criticize 
because they have made a major political issue of noncommunist 
india coming to their aid 
the indian restoration which began in 1987 was the first 
meaningful attempt to keep the rapid deterioration at bay since 
french archaeologist bernardphillipe groslier was expelled from 
angkor by the khmer rouge in 1972 
angkor has fought against the elements since being abandoned in 
the 15th century as the capital of a oncepowerful cambodian 
empire the khmer rouge occupied the area during their war against 
the usbacked government in phnom penh and did nothing to restore 
angkor during their brutal time in power 
since 1979 the prohanoi government has made efforts but with 
very few resources and expertise now says ung von there are 
prospects for real progress and small numbers of foreign tourists 
are starting to return 
i feel like a sick man who is starting to feel well again

editors note the prophet has guided several generations 
of high school and college students through the vicissitudes of 
growing up now a group of lebaneseamericans would like to 
memorialize its author their kinsman kahlil gibran in a city 
that abounds with monuments that remind of war they would make a 
quiet place dedicated to peace 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
theyre going to build a little garden here 
across from the british embassy where the strident statue of 
winston churchill arm and fingers raised in a v recalls 
memories of an awful war 
the garden will celebrate peace and understanding and a writer 
whose words helped four decades of american young people out of the 
maze of adolescence into the unsure world of adulthood 
it is a garden that almost wasnt 
but lebaneseamericans mobilized in the past few months to raise 
most of the 1 million or so needed to beat a national park service 
deadline and break ground for the wooded twoacre plot dedicated to 
their countryman kahlil gibran author of the prophet 
gibrans romantic dialectic was severely criticized by 
academics but nevertheless captured the interest of generations of 
young people notably in the 1960s with passages like this 
then a woman said speak to us of joy and sorrow 
and he answered 
your joy is your sorrow unmasked 
and the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was 
oftentimes filled with your tears 
the prophet gibrans most popular book is the bestselling 
hardcover book on the alfred a knopf list it has racked up 6 
million sales since it was first printed in 1923 and still sells 
100000 a year the deluxe edition has sold another 363000 copies 
at a steady rate of 11500 a year and the paperback has sold 
1886000 at the rate of 40000 a year an audio version brought 
out in 1986 sells about 10000 a year 
but the plans for a memorial for gibran were not nearly as 
successful and it looked for a while as if the modest project 
might founder 
it was the idea of washington housewife sheryl ameen emanating 
from her despair over the plight of lebanon wracked by civil wars 
and invasion she said she couldnt stand the vision of all this 
bloodshed and i felt it was not the true image of the 
lebanese who for 4000 years had been merchants and travelers 
descendants of the ancient phoenicians 
in 1983 the 100th anniversary of gibrans birth she determined 
to soften the image by building a memorial of some sort to the 
gentle writer whose words helped sustain the rev lawrence jenco in 
his captivity in lebanon jenco still quotes him not everyone in 
chains is subdued and hell is not torture hell is an empty 
heart 
ameen who is president of the khalil gibran centennial 
foundation had heard that the comedian flip wilson also quoted 
gibran at his performances and he appeared before congress in 
behalf of the memorial a resolution providing park service land 
for the gibran garden was written by maine sen george mitchell 
now majority whip and the late rep abraham chick kazan jr 
both of lebanese parentage 
but the planning was easier than getting the funds finally 
another lebanese bill baroody former head of the office of 
communications in the gerald ford white house and director of the 
american enterprise institute came to the rescue he mobilized 
other prominent arabamericans and the money began trickling in 
through the summer a series of seven dinners from boston to los 
angeles will raise almost half the needed 1 million with the rest 
coming from organizations wealthy individuals and the general 
public 
the deadline for breaking ground is october 19 
its off the ground and its going to successfully conclude on 
target on time baroody says its been a struggle 
one of the reasons he says is that most lebanese in america 
tended to assimilate totally to become part of the background but 
in the past 15 to 20 years they have tended to reconnect with their 
ethnic pride partly in response to what was happening in their 
tiny native land 
thats why im so excited about this project baroody says 
with all of the tragedy around lebanon the palestinians the 
whole middle east situation this has an incredibly uplifting 
potential 
ameen and baroody want the garden and the foundation to echo 
what they believe gibran stood for peace and understanding 
mediation and consensus rational debate and discussion 
gibran has plenty of critics in academic circles they say his 
writing is not poetry more like romantic drivel an exercise in 
dialectics what does baroody think 
basically i feel sorry for them 
the garden in a lush woods near the vice presidents residence 
and the naval observatory will feature a pool and walkways where 
visitors can come to meditate among the new plantings will be 
three 25foot cedars of lebanon currently growing in a new jersey 
nursery 
gibran lived most of his life in the united states in his last 
works he wrote of an exile who returns to the garden of his 
fathers to meditate and says we seek one another in our 
aloneness

consider the chances of success for a play 
called other peoples money 
the authors last work folded on opening night 
the leading man left to make a film before rehearsals started 
his replacement backed out the day rehearsals were supposed to 
begin 
the third choice kevin conway was not exactly a boxoffice 
name 
the director gloria muzio was even less well known 
and the wall street crash of october 1987 made the subject 
matter the takeover of a small company by a ruthless tycoon 
seem outofdate to many experienced theater people 
none of the above stopped neophyte producers jeffrey ash and 
susan gallin from opening other peoples money last february at 
the minetta lane theater in six months the play by jerry sterner 
has slowly become one of offbroadways biggest hits with the 
soldout sign now going up for almost every performance 
the favorable wordofmouth has really done it for us says 
gallin whose only other producing effort in new york was burn 
this by lanford wilson two years ago 
such diverse theatergoers as theater critic john simon and 
business tycoons carl ichan and donald trump trump saw the play 
twice have praised other peoples money trump even offered 
to move the play to broadway a proposal declined by ash and gallin 
i think a successful play on broadway today has to almost 
approach being a musical ash says it has to have either a 
star or something out of the ordinary broadway has come to be a 
place only for muscials and extravaganzas and offbroadway has 
become a place to do good plays like driving miss daisy the 
cocktail hour or other peoples money 
producing a play offbroadway also is different from producing 
on broadway because the theaters are smaller so are the profit 
margins the line between a profitable and an unprofitable week can 
be narrow most new offbroadway shows need time to build audiences 
ash and gallin figured they would lose money during the early 
weeks of the run the time needed for favorable audience reaction 
to pay off their general manager told them to expect 12 weeks of 
losses they budgeted the show at 525000 including a reserve 
fund of 120000 raised to pay for a heavy advertising campaign 
i had seen too many mornings when the producers have to scurry 
to try and raise money to run an ad or a television spot ash 
says and then they wind up giving away all their producers 
points selling their soul to get that money its terrible 
ash knows something about selling shows although other 
peoples money is his first producing effort he has been in 
theatrical advertising for more than 20 years now director of 
theatrical accounts for grey entertainment and media ash was a 
pioneer in developing liveaction television ads for broadway plays 
and musicals 
ash worked on the advertising for sterners last venture the 
shortlived be happy for me despite its quick departure they 
became friends sterner knew that ash wanted to produce and brought 
him a copy of other peoples money his second play in early 
1987 
i read it and fell quite in love with it ash recalls 
the story concerns a barracudalike corporate raider who wants 
to take over a familyowned business that is the lifeblood of a 
small new england town the company hires an attractive female 
attorney to battle the takeover artist and their fights turn from 
the financial to the sexual 
the play had some readings on the west coast and with actor paul 
sorvino who was interested in playing the lead he didnt but the 
play was done at his american stage company in teaneck nj in 
the spring of 1987 
audience reaction was favorable and ash had lined up an 
investor to put up half the amount needed to bring the play to new 
york then the stock market crashed in october and the money 
evaporated 
gallin then entered the picture she became interested in the 
play after a good friend davina belling went after the movie 
rights 
i read a lot of plays and this one left me with something to 
think about gallin says and it was very entertaining i even 
gave it to people who werent in the theater to read and i got a 
wonderful reaction 
ash and gallin decided to produce the play together offbroadway 
and went looking for a director the two producers sought 
suggestions from their friends in the theater business mark lamos 
artistic director of the hartford stage company was on the top of 
everybodys list 
lamos had other commitments but a play reader at his theater 
recommended it lamos finally read other peoples money and 
loved it the play directed by gloria muzio was done at the 
hartford stage as part of its 198889 season 
that was a wonderful experience gallin says it was good 
for the play and for jerry who was able to do some rewriting and 
for gloria our director who had time to polish the production 
it was the hartford production with conway as a lastminute 
replacement as the new leading man that made it to new york 
the show opened with a miniscule advance and a favorable but not 
overwhelming review in the new york times which didnt deter the 
two producers 
we did a radio campaign sponsoring business reports on 
allnews radio stations in new york advertised in the wall street 
journal and sent letters to the ceos of many corporations and 
invited them to come ash says 
now the stretch limos are regular fixtures in front of the 
minetta lane theater as well as more ordinary theatergoers drawn 
by the favorable wordofmouth ash and gallin are now 
contemplating a national tour for the play probably with a star 
and also a london production 
its a play that stays with people somehow ash says they 
keep talking about it for days afterward and even two years after 
the big stock market crash its relevant you pick up the 
newspaper and you see this thing about warner brothers and time 
magazine and paramount the subject is still current

mississippi burning orion home video vhsbeta 7998 
rated r 
 
in the summer of 1964 young men and women from around the 
nation poured into mississippi to take part in freedom summer 
a concerted effort to register black voters in the segregated 
state one was 20yearold andrew goodman a student at queens 
college on june 21 goodman and two members of core congress of 
racial equality michael schwerner and james chaney drove to the 
town of lawndale where a black church had been burned they never 
returned 
they were stopped for speeding near philadelphia and jailed for 
several hours on bogus charges after being released that night 
the workers failed to call in after an extensive search involving 
the fbi and 200 sailors and a tip from a mr x the bodies 
were discovered aug 4 on a farm outside of philadelphia 
a fictionalized account of the murder of those three young 
volunteers is unraveled in alan parkers mississippi burning 
the movie is by no means an accurate or riveting account of that 
strange and horrendous period in american history rather it is a 
detective story that boils down to the 
typical hollywood good copbad cop treatment it is male bonding 
redux 
parker focuses on two fbi agents sent to mississippi to 
investigate the disappearance of the civil rights workers ward 
willem dafoe is the upstanding neatly suited partner who plays 
things by the book anderson gene hackman is a redneck and a 
maverick he does things his way and has a short fuse 
 
their search and andersons seething tensions are relentless 
through plot twists that suspend disbelief they discover the 
bodies and peel away the facade of white southern virtue exposing 
it as an ugly oozing canker sore in the meantime parker almost 
has his audience cheering for the wonderful fbi but the reality is 
that the fbi was more a harassment to blacks and sympathetic whites 
during the civil rights struggle than heroic knight the movie also 
overlooks those who were at the very helm of the movement and who 
led and suffered through that summer blacks are mere pimples on 
the landscape in parkers thinking they stand by and do nothing 
they have no passions no aggressions no thoughts 
the strength of mississippi burning is not its shallow look 
at segregation but its performances especially by hackman his 
portrayal of anderson is one of the best in his career he 
steamrolls through the movie with volcanic force filling the 
theater with a crackling tension and good ole boy charm dafoe is 
by necessity the antithesis and he delivers well taken as a 
detective film mississippi burning the fbi file name for the 
case is a fine piece of entertainment and works well on the home 
screen but dont expect a credible history lesson

witchery vidmark entertainment vhs 7995 no rating 
 
witchery is a simply terrible film with absolutely no 
redeeming virtues 
linda blair who first horrified audiences as the possessed 
youngster in the exorcist and david hasselhoff tvs night 
rider fail to save this piece of junk their lackluster acting 
coupled with an impossibly bad script should cause this video to 
gather dust on the store shelf 
there is graphic violence and gore including garroting 
crucifixion rape and other bits of murderous mayhem but the story 
is so incredibly weak that even these excesses cant boost it to 
any interesting level 
it has the look and feel of a madefortv movie and is as dull 
as the worst sitcom 
blair plays an investigator of paranormal phenomena shes 
appears half asleep most of the time mumbling her way through her 
lines hasselhoff a photographer and blairs fiance tries to make 
the best of it with dialogue about as snappy as a grapefruit 
commercial the two have come to a new england island to take 
pictures of an old hotel that resembles a witch during certain 
times of the day 
as the witch hildegard knef is about the best thing going in 
the movie michael manches plays the most credible role as tommy a 
child who communicates with the witch

batman soundtrack warner bros prince 
 
leave it to prince to score a no 1 record at precisely the time 
his record company wanted him out of the stores 
with sagging record sales due at least in part to 
overexposure warner bros wanted prince on the shelf for awhile 
but prince foiled those plans by dashing off a soundtrack to 
batman in a matter of days after being inspired by the movie 
though batman has turned virtually everything it touches to 
gold the single batdance still qualifies as one of the 
strangest hit songs in years its not even a song really just a 
sixminute collage of dialogue from the film with a jarring tempo 
change in the middle 
in other words it manages to break just about every rule and 
still be compelling it doesnt hurt that it contains one of 
princes best guitar solos in years 
the hurried nature of this project is apparent throughout the 
rest of the soundtrack to both good and bad effect 
prince seems liberated by the need to work in a hurry it forces 
discipline and leaves no room for the musical conceits that cloud 
some of his recent work in retrospect it often seems the more 
time he has to work on a song the further he strays from the 
original idea 
the music is simple and straightforward by nature some of 
princes most commercial work songs such as partyman vicki 
waiting and electric chair prove prince can write serviceable 
funk in his sleep 
the downside is the appearance of the first prince work that can 
rightfully be called hackneyed the ballad scandalous and the 
sheena easton duet the arms of orion are excruciating there 
isnt a memorable lyric on the album and no innovations to make 
you shake your head in surprise 
but its tough to argue with a no 1 record prince didnt have 
to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight for this hit maybe 
just the joker

youve got to take yahoo seriously after he 
has written directed produced and starred in a movie being 
released by a major film company 
first of all about his name 
its on my passport its been like that since i was at art 
school yahoo serious explains the 35yearold australian 
virtuoso who stars in young einstein 
i changed it to have an art work of a name but also make it a 
laugh it kind of fit in with the rest of the stuff i did the 
weird hair and weirder clothes and stuff i had this really 
ordinary name greg pead and i thought i can do better than 
this 
yahoo is almost impossible to say unless youre having a 
good time serious i guess is the directors side of me i 
dunno its kind of a parody on names i suppose 
the other remarkable thing about serious is the hair its a 
brown mass that rises from his head like a bramble bush he calls 
it an australian surfing haircut and claims its the reason he 
chose to portray einstein hes the only historical character 
with the same haircut 
serious came here for his first exposure to the american media 
he may well be the biggest australian import since paul hogan his 
film young einstein has broken records of rambo star 
wars and the like in his home country warner bros is hoping 
not without some nervousness that serious will catch on here 
its hard to describe young einstein you might call it a 
combination of rock music silentscreen slapstick and bogus 
history yahoo plays albert einstein at the age of 26 when he 
discovered both relativity and rock n roll all this happens in 
australia you see 
the inspiration for young einstein came during a trip down 
the amazon river he relates it with such sincerity that you want 
to believe him 
i crossed the andes with a mate and we ended up on the border 
of peru and brazil and i think colombia we were going to take a 
boat down the amazon i dont think they had australians aboard 
before because we drank them out of beer in two days 
we put in at a little village the brazilian native who was 
carrying the beer on board wore a tshirt with a picture of albert 
einstein sticking his tongue out where he got the tshirt in the 
middle of the amazon jungle i dont know that was the 
inspiration the greatest mind of the 20th century doing something 
so irreverent and childlike at the age of 72 i thought wow weve 
got the basis for a film here 
serious had dabbled in film before making documentaries that 
somehow came out as comedies how to sell a feature he decided to 
do it by degrees he sold his car bought some film borrowed a 
camera gathered a cast and crew and began shooting when he ran 
out of money he borrowed an editing machine put together what he 
had filmed and sought financing 
amazingly he found backing from some investors the australian 
film commission an australian distributor and warner bros he 
was able to finish young einstein the way he wanted with a 
cast of thousands and a huge musical score and eight rock songs 
he was born in the hunter valley in new south wales he quit 
school to work as a tire fitter so he could afford to attend art 
school it became apparent early on that he had to express himself 
not with brush and paint but with the magic of comedy 
i was fed by two of the major cultures besides having the 
indigenous sardonic selfeffacing australian humor he 
recalled the monty python influence came on tv from england at 
the same time there were all the wonderful 60s situation comedies 
from here like green acres the addams family get smart and 
all the others bugs bunny was also a huge influence 
at the same time i loved epic films especially david leans 
lawrence of arabia was a huge influence on me i loved the idea 
of putting comedy in a film of epic proportions i had no idea it 
was going to be a big hit thats all 
yahoo serious is already a notable in australia and hell 
certainly be the same here with his electrocuted hair and his 
uniform of flowery hawaiian shirt and floppy white shorts the 
recognition doesnt bother him i usually get gdy yahoo 
gdy yahoo that sort of stuff like i say the word yahoo makes 
people feel good 
can we expect young einstein ii 
sequels are good when they are a small part of what is being 
made he said when theyre the bulk of whats being made i 
think its selfdefeating maybe when im a greyhaired old guy and 
weve forgotten about sequels maybe well see einstein goes to 
princeton or something like that but there wont be a sequel in 
the foreseeable future

its easy to pick out barbara nissman in a crowd 
of pianists shes the one whos known for playing sergei prokofiev 
and alberto ginastera 
what a joy to find composers in this century one can be 
passionate about she says prokofiev is a 20thcentury modern 
continuing the romantic tradition i believe the music cries out to 
be played that way 
nissman whose parents were born in the soviet union studied 
russian language and literature at the university of michigan as 
well as music ginastera visited the campus in the late 1960s when 
she was rehearsing his piano concerto and liked the way she played 
it they kept in touch and during the 15 years she pursued her 
career in europe she often played his music the composer 
dedicated his third piano sonata to her 
i play all three theyre wonderful i think the first is his 
masterpiece my favorite of his works is argentine dances which 
he wrote for solo piano when he was 18 nissman said 
his widow whos a cellist and i are going to record the 
cello concerto he wrote for her it never has been recorded i 
think he would have been pleased 
nissman recorded all nine prokofiev piano sonatas for newport 
classic distributed on cassettes and compact discs by mca volume 
2 was released in july with volume 3 set for august 
last season she played all nine sonatas in three concerts at new 
yorks alice tully hall the first time that has been done in one 
season she repeated it at wigmore hall in london next season 
shell do the cycle in the netherlands and other american cities 
there are plans for me to do the cycle in russia an american 
of russian origin going to play russian music for russians said 
nissman who has been invited by the central state archives in 
moscow to go through prokofievs piano sketches 
theyve done it with his symphonies operas and ballets maybe 
i can find some manuscripts that havent been discovered 
asked in a recent interview what led her to play the prokofiev 
cycle she said just following my nose exploring music that is 
not often played in concert i had played several of the sonatas 
with the bbc symphony i decided to look at the ones i didnt know 
i wasnt disappointed at all 
i also found a fragment of a 10th sonata and a second version 
of the fifth she said i had the first page of the fragment 
and wrote the archives in moscow to see if there was a second page 
it arrived an hour before the premiere was to be given and i 
sightread it at the concert 
it transformed my conception of the first page he went in a 
completely different direction it was very exciting to have that 
to realize that at the end of his life he was going back to the 
lyrical style of the ninth sonata 
that fragment of the 10th sonata was the last thing prokofiev 
wrote before he died in 1953 it ends in the middle of a measure 
he had a fall but kept on writing on his deathbed 
nissman will make a liszt recording this fall i cant give up 
liszt hes one of my favorites she says they come from the 
same tradition they all really knew and respected the piano and 
delighted in virtuosity which is very appealing to the public and 
to a pianist 
prokofiev built on tradition with his own personality thats 
the essence of what modern means being his own man yet building 
upon a foundation using those elements to make it his own and have 
something personal to say 
people came to the recitals resisting prokofiev she said 
the preconception is dissonance that the music should be played 
without emotion with a hard dry brittle sound they were amazed 
at the lyricism and emotional content and what they felt when they 
were listening to the music 
there is so much there in his simplicity prokofiev is truly 
profound i would say the essence of his music is the wonderful 
simplicity he communicates directly thats what one wants from 
any composer to touch the soul 
nissman recalled that when she was a child and heard peter and 
the wolf she was delighted with the melodies 
and his piano music abounds with wonderful melodies the fifth 
sonata is the weakest because of the lack of melody she said 
but the weakest for prokofiev is still pretty darn good

in a summer dominated by classic rock radio 
and concerts by reformed 1970s supergroups love and rockets has 
managed to take its intriguing mix of dreamy mood music and 
jackhammer metal into the top 20 
while the members of the british trio express no love for oldies 
stations or the ubiquitous reunion tours dont count them among 
the bands complaining that a newer band cant make it in 1989 
the band currently on tour in support of its fourth album 
love and rockets has found a good outlet for its music on 
college radio and concert crowds which include fans of love and 
rockets predecessor the early 80s group bauhaus have been 
growing on the strength of the bands first us hit single so 
alive 
were over the moon we are said daniel ash of the bands 
current success 
ash plays bass guitar and saxophone and sings about half the 
bands songs rounding out love and rockets are the brother team of 
david j on guitar bass harmonica and vocals and drummer kevin 
haskins 
david j said each of the bands us tours has found audiences 
bigger and more knowledgeable of the groups work 
the familiarity grows every time we come back the songs are 
more recognizable to a greater part of the audience he said 
this is the most definitive record weve done so far thats why 
we called it simply love and rockets 
defining the groups sound is an elusive task as love and 
rockets works in a musical universe that has room for the 
latterday psychedelia of the teardrop collector as well as 
the noise explosion of no big deal 
its almost an axiom that the rise in popularity of classic 
rock radio with its emphasis on 70sstyle hard rock has made 
it difficult for less established groups to get airplay or 
attention that phenomenon has been accompanied this summer by 
reunion tours by such veteran acts as the who the doobie brothers 
and the allman brothers band 
but ash said that despite the attention to older rock music in 
some ways the band has had better access to the airwaves here than 
back home in england being heard on college radio has paved the 
way to increased mainstream acceptance he said 
i think the college radio situation in the usa is 
excellent its a great idea ash said with the college 
stations in america they love playing their music and there isnt 
any commercial consideration they play what they actually like 
the ideal radio station ash said would play new records and 
also some good old music why not play something that was 
recorded in 1964 and then something that was recorded last 
tuesday he said 
ash said he felt strongly that rock n roll groups have a 
limited life span he said he was opposed to the current wave of 
tours by veteran rockers 
the who shouldnt exist its stupid ash said its like 
a contradiction of what they were originally about its nonsense 
its a ripoff 
theyre too old to do that sort of music when you sing songs 
like my generation and see guys in their mid40s its 
hilarious its wrong ash said when youre involved in 
something like contemporary music its real important to realize 
when you look ridiculous 
he said love and rockets is just now hitting its prime 
we just work on whatever feels right at the time he said 
weve grown close as a group we can be open enough to know when 
somebodys doing something wrong 
with its popularity growing the band is recording some of its 
current tour dates for a possible live album also in the works is 
a home video compilation and minialbum of songs recorded around 
the time of love and rockets but which did not fit in with the 
sound of that album 
david j described the minialbum as a cross between the 
andrews sisters glenn miller and captain beefheart

phillip lopate prefers sitting behind a 
typewriter to standing atop a soapbox he distrusts movements 
getting caught up in any event larger than himself 
a man of caution he remembers with discomfort the 1960s group 
ritual of passing a body from one set of arms to another what he 
does trust is the individual voice expressed in writing through 
the personal essay 
i think its important because its a direct conversation 
between the writer and the reader and has the flavor of 
personality said lopate author of against joie de vivre 
poseidon press 1895 a collection of personal essays 
if you believe in individuals and individual voices then its 
one of the ways of getting a sense of dialogue going a personal 
essay gives you a model of a human being in all his hesitations and 
faults and confusions 
his tales are more of observation than experience lopate 
examines the myth of samson and delilah deconstructs the manners 
of dinner parties and in the title essay attacks mindless 
optimism 
i think i have a streak of detachmant which is very suitable 
for being a writer and maybe not so suitable for other activities 
its very hard to knock me off course im always watching in some 
way some part of me refuses to be swept away he said in an 
interview 
when i write im able to get a sense of perspective so that 
experiences which are too painful for someone else to contemplate 
i can think about with a certain humor a certain wryness and begin 
to shape them 
he is admittedly a believer in committing experiences to 
memory as they occur even at the risk of reducing their emotional 
impact detachment is vital he insists a way of examining an 
issue to its fullest and working through to a wellconsidered 
conclusion 
i tend to analyze and brood over what has happened to me until 
i make little stories lopate said 
my essays have a strong storytelling impulse sometimes 
theyre really on the borderline between fiction and nonfiction 
theyre shaped in the narrative way theyre about characters 
people as characters 
lopate who worked as a writerinresidence at a public school 
in manhattan uses this approach in suicide of a schoolteacher 
examining the feelings brought on when a colleague takes his own 
life 
when i write about something traumatic im trying to overcome 
the pain and put it behind me he said then i think i dont 
have to write about it anymore ive dealt with it but i also 
write to hold onto things that would otherwise be lost its a 
salvaging process 
lopate attended columbia university in the early 60s acquiring 
a passion for films that never subsided he is currently on the 
selection committee of the new york film festival and credits 
movies with helping develop his skills at narration 
sometimes you learn an art by studying another art i learned 
the grammar of film and it helped me to write theres a great deal 
of cinematic influence in my writing a lot of times the scene 
will unroll as im experiencing it 
in chekhov for children lopate describes the sometimes 
tortuous process of directing a dozen adolescents in the russian 
playwrights bleak uncle vanya 
he knows that detachment doesnt work with children or the 
theater and writes of the emotional highs and lows experienced 
during rehearsals 
children are always surprising he said i watch them and 
find them very dramatic they dont tone down their response so 
much theyll tell you they hate you or love you they dont 
disguise very much 
that can be invigorating and it can also be humiliating if a 
kid doesnt like you its more of a setback than if an adult 
doesnt like you because you feel theyre responding very 
naturally 
against joie de vivre is lopates seventh book he has also 
published a previous collection of essays and an account of his 
public school experience being with children two volumes of 
poetry and two novels including the wellreceived the rug 
merchant in 1987 
lopate views the world as a stage and himself a dispassionate 
critic interpreting the actors performances to the audience at 
large 
some writers are fascinated with language i want to write 
beautifully and eloquently but much more important is for me to 
capture character on the page starting with my own character and 
using that to spread outward to use myself as a messenger that 
will bring back the world 
he sees himself as fighting to maintain integrity in a world 
where people hide their real feelings for lopate the personal 
essay is a written form of protest a modern equivalent of burning 
his draft card 
theres something almost subversive about the personal 
essay he said it empowers the individual i also think that 
in a time when many writers are afraid to say explicitly what they 
think as in fiction when they show but they dont tell too much 
the essay becomes a place where the writer testifies without a 
disguise of what she or he knows

and loneliness 27 years after his first hit record believes the 
title of his current album reflects his music timeless

romantic ballads reminiscent of roses are red his 1962 
breakthrough song on the national record charts 
the first single release from timeless is please tell her 
that i said hello which is about a man crying over an old lover 
other selections on the album include such love songs as getting 
used to being loved again and i made love with you tonight 
i feel my music is timeless vinton nicknamed the polish 
prince said in an interview roses are red and blue velvet 
still sound good today and you can relate to them there will 
always be that type of music there will always be a love singer a 
singer of stories and simplicity 
hes been flirting with a country downhome feel to his music 
for the past few years he uses fiddles and steel guitars on 
timeless and is trying to get country music radio stations 
interested in his music so that he can be heard on the same outlets 
that feature willie nelson randy travis and george strait 
i could be the beginning of the next dimension in country 
music vinton said the country music djs today are the old pop 
djs of the 60s weve all made the changes together 
country music is expanding radio stations are finding that if 
you play a bobby vinton type of artist you can pick up listeners 
from adult contemporary stations who are getting too rock n 
rollish 
country music is becoming the pop music of the 60s he 
said and thats where i came from country music is more than 
guys in a bar or guys in a corral its really growing 
vinton has sold 50 million records since roses are red his 
other hit records mostly in the mid1960s include blue 
velvet there ive said it again mr lonely blue on 
blue i love how you love me sealed with a kiss 
everyday of my life and finally in 1974 my melody of love 
his memories of three of his biggest hits 
roses are red came out around graduation time and it 
was a great farewell song 
blue velvet was recorded with 10 minutes left on the 
recording session i didnt pick it and didnt like it 
mr lonely related to lonely people theres loneliness 
in all of us and i felt it i dug back in my soul for this and 
people felt the loneliness 
he said he did well with love songs because he believed in their 
message and their emotion i really feel them i dont feel rock 
n roll you feel what you have inside and i have a lot of this 
you cant fake it i had an honesty about the records 
he did as well in his own romantic life as he did singing about 
it hes been married to his wife his only one for 27 years 
his there ive said it again in 1964 holds the distinction 
in pop music of being the last no 1 record before the beatles led 
the british invasion of english bands who changed the sound of 
rock n roll music 
vinton was able to maintain a career but many of his peers were 
never as popular again 
they eliminated my competition vinton said about the effect 
the beatles had on male vocalists of his style 
a whole new generation of record buyers is alive now and vinton 
is still competing for their dollars 
i lasted because i made the right songs good honest 
emotional records i do shows and give them a show they cant 
resist so they come back year after year and see me ive changed 
my show to make it fresh make it different 
my music is part of a lot of their lives he said it 
brings back memories their youth their first date their 
marriage so they want to go out and enjoy their early life and 
growing up and all of that 
he feels that hes a much better performer than he was 20 years 
ago 
i was awful then i was young inexperienced nervous and i 
wasnt the confident performer i am today luckily i was able to 
stick around to the point where i can walk on stage today and have 
control of the audience 
being an entertainer is like being a surgeon said vinton 
the longer you do it the better you get at it

alice didnt dare wait for the elevator 
she ran down six flights of stairs her 69 years weighing heavy 
less for the age and a bad hip more for her 52yearold son who 
was waving a knife and threatening to kill her out on the street 
alice headed for a neighbors phone to tell the police her son had 
turned abusive again 
you work and support a child all your life she said from 
new york city where she lives then they act like they hate 
you 
alice not her real name isnt alone as many as 2 million 
elderly people may be abused researchers say often by children 
grandchildren even greatgrandchildren the very people they 
depend on for care in their old age 
this happens with these blood relatives sons daughters 
nieces nephews said dorothy brodie a 75yearold retired 
social worker who works with the bronx elder abuse support projsaid elizabeth 
holtzman district attorney of the new york borough of brooklyn 
where elder abuse has risen 400 percent since 1986 to 370 cases 
last year she attributes the increase to abusers use of crack 
cocaine 
last year 140000 cases of elder abuse were reported 
nationwide an increase of 10 percent from 1987 said toshio 
tatara director of the national aging resource center on elder 
abuse in washington dc people still find it incredible that we 
abuse our elders they said the same thing about children 20 years 
ago and were doing it like a national pastime 
tatara believes just one in 14 cases is likely to be reported 
the victim usually is 75 or older a woman and generally 
dependent the abuser a son or daughter the congressional report 
found 
lawmakers heard about a 68yearold south carolina woman whose 
daughter kept her in a room so cold the urine in a catheter froze 
a 75yearold retired nurse from massachusetts whose 42yearold 
son attacked him with a hatchet a san francisco woman whose 
167000 estate was whittled to 3000 by a soninlaw 
these cases are really difficult and scary even to experienced 
social workers said lucy friedman director of the victim 
services agency in new york which helped alice seek a temporary 
restraining order against her son 
i was really afraid of him said alice who bears a scar on 
her neck where her son once sliced her once he gets the wine he 
goes crazy 
the abusers many times have their own problems drug and alcohol 
abuse unemployment money mental illness violence may be 
repayment for abuse a son or daughter received a cramped house may 
spark it middleaged children free at last of their own children 
may resent the intrusion of a frail parent in some cases its the 
stress of caring for an elderly parent 
paramedics answering a call in the los angeles suburb of san 
fernando found 77yearold virginia grimes jeter covered with 
excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom she died five hours 
later 
the womans daughter cynthia jeter green 39 had promised her 
mother not to put her in an old folks home said prosecutor lee 
harris a probation report found ms green was under a degree of 
emotional distress 
she pleaded no contest april 12 to elder abuse and was ordered 
to begin psychiatric counseling and perform 300 hours of community 
service she did not return several calls requesting an interview 
the idea that people for some reason or another do not want to 
put their loved ones in a nursing home or feel they have to be 
responsible for total care is fairly common in these cases said 
rosalie wolf associate director of the university center on aging 
at the university of massachusetts medical center 
part of the solution is getting seniors to take responsibility 
for stopping and even preventing abuse said lee pearson assistant 
manager of criminal justice services for the american association 
of retired persons 
the elderly should keep regular appointments and stay in touch 
with old friends especially if they move in with a relative 
pearson said they should have someone stop by once a week to make 
sure all is well 
new yorks victim services agency offers a 24hour hotline 
individual and group counseling and help in court getting locks 
changed and finding shelter transportation and clothing in a 
bronx group called safe place the elderly hesitantly confide what 
has happened to them and try to make sense of it 
people just believe and hope so much that this will be the 
last time things will change he wont do it again but they do 
said diana walcott director of the bronx elder abuse support 
project and leader of safe place 
in many cases the parents blame themselves ms friedman said 
they say well how did i bring up this monster 
fortytwo states and the district of columbia have statutes 
requiring reporting of elder abuse but those involved with the 
cases say the nation has a long way to go toward recognizing the 
problem 
the states spend an average 22 per abused child but just 290 
for each abused older person congress found its report 
recommended emergency shelters tax credits for families caring for 
older adults amendments to medicare and medicaid eliminating 
limitations on benefits and services to elderly people cared for by 
family members at home and mandatory reporting of abuse 
its so foreign to our thinking said ms holtzman 
doctors wont even ask if abuse has taken place its possible 
the person once cured will be sent back to the same environment 
possibly to be killed

when it comes to the nations fastest growing 
population several demographic truths apply they are affluent 
interested in getting the most for their buck and over 55 years old 
but dont call them senior citizens 
its instant death said marion williams who developed 
boston five cents savings banks program for older customers 
in the early going some banks made the mistake of pitching 
accounts with names like golden years said marsha blasco of 
florida national bank inc 
since the early 1980s banks around the nation have been paying 
more attention to their older customers government figures project 
a 40 percent increase in the number of people over 50 during the 
next 10 years as the baby boom generation ages this group earns 
900 billion dollars a year and controls 75 percent to 80 percent 
of financial assets in the marketplace 
those are numbers that say this is an important segment 
said thomas munsell of shawmut national corp in hartford conn 
theyre there and have big dollars but theyre sophisticated and 
elusive 
munsell who did considerable research in developing the shawmut 
55 program said the mature bank customer is anything but an easy 
sell they are very wellread and in some cases have the time to 
look into and carefully compare what banks offer these people 
are astute he said 
retirement account managers agree the most important point in 
wooing the over55 set is they regard themselves as anything but 
older 
most of these people consider themselves about 10 years 
younger than they are said blasco an assistant vice president 
they dont feel their age and are much more active than prior 
generations 
when barnett banks of jacksonville fla in 1982 designed a 
package of financial and banking services for older customers it 
was an anomaly said denise martin retirement market manager now 
the competition is fierce everybody is finally realizing that 
its a very important population 
and the scramble has just begun said michael p sullivan a 
charlotte nc consultant and author of banking on the mature 
customer theres going to be some real warfare out there as 
more and more attractive programs are made available to the 
seniors up till now most banks have targeted the young urban 
professional market but suddenly theyre realizing that 60 to 85 
percent of their savings balance is held by people over the age of 
50 
to appeal to that market hundreds of banks have adopted 
programs like barnetts senior partners program specialized 
services have become standard 
customers over 55 can expect free checking travelers and 
cashiers cheques special financial planning guides and accidental 
death insurance have become de rigeur and any bank worth its salt 
is liable to have a newsletter addressed to the mature banking 
customer martin said 
in addition to standard banking discounts marketing directors 
said their older customers are interested in travel entertainment 
and medical benefits 
theyre no longer acquiring and are instead in the 
appreciation stage of life said williams an assistant marketing 
manager at boston ive 
a florida bank offers older customers free memberships to disney 
worlds magic years club and a pocketsized computer card containing 
the clients entire medical history 
but travel perks and dining discounts arent high on some 
seniors lists and many seniors banking programs require minimum 
balances of as much 10000 excluding many people on fixed 
incomes said barbara hughes a consumer affairs specialist at the 
american association of retired persons 
our concern is for those who through deregulation and 
increased fees have found banking services beyond their budget 
hughes said in many places banking services are beyond the reach 
of low or moderateincome people 
between 70 percent and 80 percent of banks offer free checking 
with no minimum balance to people over age 60 said ken mceldowney 
of consumer action a san franciscobased advocacy group but banks 
generally dont advertise them or notify customers they are 
eligible and the advertising ends up targeting at the 
wellheeled consumers in an attempt to persuade them to open an 
account with lots of frills and whistles when in fact such an 
account may not be as advantageous as a more strippeddown 
account he said 
aarp has lobbied for increased sensitivity to older consumers 
needs in all sectors and in particular banks hughes said 
seeing hearing and moving may be diffficult for older consumers 
and older consumers still very much like oneononecontact with 
individuals at the bank tellers 
straight talk about banking service options is another thing 
older customers want she said banks have devised so many 
investment vehicles that its hard to comparison shop and to know 
what youre getting into

a littlenoticed supreme court ruling making 
it easier for employers to limit older workers fringe benefits has 
spurred members of congress to seek agediscrimination barriers 
many thought had been in place for decades 
lawmakers and advocates for the elderly are pushing legislation 
to nullify the june 23 ruling that bias in benefits such as health 
and retirement plans is not automatically banned under the 1967 age 
discrimination in employment act 
in the wake of the ruling employers are probably going to 
start tightening up on what fringes they offer to older workers 
said vicki gottlich an attorney with the national senior citizens 
law center employers may start rethinking how theyre going to 
provide benefits 
however doug mcdowell whose washington law firm mcguiness and 
williams represents management in employment cases said companies 
arent likely to make major cutbacks that would hurt worker morale 
theres a labor shortage in a lot of areas instead of laying 
off people they want to keep them im not sure people would want 
to stay with an employer who said everyone over age 65 is going to 
lose benefits mcdowell said 
the government has long interpreted the age discrimination act 
as letting employers limit fringes for older workers only if it 
would cost more to offer them the same benefits given younger 
employees for example life insurance 
but the supreme court in an ohio case said the law bans biased 
benefit plans only in cases where the disparities are part of an 
intent to discriminate in some nonfringebenefit aspect of 
employment such as hiring or firing 
justice thurgood marshall in a strong dissent from the 72 
majority decision said the ruling immunizes virtually all 
employee benefit programs from liability under the age 
discrimination act 
it is difficult to believe that congress intended to 
immunize acts of unabashed discrimination against older workers 
marshall wrote 
horace deets executive director of the american association of 
retired persons said that while the ruling got little attention 
amid the excitement over longawaited court decisions on abortion 
and flagburning it was an absolute shocker to the aging 
community 
for years the assumption has been that benefits are covered 
under the age discrminiation act as would be hiring and firing 
deets said this puts older workers at a distinct disadvantage 
the decision came in a lawsuit filed by june betts who began 
working in 1978 as a speech pathologist at the hamilton county 
board of mental retardation and developmental disabilites when her 
work deteriorated due to alzheimers disease the 61yearold ms 
betts in 1985 was given the choice of unpaid medical leave or 
retiring with a standard pension of 15850 a month 
because she was over 60 she was denied a third option of 
disability retirement with benefits of 355 a month 
lower courts upheld ms betts contention that it was a 
violation of the act to deny disability benefits solely because of 
her age but the supreme court said congress had left the 
employee benefit battle for another day when it enacted the 
antidiscrimination law in 1967 
the equal employment opportunity commission which enforces the 
age discrimination act filed a brief supporting ms betts and 
stating its belief that the law required some sort of cost 
justification in order to permit an employer to avoid a charge of 
discrimination 
the courts ruling to the contrary is under review and its 
impact on cases pending has not been determined said eeoc 
spokeswoman margaret fernandez 
the rulings biggest impact will be in disability and severance 
benefits which sometimes are designed to convert to pensions at a 
certain age or after a specified time according to jim klein of 
towers perrin a new york consulting firm that often represents 
employers but most employers already are accustomed to applying 
the act to benefit plans and are unlikely to make big changes

when chuck williams retired four years 
ago from a career that included three decades as a tv producer and 
several stints as a broadway performer he planned to play a lot of 
golf 
a few months later though he found himself in 16thcentury 
garb serenading crowds at the busch gardens theme park four days a 
week 
i think its kept me young said williams 64 who enjoys 
mingling with the crowds and bestowing kisses on female tourists 
between shows 
park owner anheuserbusch is among several local employers who 
have taken advantage of the growing number of business and 
government retirees settling in planned communities around this 
small historic city 
colonial williamsburg the college of william and mary and james 
city county all have benefited from retirees with decades of 
experience willing to work parttime for little or no pay 
what may make it unusual is the retirees here are those in the 
upperincome range said john e mcdonald county budget 
director we also see early retirees retirees in their mid50s 
who are still very active people and are still continuing to look 
for challenges 
mcdonald hired one of those ted bickmok at the helm of a station he 
founded massaging listeners 
daily with his gentle yet authoritative and mellifluous voice a 
throwback to an era when radio was king 
at 68 whitehaired and mustachioed shoecraft is an engaging 
entrepreneur raconteur onair pro and civicminded world traveler 
hes also an example for others though he insists on minimizing 
that 
when shoecraft started june 1 1939 just out of phoenix union 
high school changing records at kglu in safford he worked 70 
hours a week including the 6 am signon to 1215 am signoff 
on alternating sundays as record master of ceremonies whatever 
that is the pay was 10 a week 
in those days the dial was less cluttered there were six 
stations on the air in arizona compared with more than 180 today 
it was the prime entertainment in those days and it probably 
was fed a lot by the depression shoecraft says if you could 
get enough to buy a radio this was your family entertainment and 
it was free 
standard fare included bob hope bing crosby and the kraft music 
hall the firestone hour arturo toscanini and the nbc symphony 
orchestra 
the best entertainmment in the whole world comedy and music 
and it really meant more to my way of thinking its still just 
as magnetic if its done right of course the competition now is 
fierce 
shoecraft selftaught has met that competition with his own 
brand of littletown radio a comfortable mix of talk 
information music and general help plus a large dose of local 
news if its news in globe weve got it 
the philosophy is simple interact with listeners 
heres the formula 
a morning open line callin show 
the money tree offering 20 or more to callers who 
correctly answer five truefalse questions like whether president 
truman sold his memoir rights in 1953 to the saturday evening post 
he didnt they went to life magazine 
trading post a daily swap shop 
requests for work clothing or other help for local needy 
citizens 
then there are larry king california angels baseball and other 
sports 
hes been so involved in the community through the radio 
station says sheldon miller manager of the chamber of commerce 
he caters to just so many people 
frank b healy a close friend since childhood says shoecrafts 
word is as good as his signature but hes a poor poker 
player 
its often diffficult to get a straight answer from shoecraft 
healy says i think im the only one who can outjoke him at 
times 
shoecraft has lived in globe since 1943 in 1958 he went on the 
air with his own station kikoam originally broadcasting from the 
lobby of the copper hills hotel eventually he struck a deal with 
inspiration copper co to build a mobilehome park and moved kiko 
into one he built stations in safford and winslow and sold them 
then in 1979 established kikofm with the highest fm signal 
possible carrying 80 miles into phoenix 
over the years hes made the most of turning bad luck into good 
fortune 
for instance there was the time a hunter shot a telephone line 
jumbling signals so a conversation between two women was broadcast 
over kiko shoecraft faced a threat of being sued until he became 
friends with one of the women and her husband and the womans 
sister billie whom he married 
shoecraft played piano in a bar served on the city council and 
as vice mayor and once ran for the state senate i was soundly 
beaten he says 
he served on the hospital and industrial development boards and 
was active in scouting he and billie who died in 1976 raised 
three sons an accountantdeveloper and noted balloonist an 
attorney and a school administrator 
he subsequently married billies nurse ruth 
now shoecraft is running kiko a second time he sold the 
stations in 1987 for 175 million and bought back the am station 
in june 1988 for 125000 
he provided a vehicle for people to vent their feelings 
sometimes in anger sometimes in excitement sometimes in joy but 
whatever the people have had an opportunity to be part of that 
radio station miller says 
one other thing sets willard shoecraft a bit apart since an 
accident when he was 8 he has had no legs 
its one of the few things he doesnt talk much about

the message today is simple beware the 
summer sun 
too many people especially older people become needlessly ill 
because they fail to recognize the potential dangers of the sun and 
its heat however the two great dangers heatstroke and skin 
cancer are largely preventable 
symptoms of heatstroke occur almost instantly and can be 
immediately fatal while skin cancer develops years after exposure 
to the suns rays 
if you must be exposed to the heat drink plenty of water or 
fruit and vegetable juice even if you arent thirsty avoid 
alcohol and caffeine dress in lightweight lightcolored loose 
clothes limit activity in the hottest part of the day and keep 
meals simple and light if they are available use air conditioners 
liberally trips to cool places are good alternatives 
if you are a relative friend or neighbor of a person who is 
unable to get around you may want to offer transportation 
older people are especially vulnerable to heatrelated 
illnesses changes in the body that may affect ability to cope with 
heat include inefficient sweat glands poor circulation and changes 
in the skin also some older people have illnesses that cause 
weakness or fever which in turn affect their ability to cope with 
heat heart lung and kidney diseases are good examples 
diseases requiring special diets also may make a person more 
vulnerable to heatstroke people with high blood pressure for 
example reduce the amount of salt in their diets yet this 
reduction may increase the risk of heat stress a word of caution 
salt should not be increased nor salt supplements taken without 
consent from a physician 
medications like diuretics sedatives tranquilizers and certain 
heart and bloodpressure drugs may contribute to a bodys inability 
to regulate internal temperature but never stop medication or 
change a recommended diet without consulting a doctor unusually 
heavy or underweight people also are at risk as are those who 
drink alcoholic beverages regularly 
anyone suspected of suffering a heatrelated illness should 
receive attention victims of heatstroke exhibit a body temperature 
of 104 degrees or higher the pulse may be rapid other symptoms 
include flushed skin a faint feeling confused and bizarre 
behavior and combativeness these symptoms require immediate 
emergency medical assistance 
heat fatigue and heat exhaustion are milder forms of heat 
stress should you suspect either illness look for giddiness 
nausea profuse sweating and a cold and clammy feeling and take 
steps to prevent the condition from worsening 
first and perhaps most obvious the person needs to get out of 
the sun and into a cool preferably airconditioned place 
encourage sponging off with cool water or taking a cool bath or 
shower and nonalcoholic noncaffeinated drink 
another serious danger associated with the sun and aging is skin 
cancer 
whether you are 15 or 50 your skin is accumulating sun damage 
including wrinkling various growths and skin cancers and change in 
texture by following some easy sunsafety tips many skin cancers 
can be prevented 
dont sunbathe too long try to limit exposure between 10 am 
and 3 pm and get used to the sun gradually wear a hat 
longsleeved shirt and wrated ultraviolet sunglasses use 
sunscreens liberally and apply them at least one hour before going 
out reapply after swimming or sweating sunscreens are effective 
at spf sun protection factor 15 
prolonged exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer the most 
common forms are basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma and 
malignant melanoma 
basal cell carcinomas are the most common and rarely harmful to 
vital organs squamous cell carcinomas are less common but are 
potentially harmful because they can grow quickly and spread to 
other organs malignant melanomas often look like dark irregular 
moles they can be deadly 
if you suspect skin cancer see a doctor warning signs include a 
new moletype spot or changes in color size shape or texture of 
an existing one with early detection and prompt treatment many 
skin cancers can be cured even if you have had a benign cancer you 
must guard against the dangers of the sun 
with good sound judgment and a knowledge of preventive measures 
the hot summer months can be safe and fun for everyone

plants dont care how old you are a 
rose blushes as sweetly for the 80yearold gardener as for one 50 
years younger with age a tennis serve loses its zing and a golf 
drive its distance but your daffodils will dance in the wind as 
sprightly as ever 
augusta carter took to gardening before she was 10 helping her 
grandmother in the red soil of a georgia vegetable patch 
i was the only one of the grandchildren she would let in the 
garden because i remembered the names of things i was alway asking 
questions i wanted to know why things grew the way they did 
now 81 and ailing augusta still finds the garden a main 
pleasure in life people in pound ridge a country town 50 miles 
north of manhattan have long thought of augusta and her lawyer 
husband ray 82 as mr and mrs garden 
most every town has elderly couples like them who seeking 
beauty and flavor have put a lifetime into raising flowers and 
vegetables with skill and dedication and many newly retired 
seniors are looking to the garden to fill the leisure hours 
but augusta warns that a gardener has to get grimy and dirty 
and enjoy what comes out of real work if youre one of those 
people who are afraid to get your fingernails soiled or broken and 
you dont want to put on dirty old jeans and old sneakers and get 
out and dig youre not really a gardener 
ailments keep her from doing as much now shes concentrating 
more and more on flowers and herbs but leaning on her stick 
augusta helps out at every event put on by the garden club of 
which she was once president she supervises the care of the 
library grounds 
but mostly she likes to look at her perennials renewing 
themselves in the spring like the lavender clematis that has 
showed 300 blooms 
in his youth in florida ray worked as an attorney for the war 
department but briefly tended a victory garden in mamaroneck a 
suburb of new york city augusta remembers his vegetables were so 
good that he was robbed often people would come in the middle of 
the night and take things 
after the war the carters moved to a 1737 house on acreage in 
pound ridge which since has become a national landmark 
even as ray commuted daily by train to his law firm in 
manhattan he became more and more involved in his garden id 
get up at 430 and get my gardening done then otherwise i wouldnt 
keep abreast of it there wasnt enough time 
before leaving for his train ray would pick a flower for his 
buttonhole and he became known to fellow commuters as the man who 
always wore a flower 
for years now the carters have been going back south in the 
winter to a house and another garden in the florida keys and 
theyll define for you expertly the nuances of southern and 
northern horticulture 
ray has also been ailing lately and has cut his outdoor work 
sharply but he likes to take you around his pound ridge grounds 
and point out interesting plants like his offseason egyptian 
onions in the vegetable patch he shows how yearly mulching with 
autumn leaves has enriched the soil to a deep dark brown his 
daughter quincy helped put in the tomatoes this year 
keeping up the family tradition quincy has also headed the 
garden club 
talking with the carters in their comfortable sitting room you 
get a sense of the soul of the garden augusta appreciates but 
doesnt agree with an old saying that people like to garden 
because the plants dont talk back 
she thinks plants have a lot to say without talking that 
theyll let you know by sign language if they need more sun or rain 
or a richer soil she also says its the care you give a rose 
that brings out the better rose 
any wisdom shed pass on 
you dont have a garden just for yourself you have it to 
share but you have to be willing to do the work

kids dont think like grownups 
with that simple premise and a 50000 grant from the national 
institutes of health a momandpop research company has come up 
with a childproof cap it hopes will make life easier for older 
americans 
the caps designed by bob and mary hunters yellowstone 
environmental science dont rely on an adults strength or 
dexterity instead they require two cognitive skills that children 
aged 3 to 5 dont have read the directions then do some things in 
a specified sequence such as push twist then pull 
the designs were similar to simple combination locks said 
mary hunter 
the hunters recruited 26 adults aged 60 to 75 from the bozeman 
senior center and 20 3 to 5yearolds from the child development 
center a preschool associated with montana state university to 
test three cap designs 
it was a much smaller group than youd need to come to 
definite conclusions but two of the designs were virtually 
childproof no children opened them one child almost 5 opened 
one of the designs mrs hunter said 
the children seemed familiar with the nowcommonplace safety 
caps but were thwarted by the sequence requirements she said 
ninety percent of the adults opened the caps and 80 percent rated 
them easy or very easy to use 
a recent gallup poll of older americans found that the no 1 
problem of daily life was opening medicine the hunters said 
safety packaging is optional on prescription drugs and many older 
people especially arthritics refuse it 
one result said bob hunter is that one of every six children 
poisoned by a prescription medicine each year has taken a 
grandparents medication 
the consumer product safety commission is considering a staff 
proposal to test packaging for medicines and toxic household 
chemicals on elderly people as well as the children it is meant to 
protect people over 65 receive 25 percent of all prescriptions 
but testing uses only 18 to 45yearolds hunter said 
owensillinois a 3 billionayear packaging manufacturer has 
asked to look at the hunters findings

a computer that makes up to 100 phone calls an 
hour can alleviate one of the fears of elderly people living alone 
being undiscovered for days after being stricken suddenly at home 
by illness 
there is a large percentage of elderly that live alone with a 
preexisting medical conditions and nobody to check on them 
youngtown police chief mike branham said recently announcing plans 
to install the system 
the service ruok coined by developer bruce johnson for 
are you ok is being installed in the youngtown sun city and 
sun city west suburbs of phoenix ruok was first installed in 
osage iowa in march 1988 and has been started in about 15 cities 
including in gulfport miss in july 
its a real simple system branham said a computer modem 
hooks to a telephone and calls the elderly person if they dont 
answer the phone the computer relogs the number and recalls it 
eight minutes later 
if there is no answer a computer sends a printout of the 
persons name and condition to a police dispatcher who will send 
an officer the computer dials up to 100 phones an hour and should 
be able to serve about 500 people 
a person may have the computer call any number of times in a 
day branham said everyone will get at least one call every 24 
hours 
johnson who attended a news conference kicking off the gulfport 
system if a person can answer the phone we assume hes ok 
enough to call for help this program is aimed at those who cant 
answer 
the cost varies phoenixarea civic groups raised 7000 to 
start ruok gulfport police came up with 3600 for theirs

freeze prices for an unspecified period following similar measures 
taken by staterun enterprises earlier this month the alittihad 
weekly reported monday 
the weekly published by the iraqi federation of chambers of 
commerce and industry said the price freeze was requested in 
accordance with the governments inflationfighting efforts

and as hindering development of the national economy 
the governments call came just a few days after it raised state 
employees salaries by 80 a month in their first pay hike in more 
than 10 years 
the government also froze prices of goods and services provided

honeywell inc the subject of intense 
takeover speculation for the past two weeks today announced a 
major restructuring program that includes reducing its weapons 
business and cutting 4000 jobs 
the company said it also planned to repurchase up to 10 million 
shares of its common stock on the open market and to sell a 
substantial portion of its 50 percent stake in 
yamatakehoneywell a japanese controls maker analysts have valued 
that holding at nearly 1 billion 
the sweeping program will result in a 65cent increase in the 
honeywells fourthquarter dividend to 275 a share and could 
include a special cash dividend said chairman james j renier 
renier said he expected the restructuring to improve operating 
profits by about 150 million over the next 18 months 
honeywell is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the us 
navy and also supplies small medium and large ammunition to the 
us army tunheim said 
wall street greeted todays announcement with open arms 
honeywell jumped 337 to 8887 in active latemorning trading 
on the new york stock exchange following a delayed opening 
renier said the reduction of honeywells weapons business is 
part of a strategy begun in 1988 to concentrate on core controls 
businesses that principally serve commercial markets as well as the 
market for military and space controls 
the reduction will proceed over time in a responsible manner 
that recognizes the us governments interest in these businesses 
so as not to adversely affect national security interests our 
government program obligations or the value of these businesses to 
honeywell shareholders renier said 
the weapons business accounts for about 20 percent of 
honeywells revenue 
kathy tunheim a company spokeswoman would not say whether a 
sale of the business is one of the options being considered 
however tunheim said negotiations to sell the companys stake 
in yamatakehoneywell which is listed on the tokyo stock exchange 
will begin within a few days she would not identify potential 
buyers japanese investors currently own half of the company she 
said 
honeywells restructuring program will include the elimination 
of 4000 jobs worldwide over the next 18 months including 300 
corporate staff positions targeted in a previous announcement 
honeywell currently employs about 78000 workers many of the 
job cuts will be made through attrition but layoffs will be 
necessary tunheim said the company had announced last month that 
it would lay off 300 employees 
todays restructuring announcement follows speculation that 
honeywell is a takeover target honeywells stock price has risen 
sharply in the last two weeks following published reports that 
general electric co was considering acquiring the company 
the takeover rumors began after the company announced that it 
lost 435 million in fiscal 1988 
honeywells secondquarter profit jumped to 748 million or 
173 a share from 316 million or 75 cents a share in 1988 
john mcmanus a securities analyst with thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york said todays announcement could deter 
a takeover attempt although it wont guarantee independence for 
honeywell 
they are trying to basically boost the stock price to make it 
more difficult for someone to take them over mcmanus said it 
will also alleviate some of the large shareholders who have been 
pounding on the door they are doing the things they have to do to 
deter a takeover

enter the market but the soviets have yet to make an offer 
the near completion of the wheat harvest and the purchase last 
week by egypt of 200000 metric tons of wheat from european growers 
pushed wheat futures lower

correction after its sharp move forward in recent weeks

reported pockets of profittaking

financier sir james goldsmith for bat industries plc july 11

many of the economic considerations of a 
proposed capital gains tax cut now have become obscured by politics 
and reduced to a question would a cut be a gift to the rich at the 
expense of the poor 
some studies say it would be the reasoning being that most 
capitalgain dollars or financial gains on appreciation of 
longterm assets are earned by the wealthy internal revenue 
service figures document it 
those figures show for instance that in 1986 the group with 
total income of 1 million or more earned more than onethird of 
all capital gains the percentage often has been cited in defense 
of the rich vs poor argument 
less often cited are data from the same source showing that 
people with medium or low income constitute nearly 18 percent of 
capital gains earners and that they might fare worse than the rich 
moreover says ron utt former deputy director of the office of 
management and budget those figures must be read with a very 
serious caveat that some relatively poor people may become 
rich once in their lives 
once is enough however statistically to catapult them into the 
higher brackets 
utt now a fellow at the conservative heritage foundation 
observes that even relatively poor people can be hit hard by 
capital gains who an elderly widow selling her home a parent 
selling stock to pay for a childs education 
it also might be a hardworking citizen who sells a business or 
almost anyone who tediously saved a few thousand dollars in a 
mutual fund or a divorced couple selling a home into which they 
had poured hearts and dollars 
for one year the year in which they disposed of their assets 
they became rich for tax purposes forever leaving their imprint on 
the national statistics and their own financial well being 
the tendency to view capital gains and capital gains taxes as 
affecting only the rich led to obscuring another economic 
consideration when the tax was raised from a maximum of 20 percent 
to a maximum of 28 percent in 1986 
that increase did indeed impact the rich it was after all a 
40 percent increase often overlooked then and now is the fact 
that under the old rules the taxes of many low and middleincome 
taxpayers amounted to only 14 percent they too jumped to 28 
percent doubling in one legislative swipe 
that was part of the increase because of legislative action at 
the state level or because state tax rates were based on the 
federal model state taxes also rose some between 100 percent and 
200 percent 
an economic consideration often referred to by supporters of a 
capital gains tax cut is the injustice of taxing people on capital 
gains income never earned the tax is applied quite literally to 
the inflated value of assets 
but while taxing people on inflation may be unreasonable it is 
seldom pointed out that the assets involved may have grown more 
swiftly because taxes were deferred until sold that observation 
also seems to have been forgotten 
important also is the potential significance of capital gains 
taxes for the united states as a global competitor capital gains 
taxes are not universal they are rare restricted mainly to such 
industrial giants as the united states which has the highest 
britain sweden canada and france 
in a 1987 report the accounting firm arthur andersen pointed 
out that west germany belgium italy japan and the netherlands 
exempted longterm capital gains also exempting them were hong 
kong singapore south korea taiwan and malaysia all on a fast 
track to industrial might and competitive power 
these and many other economic considerations have been 
overwhelmed in the heat of the political battle a battle that 
seems to have distilled the important issues to just one

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade as rain and moderate 
temperatures in large areas of the us growing region weighed 
heavily on the market 
the market opened very weak and continued that way 
throughout the day said dale gustafson an analyst for drexel 
burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the favorable growing conditions for this week with a little 
less warm temperatures than predicted added to the bearish 
sentiment gustafson said 
he noted that the weakness in soybean and corn prices spilled 
over into the wheat pit wheat prices also were pressured by the 
good pace of the harvest 
disappointment in the export side of the market also affected 
prices gustafson said 
at the close wheat was 6 cents to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 388 a bushel corn was 6 
cents to 9 cents lower with september at 230 a bushel oats were

design group because he was afraid of losing control of his 
companies borg said he was negotiating other financing to keep his 
business afloat 
i remain committed to the business and am in the process of 
trying to reorganize the management and corporate structure of the 
group borg said in a statement 
bjorn borg design group produces a line of designer fashions 
fragrances shoes and accessories and has real estate interests in 
sweden 
lars skarke who has a 25 percent stake in borgs companies

forcing the closure of the group 
the company needs an infusion of cash to meet orders and finance 
further expansion skarke was quoted as saying in the aftonbladet 
daily 
borg the fivetime wimbeldon champion who retired from 
professional tennis in 1983 has boasted of his handson management 
style making major business decisions on his own 
borg turned down an offer of 30 million kronor or 46 million 
by the mercuriusgroup ab to buy into the holding company bjorn 
borg enterprises ltd headquartered in monte carlo

singer loredana berte which have been frustrated by delays in 
obtaining her divorce

william t allen the judge said the proposed timewarner deal 
which was announced in march three months before paramount 
launched its bid was the result of longterm business planning and 
that paramount and times shareholders could not interfere 
michael klein an attorney for some of the time shareholders 
said that because it was a unanimous ruling the decision would not 
be appealed to the full state supreme court which has five 
justices 
paramount said in a statement it was ending its bid for time but 
would continue to try to expand through acquisitions mergers 
joint ventures or partnerships 
we believe in making bold moves when they are in the best 
interest of paramount communications shareholders paramount 
chairman martin davis said we have just demonstrated that in our 
offer for time 
time attorney robert joffe said time would proceed as planned 
with its 70 a share tender offer for warner which was scheduled 
to expire at 5 pm edt 
the supreme court widely had been expected to uphold allens 
ruling and the justices close questioning of the paramount and 
shareholder attorneys during the twohour hearing indicated they 
would rule in times favor 
investors sold off time stock as the hearing which was 
televised live by cable news network proceeded the companys 
shares were down 125 to 13725 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading after the decision was announced 
warner was up 1 to 6650 a share and paramount was up 87 
cents to 5837 a share 
at one point in todays hearing justice andrew gt moore asked 
of michael klein an attorney for some of times biggest 
shareholders whether they were demanding that we must hold that 
a board is hostage to any person who walks in and makes a bid no 
matter what the longterm plans are 
paramount attorney melvyn cantor contended today that delaware 
law required the time board to inquire into paramounts bid and 
reminded the threejudge panel that the supreme court in a previous 
case had held that the failure to inquire is gross negligence 
stuart savett representing some of the shareholders accused 
the time board of passively sitting by while company management 
used the warner deal to entrench itself 
the justices asked joffe the time attorney why the 70 a share 
tender offer for warner which replaced an earlier stockswap 
merger plan was not submitted to a vote by time shareholders at 
the companys annual meeting in june 
joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not 
involve the issuing of new time stock furthermore he said after 
paramount launched its bid on june 6 the market for time stock was 
in disarray and the price of the shares was gyrating 
this was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned 
evaluation of future value and get a fair vote he said 
joffe contended times plans to merge with warner would give 
shareholders greater value in the long term than paramounts 200 a 
share offer 
in its tender off for warner time will pay 70 per share in 
cash for half of warners 200 million outstanding shares 
time will later exchange 70 in a combination of cash and 
securities for the remaining shares in what is called the deals 
back end the back end could take several months to complete 
paramount argued in a brief filed with the supreme court last 
week that allens decision allowed the time board to proceed with 
the merger with warner although the deal was economically inferior 
to the paramount offer and therefore detrimental to time 
shareholders 
paramount contended that allens ruling would allow directors to 
reject any offers if they could point to some longterm corporate 
strategy 
time in its brief defended the right of its directors to 
determine the companys future course and said previous delaware 
supreme court cases allow a board to refuse to consider offers that 
threaten longterm plans 
the media giant argued that its longterm strategy should not be 
instantly negated by the launching of a hostile tender offer 
both companies claimed that the delaware supreme courts 1985 
ruling in a case involving unocal corp and takeover strategist t 
boone pickens jr supported their arguments that decision was 
written by justice andrew gt moore one of the three jurists who 
had been scheduled to hear the time case 
allens decision effectively gave corporate directors leeway in 
rejecting offers and in setting a course for their companies there 
was widespread speculation prior to the supreme court hearing today 
that an overturned decision would radically change the climate for 
friendly mergers in the united states 
many of the biggest us corporations are incorporated in 
delaware and subject to its laws and other states have modeled 
their statutes after delawares 
separately the wall street journal reported today that about 
500 warner executives and employees would be paid a total of about 
677 million under stock option and bonus plans if the deal with 
warner goes through 
the journal said the payments disclosed in minutes of a warner 
board meeting june 15 amounted to the largest compensation 
package for employees of a company involved in a takeover 
warner chairman steven ross would receive 193 million in 
payments and would also receive options on 18 million time warner 
shares the journal said

a refinancing agreement between mexico and its 
creditor banks offers a glimmer of hope to the debtstrapped third 
world but success of the plan hinges on how far the banks are 
willing to go government officials and private bankers said monday 
the administration which provided a final push over the weekend 
to get the agreement hailed the package as a landmark success for 
its debtreduction initiative unveiled by treasury secretary 
nicholas brady on march 10 
however the banks that will implement the plan were more 
reserved in their enthusiasm with many contending that it was too 
soon to say how much debt relief they will provide to mexico 
because they were still examining the fine print of the agreement 
at the moment were exploring our options fraser seitel a 
spokesman for chase manhattan corp said in a typical comment 
were looking at the entire third world debt package 
the bush administration hopes to use the mexican agreement to 
set a precedent that will facilitate debt relief in other 
countries with venezuela and the philippines considered the two 
leading candidates to follow mexicos lead 
the administration has made debt reduction a key component of 
its foreign policy believing that the only way to ensure the 
survival of emerging democracies in latin america is to reverse the 
decadelong slide in living standards caused by the crushing 13 
trillion third world debt burden 
the brady plan for debt relief is seeking to slash this debt by 
establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily 
forgive a portion of the loans 
however banking analysts said it was unclear whether the 
incentives being offered in the mexican package were sufficient to 
trigger a substantial writedown of the debt 
in the case of mexico the debtreduction package provides the 
commercial banks with three options 
on the debt relief side they can cut 35 percent off the face 
value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce interest 
rates to 625 percent down from about 10 percent currently 
banks also have the option of simply providing new loans 
the administration estimated that the various options could save 
mexico about 15 billion annually off the 5 billion to 55 
billion it must pay to service its 54 billion in commercial bank 
debt 
however the administration stressed that this was a rough 
estimate and would vary depending on individual decisions made by 
the 500 commercial banks located in the united states japan and 
europe that hold the mexican debt 
rep charles schumer dny and a leading congressional expert 
on third world debt said that the mexican agreement appeared 
seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for 
banks to opt for the two debt reduction options rather than simply 
piling on new debt 
a lot of the banks without the necessary carrots or sticks 
are going to stick with the familiar approach of supplying new 
money to pay old debt schumer said 
schumer said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the 
past seven years since 1982 when the debt crisis first erupted 
third world debt has more than doubled from 600 billion to the 
current 13 trillion 
rep john lafalce dny said the mexican agreement did not 
represent any longlasting breakthrough in mexicos debt 
situation he said while the amount of debtreduction was likely 
to be small mexico would benefit in the next couple of years with 
an infusion of new money to get its economy started again 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgraw hill said that the 
administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as they 
could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to get 
an agreement 
it looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get 
something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work 
she said it is a surface agreement that allows the 
administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered 
questions 
the administration had hoped that president bush would be able 
to present a completed mexican package during the sevennation 
economic summit last week in paris 
when that deadline was missed brady stepped up his lobbying 
efforts he brought the bankers and mexican negotiators to 
washington over the weekend for meetings at the treasury which 
were also attended by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
after two days of discussions at the us treasury final 
agreement was reached late sunday in time for mexican president 
carlos salinas de gortari to announce the breakthrough during a 
televised broadcast saying the proposal would answer the the cry 
of mexicans to return to growth

ferruzzi group on monday called for a study of 
chicago board of trade operations in a followup of the soybean 
processors criticism of the exchanges emergency order that 
required traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures 
contracts 
david h swanson president of central soya co and a member of 
ferruzzis executive committee said the emergency order 
illustrated that the exchange had failed to keep up with the global 
expansion of commodities trading 
he said a study of the cbot should look at its grain delivery 
system regulations market stability committee structure and 
market trends swanson said such a study should be undertaken by a 
group made up of soybean farmers processors and others with a 
stake in the soybean market 
the agricultural market is becoming truly global in nature 
more than ever it requires a strong and predictable chicago board 
of trade swanson said at a news conference 
as it stands now it is open to question whether the market is 
serving that function 
the board of trade on july 11 ordered ferruzzi group part of 
the italian grain conglomerate ferruzzi fianziaria spa and other 
major traders to liquidate contracts for july delivery or sale of 
millions of bushels of soybeans 
that decision touched off wild swings in soybean prices and the 
exchanges action has been widely questioned by farm groups 
cbot officials said the exchange was worried that soybean 
supplies were insufficient for meeting large holdings of contracts 
for july delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading in that 
contract 
swanson said monday that ferruzzi was holding contracts for 
delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans in july he said those 
holdings were built up because of concerns ferruzzi might not be 
able to fill export orders because of the reduction in soybean 
supplies due to the 1988 drought 
it is both incredible and unacceptable that a market with 
international authority and indeed global responsibility can be 
in a crisis over 20 million bushels of beans he said 
the chicago board of trade refused to comment on ferruzzis call 
for the study however a cbot spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the exchange conducts internal reviews on a regular 
basis 
we have an entire department the department of economic 
analysis and planning that reviews the market on a regular 
basis said the spokesman it adjusts contracts if they need 
adjusting 
swanson said that despite the global nature of the soybean 
market the number of participants had declined 
with fewer but larger players hedging needs of the major 
firms have increased dramatically he said do the cbots 
operating practices accommodate this changed market 
swanson also said a study should look into whether options have 
reduced futures trading and increased price volatility 
futures are contracts for the delivery of a specified amount of 
a commodity such as soybeans at a future time for a specific 
price options give a speculator the option to buy or sell futures 
contracts at a specific price during a certain period of time 
options are the preferred instrument of many farmers the 
cbot spokesman said when they enter to an options agreement it 
puts a floor on the price but they are free to take a better price 
should it occur

unisys corps earnings fell 67 percent in 
the latest quarter in spite of an 8 percent increase in revenue 
the computer and defense contracting company said 
unisys chairman w michael blumenthal attributed the sharp 
earnings drop to the expense of cutting inventories pricing 
pressures from competitors and the temporary suspension of its 
defense business by the pentagon also the rise in the dollar 
decreased the dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies 
net income was 536 million or 17 cents a share on revenue of 
257 billion for the apriltojune period compared to 1623 
million or 78 cents a share assuming full dilution in the similar 
1988 period revenue grew to 257 billion from 239 billion a 
year earlier 
for the first half of this year unisys recorded a loss of 251 
million in contrast to a profit of 3116 million or 160 a share 
assuming full dilution in the yearearlier period revenue for the 
first six months this year was 478 billion up narrowly from 
476 billion in 1988 
three former units of sperry corp were temporarily suspended 
from bidding on navy contracts from march 15 through june 23 1989 
the suspension stemmed from a federal investigation into 
government contract bidding procedures two former employees 
pleaded guilty to bribery and illegal political donations charges 
unisys said the incidents occurred before sperry and burroughs 
corp merged and became known as unisys but agreed to institute a 
company ethics program when the contract bidding suspension came to 
an end unisys is rated the nations 15th largest defense 
contractor and last year received 14 billion in contracts from 
the pentagon

stock prices pulled back today reined in by 
uncertainty about the chances for lower interest rates anytime soon 
the stock market moved broadly lower from the opening bell and 
various market measures finished near their worst levels of the 
session after an afternoon rebound ran out of steam 
wall street analysts had anticipated todays selloff 
much of the force behind fridays nearly 32point surge in the 
dow jones industrial average came from trading strategies tied to 
the expiration of july stockrelated futures and options 
with the conclusion of trading in those contracts a major 
buying motivation disappeared 
a lot of last weeks activity was predicated on the futures 
and options expirations said eugene peroni director of 
technical research at janney montgomery scott inc 
attention now has returned to the interest rate outlook 
financial markets have been building up their hopes for the federal 
reserve board to make a significant move toward a more generous 
credit policy but so far they have been disappointed 
the market must now consider that the fed and the major 
commercial banks have not acted as aggressively as was hoped 
said peroni 
earlier this month when chase manhattan bank cut its prime 
lending rate to 10 percent from 11 percent it was widely assumed 
that its competitors would follow suit but other major banks have 
demurred 
peroni said he thinks the fed will continue to ease its hold on 
credit but will do so in gradual careful steps as it assesses the 
economys condition

eastman kodak co said monday a 
previously announced restructuring plan would reduce its net profit 
by about 225 million in the second quarter 
kodak also said its operating results apart from the 
restructuring were hurt by the artificially high value of the 
us dollar and the absence of expected efficiencies in 
manufacturing 
kodak chairman colby chandler said the shortfall in operating 
results was very disappointing and said the company would take 
strong steps to address the situation diclosing a plan in the near 
future 
as for the restructuring charge he said this should be seen 
in a positive light we are paying now for superior performance in 
1990 and beyond 
after announcing a 23 percent slide in firstquarter profit 
kodak said it would consolidate its photofinishing and consumer 
photography operations steps that could cost hundreds of jobs 
the 225 million charge will cover the cost of special 
separation payments to outgoing employees as well as the expense of 
writing off the book value of equipment materials and goodwill 
it was no surprise they had mentioned the 200 million figure 
before said regina wiedenski of adams harkness in boston but 
there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the company 
ms wiedenski said kodak watchers are waiting for details of the 
companys restructuring plans and more information about divisions 
that incurred losses during the quarter 
kodak will announce the secondquarter results on aug 1 
last year kodak reported sales of 17 billion and net earnings 
of 14 billion

the bush administration on monday hailed the 
new mexican debtreduction package as a breakthrough for its third 
world debt strategy but others were decidedly less enthusiastic 
several members of congress and private bankers said they 
believed the final agreement with mexico offered a glimmer of hope 
for the debtstrapped third world but they said the success of the 
plan hinged on how far commercial banks would ultimately be willing 
to go 
treasury secretary nicholas brady briefing reporters monday 
labeled the agreement between mexico and its commercial banks 
reached late sunday night as a landmark agreement he said would 
establish a precedent to provide debt relief for other third world 
countries such as venezuela the philippines and costa rica 
mexico had been seen as the key test case for the 
administrations effort to reduce the burden of third world debt a 
strategy brady unveiled march 10 
brady said the agreement if fully implemented by the commercial 
banks would shave mexicos annual interest rate payments by 15 
billion down about onethird from the current 5 billiion to 55 
billion the country is paying on its commercial bank debt of 54 
billion 
in addition brady said that over four years the amount of 
mexicos outstanding debt will be reduced by 10 billion to 12 
billion from where it would have been had the deal not been struck 
this is a fantastic change in circumstances brady said 
although he conceded that the ultimate shape of the debtrelief 
package will depend on the willingness of commercial banks to 
participate 
for their part the commercial banks that hold mexicos debt 
were more reserved with many contending that it was too soon to 
say how much debt relief they will provide to mexico because they 
were still examining the fine print of the agreement 
at the moment were exploring our options fraser seitel a

are going to stick with the familiar approach of supplying new 
money to pay old debt schumer said 
schumer said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the 
last seven years since 1982 when the debt crisis first erupted 
third world debt has more than doubled from 600 billion to 13 
trillion 
rep john lafalce dny said the mexican agreement did not 
represent any longlasting breakthrough in mexicos debt 
situation he said that while the amount of debtreduction was 
likely to be small mexico would benefit in the next couple of 
years with an infusion of money to get its economy started again 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgrawhill inc said that 
the administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as 
it could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to 
get an agreement 
it looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get 
something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work 
she said it is a surface agreement that allows the 
administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered 
questions 
the administration had hoped that president bush would be able 
to present a completed mexican package during the sevennation 
economic summit last week in paris 
when that deadline was missed brady stepped up his lobbying 
efforts he brought the bankers and mexican negotiators to 
washington over the weekend for meetings at the treasury which 
were also attended by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
after two days of discussions at the treasury final agreement 
was reached late sunday in time for mexican president carlos 
salinas de gortari to announce the breakthrough during a televised 
broadcast saying the proposal would answer the the cry of 
mexicans to return to growth

supercomputer rivals cray research inc and 
hitachi ltd on monday confirmed that they have agreed to license 
their patents to each other freely but cray said the pact does not 
allow for joint marketing or sharing of trade secrets 
previous press reports were mistaken in saying the pact would 
allow the two compaies to share information not yet patented said 
john swenson a spokesman for minneapolisbased cray 
hitachi issued a statement to confirm the existence of the 
crosslicensing agreement but a spokesman in new york declined 
further comment 
swenson said such agreements are customary in the computer 
industry but he said hitachi is the first japanese company to sign 
such an agreement with cray convex computers of richardson texas 
and supertek computers of california have similar agreements with 
cray swenson said 
the agreement gives each company freedom to pursue designs 
without having to be concerned about accidental design overlaps 
involving a patent held by the other company swenson said if 
we should stumble onto one anothers technology weve agreed not 
to litigate 
the kyodo news service of japan japan broadcasting corp and 
the nationally circulated asahi shimbun newspaper reported earlier 
that the agreement would enable hitachi to obtain unpatented 
technology from cray which has more experience in supercomputers 
the reports quoted unidentified industry sources 
clyde v prestowitz jr a former commerce department trade 
negotiator said deals between high technology firms in the us 
and japan draw the attention of the us government officials 
because they have been using taxpayer money to build up american 
technology 
prestowitz author of trading places a book that advocates 
us industrial policy to preserve american technology said he has 
his eyebrows raised over the crayhitachi deal 
i wonder what lies behind it he said particularly why 
they chose hitachi 
prestowitz said the japanese have benefited from an imbalanced 
flow of information between the two countries 
if cray gets more information than they give more power to 
them he said

to increase the availability of european energy products analysts 
said

lambert inc in chicago disappointment in the export side of the

the plan for reducing mexicos foreign debt 
removes an obstacle to growth but does not guarantee recovery 
economists said monday 
the benefits go beyond what you can see in terms of the 
reduction said nora lustig who teaches at the colegio de 
mexico a graduate school and think tank and is a visiting fellow 
at the brookings institute in washington dc 
it generates the impression to the world and investors who 
want to go to mexico that the financial stability is more or less 
there she said 
economists say elements still needed for recovery are 
confidence lower interest rates investment domestic savings 
reduction of the government deficit and continued containment of 
wages and price 
they said that even if those conditions are met the government 
must be careful not to let the economy overheat and generate more 
inflation 
the agreement will let the economy grow and will gradually 
raise our standard of living it doesnt permit dreams but with 
work we can return to sustained growth treasury secretary pedro 
aspe told a luncheon gathering of 500 of mexicos elite and 
powerful 
president carlos salinas de gortari also spoke to the gathering 
attended by mexicos most powerful business industry media labor 
and farm leaders 
in his remarks salinas said every mexican must now redouble 
his efforts but that those efforts can now be made with spirit 
even happiness because they will result in progress 
mexicos agreement in principle with a steering committee of 15 
creditor banks was seen as a test of bush administration policy for 
reducing third world debt and as a milestone for other debtor 
countries waiting to renegotiate 
it represents the first significant reduction in a governments 
debt to commercial banks 
for the banks it is hard but something they can live with 
said m peter mcpherson executive vice president of bank of 
america this really was a big reduction of assets for the banks 
and this was a big matter for mexico in terms of how to get on top 
of the debt problem 
under the agreement banks have three options a 35 percent 
reduction in principle reduction of the interest rate to 6 
percent from the current average of about 10 percent or providing 
new loans equal to 25 percent of what mexico owes the bank 
the deal applies to about 54 billion of mexicos foreign debt 
which totals 107 billion second in the developing world only to 
the 120 billion owed by brazil 
after more details are worked ut which is expected to take a 
few weeks the agreement will be sent to the more than 500 creditor 
banks for approval and choice of options 
is it enough so that mexico is in a relatively comfortable 
position to keep up with its payments definitely yes said 
jonathan heath of macroasesoria an economic consulting firm 
he added however that savings provided by the agreement were 
not necessarily enough to achieve president carlos salinas de 
gortaris goal of 6 percent annual economic growth by the end of 
his sixyear term in 1994 
that point is still to be seen because the external debt is 
the first step and probably the most important one but those 
savings alone will not be enough to finance the growth heath said 
mexico had a net inflow of resources when its economy was 
growing he said but with the agreement the country still will be 
sending out more foreign exchange than it gets 
officials in washington estimated the various options could save 
mexico about 15 billion annually of the 5 billion55 billion 
in interest on the 54 billion of commercial debt involved 
rogelio ramirez de la o a mexican economic consultant said 
the net transfer of funds abroad would be more than 4 percent of 
the gross domestic product even with the agreement the 
governments goal was to reduce the amount from 7 percent to 2 
percent 
i am confident the agreement is going to boost optimism in the 
private sector he said but added the mexican crisis is not 
over 
abel beltrandelrio director of ciemexwefa an economic 
consulting firm in philadelphia said the biggest risk was renewed 
inflation 
the greatest risk is that it may generate growing pressure on 
public spending which has fallen behind especially in 
governmentowned industries and for salary increases he said 
beltrandelrio said the government wageprice plan that brought 
inflation down from 1592 percent in 1987 to an anticipated 20 
percent 22 percent this year still will be needed

paramount communications inc abandoned 
its 122 billion hostile bid for time inc on monday after the 
delaware supreme court upheld a lower court decision allowing time 
to proceed with its 14 billion buyout of warner communications inc 
we find no error of law by the court of chancery justice 
henry r horsey announced as the threejudge panel unanimously 
sustained a ruling by judge william t allen thereby affirming the 
rights of corporate directors to decide the future course of their 
companies 
the decision ended paramounts sevenweek bid to acquire time 
paramount issued a statement that it was dropping its 200 a share 
buyout offer but would continue trying to expand through 
acquisitions mergers joint ventures or partnerships 
we believe in making bold moves when they are in the best 
interest of paramount communications shareholders said paramount 
chairman martin davis we have just demonstrated that in our 
offer for time 
paramount and several of times biggest shareholders 
unsuccessfully had sought an injunction against times tender offer 
for warner claiming that time should be forced to consider 
paramounts buyout offer 
the tender offer for warner expired at 5 pm edt and time 
announced it held more than 117 million warner shares or about 58 
percent of the companys outstanding common stock time said it 
would announce tuesday the exact number of shares tendered under 
its offer 
under its 70 a share offer time was to purchase slightly more 
than half of warners common stock and exchange a combination of 
cash and securities valued at 70 a share for the rest time said 
shareholders would start to be paid for the tendered shares on 
monday 
when their merger is complete a process expected to take 
several months the new time warner inc will be the worlds 
largest communications concern 
paramount said it would not pursue a bid for time warner 
allens ruling gave corporate directors latitude in defending 
against unwanted takeover bids that they claim interfere with a 
companys longterm strategy 
the judge said the proposed timewarner deal which was 
announced in march three months before paramount launched its bid 
was the result of longterm business planning and that paramount 
and times shareholders could not interfere 
paramount has contended that once time announced its plan to 
merge with warner it effectively placed itself up for sale and 
under delaware law therefore had to consider paramounts offer 
during more than two hours of arguments before the supreme court 
monday paramount attorney melvyn cantor said times board had a 
fiduciary duty to inquire into paramounts initial 175 a share 
buyout offer 
we dont question that timewarner is a good deal cantor 
said but he contended time shareholders should have had a chance 
to vote on whether paramounts acquisition of the company would 
have been a better deal in the short term 
michael klein an attorney for major time shareholders 
including texas investor robert m bass said thousands of the 
companys stockholders opposed the timewarner merger he argued 
that based on previous delaware court rulings the board was 
obligated to consider paramounts offer 
but justice andrew gt moore interjected that kleins argument 
would make a board hostage to anyone who walked in with a bid 
regardless of a companys longrange plans 
klein said after the court ruled that the decision tilted 
delaware law in favor of management he predicted attorneys would 
advise corporations to develop an appearance of a longterm 
plan to ward off potential takeover bids 
when time attorney robert joffe presented his case monday the 
justices asked why times tender offer for warner which replaced 
an earlier stockswap merger plan was not submitted to a vote by 
time shareholders at the companys annual meeting in june 
joffe said a vote was not required because the deal did not 
involve the issuing of new time stock furthermore he said after 
paramount announced its bid on june 6 the market for time stock 
was in disarray and the price of the shares was seesawing 
this was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned 
evaluation of future value and get a fair vote he said 
joffe contended times plans to merge with warner would give 
shareholders greater value in the long term than paramounts 200 a 
share offer 
the case was heard in delaware because all three companies 
like many of the biggest us corporations are incorporated 
there because so many major corporations subject to delaware laws 
the time case likely will have implications for other companies in 
the future 
the supreme court planned to issue a written decision at some 
point in the future 
the justices ruling was widely expected even before the hearing 
began as arguments proceeded and were televised live by cable 
news network times stock dropped on the new york stock exchange 
time stock closed down 1 at 13750 a share warner stock 
rose162 to 6612 a share and paramount rose 187 to 5937 
a share 
time stock which traded at 126 a share before the paramount 
bid rose to a high of 18275 before falling back in recent weeks 
as investors became increasingly pessimistic about the chances for 
paramounts success
