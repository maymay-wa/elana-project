libya has secretly started producing limited 
quantities of chemical weapons at a plant near tripoli and has 
conducted trial runs of its production equipment us officials 
said tuesday 
libya claims the facility manufactures pharmaceuticals not 
chemical weapons until now us officials said libya was on the 
verge of producing lethal gases but had not actually begun doing so 
they have conducted test runs and have some limited 
production said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a similar indication was given by state department spokesman 
charles redman who said that if foreign companies withheld further 
technical help from the libyan chemical weapons facility libya 
would find it difficult to begin full production and would not be 
able to sustain limited cw production he declined to elaborate 
abctv quoting unnamed intelligence sources reported tuesday 
night that libya has been moving material out of the plant in recent 
days perhaps to clear away evidence before an international 
inspection 
there was a spill of toxic chemicals at the plant during an 
operational test run last summer the washington post reported in 
wednesdays editions the newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying 
that few details were known about the spill 
the escalation of the us campaign against libya appears 
designed to bolster the american position at an upcoming 
international conference on chemical weapons scheduled to begin jan 
7 in paris the us delegation led by secretary of state george p 
shultz plans to press participants to withhold help from libya for 
the facility 
attention has been focused on the facility near rabtha about 50 
miles southwest of tripoli after president reagan told an 
interviewer last month that a military attack on the plant had been 
discussed and added thats a decision that has not been made 
yet 
a statement by the official jana news agency on tuesday accused 
the united states of lying about the plant as an excuse to attack 
libya and kill its leader col moammar gadhafi 
the movement of a us carrier group toward the mediterranean on 
tuesday in what the pentagon said was a normal rotation of forces 
prompted speculation in italy of an impending strike 
in los angeles bob hall an assistant white house press 
secretary accompanying president reagan on a california vacation 
declined comment on the reports other than to say we have nothing 
new on the subject 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman also declined to 
discuss the reports but denied that the carrier movement was tied to 
the situation in libya 
its a standard deployment howard said 
the united states said it has shown west germany italy japan 
and other allies convincing proof that the newly built facility is 
producing chemical weapons 
italian japanese and west german companies were involved in the 
construction of several plants in the complex housing the alleged 
chemical weapons facility 
japan has told the united states its companies were helping build 
a nearby metallurgical plant but us officials say that plant 
makes canisters big big metal canisters said one official 
what are they for for pills added the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity he indicated the canisters were intended for 
use in conjunction with the chemical weapons 
but a spokesman for the west german government said authorities 
there had no indication or evidence to verify the american 
suspicions that german companies were involved in the construction 
of a chemical weapons plant 
nonetheless west german officials announced they were examining 
the records of one chemical company doing business in the complex 
imhausenchemie 
we are confident that the west german government is taking the 
information we have provided very seriously and is investigating 
fully redman said 
the united states along with at least 20 other countries also 
produce chemical weapons but redman said that in libyas case it 
does happen to be in the hands of a particularly irresponsible 
government us officials are concerned libya make give the 
weapons to one of its surrogate terrorist groups 
the administration of presidentelect bush is expected to revive 
the moribund international talks in geneva on a global ban of 
chemical weapons use

a vietnam veteran whose plans for a 
vietnam war forest memorial were threatened by a bank foreclosure 
sale was bailed out by a flurry of lastminute donations tuesday 
his supporters said 
this has been a long long effort but we did reach our goal 
said terry thompson a vietnam veterans activist from dayton ohio 
who has led a nationwide fundraising campaign to help save the 
project 
the veterans national living memorial which geoffrey steiner has 
planted with more than 30000 trees since 1980 was scheduled for a 
foreclosure sale wednesday at 10 am the 100acre tract near 
cushing was being taken by the randall state bank which holds a 
mortgage on it 
steiner 39 who received national publicity for his efforts was 
slated to lose the property after failing to repay a loan from the 
bank he secured the loan 8000 loan with the property in 1984 to 
buy a car for his wife 
the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings last fall to recover 
5424 still outstanding and scheduled the foreclosure sale 
thompson said adolph coors co and minnesota coors distributors 
will pay about 80 percent of the nearly 6896 needed for steiners 
debts legal fees and taxes the golden colo brewer is a major 
supporter of veterans affairs and onethird of its employees are 
veterans she said 
the remainder of the money will come from smaller donors she 
said 
thompson says shes already talked with brigid fitzgerald an 
attorney was handling the foreclosure she said she and steiner will 
meet fitzgerald wednesday with the money and fitzgerald then will 
cancel the sale 
fitzgerald said earlier that steiner could stop the auction by 
paying his outstanding debt plus legal and advertising costs 
incurred by the bank 
thompson read about the foreclosure proceedings in november in a 
dayton newspaper and launched a fundraising campaign through her 
hometown chapter of vietnam veterans of america 
since arriving in little falls on monday night she has been on 
the phone with veterans groups across the nation seeking to raise 
the funds needed to redeem the property 
she said replies have been slow because chapters have had to 
convene their executive boards to approve donations but she said 
she is confident the money can be raised 
thompson said they planned to plant a tree wednesday for jason 
rother the minnesota marine who died after being left stranded in a 
california desert when his outfit pulled out during a training 
mission 
newsweek magazine cited steiner as one of 50 american heroes in 
july 1987 he has said his goal is to plant a tree for each of the 
approximately 58000 us soldiers killed in the vietnam war

cuban president fidel castro has pledged the 
us catholic conference he will free the remaining 225 prisoners 
the havana government has recognized as political the washington 
post said in its wednesday editions 
the group of prisoners include 44 the cuban government has 
previously described as too dangerous to release from jail the 
paper said citing an unidentified senior cuban official and western 
diplomats 
the catholic conference has been pressing since 1985 for the 
prisoners release the diplomats were quoted as saying 
of the 476 prisoners on the governments roster of those who have 
faced political charges about 225 remain in jail some 250 were 
released during 1988 
the political prisoners the government has acknowledged include 
those named in a list of about 450 presented to cuba in may 1988 by 
cardinal john oconnor of new york city according to the post 
during the summer castro said that everyone on that list would 
be freed except 44 whom he described as too dangerous the 
government has not admitted that anyone else among its approximately 
30000 prisoners is being held on political charges 
castro says now he will free the 44 prisoners he originally 
rejected on the condition they be granted visas to travel 
immediatly to the united states the post said a highranking 
communist party official confirmed 
among those to be liberated are the last four of 64 plantados 
prisoners who refused on principle to participate in rehabilitation 
programs or in some cases to wear jail uniforms the post said some 
have been jailed since the first years after the 1959 revolution 
however the post said it remained unclear whether all of the 
prisoners would be eligible to go to the united states at least 24 
released last year were denied visas because of criminal histories 
according to a list drawn up by elizardo sanchez head of the cuban 
commission for human rights and national reconciliation

more than a million cubans have fled the island since castro came 
to power in 1959 by overthrowing the rightist dictatorship of 
fulgencio batista but the traffic goes both ways many have 
returned and about 200 americans have even settled on the island 
a documentary about nine such americans was shown on television

a visitor has trouble sorting out the conflicting claims cubans 
make about their revolution 
according to government statistics enrollment in colleges and 
universities has increased ninefold since the year before the 
revolution

quoted in an interview with bohemia magazine as saying young 
people feel secure about their future they dont live in 
uncertainty as to whether they will be able to continue their 
studies or whether theyll be able to find a job afterward 
sometimes i wonder if it isnt all too easy 
there are however some clear signs of discontent a rock group 
caused a sensation recently with a song called el hombre esta 
loco the man is crazy 
when the group sang the song in midnovember at a local theater 
a crowd of thousands broke into a rhythmic chant repeating the 
title over and over 
witnesses said the crowd had discovered a clever way of venting 
anticastro feelings without leaving themselves open to charges of 
antigovernment activity 
government radio stations stopped playing the song but it can 
still be heard on radio marti the usfunded voice of america

castro shuns the notion of high salaries as an inducement for 
hard work but he has allowed an alternate form of material 
incentive in an effort to remedy cubas terrible housing shortage 
a cuban who is unhappy with his existing home can take a leave of 
absence from his job and volunteer for work on an apartment 
construction crew the worker is paid the same as on his normal job 
but hours usually are much longer up to 70 a week 
the payoff is that the worker after two years of arduous labor 
is entitled to move in to one of the apartments he worked on he 
uses about 10 per cent of his income for mortgage payments and the 
apartment is his after about 18 years

joel steinberg used to upset michele launders 
when he stared at her in court she said steinberg charged with 
fatally beating the daughter ms launders gave up for adoption 
frightened her 
now i just stare right back said ms launders and these 
days it is steinberg and his lawyers who are occasionally unnerved 
steinberg is charged with seconddegree murder firstdegree 
manslaughter and endangerment of a child in the death of 6yearold 
lisa steinberg the girl whom he illegally adopted in 1981 died of 
a brain injury three days after she was removed unconscious from 
steinbergs greenwich village apartment nov 2 1987 
lisas death in an upscale home steinberg was an attorney now 
disbarred and his companion hedda nussbaum was a childrens book 
editor shocked new yorkers and sparked investigations into how 
child abuse cases can slip through the cracks of welfare agencies 
and schools 
every day since steinbergs trial began nine weeks ago ms 
launders 27 has occupied a frontrow seat the trial on haitus 
for the holidays was being resumed today 
ms launders sits directly behind steinberg staring at his back 
and watching his constant notetaking and nervous movements 
the week before christmas she watched him hop out of the room on 
his right foot because he had sprained his left ankle in a touch 
football game at the rikers island jail she laughed aloud 
but more often ms launders cries which steinbergs attorneys 
fear may influence the jury on dec 12 defense lawyer ira london 
sought to have her removed from the front row because she was crying 
and holding hands with another woman state supreme court justice 
harold rothwax refused 
its not easy to hide my feelings but ive acted with 
restraint ms launders said outside the courtroom later as she 
crushed a cigarette butt the one time i was overwhelmed i left 
the courtroom 
ms launders met steinberg in a nassau county diner in april 
1981 through her physician michael bergman 
unwed pregnant and 19 ms launders paid steinberg 500 for what 
he called filing fees to arrange for her unborn childs adoption 
into a middleclass catholic family she says that when lisa was 
born may 14 1981 she had no idea steinberg planned to keep the 
baby himself 
another baby steinberg illegally adopted under similar 
circumstances from an unwed teenager was a 17monthold boy that 
police found tethered to a chair and wallowing in excrement the day 
police removed lisa from the apartment 
the boy whom the steinbergs named mitchell was returned to his 
biological mother nicole smigiel of massapequa park who took 
custody and changed his name to travis christian she has not 
attended the trial though her mother graceann has sat at miss 
launders side from time to time during the trial 
a middlelevel manager for an insurance company ms launders 
said in a recent interview that she has been unable to work since 
lisas death my mind isnt there yet she said i cant 
concentrate 
she said she visits lisas grave often sometimes with the girls 
father whom she refuses to identify 
although its wrenching to attend the trial every day she said 
she comes to court partly because of guilt and partly because she 
wants to know what happened but she also shows up because she wants 
to see steinberg convicted 
its killing me to do it but im not going to stop coming 
ms launders said im going to come here every day until justice 
is done that will be the day steinberg is convicted of murder and 
sentenced to life in prison for what he did to lisa 
ms launders also said she now feels that ms nussbaum the 
prosecutions chief witness deserves more blame than she has 
received she should be on trial said ms launders maybe not 
for murder but for other charges 
prosecutors dropped charges against ms nussbaum before the 
trial saying she had been so physically and mentally incapacitated 
by repeated beatings that she was not responsible for lisas death

the victims of agent orange finally will get 
their compensatory payments in 1989 more than a decade after 
vietnam veterans first sued the defoliants makers and 16 years 
after the us pullout from indochina the first payments are 
expected to go out in march or april 
more than 64000 applications have been mailed to veterans or 
their families and 2000 to 3000 additional veterans applied 
before the jan 1 deadline for cash benefits that will average about 
5700 
the money for veterans payments comes from a 170 million fund 
part of the settlement of a classaction lawsuit brought in 1978 
the total settlement was 180 million but the fund has grown to 
240 million with interest 
payments will be made to individuals to families and to social 
service agencies that help vietnam veterans said kenneth feinberg 
the courtappointed special master who helped settle the suit 
my feelings are ones of frustration and relief said 
feinberg frustration because it took so long and relief because 
those who are entitled to the money will finally get it 
the court has estimated that about 30000 veterans and 18000 
survivor families will be eligible for the special benefits early 
projections showed eligible veterans would receive an average total 
of about 5700 the most anyone can expect to receive is 12800 
even though it may not be enough money what it does is begin 
the healing process said frank mccarthy a veteran who was active 
in the litigation these children these families who have lost 
loved ones these totally disabled veterans are the bottom line and 
we have to help them now 
the federal lawsuit was brought in 1978 by veterans who claimed 
exposure to the chemical defoliant sprayed over southeast asia 
during the 1960s by the us military in an attempt to deprive 
communist troops of crops and cover caused cancer birth defects 
in their children and other illnesses 
the herbicide contains the highly toxic chemical dioxin 
in 1984 hours before the trial was to start the seven 
manufacturers of the chemical agreed to pay 180 million but denied 
liability for any injuries 
the money has been tied up since in legal challenges the us 
supreme court cleared the last obstacle in june and soon after 
us district judge jack b weinstein announced plans for dispersal 
of the money 
weinstein who presided over the case and continues to oversee 
the distribution split the settlement fund 
the first component sets aside 170 million for the agent orange 
veteran payment program which will provide cash benefits to 
veterans considered totally disabled under social security 
guidelines and to the families of veterans whose deaths were linked 
to agent orange 
an additional 52 million was earmarked for the agent orange 
class assistance program which will distribute grants to social 
service agencies that serve vietnam veterans and their families 
of the remaining money 5 million was distributed to australian 
and new zealand military personnel who were exposed to agent orange 
in vietnam and 13 million went for attorneys fees and other 
expenses 
the jan 1 deadline does not affect veterans who later become 
aware of an agent orangeconnected illness or succumb to such a 
disease those claims can be filed until dec 31 1994 
aetna life insurance co was appointed to process the claims and 
set up a separate unit in hartford conn to administer the payment 
program according to bill cotter a consultant for the company he 
said aetna already has received back 10000 filledout applications 
of the 64000 sent out a tollfree telephone number drew more than 
60000 calls he said 
we have had so many different types of calls the very angry 
veterans who are quite abusive on the phones the very courteous who 
are pleased with the information and the veterans who have broken 
down and sobbed he said 
the assistance program is headed by dennis rhoades a vietnam 
veteran who was director of the american legions national economic 
commission 
rhoades said he is reviewing about 140 proposals from agencies 
seeking grants from the 52 million fund he expects to authorize 
the first grants in three to six months

1988 of whom 2659 were girls and 2872 were boys in 1987 out 
of a total of 5477 boys were in a majority of 134 
james again led both the firstname and the allnames leagues

first time and charlotte 
in the allnames leagues henry supplanted christopher while

orthodox jewish leaders have 
reluctantly given the goahead for construction of a shopping center 
on a plot of land surrounded on three sides by a jewish cemetery a 
rabbi said monday 
the chicago rabbinical council decided that the fiveacre parcel 
owned by the jewish waldheim cemetery and leased to a developer is 
not consecrated land 
the rabbis were very unhappy about it and had we been asked 
in advance we certainly would have said no said rabbi paul s 
greenman a member and past president of the council but since 
its already in progress it can continue 
some people who have relatives buried in the cemetery in this 
suburb west of chicago had objected to the construction of a 
sportmart inc sporting goods outlet and three other stores on the 
land 
the des plaines cemetery corp which owns the land said the 
land was originally reserved for burials but many jewish families 
have moved from the area reducing the demand for burial plots 
larry hochberg president of sportmart inc said when the 
controversy surfaced in early december that he had consulted a rabbi 
before going ahead with construction plans he said the rabbi whom 
he would not identify had assured company officials that graves 
would not be harmed by the project 
greenman said the council agreed that the project scheduled for 
completion next summer will not disturb any graves it also will be 
separated from the cemetery by fencing and landscaping 
sportmart said in a statement sunday that it will spend 200000 
on drainage pipes to prevent flooding of nearby gravesites and has 
repaved 2000 feet of cemetery roads

the government says consumer prices rose 1722 
percent last year the highest singleyear mark in memory and one 
economic forecasting firm predicts they will rise at more than three 
times that rate this year 
economists say the rampant inflation is tied to a steep recession 
that weakened the economy following a growth rate of 85 percent in 
1986 and of 67 percent in 1987 economy minister carlos rivas said 
last week that early estimates indicate the economy shrank 84 
percent in 1988 
we are now paying the price for two years of growth 
president alan garcia said recently 
the crisis has been marked by shortages of basic foods such as 
milk sugar and bread and by increasing discontent among the 21 
million peruvians 
political analysts say the flagging economy together with a 
relentless insurgency by leftist guerrillas are undermining perus 
frail democracy 
rivas said a major cause of record inflation was government 
deficit spending to finance consumer subsidies 
the inflation figure of 1583 percent set in 1985 had been the 
highest since peru began keeping such records in 1920 
the national statistics institute in its report monday said 
consumer prices in december increased by 409 percent compared with 
the month previous 
garcia a centerleft populist took office in july 1985 and used 
perus dollar reserves to subsidize imports needed for perus 
economic recovery 
consumer prices surged early in 1988 after the reserves ran out 
and the government maintained its program of subsidies through heavy 
deficit spending said economists speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the respected economics analysis firm apoyo predicted inflation 
this year will hit at least 6000 percent

the energy department is proposing an 81 
billion 20year program to clean up and modernize the nations 
troubled nuclear weapons production complex 
the cost of modernization and environmental restoration will 
require a significant increase in funding for the next two 
decades said an energy department report for delivery to congress 
the 81 billion total includes 52 billion to modernize outdated 
facilities some of which are more than 30 years old while 29 
billion would go toward efforts to deal with radioactive and 
chemical contamination at many sites throughout the weapons complex 
the longrange plan would involve building new facilities in 
south carolina and idaho as well as phasing out weapons production 
activities in washington state colorado and ohio 
the energy department has refused to release any portions of the 
classified document known as the 2010 report because it looks 
ahead as far as the 2010 fiscal year 
gail bradshaw deputy chief spokesman for the department said 
this week the department could not release the reports unclassified 
executive summary until it had received permission to do so from the 
national security council 
a copy of the summary was obtained by morris news service and 
made available to the associated press 
energy secretary john s herrington said dec 22 the next 
administration faces hard choices in dealing with the problems 
of the nuclear weapons complex 
he told a national press club audience that cannibalization of 
some warheads to build or upgrade others is something we must look 
at to keep our options open but herrington added i do not 
anticipate the need to resort to such methods 
the possibility of cannibalizing warheads was raised after safety 
and equipment problems closed the nations three reactors for 
producing tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen because 
tritium decays at a rate of 55 percent a year it needs to be 
regularly replenished to keep warheads at peak explosive power 
herrington has said it will be spring or summer before any of the 
three reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken sc can be 
restarted 
the 2010 report raises questions about whether the savannah river 
reactors can be brought back to efficient production of tritium 
it noted that all three reactors are shut down for safety 
system improvements and are not expected to be fully operational 
until late 1989 despite these improvements and increasingly 
extensive maintenance the reactors may not be able to achieve 
acceptable production efficiencies 
other key findings of the report 
the nuclear weapons complex must be modernized so nuclear 
deterrence can continue to be a vital element of us security 
policy 
operations of the complex will require environmental safety and 
health remedial actions and a program to ensure that its operations 
comply with applicable laws standards and regulations 
much of the nuclear weapons complex was constructed more than 30 
years ago and many facilities are approaching the end of their 
useful lives 
full funding for the modernization and environmental cleanup 
effort will probably be difficult to achieve in view of competition 
with other programs 
the report said that while the budget for fiscal 1990 will be 
generally consistent with the plan accomplishing all 
recommendations on schedule probably will require more resources 
than are now expected to be available in subsequent years 
major environmental restoration will be required at the 
rocky flats plant near denver the hanford reservation near 
richland wash and the feed materials production center in 
fernald ohio when nuclear weapons activities there are either 
relocated or terminated 
as an interim measure certain upgrade steps will be required at 
the rocky flats plant to maintain operations at an acceptable 
level of risk while the relocated facilities are being constructed 
new production reactors are slated for the savannah river plant 
and the idaho national engineering laboratory doe has proposed 
building a heavy water reactor at savannah river and a gascooled 
reactor at the idaho facility 
both the administration and congress recognize the need for the 
modernization and cleanup program and expeditious 
implementation of the proposed plan is recommended the report 
summary said

year iv of perestroika gorbachevs driv to refashion soviet 
economy and society will bring the first national multicandidate 
elections in decades part of the his campaign for 
democratization and continued streamlining in the economy 
but at the dawn of the year as moscow shivered in subzero cold 
such common items as detergent bath soap chickens coffee 
toothpaste sugar yeast and candy were hard to find or completely 
absent from staterun stores 
on sunday the kremlin announced an export ban on goods ranging 
from caviar to childrens shoes an apparent attempt to hoard 
chronically scarce sovietmade products for soviet consumers 
in his televised new years eve message gorbachev told his 285 
million countrymen that improvements in their lives would be gradual 
at best in the coming months and that there would be no miracles 
it is wrong to think comrades that somebody will solve our 
problems for us and that everything around us will change at the 
wave of a magic wand with the chime of the clock on new years 
eve he said 
we see now that it is essential to act with greater 
resoluteness said gorbachev soviet leader since march 1985 we 
are not awaiting and we are not promising manna from heaven knowing 
well that the burden of unresolved issues is heavy and our road is 
difficult 
for some that message may have seemed distressingly like 
gorbachevs forecast at the beginning of 1988 when he said 
immense and hard work lay ahead in his drive for economic change 
the multibillionruble cost of rebuilding areas of northwestern 
armenia shattered by the dec 7 earthquake also will cause shortages 
in the economy for example in building materials prime minister 
nikolai i ryzhkov has said 
on jan 1 all 48000 staterun enterprises in the nation were 
put on a paytheirownway basis meaning they are deprived of 
government subsidies and forced to find ways to generate enough 
revenue to meet costs and payroll 
for soviet managers accustomed to topheavy centralized controls 
which severely limited their initiative but also freed them from 
many decisionmaking responsibilities selfaccounting is a 
mixed blessing 
they are free to negotiate contracts and pursue the 
onceforbidden goal of making a profit but also in theory may face 
bankruptcy if they fail 
the nations 130 million workers too can theoretically earn 
more if they produce more but run the risk of layoffs if their 
factory trims its labor force to cut costs 
according to radio moscow enterprises that account for 60 
percent of soviet industrial output have been on selfaccounting 
since january 1988 the jury is still out however on whether they 
have gained much freedom 
one soviet economist nikolai shmelov has said government 
bureaucrats still exercise effective control over some branches of 
the economy by issuing them 80 percent and more of their orders they 
must fill 
in march voters will be called to elect the members of a new 
council of peoples deputies that will choose their membership of 
their national parliament and name a head of state with increased 
powers 
the sole candidate for the new presidential post is widely 
expected to be the 57yearold gorbachev himself posing further 
questions about how democratic the kremlins democratization 
process can or will be 
at lower levels however voters will be able to choose from more 
than one candidate in contrast to past practice when electoral 
nominees were selected according to social status age and sex to 
fill quotas fixed in moscow 
1989 will also bring uncertainty in international relations as 
the kremlin seeks a working relationship with a new us president 
and decides whether to complete its nowfrozen military withdrawal 
from afghanistan in time to meet a unbrokered feb 15 deadline 
shortly before gorbachev went on tv with his new years message 
the official news agency tass transmitted new years greetings to 
englishlanguage subscribers along with the image of a snake a 
reminder that according to oriental astrology 1989 is the year of 
the snake 
some soviets in humor or in earnest note that past such years 
in the 12year oriental cycle have been the occasion of tragic or 
cataclysmic happenings in their homeland and predict an eventful 
1989 
in 1905 there was an abortive anticzarist revolution in 1917 
the bolshevik revolution brought the communists to power in 1929 
dictator josef v stalin began the bloody campaign to snuff out 
private farming 
in 1941 the nazis attacked the soviet union and in 1953 stalin 
died and was succeeded by nikita s khrushchev

the weather continues to be the biggest 
question mark for agriculture department economists trying to figure 
out where us farm production may be headed in 1989 
for example most analysts say the historical record shows little 
chance that the devastating drought of 1988 which shriveled crop 
production by 30 percent will repeat this year 
but the droughts effects are still apparent in much of the land 
where subsoil moisture has yet to recover and even longshot odds 
of the 1988 heat and drought repeating are causing usda economists a 
few nightmares 
the uncertainties are important as the economists look at all 
crop prospects but they are particularly vital for feed grains and 
how this years output might affect livestock producers 
dave hull of the departments economic research service says in 
the januaryfebruary issue of agricultural outlook magazine the 
acreage of corn and other feed grains is expected to increase in 
1989 because of a relaxation in the governments landidling 
requirements 
the program changes he said could add 8 million to 10 million 
acres to this years corn plantings in all the corn area for 
harvest next fall could be in the range of 67 million to 69 million 
acres compared with an estimated 567 million harvested in 1988 
last years corn production was 467 billion bushels down from 
706 billion in 1987 and 825 billion in 1986 yields averaged 823 
bushels per harvested acre compared with more than 119 bushels per 
acre in each of the two previous years 
many estimates of 1989 corn yields range from 110 to 115 
bushels per acre although these forecasts may be weighting the 1988 
disaster and potential weather problems a bit too heavily hull 
said if weather cooperates in 1989 yields of 120 bushels per 
acre are not out of the question considering longterm trend 
increases of more than 2 bushels per year 
if that happens he said farmers could harvest between 77 
billion and 83 billion bushels of corn next fall 
hull said that if 1989 corn production is at the low side of 
these projections farmers probably would see some decline in market 
prices in the 198990 season the agency currently projects corn 
prices will average 240 to 280 per bushel in the 198889 
marketing year that began last sept 1 
but if this years harvest is at the higher end of the projection 
range the price decline would be much sharper as us stockpiles 
once again start to rebuild hull said prices then could drop in 
198990 to near the governments price support loan rate of 165 
per bushel 
if yields return to normal 198990 production of barley oats 
and sorghum also is likely to rebound he said stocks of barley 
and oats would tend to build modestly if production returns to 
normal and prices probably will fall 
soghum output is likely to rebound this year if yields are 
normal although total use may continue to exceed production hull 
said prices will probably continue to be pegged to roughly 90 
percent of corn prices

the agriculture department says another major 
advance has been made in the long struggle against the boll weevil 
for generations a fabled devastator of cotton crops 
fred planer of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service says the latest campaign ended dec 3 after 35 
weeks of eradication efforts 
the cooperative project called the southeast boll weevil 
eradication program involved a total of 482000 acres in alabama 
florida georgia and south carolina federal and state agencies 
along with the growersupported boll weevil eradication foundation 
cooperated in the venture 
planer said usda and state surveys showed that 99 percent of the 
fields in the program sustained no weevil damage in 1988 
program activities include trapping surveys using traps baited 
with sex scents or pherromones to determine weevil numbers and 
distribution and field treatments with malathion an insecticide 
used commonly in mosquito control programs 
the real key to the success of this progrm is uniform 
participation of all cotton producers so that weevils cant run away 
from one farm and go to another planer said with uniform 
participation theres no place for the weevils to hide 
the southeast program began in september 1987 following the 
successful eradication of the boll weevil through a similar program 
in areas of virginia and the carolinas he said

handcuffed by public refusal to accept 
a speed limit on the autobahns west german lawmakers have issued a 
compromise order to curb rising accident rates it is now the law 
that drivers must be polite 
aggression in the form of dangerously high speeds and daredevil 
maneuvers accounted for many of the 400000 injurycausing accidents 
in west germany in 1988 according to police and automobile club 
statistics 
the revised rules that took effect sunday include a prohibition 
against blinking headlights to pressure slower drivers to move to 
the right as well as a finderskeepers policy on parking spaces 
which are at a premium in most cities 
a nation renowned for its fast cars and frustrated drivers west 
germany has more traffic volume than any nation in europe it also 
suffers the continents highest injuryaccident rate 
fatal accidents about 8000 last year have been considerably 
reduced in the past 10 years but the number of collisions rose by 
more than 10 percent in 1988 and moving violations were up by 28 
percent over 1987 
recent mild winters coupled with cheaper gas prices due to a 
strong west german mark have intensified the problem of too many 
cars traveling too fast on too few roads 
the problem is that drivers are becoming increasingly 
aggressive on the highways borrowing the idea from americans that 
time is money said andreas zimmermann regional traffic division 
chief for adac west germanys largest automobile club 
the new intelligent use of the streets legislation aims to 
diffuse some of the aggression by punishing drivers for infractions 
that until now have been considered impolite but not illegal 
the more than 100 minor revisions to the 1971 driving code are 
seen as a token of consolation for the outnumbered advocates of 
speed limits and environmental protection 
public opinion polls have shown the vast majority of west german 
drivers favor a retention of the status quo no speed limits at 
all they have rallied under the cry of free ways for free folks 
and through the powerful car industry and auto club lobbies fought 
off all attempts to cool their engines 
more than 1 million of the 28 million registered automobiles are 
capable of sustained speeds exceeding 125 mph according to the 
adac which is the worlds secondlargest auto club after the aaa in 
the united states 
some politicians of the opposition social democrat party and the 
environmentalist greens annually have put forward measures to 
establish a limit of 60 mph but have been defeated by the dominant 
christian democrats and members of their own parties concerned about 
voter reaction 
short of forcing drivers to slow down the new laws require them 
to cease the widespread practice of using headlights and blinkers to 
pressure slower cars into moving out of their way 
tailgating also has been outlawed as well as passing too closely 
a favorite punishment meted out by drivers miffed at having to 
change lanes to get by a slower car 
truck drivers hauling dangerous cargo must pull into the nearest 
parking turnout when visibility drops to less than 165 feet because 
of fog snow or rain 
vehicles long have been prohibited from passing on the right but 
the code revision makes the offense one that can damage a drivers 
record and eventually lead to license revocation 
many drivers argue that despite the law german practice on a 
threelane autobahn dictates that slower cars use the right lane 
fast cars the left and the middle lane is to remain open for passing 
from both sides 
some of the more controversial and lessenforceable rules govern 
parking including a requirement that the first car in a line of 
autos circling for a free space has claim to the next open spot 
even if the driver has already passed it by 
drivers are also required to activate their warning blinkers as 
soon as they see a traffic backup on an autobahn with the aim of 
preventing the kind of multiple smashups that often occur in the fog 
or when backups are obscured by a rise or turn in the road 
dieter schulte parliamentary secretary for the federal transport 
ministry and a member of chancellor helmut kohls christian democrat 
party said more than 230 million will be invested in improving 
signs and roads as part of the new legal changes 
not only will these changes reduce the hazards from backups and 
passing but they will also save energy and reduce environmental 
problems like noise and exhaust schulte said 
others argue however that drivers will begin to depend on the 
new signs to warn them of roadblocking hazards ahead and drive even 
faster when no warnings are visible 
with the best intentions the changes may have negative 
consequences for safety and the environment zimmerman conceded 
some of the new rules irreverently referred to as the polite 
driving act are virtually unenforceable such as requiring 
drivers to alert one another about hazards they themselves may not 
react to in time 
but the regulations are expected to deter some of the aggressive 
practices because violations will count against a drivers record 
west german drivers are not required to renew their licenses once 
they have passed initial tests and a twoyear probation period 
unless theyve accumulated a considerable series of citations in a 
short period 
the point system differentiates between character offenses and 
accidents ascribing a higher penalty for drunken driving than for 
killing a pedestrian in a crosswalk 
points also are recorded for offenses such as misuse of blinkers 
or following too closely previously punishable only by fines 
the success of the new system will depend heavily on the driving 
public which to date has shown little interest or understanding of 
the revisions 
drivers questioned at gas stations over the new years weekend 
expressed amusement over the effort to get them to mind their 
manners 
sure ill be polite promised one bmw driver who gave his 
name only as rudolf as long as the trucks and the timid stay out 
of the left lane

daniel ortega paused for a moment to 
ponder his major achievement as president then responded 
confidently resisting the war policies of the reagan 
administration aimed at destroying the revolution 
the cost has been social and economic in losses of lives and 
raw materials ortega said in an interview with the associated 
press but the reality is that the revolution is here 
ortega 43 heads the sandinista government brought to power in 
1979 by a revolution that ended four decades of dictatorial rule by 
the somoza dynasty 
president reagan charging the new government with fomenting 
revolution in the region began financing contra rebels in 1981 to 
oust the sandinistas and end what he said was a beachhead for 
communism 
with reagan leaving office soon and the contras reduced to what 
ortega calls delinquent bands ortega hopes to restore the 
dreams of a socialist society based on equality 
i have the hope that president bush will work on a constructive 
line ortega said he declined to elaborate on a proposal his 
government is preparing to deliver to bush 
ortega described the sandinista government as socialist with its 
ideal goal a classic communism in which there is an equal 
distribution of wealth 
this is a socialist revolution that is in a stage where a mixed 
economy and political pluralism are factors of the socialism that we 
have been constructing in nicaragua he said 
yes socialism is a step toward communism but to speak of 
communism i think that would be utopian right now ortega said 
to speak of socialism in which there is social and economic 
development and to have a society in which the distribution of 
wealth would be really equal and rational this is a proposal it is 
an objective 
private enterprise exists in nicaragua and the state does not 
hold a majority of the land 
the governments ideals have crumbled under the weight of an 
economy that has worsened yearly inflation ortega said stands at 
an inconceivable 21000 percent many nicaraguans are suffering from 
hunger for the first time meager wages fail to provide the basics 
and tens of thousands of nicaraguans have fled the country 
but he said the fact that the sandinistas will celebrate their 
10th anniversary in power in july means theres no doubt the 
revolutionary process is irreversible 
ortega himself has changed markedly in the past decade his 
railings against the united states and president reagan have taken 
on a softer more rational tone and he peppers them with facts and 
figures 
in the interview conducted saturday he did not employ the harsh 
rhetoric he has used in the past he simply said the 29000 dead in 
nicaragua would be comparable in the united states to losing the 
entire population of minnesota 
ortega rose to leader of the ninemember sandinista directorate 
following the 1984 elections in which he won the presidency he 
consolidated his control a year later when he became the head of the 
partys executive commission 
sandinista watchers frequently point to the differences between 
ortega seen as a pragmatist and the hardline tomas borge one of 
the founders of the party a directorate member and the current 
interior minister ortega seems to have won out 
ortega is a populist supported at times even when the sandinista 
party suffers criticism the press and a majority of citizens call 
him by his first name he frequently is seen in casual clothes a 
sport shirt and cotton jacket with jeans rather than his military 
uniform he drives himself around town in a jeep along with heavily 
armed security agents in identical jeeps 
ortega has altered his image as a tough guerrilla fighter jailed 
as a teenager to that of supporter of the arts poet and an opera 
buff 
the president speaks quietly and is seen as a good listener he 
frequently travels to the countryside to meet with peasants 
during a town halltype meeting a few months ago ortega was 
applauded when he called to task a factory manager after an employee 
complained he was patted on the back when he handed out christmas 
presents to deprived youths in the capital 
political opposition figures often call ortega a dictator 
supporters refer to him as el comandante 
ortega has said he hopes to repair relations with the united 
states but vows that his nations internal politics arent up for 
negotiation 
recently he fondly recalled meeting bush in brazil for the 1985 
presidential inauguration the two men shook hands and the guests 
packed into the brazilian congress cheered 
its a start ortega said

the reporters at the roosevelt bulletin 
know their readers almost all of them 
there are only 911 people in this tiny central new jersey town 
founded in 1936 as an experiment in socialism and named after fdr 
but there are a lot of people expecting babies said honey 
socholitzky 
at 78 mrs socholitzky is a copy editor at the monthly newspaper 
run by residents who volunteer to cover their school board their 
planning board and their neighbors 
the staff is serious about its work since the bulletins birth 
11 years ago it has grown from a mimeographed newsletter to a sharp 
tabloid of 24 or so pages neatly packaged with modern graphics 
its content also has evolved 
were a small town with some fairly large problems said 
editor mark zuckerman we have some big decisions that have to be 
made 
reporters still write stories about matters such as the geese 
camping out at the towns only gas station but they also pay close 
attention to issues facing the little town 
decisions must be made on how to pay for a revised sewer plan and 
school repairs the bulletin reports on the possibilities and the 
residents take to the opinion columns 
weve become a little more hardnewsy mrs socholitzky said 
recently there are a lot of problems in town in that some people 
want to see it grow and some dont 
there are about 600 acres of cityowned farmland in the path of 
developers and residents are debating whether to sell to help pay 
for some of the needed improvements 
some people think if we let in the developers we can double the 
population and bring in some money zuckerman said some people 
dont think thats such a great idea 
that keeps bob clark busy on his planning board beat 
ive always just had a desire to stay involved in the affairs 
of the community he said it gets to be a bit of a drain 
because you have to keep up with it going to meetings and so on 
but its worth it 
clark said his real job deputy director of the state 
division of investigation precludes him from political involvement 
but the bulletin provides an outlet 
occasionally someone will question the objectivity of a hard 
news story but i chalk that up to them not getting their favorite 
quote printed he said 
the newspaper is as unusual as the towns history roosevelt 
named after the president whose new deal financed its founding was 
established by immigrant jews who moved here from new york 
garment workers would make coats in the winter for sale in a 
cooperative factory and grow their own food in the summer the 
experiment in socialism failed after three years but the town 
remained 
like most of the newspaper staffers clark and mrs socholitzky 
dont have journalism backgrounds 
reporters write their stories and then have them edited in an 
office owned by zuckermans company zuckerman takes care of the 
graphics on a computer 
for mrs socholitzky editing is of paramount importance 
i took a twoyear hiatus once but i had to come back because i 
wasnt satisfied with the quality of the editing she said im 
a purist grammatically 
and shes picky 
mrs socholitzky once discovered a grammatical error on a list of 
ingredients of a baby food companys product 
i wrote to them and said i didnt want to raise a baby on a 
baby food with a split infinitive in it she said they wrote 
back and said they had already printed thousands of labels but 
would correct their error on the next printing and they did

outgoing us ambassador vernon a walters 
says un peacemaking successes last year ending wars in 
afghanistan the iraniraq war and angola are unprecedented in the 
annals of the world body 
these successes and warming ussoviet relations have made the 
united nations a better place for the united states to do 
business walters said in a farewell interview 
the former deputy head of the central intelligence agency said 
the us view of the world body once hostile and disdainful has 
changed to appreciation if properly handled walters said 
the un can be advantageous in promoting our goals of peace 
prosperity and freedom 
if it didnt exist it would have to be invented 
he spoke as the general assembly concluded its 43rd session a 
dazzling year of achievements 
it was the year of the nobel peace prize for un peacekeeping 
operations the farewell speech by president reagan the un debut 
of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and a move to geneva to 
hear plo chairman yasser arafat 
walters 71 who has served as us permanent representative here 
since 1985 described what he called an extraordinarily 
successful year 
we got agreements to end the afghan war the persian gulf war 
between iran and iraq and the war in angola there is nothing like 
it in the annals of the united nations said walters who is being 
succeeded by thomas pickering ambassador to israel 
and god willing walters said we will shut down the 
western sahara and cambodia wars very soon 
walters refused to disclose his next posting but diplomats 
speculated he might be assigned to a european capital 
last month angola cuba and south africa signed agreements 
providing for namibian independence from south africa and the 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola a un independence plan for 
namibia will be implemented next year and un peacekeepers and 
observers deployed 
walters also said he believed the united states will pay about 
400 million in arrears he has opposed us withholding of un 
dues to protest what washington considers un bias and inefficiency 
and has urged restoration of full funding 
the united nations is far more effective today than in the past 
and antius namecalling which flooded this forum several years 
ago is virtually nonexistent 
we no longer get the bloodsucking vampires of wall street 
draining the last drop from the toiling masses of the third world 
that stuff is gone walters said 
he attributed the change almost entirely to the new international 
environment and improved ussoviet relations 
in the old days if we said it was black the soviets said it 
was white he said thats no longer there and the possibility 
of playing off east against west has largely disappeared 
walters said he gave a great deal of the credit to mr 
gorbachev who had the courage to make very difficult decisions he 
clearly was the one who decided to change the style and content of 
foreign policy 
he added however that a lot of obstacles were created by the 
soviet union through its contrariness and desire to inflict its 
ideology on others 
in the last session walters said one of the most important 
achievements for the united states was the adoption of a budget that 
prohibits extravagant expenditure and lowers spending 
through us appeals to the un human rights commission he 
said cuban leader fidel castro released 700 prisoners he claimed 
he didnt have 
walters defended the evaluation of voting records to determine 
how often nations side with the united states 
by and large the nonaligned are aligned against us he said 
referring to the 102nation nonaligned movement today the 
nonaligned give me far more trouble than the soviet union and 
china 
he said a great deal of the nonaligned vote against the united 
states is for the sheer pleasure of it 
walters refused to cite nations saying not all nonaligned 
nations were antiamerican 
on usiranian relations walters said he saw no immediate 
prospect of better ties they are at a dead end right now because 
if they expect to get anything from us they have to release those 
hostages first 
he said his greatest satisfaction at the united nations was 
irans acceptance in july of security council resolution 598 which 
led to the aug 20 ceasefire in the iraniraq war and direct peace 
talks with iraq

police have said for years that more than 
1 million people line up along the 5mile route the tournament of 
roses parade takes annually but a more scientific count cuts the 
number in half 
the pasadena starnews used a formula devised by al hibbs a 
retired physicist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory to estimate 
the number of people attending mondays gala procession of 
flowercovered floats 
it was the first time in the 100yearold extravaganza that 
anyone estimated the crowd size by counting heads police and 
tournament of roses officials said neither group disputed its 
accuracy 
the tournament in the past has never really had a scientific 
way of doing it spokesman ken veronda said if the starnews 
can come up with a better way more power to them 
hibbs formula was based on the assumption that at least 18 
inches separate spectators and that at least 10 rows of spectators 
line the sidewalk multiplying the estimated number of one row by 10 
equaled 387200 adding the 125000 holding tickets to grandstand 
seats put the total at 512200 
that figure is probably high because people dont usually stand 
shoulder to shoulder hibbs said 
i packed em in like sardines hibbs said im giving every 
benefit of the doubt to the upper number 
the crowd estimate of 1 million appears to have started in a 
newspaper account of the 1928 parade that said warren r flynn a 
santa fe agent who is an expert at measuring a large assemblage 
placed the crowd at 968000 
skepticism about the parades 1 millionplus attendance figures 
arose when organizers of the doo dah parade an offbeat counterpart 
to the rose parade used head counts to discount official crowd 
estimates 
in 1987 police said 150000 people attended the parade down the 
same street the rose parade follows but an estimate made by 
counting heads in photographs revealed a total of 50000 said doo 
dah parade organizer peter apanel

the white house says representatives of the 
united states and the palestine liberation organization have 
discussed possible plo assistance in investigating the airliner 
bombing over scotland that took 270 lives 
president reagan says he would be happy to receive any 
information that plo chairman yasser arafat might offer to help 
solve the mystery of pan american flight 103 which crash dec 21 en 
route from london to new york 
arafat has condemned the bombing 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the united states stopped short of formally 
requesting plo assistance 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said monday 
that robert pelletreau the us ambassador to tunisia met on 
saturday at the us embassy in tunis with hakam balaoui the plo 
representative in tunis 
popadiuk said the meeting was requested by balaoui to introduce 
himself to pelletreau he said it was not a continuation of the 
contacts which the united states calls a dialogue which began with 
a meeting dec 16 between pelletreau and three members of the plo 
executive committee 
the discussion centered on middle east issues popadiuk said 
the ambassador took the opportunity to mention that the united 
states would welcome any information the plo is able to develop 
concerning the pan am tragedy 
this is in line with what we have already publicly stated and 
is true for the plo as well as anyone else who may have information 
on the bombing he said 
the administration official who spoke anonymously said this 
was not a request for assistance from the plo 
the official said balaoui took note of pelletreaus comments and 
told the ambassador he would relay them to arafat 
earlier monday reagan was asked about reports that arafat had 
offered his assistance in the investigation 
weve not heard from him the president we will be happy 
to hear from him if he has anything to tell us im sure hell tell 
us 
the exchange took place as reagan stepped off air force one at 
los angeles international airport after spending new years weekend 
in the palm springs area 
he and his wife nancy were then driven to the brick 
ranchstyle home in the expensive bel air section of los angeles 
where they will live after they leave the white house jan 20 
they are expected to remain behind the high walls of the estate 
until they return to washington thursday except for an appearance 
at a 1 million fundraising event wednesday night for the nancy 
reagan center for teenage drug addicts to be opened in a renovated 
hospital in nearby pomona

it was hard to tell the soviets from the americans 
without a scorecard this week as squabbling grew louder over 
spending huge amounts on a soviet space shuttle project while other 
needs go begging 
the communist party newspaper pravda said monday without giving 
details of the debate that some scientists involved in the project 
joined consumers upset by food and clothing shortages in questioning 
the value of the program 
in the years before scientists here revealed their own shuttle 
program they assailed the us project as too costly and of 
questionable use many soviet scientists said they could gain the 
same goals with more standard singleuse rockets 
pravda said in a fullpage article devoted to the development and 
testing of the soviet shuttle that a major rethinking and a fierce 
clash of ideas concepts and proposals are under way even within 
the space shuttle program 
the soviets successfully launched the space shuttle buran 
snowstorm on nov 15 on an unmanned 3hour 20minute test flight 
tons speed heights automation and etc wrote a rudenko 
a pravda reader from the moldavian capital of kishinev on buran 
but where are the expenditures the billions of rubles of the 
national means 
where is the mutual connection with the peoples wellbeing 
how many years has buran delayed fulfillment of the food program 
the output of good quality shoes clothes and the improvement of 
medical care for soviet citizens he asked 
pravda said that only a small part of the soviet shuttles 
program has been fulfilled and the buran has yet to prove that it 
can perform useful work in orbit 
the newspaper said that the reaction of soviet citizens to the 
1961 launch of cosmonaut yuri gagarin was much more positive than 
the reaction to the space shuttle program even though people were 
poorer then 
it said the hopes for a better life that people lost during years 
of corrupt government and a stagnant economy were to blame 
the techonological advancements of the shuttle program eventually 
will work their way into everyday life however pravda said 
it lamented we have one pole of exclusively high technology 
buran and a pole of failures of technological quagmires the 
agroindustrial complex household goods shoes clothes 
pravda said ways must be found to connect the two poles

he says he is a hardworking chef chasing the 
american dream but the us government contends carmine esposito is 
the al capone of italy a ruthless mob boss linked to a dozen 
killings 
esposito 31 facing a jan 13 deportation hearing is fighting a 
return to italy that he says would mean certain death at the hands 
of mobsters or corrupt law enforcement officials 
would the al capone of italy come to chicago and work like a 
dog would he leave behind his protection and his money he 
demanded in a recent interview from the federal metropolitan 
correctional center where he has been held in solitary confinement 
for 21 months 
would the al capone of italy get up at 4 am each day to go 
buy meat to make sausage alone to deliver it at night not have 
enough time in a day to even wash yourself 
but the us government has concluded that esposito is the man 
named in an extradition request from italian authorities 
the document charges that esposito ordered or committed 12 
killings in italy from april 1982 through june 1983 while holding a 
top post in the nuova camorra organizzata a criminal clan similar 
to the mafia that operates in and around naples near espositos 
hometown of acerra italy 
esposito is big fish said italian judge vicenzo scolastico 
who was involved in the investigation of the organization 
as a member of the camorras policymaking council of nine 
esposito had people strangled some had to dig their own graves 
before they were shot bodies were mutilated or disappeared 
he is one of the last great nuova camorra figures still at 
large and if he ever decided to talk he could cast light on many 
unsolved crimes scolastico added in an interview with the chicago 
tribune 
esposito was arrested in march 1987 as he and several employees 
finished lunch at bravissimo the modestly successful restaurant he 
and his wife opened in may 1986 he also worked as a chef there and 
earlier had worked as an auto body repairman car salesman and 
sausagemaker 
he entered the united states in 1984 had no trouble with the law 
and appeared to have been what he claimed a contented 
hardworking immigrant whose sweat earned him a growing business and 
a home in the suburbs he earned enough money to send his children 
to parochial schools 
but all that changed with espositos arrest a lengthy court 
fight drained his resources and forced his family onto publicaid 
rolls he also said his prison confinement has worsened a heart 
condition 
the authorities make him out to be a oneman crime wave said 
espositos attorney philip parenti and for all that there is 
not one eyewitness one photograph one fingerprint 
there is not one piece of corroborating evidence except for 
the pentiti 
pentiti which literally means penitent but has taken on 
the more pedestrian definition informant 
assistant us attorney thomas scorza argued that even though 
some informants criminal histories might raise questions those 
matters are best addressed in italian courts the us government 
does not have to prove espositos innocence or guilt scorza said 
besides he said the witnesses almost always are 
informants in gangster cases and in this instance the people 
pointing at him are saying i did it with him 
theyre not doing it to save their necks theyre confessing to 
the crimes as well 
esposito admits to having known camorra members while working at 
his fathers auto body shop in acerra to fixing their getaway cars 
and on at least one occasion to sawing off the barrels of shotguns 
his refusal to join the camorra he said resulted in harassment 
by italian police and later in his decision to pack up his family 
and run he left acerra and spent the next three years in several 
italian cities caserta then rome and milan before heading for 
the united states 
in italy the camorra have so much influence with the 
government and with police there is no way to be safe he said 
always i think if only i am successful to reach the united 
states it will be different 
now he concluded i am not so sure

part of the tail section of pan am 
flight 103 and other wreckage has been found in remote moorland 15 
miles east of this scottish town and canadian experts have joined 
the crash investigation 
the discoveries of wreckage made monday near the village of 
langholm and other finds made in previous days meant searchers had 
located just 20 percent of the aircraft which was destroyed by a 
bomb 
the area is very rough terrain and there has been no 
confirmation yet from the accident investigators about what parts of 
the aircraft are there other than the tail part local police 
superintendent angus kennedy said 
all 259 people aboard the new yorkbound flight died when a bomb 
smuggled onto the boeing 747 blew it apart over lockerbie on dec 
21 authorities have found three of the 11 people presumed to have 
died on the ground 
kennedy said no bodies were recovered monday but that the body 
of passenger ingrid smith of britain was among 13 identified that 
day her husband capt bruce smith a pan am pilot accused local 
police during the weekend of being paralyzed by inexperience and 
incompetence and of delaying the return of victims bodies to 
their relatives 
area police chief john boyd said he sympathized with bereaved 
relatives but every effort was being made to positively 
identify the victims and return them to their families he said 
monday that 81 of the 242 recovered bodies have been released 
the trauma and grief experienced by relatives continues to be 
uppermost in our minds 
pan ams senior representative at the crash site robert gould 
vice president for operations said the police had been thoroughly 
professional 
members of the royal canadian mounted police which investigated 
the suspicious 1985 crash of an airindia jumbo jet joined the 
investigation monday said superintendent pat cummings of ottawa 
an indian government inquiry concluded that the crash off 
ireland in which 329 people died was caused by a bomb probably 
placed on board in canada where the flight originated a similar 
inquiry by canadian aviation authorities reached no firm conclusion 
but suggested that evidence points to a bomb 
the flight 103 investigation is focused on the lockerbie crash 
site frankfurt airport and londons heathrow airport the flight 
originated on a boeing 727 in frankfurt and following a stop in 
heathrow left for new york on the jumbo jet 
us officials say no group has offered a credible claim of 
responsibility for the attack speculation on suspects has focused 
mostly on palestinian extremists opposed to palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafats middle east peace initiative 
fbi director william sessions said sunday that he welcomed any 
information arafat could provide in identifying suspects 
the london weekly newspaper the sunday express reported without 
attribution sunday that arafat had vowed to dispatch an 
assassination squad to hunt down and kill the bomber 
les jardine spokesman for the regional council that governs 
lockerbie said council officials would meet soon with residents of 
the village to discuss plans to rebuild what was destroyed by 
falling wreckage and burning fuel 
ten houses were destroyed a crater 100 feet long by 30 feet deep 
where they once stood and another 30 homes were badly damaged

findlay college president kenneth zirkle 
spends his days at school and his nights at prison but hes no 
criminal 
zirkle teaches an introduction to business course to 24 inmates 
at the allen county correctional institution 
he helped set up classes at the western ohio prison and at the 
nearby lima correctional institution to give inmates an opportunity 
to earn a college degree while on the inside 
i have been involved in higher education for a long time but 
this is one of the most exciting ventures that i have ever been 
in zirkle said 
i think that pragmatically many of them see this as looking 
good on a resume as they go before a parole board seeking to be 
released from prison he said 
secondly and which i think is more pervasive is the fact that 
most of these people really are committed to trying to better 
themselves he said most of the time if you talk to them they 
can tell you why they are there and they can tell you what led to 
it they are very fearful of going back 
the classes were established 4 years ago at the maximumsecurity 
prisons 
we went in with certain stipulations obviously that we would 
not be offering all programs for example it does not make a lot of 
sense to offer teachers education there because when the person is 
no longer incarcerated it is almost impossible to get a job in 
public education with a prison record 
so what we tried to do is offer those areas of our program that 
would have the most interest with the inmates and from a very 
pragmatic society standpoint would enable these people to come out 
and be productively employed he said 
zirkle and his staff put together a curriculum that offers 
associate degrees in business areas like accounting and computer 
science and in the humanities 
we have a pretty broad spectrum of programs that are offered 
when we started we thought we would have 40 or 50 students involved 
and the next thing we know we have 200 involved in a fulltime 
basis he said 
inmates have to take 12 hours of courses about 35 professors 
have volunteered to help he said 
there are no parttime students they either take fulltime or 
we are not involved with them he said 
helping inmates redirect their lives was not a new for zirkle he 
put three exprisoners in highlevel jobs while he was coordinator 
of residence halls at penn state university in the early 1970s 
most inmates are good students who have never been given the 
chance he said their drive and willingness to learn is impressive 
he said and learning they can succeed in college gives them the 
confidence and hope that they can turn their lives around

authorities charged a 22yearold ferry 
captain with negligent homicide after the boat overcrowded with new 
years travelers sank off the caribbean coast sixtyseven people 
drowned and 14 were missing 
officials said 46 people survived the sinking of the ferry justo 
rufino barrios ii in amatique bay on guatemalas east coast sunday 
juan pablo ezquibel was arrested after authorities determined 
that about 120 people were aboard the 30ton ferry which was 
authorized to carry 90 said capt anibal giron arreola 
secondincommand at the puerto barrios naval base 
he said by telephone that the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 
16mile run across the bay from livingston to puerto barrios and 
sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port 
officials had yet to determine the exact cause of the sinking 
but giron arreola said the ferry captain was slow to respond to 
requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of 
the ferrys wheel once it was under tow he said the patrol boat 
captain believed the ferrys rudder was unmanned while under tow 
esquibel radioed that he had taken the wheel just as the boat 
began to capsize giron arreola said 
giron arreola also said that passengers ran to one side of the 
ferry while it was under tow just before the ferry sank 
it appears the boat rode a wave and that as it was leaning the 
people ran to one side out of fear he said although seas were 
only 1to1 feet passengers were not used to traveling by sea he 
said 
no americans were on board he said 
a morgue official said 13 bodies were identified 
navy patrol boats fishing vessels and other private craft 
searched for the missing monday

in making their wedding plans rhonda 
hufford and todd kellermann chose musicians pink dresses and gray 
tuxedos and they were tested for aids under a yearold law some 
officials say isnt worth the cost 
the nations only premarital aids testing law may not be a law 
much longer primarily because like the kellermanns the 
overwhelming majority of those tested have shown no signs of the 
aids virus 
illinois mandatory testing program took effect jan 1 1988 but 
only 23 of the 150000 people tested in the first 11 months were 
found to be infected with the virus the state department of public 
health said 
thats about one in 6500 tested 
the cost of the aids test in illinois including the doctors 
visit ranges from 25 to 125 per person said state health 
department spokesman tom schafer based on a conservative 35 
per test average the cost of finding each of the 23 infected people 
came to more than 228000 he said 
still to receive a marriage license for their june wedding 
kellermann and ms hufford a nursing student had to show the macon 
county clerks office a certificate verifying they had been tested 
im easygoing about it said kellerman a 22yearold 
springfield computer analyst as long as they make it a law 
theres not much you can do about it 
but the law has resulted in a 25 percent drop in the number of 
marriage license applications in illinois state public health 
director bernard turnock said hundreds of illinois couples have 
gone to bordering states to tie the knot 
they dont want to take the aids test said janet hudacek of 
the lake county ind clerks office which has seen a sixfold 
increase in the number of illinois residents seeking marriage 
licenses mostly its the cost 
to the north in kenosha county wis officials are selling more 
marriage licenses to illinoisans than to wisconsin residents 
through dec 8 they said 1073 illinois couples got married in 
kenosha county 51 percent of all licenses issued the previous 
year 58 illinois couples were married there of 1021 licenses 
issued said michelle riley a clerk in the county offices 
because the number of people with aids infections detected 
through premarital testing is so low and the cost so high turnock 
plans to recommend to republican gov james r thompson that the law 
be scrapped democratic state rep grace mary stern who was 
rebuffed this spring in efforts to dump the testing law has filed 
legislation for this session to end the testing 
but republican rep penny pullen said repealing the law would 
send a message that illinois no longer sees aids as a serious 
problem 
this program is giving thousands of illinois couples the good 
news that they are not infected she said in this society with 
its current mores that can be very good news indeed and yet its 
very unlikely that couples would demand the test of each other if 
the state did not demand it 
illinois is the only state with a premarital aids testing law 
louisiana repealed its version of the law last year 
i think other states are still looking at doing it but i doubt 
they will because theyre finding really its not very cost 
effective said tracey hooker a staff associate at the national 
conference of state legislatures in denver 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys 
defenses against disease leaving a person prey to lifethreatening 
infections and certain cancers 
the aids virus is believed to be passed mainly through sexual 
intercourse shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to 
their infants before or during birth

maids who turned the money in hotel officials said 
cathy dean and paula vaughan found the money in a shoe box 
saturday while cleaning a suite at the residence inn 
as a child i went to church every sunday said ms vaughan

you you turn it in 
it makes you feel good like the glow you get after you give 
birth to a baby she said 
ms dean 36 said she was shocked at finding the money 
i about passed out she said i held onto it real tight as 
we took it back to the front desk

cash

either said detective sgt harold moore 
its the ladys money as far as we know moore said monday 
she could have sold a house and been taking the money to a bank 
laura butkovic another hotel manager said the guest did not 
offer the maids a reward when she returned in fact she appeared so 
relieved about recovering the money she apparently forgot to thank 
them she said 
but the hotel will not forget the act of honesty ms catalina

reward

a woman and her three children suffocated 
in the back of a pickup truck as the family was driving home from 
mexico unaware carbon monoxide fumes were seeping into the camper 
shell officials said 
the children ages 36 and their mother were found unconscious 
monday at the calexico port of entry when her husband pulled up to 
the border station following a three to fourhour wait said police 
sgt bill matus 
the discovery prompted officials to check other cars and two 
children were found unconscious in the back of another pickup truck 
they were taken to a hospital where they remained today for 
observation 
us customs service officials identified the dead as micaela 
iniguez aguilar 26 and her children horacio aguilar 6 francisco 
javiar aguilar 4 and camilio aguilar 3 
the father horacio aguilar 36 was unhurt and was unaware the 
fumes were seeping into the truck matus said 
inspectors and paramedics tried to revive the four but they were 
pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital here 
the pickup truck had a faulty exhaust system and the bed had 
holes in it allowing carbon monoxide to seep into the back said 
john miller a customs service spokesman 
he said the family all mexican nationals were returning home to 
the san joaquin valley town of laton after a holiday visit to 
mexicali 
holiday traffic caused a massive backup at the border station 
about 100 miles east of san diego matus estimated traffic was 
delayed three to four hours and that could have contributed to 
the whole thing 
miller declined comment on the delays except to say that all 
eight lanes at the border station were open 
matus said that when the family encountered the backup the 
mother moved from the cab to the back to check on the children 
shortly after the first discovery mexican border agents went car 
by car to warn motorists in line about carbon monoxide dangers 
they discovered angelica ortega 11 and armando ortega 12 of 
niland calif unconscious in the back of another pickup also 
covered the children were revived and taken to a hospital customs 
spokeswoman bobbie cassidy said

now that presidentelect bush has nearly filled 
his cabinet his next major challenge is to fashion a legislative 
package that he can push through a democraticcontrolled congress 
the problem of the nations budget deficit looms as the 
overriding test for bush but his aides also are looking to move 
legislation on issues that bush stressed during his campaign 
including childcare education the environment and ethics 
the bush team has said the budget deficit will take priority and 
much of his legislative program will depend on the fiscal package he 
is able to work out with congress 
wed have to have the framework first for dealing with the 
budget said craig fuller the bush transition codirector 
but he said bush will still pursue commitments he made during his 
campaign that would mean legislative proposals in such areas as 
environment childcare and education 
in the area of government ethics where president reagan vetoed a 
package from capitol hill last fall bush said recently that he will 
send an ethics bill to congress very very early 
in his proposals on lobbying by government officials after 
theyve left office bush applies the same standards to congress as 
to executive branch workers said boyden gray who will serve as 
bushs white house legal counsel 
as his budget team toils over the the fiscal framework they will 
take into congressional negotiations small groups of aides are 
working on that and other building blocks of the bush agenda 
research teams headed by jim pinkerton head of policy 
development for bushs transition operation have gathered data from 
cabinet departments including synopses of measures pending in 
congress and issues seen as key in the new congressional session 
much of the serious policy analysis on the bush legislative 
package is expected to occur early in january said robert teeter 
codirector of bushs transition team 
the early proposals are expected to center on a domestic agenda 
stressing the kinder gentler approach to government that bush 
discussed during the campaign 
spending proposals such as his plan to expand medicaid coverage 
ultimately will hinge on how the budget negotiations turn out for 
instance bushs commitment to the tough antidrug stance he took 
during the campaign could be tested in talks on financing the 
massive new antidrug legislation congress passed this fall 
the bill calls for 27 billion in new spending but congress 
initially appropriated only 976 million 
but other items such as the ethics package dont have a 
significant pricetag 
one idea is to stress presidential leadership on projects that 
dont involve large sums of money such as an international 
conference bush has proposed to deal with the problem of global 
warming of the atmosphere from carbon dioxide 
bush wants a revised cleanair bill and said in the campaign the 
nation must have a clear commitment to emissions reductions on a 
clear timetable 
he said he will work with congress on the exact amounts and 
exact methodology to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulpher dioxide 
emissions 
on one of the acidrain sticking points bush proposes burden 
sharing of the costs among ratepayers nationwide rather than just in 
the polluting regions 
the clean air act has been up for renewal every year this decade 
but congress has been unable to agree on the provision dealing with 
acid rain 
there will be a long negotiation on acid rain and clean air 
authorization predicted bush adviser bob grady 
environmentalists also are waiting to see how the bush team 
handles some of the regulatory aspects of environmental protection 
and cleanup a subject on which the reagan administration was 
heavily criticized 
another controversial topic is offshore oil drilling congress 
in an ad hoc approach has tacked on a drilling prohibition for the 
california coast for example when passing appropriations for the 
interior department each year 
bush a former oilman has shied away from blanket bans saying 
he will look at the drilling situation on a tractbytract basis 
bush also emphasized education issues during the campaign his 
proposals include a 500 million merit schools program 50 million 
for magnet schools and 50 million for programs in teaching reform 
and innovation 
he also promised to push for a big increase in head start 
funding to extend it to all eligible 4yearolds 
bush during the campaign pledged a childcare plan to include a 
government refund for childcare expenses for the poor with a 1000 
tax credit per child under age 4 
differences between bushs childcare plan and versions offered by 
congress are expected to spark a battle the new president also will 
send congress his plan for yes or youth entering service to 
america it calls for 100 million to match private sector grants 
for young people to volunteer in community service programs

a streamlined christian science monitor with color 
photographs fewer pages and less advertising was redesigned to save 
time for readers of the 80yearold newspaper its editors say 
concern over the new appearance which started with todays 
editions and other changes prompted an exodus in november of top 
management at the churchrun daily newspaper including the 
departure of pulitzer prizewinning editor katherine fanning 
but the changes in the 80yearold newspaper which has lost 
money for years were based on five years of reader research news 
executives said monday 
readers told us that because of the demands on their time they 
want greater selectivity in topics covered by the monitor more 
concise articles and a design and layout that helps them absorb the 
papers editorial content john h hoagland jr manager of the 
christian science publishing society said monday in a statement 
in short they continue to look to the monitor for the context 
and perspective of events and want a serious paper that can be read 
thoroughly in about 30 minutes 
the weekday newspaper with a circulation of about 170000 is 
still tabloid shaped but it will be 20 pages smaller by about 
eight pages than its previous format this was accomplished by 
keeping national advertising to two pages and eliminating local and 
classified ads 
in addition the newspapers staff of 160 is among the 800 
members of the publishing society and broadcasting operation due for 
cutbacks of 20 percent to 25 percent said spokesman don feldheim

us war veterans seeking the release of 
colleagues they claim are being held in laos said today that they 
are offering anticommunist laotian insurgents 5000 to destroy a 
government building 
the veterans have formed a war council and are offering the 
money for the first significant government building the insurgents 
destroy group spokesman ted sampley said 
we believe the only way the truth and any living american 
prisoner of war will ever be liberated from laos is if the pathet 
lao communist party are driven from laos he said were going 
to encourage the insurgents to take on the pathet lao any way they 
can 
sampley who spoke in a telephone interview from the united 
states is chairman of the national steering committee for vietnam 
war veterans the private lobbying group has accused the us 
government of failing to secure the release of americans held from 
the indochina war which ended with communist victories in cambodia 
laos and vietnam in 1975 
the laotian government has repeatedly denied holding any 
americans from the war and has reacted angrily to private 
initiatives 
the us government also has criticized these private 
initiatives preferring official contacts with the laotian 
authorities whom it says have increased cooperation in recent 
months 
a total of 547 americans are officially listed as missing in 
action or mia in laos but us officials said all but one are 
presumed dead 
if the reagan administration will encourage private citizens to 
help the contras insurgents in nicaragua then by god we can help 
the laotians against the pathet lao communists said sampley a 
former green beret from kinston nc 
he said the 5000 had been donated by a private us citizen but 
would not identify the person 
insurgents based along the thai and chinese borders have fought 
the laotian government since the pathet lao seized power in december 
1975 but do not appear to pose a major security risk the us 
government says it gives no support to the insurgents 
in october sampley led a group of americans to thailand on the 
mekong river which separates thailand and laos they floated 
currency notes stamped with another reward offer 24 million to 
anyone who brings out a live prisoner 
two members of the group were detained by the laotians for 41 
days after they illegally crossed to the laotian side of the river 
last month us and laotian experts conducted their fourth joint 
excavation of a us warplane crash site in laos and found one set 
of human remains 
the mia issue was expected to be discussed during talks this week 
between laos deputy foreign minister soubanh srithirath and 
richard childress director of asian affairs at the us national 
security council 
childress was accompanied on the trip by ann mills griffiths the 
head of the national league of powmia families a private lobbying 
group 
the official laotian radio said soubanh and childress met in 
laos capital of vientiane on monday and were expected to meet again 
today 
the consultative meeting proceeded in a good and 
straightforward atmosphere said a text of mondays broadcast 
which was seen in bangkok today

have seen me in playboy and i dont know if that would color their 
thinking or if it would just make them uncomfortable to be in a 
courtroom with me or me uncomfortable to be in a courtroom with 
them brenda taylor said monday 
we have been talking to her representative said elizabeth 
norris communications director for playboy enterprises in chicago 
nothing has been settled 
earlier taylor had said she wasnt sure about taking the offer 
because of how it might affect her chances of getting a law job 
taylor 25 was dismissed in september from the broward county 
state attorneys office where she worked in the county court 
division she mostly handled drunken driving cases 
her firing came two weeks after she filed a discrimination 
complaint accusing her boss assistant state attorney john 
countryman of saying she looked like a bimbo and a 
manhunter because of the short skirts and tight dresses she wore 
in the courtroom 
chief assistant state attorney ralph ray jr cited shortcomings 
in her job performance as the reason for the dismissal 
since leaving the state attorneys office she has been working 
in private practice handling civil cases from donated office space

a retired black schoolteacher who helped 
resurrect this racially divided towns government has won 
reelection as mayor in keysvilles first locally supervised 
election since the depression 
mayor emma gresham 64 defeated 67yearold challenger joseph u 
cochran who is white by a vote of 12761 on monday as her 
allblack slate of city council candidates defeated cochrans slate 
of four whites and one black by similar margins 
i feel that god has blessed us again mrs gresham said 
this means we can continue for progress in keysville people can 
see the change they must have for me to get that many votes 
the east georgia town has about 230 registered voters and is 70 
percent black 
cochran said he wasnt surprised by the results in light of a 
ruling earlier monday by the burke county board of registrars 
rejecting challenges he had filed against 84 black voters 
cochran contended that the 84 voters including 35 who live in a 
newly annexed area did not live within town boundaries 
since the towns boundaries have not been established i cant 
see hardly how you can annex more property into it cochran said 
the washingtonbased public interest law firm that helped 
keysville organize and conduct the election christic institute 
south disputed cochrans contention that the town limits were in 
question 
the institutes attorney alan gregory said the annexation was 
cleared in advance by the us justice department and approved by 
the georgia secretary of states office 
in addition to the 35 voters living in the annexed area 
theyre challenging the same 49 people that were challenged in the 
last election he said those were nullified by the registrar at 
the end of the vote tallies there is no reason for those people to 
be challenged again 
sixtythree of the challenged voters cast ballots 
cochran said monday night he had not decided whether to appeal 
the registrars decision 
keysvilles government was revived in january 1988 when mrs 
gresham and council members won oneyear terms in a contested 
election 
mondays election was for 20month terms subsequent elections 
will be for fouryear terms under a new charter awaiting approval by 
the georgia legislature 
for reasons lost to time keysville deactivated its government in 
1933 in the 1980s black residents began a move to reactivate it in 
order to get municipal water sewers fire and police protection 
all of which the town lacked there were problems with defining the 
boundaries however as the original 1890 charter described the city 
limits as everything within a halfmile radius of a schoolhouse that 
was demolished around 1895 
white residents went to court to block the move to reactivate the 
government they denied they were worried about a possible black 
government saying they were concerned that installing basic 
municipal services would tax poor blacks out of their homes 
mrs gresham and a council were elected the first time in 1985 
but white residents contended in court that since the city limits 
were not specific the vote should be thrown out a state court 
agreed and issued an order forbidding the keysville officials from 
taking office 
opponents used the same argument to try to prevent elections last 
year but ultimately lost in federal court

a charity that counts nancy reagan among its 
supporters is being investigated because of a report that it misled 
donors and sometimes gave less than half its donations to aids 
research officials said 
it seems that their expenses were enormously high for the 
amount of money they were giving to the organizations they 
promised said lanie accles a spokeswoman for state attorney 
general robert abrams who has subpoenaed the creo societys records 
the investigation follows a dec 27 better business bureau 
report which found based on the organizations records that of 
13 events in 1987 and 1988 seven yielded less than 50 percent to 
charity the bureaus minimum acceptable standard 
the bureaus new york philanthropic advisory service which 
investigated creo for four months said creo had given it four sets 
of inconsistent financial statements 
creo founded in 1983 describes its mission as raising funds 
for charitable purposes notably for aidsrelated organizations 
in addition to mrs reagan supporters of the organization have 
included un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and king 
juan carlos of spain 
the organization whose name means i create in latin and i 
believe in spanish has sponsored several lavish highsociety 
benefits including a production of the musical hair at the 
united nations last may that was to raise 2 million for children 
affected by aids 
solicitations for the event were particularly unclear and 
potentially misleading the bureau said 
less than half that amount 829668 was raised about 1000 
under the cost of production according to creos records 
records indicated that 74000 went to aidsrelated charity but 
the organizations president marshall yeager acknowledged monday 
that that figure relied on pledges that have yet to be received 
the amount creo has given to charities from its events ranged 
from 6 percent of the 15000 raised at a film benefit last 
september to 83 percent from a december benefit that raised 
2425000 
yeager defended the various figures given by creo to the bureau 
the figures were different because they wanted things reported 
in a different way he said 
rhonda klein singer the bureaus executive vice president and 
general counsel said she believed creo should be forced to register 
with the state as a professional fundraising organization

rival shiite moslem militias blasted each 
other with grenades mortars and cannons in beiruts southern slums 
all night and police today said five combatants were killed and 
seven others wounded 
thousands of residents remained huddled in basements and bomb 
shelters as the fighting raged into a fourth day police said 
the sound of explosions reverberated across the lebanese capital 
as militiamen of the syrianbacked amal arabic for hope and the 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god battled under parachute 
flares 
iran had planned to send its deputy foreign minister mohammed 
javad larijani to beirut to try to attain a ceasefire according 
to radio stations in moslem west beirut but larijani flew to the 
soviet union today irans official islamic republic news agency 
reported 
it was not clear if the trip to moscow syrias main backer was 
connected to the fighting in lebanon syria is lebanons main power 
broker and its troops though in the vicinity of the fighting have 
stayed clear 
the new casualties brought the toll to 25 killed and 54 wounded 
in four days of fighting in the slums and on the northern fringe of 
israels selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
a police spokesman said the two militias fought from house to 
house in beiruts ghobeiri neighborhood after nightfall monday when 
hezbollah fighters wearing their trademark black headbands overran 
a police station 
the fighting in south beirut and south lebanon tapered into 
sniper fire at dawn said the spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing regulations 
its not a ceasefire theyre simply tired and need a rest 
the spokesman said they will be at it again 
six ceasefires called by syrian peacekeeping troops have failed 
to curb the hostilities 
in may syria sent 4500 toops into the slums a cluster of 
lowincome districts stretching over 16 square miles on beiruts 
southern flank 
the syrian intervention came after a threeweek bloodbath between 
amal and hezbollah in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1000 
wounded 
but both sides clashed again in november forty people were 
killed and 87 wounded in that round of street fighting in west and 
south beirut 
the syrians have 7500 troops in west beirut in addition to the 
contingent in the slums they also maintain about 25000 troops in 
northern and eastern lebanon under a 1976 mandate from the arab 
league to halt the moslemchristian civil war now in its 14th year

the 68yearold ambassador hotel a landmark 
where charlie chaplin once lived and where robert kennedy was 
assassinated checks out its last guest today and closes its doors 
employees and visitors walked the nearly empty lobby monday as 
christmas decorations were taken down people snapped pictures and 
swapped memories about the hotel which had once put up the likes of 
soviet premier nikita khrushchev and actress elizabeth taylor but 
which has lost money in recent years 
elvira bell a maid met such stars as miss taylor lena horne 
harry belafonte bing crosby and ray charles during her 31 years at 
the hotel she remembered how a party thrown by singer don ho left 
pineapple juice in the hallway 
in those days the music was so loud that it began to run you 
crazy said ms bell 60 wholl now try to collect unemployment 
payments now i miss it i have dropped tears when i see those 
singers on tv theyre getting so old and i wonder how about me 
the hotel which sits on 235 acres of expansive greenery on 
wilshire boulevard faces an uncertain future said spokeswoman 
margaret burk two companies are negotiating to buy it she said 
the ambassador dramatically came into the national limelight when 
sen robert kennedy was assassinated there on june 6 1968 he was 
shot to death as he made his way through the hotels kitchen toward 
a news conference moments after declaring victory in californias 
democratic presidential primary 
but the hotel had been a landmark for years before thanks in 
part to its famous cocoanut grove nightclub where such stars as 
sammy davis jr nat king cole and bob hope performed 
khrushchev slept at the hotel and newspaper tycoon william 
randolph hearst entertained there 
but despite its history the ambassador will not have a ceremony 
to mark its closing ms burk said management decided against a 
party because people have known for two years that the hotel would 
be closing 
duke russell 62 a bellhop at the hotel during the summer of his 
freshman year in high school came back for a last short visit with 
his wife 
i have a good feeling about this place said russell now 
retired in 1941 this was a rather exciting elegant plush 
place 
another visitor betty szeden who first set foot in the 
ambassador 30 years ago as a model in a fashion show came back 
monday with her husband to catch the bus to the rose parade 
it was sad and quiet last night she said but im glad to 
see it again

the group 
as part of planned political reforms the government of prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski has been working on a draft law to 
make it easier for individuals to form private associations

in more than one unfriendly ballpark dodger 
manager tommy lasorda has probably been called chopped liver 
but fried mozzarella or escarole and beans or littleneck clams 
in a garlic pesto sauce over linguine try shouting that last one 
with a mouthful of peanuts 
lasorda has been called all of these and more not from the 
stands but on the menus of various southern california eateries 
that have honored him and other celebrities by naming foods after 
them 
while restaurateurs find the rotund manager of los angeles world 
series champion baseball team one of their favorite people to name a 
food after a number of other notables have also been bestowed such 
honors 
for example 
the ronald reagan is a baked ham and swiss cheese tripledecker 
sandwich at the legends of hollywood delicatessen a liverwurst and 
bologna tripledecker at the stage and a roast beef ham and 
american cheese hero at the substation 
the arnold schwarzenegger is a tripledecked turkey liver and 
salami sandwich at legends of hollywood a no 518 muscle sandwich 
with avocados vegetables cheese and mushrooms on whole wheat at 
larry parkers beverley hills 24hour diner and an omelet filled 
with swiss cheese and chopped tomatoes at the ocean park omelette 
parlor in santa monica 
having a meal named after them doesnt seem to be too hard to 
swallow for some celebrities 
just ask dick clark whos a sandwich piled high with turkey at 
the stage 
turkey is good for you what can i say clark said im 
honored to be in the presence of the tommy lasorda chopped liver 
but im a little disappointed they gave the peanut butter and jelly

six weeks before the promised soviet 
withdrawal of all troops from afghanistan members of the kabul 
government have moved dependents to new homes near the soviet 
border western diplomats said today 
the diplomats also said the countrys ruling peoples democratic 
party is changing its name and that of its newspaper in an effort to 
broaden its appeal and remove references to the bloody 1978 
revolution it rode to power 
the moves coincide with the exodus of soviet civilian advisers 
from the afghan capital and warnings from foreign embassies that 
their nationals leave the country unless they have essential 
business the diplomats said 
under unmediated accords half of the roughly 100000 soviet 
troops that had been in afghanistan fighting moslem guerrillas left 
the country by aug 15 and the balance are to be out by feb 15 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan to prop up the government 
in 1979 
in the western part of the country the soviet pullout has begun 
from shindad and herat said the islamabadbased diplomats who 
spoke on condition of anonymity they quoted afghan officials as 
saying the the main military withdrawal will begin jan 15 
the diplomats said senior members of the peoples democratic party 
of afghanistan have been allocated apartments in mazaresharief 
165 miles northeast of kabul most of them have sent their 
dependents and household goods to town near the soviet border 
the special guard which protects party and government officials 
has increased to at least 4000 members and is expected to rise to 
20000 to withstand guerrilla attacks when the soviets leave the 
diplomats said 
special aeroflot flights have taken soviet advisers from the 
capital and the soviet embassy has been reduced to about 100 
workers the diplomats said 
the ruling party will change its name to the liberal democratic 
and national party and adopt free market policies along the lines 
of western social democratic parties said one western diplomat 
citing afghan sources 
the name of the party newspaper has been changed from truth of 
the april revolution to the more moderate message diplomats said 
the symbolism of junking the name of the april 1978 
revolution is probably only the first in a series of steps 
designated to paper over the image of the party as a revolutionary 
communist party another diplomat said 
a ceasefire president najib offered on new years day has been 
ignored by guerrillas and by government troops 
staterun radio said 82 people including 79 guerrillas were 
killed and 40 wounded in fighting sunday and monday it said the 
three others were civilians there was no independent confirmation 
western diplomats reported that 132 people were killed in heavy 
bombing by the soviet and afghan air force just north of kabul on 
dec 26 and dec 27 
the diplomats estimated that 100 guerrillas 20 civilians and 12 
government troops were killed in the bombing 
anticommunist guerrillas also have renewed attacks on other 
governmentheld cities tass today reported that security forces 
uncovered a guerrilla storehouse in the capital with 84 rockets 
grenades and more than 300 rifles

a nasa research plane took off for the arctic 
today on the first flight of a sixweek search for signs that the 
earth is losing its protective ozone layer over the region 
the highaltitude er2 airplane departed from sola air base at 
the west coast city of stavanger where the project is based to 
analyze the atmospheric layer 12 miles above the planets surface 
many of the 150 americans and europeans in the 10 million 
project are veterans of a 1987 expedition that documented an ozone 
hole over antarctica 
for several years experts have warned that manmade chemicals 
especially chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigerators aerosol cans 
cleaning processes and in making plastic foam were destroying the 
ozone layer 
ozone protects the earth from the suns harmful ultraviolet rays 
and studies have shown that a decline in the ozone can lead to 
increases in skin cancer and eye damage 
scientists at sola say the arctic hole appears to be smaller than 
the one over antarctica but could be more dangerous because it is 
closer to where more people live 
last march an international group reported evidence that ozone 
also is being lost in other places especially in northern latitudes 
where europe and north america have high populations 
the idea here is to look at what happens not only in the 
vortex but what consequences it could have for the ozone at lower 
latitudes ivar isaksen a university of oslo professor said 
before the project began 
the vortex is a swirl of westerly winds over the arctic the 
project sponsored by the us national aeronautics and space 
administration is also aimed at exploring stratospheric clouds that 
form near the vortex and find out what role they play in ozone loss 
the er2 a modern version of the u2 spy plane will be 
supplemented by a modified dc8 flying at lower altitudes the 
planes carrying a variety of measuring instruments will fly 10 to 
12 missions in the area between northern norway greenland and the 
north pole 
weather balloons will also be sent up and scientists working in 
a hangar at the norwegian air base will compile and analyze the data 
through a computer network 
the scientists may release preliminary findings when the project 
ends in midfebruary but complete results will not be available 
until after several months of study and discussion said dr adrian 
tuck a project chemist and meteorologist

an increase in singlefamily home building and 
government projects pushed construction spending up by 08 percent 
in november the third consecutive monthly gain the government said 
today 
building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4111 billion in november following a 02 percent rise in october 
and a 09 percent jump in september 
even with the gains construction activity as a whole was up only 
a lackluster 1 percent for the first 11 months of 1988 compared 
with the same period of 1987 the figures are not adjusted for 
inflation 
rising interest rates have dampened activity in most sectors 
fixedrate home mortgages averaged 1077 percent during the last 
week of 1988 the highest in 13 months 
apartment and office building construction in particular have 
been sluggish held back by high vacancy rates in many parts of the 
country especially the southwest 
in november residential construction rose 07 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 2004 billion reflecting a 23 percent gain in 
singlefamily home building apartment construction dropped 19 
percent 
nonresidential construction dropped 08 percent in october 
falling to an annual rate of 923 billion declines in office 
building and in commercial projects such as shopping centers more 
than wiped out gains in hotel and motel construction and in 
industrial buildings 
hotel and motel building was up 66 percent and factory 
construction rose 13 percent the industrial sector has been one of 
the strongest this year as manufacturers expand capacity to meet 
demand generated by a boom in export sales 
office construction posted a 25 percent decline in november 
while commercial projects dropped 22 percent 
government construction climbed 4 percent to an annual rate of 
81 billion reflecting increased spending for schools sewer 
systems and roads highway construction the largest government 
category rose 27 percent in november to an annual rate of 266 
billion

hotels their flight continued this morning after the plane was 
searched

30 minutes

caller told police in budapest on new years eve that sas would be 
the target of a bomb attempt

people that officials say may be members of a palestinian faction 
planning to hijack or blow up an asian airliner this month

be members of a palestine liberation organization faction led by abu 
musa who is supported by syria and libya estabillio said the names

chairman yasser arafats media adviser for the first highlevel 
contact between britain and the palestine liberation organization 
the united states last month lifted a 13year ban on the plo and 
agreed to initiate a dialogue with arafat after he explicitly 
recognized israel and renounced terrorism

leadership we must all now look to the new government of israel 
to make a matching response howe said we will certainly go on 
urging that message on the prime minister of israel mr yitzhak

secure existence and the right of the palestinian people to self 
determination 
howe said his talks with the kuwaiti leaders covered a lot of 
bilateral and regional issues 
we have of course discussed our cooperation on security 
matters he said

help us identify those responsible for the pan am bombing for 
there must be no safe haven for people responsible for such wicked 
actions howe said

a chemical weapons plant in libya howe dismissed as speculation

as far as the report of chemical warfare capabilities in libya 
is concerned we find any report of that kind very disturbing he 
added 
howe is on a sixnation tour that will also take him to saudi

the home of country music is singing the 
blues after the sale of its last locally owned music publising 
company to cbs records 
tree international publishing ranked as billboard magazines no 
1 country music publisher for the last 16 years is being sold to 
new yorkbased cbs for a reported 45 million to 50 million the 
tennessean reported today 
the company whose catalog of music copyrights includes more than 
35000 songs by such artists as willie nelson buck owens merle 
haggard harlan howard and roger miller was the last major 
publishing property in the city that had not been acquired by an 
outoftown conglomerate 
im saddened by the whole thing said roger sovine the 
nashville head of broadcast music inc and a former tree executive 
its the end of an era 
but company officials defended the sale as being good for the 
city 
nashville will be the headquarters for all cbs publishing 
said tree international owner buddy killen this is great for 
nashville 
were going to quadruple the size of tree very quickly 
killen 52 said he will be president of cbstree publishing 
tree vice president donna hilley will be chief operating officer 
country music foundation executive director bill ivey said the 
sale was sad but its also a final step in a trend that has been 
going on for decades 
in the 1980s such companies as acuffrose cedarwood house of 
gold and combine music also went to outoftown conglomerates 
this is the loss of what has historically been nashvilles area 
of financial control were substituting control in new york or los 
angeles and its not a fair trade in any sense ivey said 
he described the new character of music row as colonial 
operations in every segment of the industry 
cbs records president tommy mottola called the sale a marriage 
of two highly compatible partners 
its fitting that country musics leading publisher be united 
under the same roof with the leading record company in the world 
he said 
but sovine said it will not be the same 
the big conglomerates cant work with songwriters in the same 
way that buddy did with tree he created a place for people to make 
music he was the best and i hate to see it go away

foreign minister moshe arens complained today 
that european countries are not consulting israel about middle east 
peace steps and said israel is ready to suffer isolation from the 
world for the sake of security 
in the the new foreign ministers first news conference with 
foreign correspondents arens said israel does not approve of the 
european communitys plan announced monday to start a middle east 
peace initiative by encouraging an international conference on the 
region 
i think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind of 
intitiative the members of the european community were to meet with 
us were to consult with us were to coordinate with us he said 
arens 63 a former ambassador to the united states also renewed 
israels criticism that the us decision to hold talks with the 
palestine liberation organization was damaging the fight against 
international terrorism 
arens became foreign minister with the formation of israels new 
government on dec 22 he is a member of the likud bloc of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir which has opposed an international middle 
east peace conference 
arens said his government does not welcome isolation but must 
think first of security 
we should not be expected to take any step that might decrease 
the sense of isolation if they are steps that would endanger the 
state of israel arens told the foreign press association 
meanwhile lova eliav a member of the centerleft labor party 
said today he and three other israeli parliament members will attend 
a european symposium this month on middle east peace alongside plo 
representatives despite israels ban on meetings with plo members 
we have to speak to the palestinians directly and reach peace 
with them through compromise eliav said the more we speak the 
better 
the conference titled a european initiative for peace in the 
middle east was initiated by several members of the european 
parliament it will be held in paris on jan 1213 
eliav said the other israeli lawmakers planning to attend are ora 
namir also of the labor party yair tsaban leader of the socialist 
mapam party and shulamit aloni head of the citizens rights 
movement 
the plo is banned in israel as a terrorist organization the 
citizens rights movement and mapam have called on the government to 
revoke its ban and public opinion polls indicate the majority of 
israelis support a policy change on this issue 
last month the united states launched a dialogue with the plo 
after chairman yasser arafat recognized israel and renounced 
terrorism

35000 songs by such artists as willie nelson buck owens merle

outoftown conglomerate 
im saddened by the whole thing said roger sovine the

its the end of an era 
but company officials defended the sale as being good for the 
city 
nashville will be the headquarters for all cbs publishing

nashville 
were going to quadruple the size of tree very quickly 
killen 52 said he will be president of cbstree publishing 
tree vice president donna hilley will be chief operating officer 
country music foundation executive director bill ivey said the 
sale was sad but its also a final step in a trend that has been 
going on for decades 
in the 1980s such companies as acuffrose cedarwood house of 
gold and combine music also went to outoftown conglomerates 
this is the loss of what has historically been nashvilles area 
of financial control were substituting control in new york or los 
angeles and its not a fair trade in any sense ivey said 
he described the new character of music row as colonial 
operations in every segment of the industry 
cbs records president tommy mottola called the sale a marriage 
of two highly compatible partners 
its fitting that country musics leading publisher be united 
under the same roof with the leading record company in the world 
he said 
but sovine said it will not be the same 
the big conglomerates cant work with songwriters in the same 
way that buddy did with tree he created a place for people to make 
music he was the best and i hate to see it go away

bodies from the murky waters of guanabara bay raising to 53 the 
number of confirmed deaths in the new years eve sinking of a 
sightseeing boat 
one of the bodies found today was identified as that of paolo 
mantegazza of turin italy according to valmir rabelo of the fire 
departments maritime group he had been reported missing by the 
italian consulate in rio 
the other body a woman was not identified immediately 
police have said they would seek homicide charges against two 
cruise officials and two port guards in connection with the sinking 
authorities said monday they were investigating allegations that the 
guards were paid to let the boat sail overloaded into choppy waters 
it was still not clear how many passengers were missing because 
cruise operators said the passenger list went down with the 100foot 
flatbottomed craft estimates of those on board ranged from 130 to 
150 but it was not known how many were rescued by nearby boats 
tables chairs and a broken wooden staircase on the sunken boat 
blocked an underwater search monday said col jefferson cardoso de 
bem who heads the fire departments maritime group 
the doubledecked bateau mouche was carrying revelers who paid 
220 a ticket to dance drink and watch fireworks off copacabana 
beach when it sank saturday night in about 65 feet of water at the 
mouth of guanabara bay near rios sugar loaf mountain 
the navy released a statement monday that conflicted with reports 
of witnesses who said the boat was overloaded and lacked enough life 
jackets 
the statement said navy inspectors checked the craft on 
wednesday finding satisfactory safety and navigational 
conditions and a number of lifejackets above what was 
necessary 
the navy statement also confirmed survivors reports that the 
boat was inspected again two hours before it capsized it said 
there were 149 people aboard within a permitted capacity of 
153 
precinct police chief irineu barroso who is in charge of the 
case said he would seek homicide charges against the owner of 
itatiaia turismo the tourist agency that booked the trip the owner 
of the sol e mar restaurant that operated the boat and two port 
authority guards who stopped the boat saturday then allowed it to 
continue its trip 
barroso said he would also seek charges of corruption and 
accepting bribes against the guards there have been no arrests in 
the case 
after taking statements from survivors we can see something 
was not right barroso said i believe someone will go to jail 
for this 
the navy said it would investigate rumors of bribes or 
negligence regarding the patrol boat guards who inspected the boat 
tv globo the countrys largest commercial network said monday 
there were reports of up to 30 more victims trapped inside the 
wreckage 
we could find more bodies caught inside the boat de bem 
said but its hard to tell no one has an accurate idea how many 
survivors there are and our divers are having problems searching 
the boat and the visibility is very bad

steve burleson president of asheville christian cable network 
said he didnt carry the program and hasnt decided whether to 
televise it 
im all for presenting the gospel of jesus christ but im

the government will open the archives of 
the ottoman empire to clear up charges that 15 million armenians 
were massacred by ottoman turks during world war i according to a 
report published tuesday 
foreign minister mesut yilmaz told the istanbul daily milliyet 
the archives were not in organized form and at least 10 years were 
needed to put the documents in order 
but we will release to the scholars the documents related to 
the armenian incident in four months yilmaz said 
in the summer of 1915 a crumbling ottoman empire regarded 
armenians as a dangerous foreign element with friends and cousins 
among the russian enemy the ottomans accused the armenians living 
in eastern turkey of helping the invading russians during world war 
i and ordered the whole armenian population deported to syria 
armenians were rounded up their homes destroyed and their 
property seized hundreds of thousands died from beatings 
starvation and exposure during the trip 
turkish officials have disputed the 15 million figure saying 
there were only 14 million armenians living in turkey at the turn 
of the century they say 300000 armenians were killed in the 
turmoil of deportations and local reprisals historians have 
estimated 600000 dead 
both sides claim to have documents proving their version of the 
events and brand as forgeries documents that support the other 
sides claim 
a group of prominent turkish historians interviewed by the 
semiofficial anatolia news agency on tuesday welcomed the news that 
the ottoman archives would be opened up soon for scholarly research 
they said however that the move should have been made earlier 
if the ottoman archives had been made public earlier the 
armenian issue would not have become so gangrenous by now said 
attila ilhan a poet who has also written historical novels 
armenian underground organizations killed 30 turkish officials 
and their dependents abroad from 197384 in revenge for the alleged 
massacre of armenians

family members who serve as judge 
prosecutor and defense attorney in dyer county juvenile court say 
they work hard at avoiding conflicts of interest 
it looks like a kangaroo court said james o lanier the 
public defender 
his brother david w lanier is the juvenile court judge the 
public defenders son james e lanier is a prosecutor 
judge lanier requires all attorneys defendants and parents to 
sign a waiver before he hears a case in which his brother or nephew 
are attorneys the waiver acknowledges that everyone is aware of the 
relationships 
so far no one has refused to sign 
but the judge who has been on the bench in this western 
tennessee community since 1982 said he does not believe his nephew 
should prosecute cases in his courtroom 
i dont think there will be any conflict of interest but its 
not good practice for the three of us to all be in the courtroom 
he said 
but james e lanier said he sees no conflict none of us are in 
collusion with each other he said 
state attorney general charles w burson has issued a legal 
opinion requested by james o lanier saying the arrangement violates 
no state law 
gil campbell executive director of the tennessee bar 
association declined to comment 
other tennessee officials said it is common for parties in legal 
proceedings to be related but not to the extent of the laniers 
james o lanier the public defender also has asked the state 
board of professional responsibility for an ethics opinion on the 
matter the board is made up of nine private attorneys appointed by 
the state supreme court to supervise the legal profession 
james o lanier and his son practiced law together for seven 
years before the younger lanier became assistant district attorney 
general in october

the government will more than double 
its police force to prevent violence during februarys parliamentary 
elections a police official said tuesday 
the government will recruit 38000 extra police officers 
increasing the size of the force to 64000 before the elections 
said the police official who requested anonymity 
the need to increase the police force is apparently due to 
soldiers being withdrawn to their barracks by jan 15 
new president ranasinghe premadasa has said he wont extend 
emergency laws beyond that date the laws gave powers to the 
military to detain militants from sinhalese and tamil communities 
who have vowed to disrupt the elections 
national elections were called for feb 15 by former president 
junius r jayewardene who left office on tuesday after 11 years in 
power voters will elect 225 parliament members to sixyear terms 
sinhalese militants are waging an antigovernment campaign to 
protest a july 1987 peace plan offered to tamil rebels fighting for 
a separate homeland in northeast sri lanka the mostly hindu tamils 
form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people but are a majority 
in the northeast 
at least 8500 people have been killed since tamil rebels 
launched their campaign for a separate state in 1983 the sinhalese 
antigovernment campaing has claimed at least another 1000 victims 
in the latest violence monday at least five people including a 
ruling party candidate for next months elections were shot and 
killed police said

the concise oxford dictionary has offered a 
compromise in its longrunning quarrel with jewish groups over its 
inclusion of the word jew as a racial slur 
the jewish campaigners say they welcome the change but believe 
its not enough 
the disputed entry defines jew as 1 person of hebrew 
descent person whose religion is judaism 2 derog colloq r 
person who drives hard bargains usurer 
and as a verb derog colloq r cheat bargain with 
person to lower his price 
derog colloq r stands for derogatory colloquial 
racially offensive 
according to a letter from sj tulloch senior assistant editor 
of the dictionary to the council of christians and jews the next 
edition will add the stereotype which is now deeply offensive 
arose from historical associations of jews as moneylenders in 
medieval england 
the aim mrs tulloch wrote is to put things into context 
but council director canon jim richardson said he wished the 
dictionary simply would drop all the pejorative definitions 
mrs tulloch wrote that dictionaries had to record not to pass 
judgment and that jew pejoratively is still current both as a 
noun and as a verb 
richardson an anglican clergyman whose organization fosters 
christianjewish understanding disagreed she said it was in 
common practice we actually doubt that and ask is it really in 
use couldnt it be left out 
the jewish community is very sensitive about the definition of 
jew in the oxford dictionary he said in an interview the 
definition of jew as a usurer as a person who strikes a hard 
bargain promotes an antijewish attitude 
he said the lexicographers latest step was very much a move in 
the right direction but we wont be satisfied until it the 
definition is scrapped because it is dangerous 
mrs tulloch wrote the meaning of jew that you mention is 
certainly offensive but that is not grounds for omitting it from 
the dictionary nor does our inclusion of it imply that we condone 
its use in this sense instead it should be carefully labeled so 
that the reader understands the context in which it exists 
shimon cohen a spokesman for lord jakobovitz the chief rabbi of 
britain said he was somewhat pleased with the proposed change 
but also wanted the pejorative definitions removed altogether 
other british dictionaries also include pejorative definitions of 
jew chambers 20th century dictionary published in scotland 
defines the word as usurer miser the longman dictionary of the 
english language attributes its origin to the alleged sharpness of 
jews in business dealings 
chambers longman and oxford also list the meanings of kike 
sheeny wog nigger and chink with notations that 
they are offensive slang 
in the united states websters new world dictionary has restored 
obscene words and racial slurs after prolonged banishment 
david b guralnik editorinchief until his recent retirement 
expunged the words in the 1970s in a practice mocked by some british 
lexicographers as guralnikism but restored them in the latest 
edition published in september 
the verb to jew is defined in websters as to swindle 
cheat gyp with the warning this is a vulgar and offensive 
usage even when not consciously expressing an antisemitic 
attitude 
times have changed said the present editor in chief 
victoria neufeldt there is far more acceptance in print of all 
the vulgar terms and what david guralnik called the true obscenities 
ethnic slurs 
in a telephone interview from her cleveland office she said she 
did not think dictionary inclusion of such words encouraged their 
usage 
putting aint in the dictionary hasnt made aint more 
acceptable dictionaries dont have that power she said 
in 1973 marcus shloimovitz an english jewish textile merchant 
took the oxford dictionary to court to force it to stop defining a 
jew as a grasping or extortionate moneylender or usurer 
he argued that the jewish race includes sages scholars 
judges scientists and people from the arts and stage they have 
done great service for their countries they are not cheats or 
unscrupulous usurers 
shloimovitz lost because he failed to prove the dictionary 
entries caused him personal suffering but the lexicographers 
subsequently toned down the disputed definitions

us troops will remain in south korea 
as long as the threat from north korea remains and as long as south 
koreans desire their presence outgoing us ambassador james r 
lilley said tuesday 
a majority of the people in south korea believes the us 
military presence is still necessary to ensure the security of 
korea lilley said in departing seoul pointing to polls showing 
that 60 percent wanted the troops to stay 
about 42000 american troops are stationed here under a mutual 
defense pact 
echoing north koreas calls some radicals in south korea have 
demanded the us troops pull out saying they obstruct 
reunification 
in view of north koreas military presence and its invasion in 
1950 that started the threeyear korean war the diplomat said it 
is essential that we stay strong wellprepared and welltrained 
he said the annual ussouth korean military exercises are 
necessary for bilateral security 
north korea last week called for an end to the exercise in a 
meeting with south korean lawmakers in panmunjom to try to arrange 
parliamentary talks to improve relations north korea said an end to 
the exercise was a precondition to progress in such talks 
lilley also said washington fully supports south korean 
president roh taewoos proposals to promote dialogue and reduce 
tensions with north korea and develop better relations with 
socialist countries 
citing south koreas economic growth lilley said the united 
sates will continue to seek a fair chance for us firms to 
compete in the korean market while calling on seoul to further 
liberalize its economy including its import and capital markets 
south korea posted a trade surplus of about 10 billion with the 
united states last year 
he cautioned that there will be problems ahead and we will not 
always agree on how best to solve them nevertheless i am confident 
of the future there is an underlying mutuality of interests which 
characterizes the uskorea economic relationship

from a nanking university of the four one has been arrested and 
three detained for questioning 
a third racially related incident continued in hangzhou where 56 
african students have been boycotting classes for a week because 
they allege chinese authorities say they all have aids

banners in chinese and english hooligans go home and we 
demand a safe campus said two banners in chinese a banner in 
english said no offend womens rights 
chinese students said the last boycott involved about 2000 
students final exams are saturday so classes are important 
students said they wanted their school to fix locks on dormitory 
doors provide better lighting and upgrade security they said they 
wanted foreign students to respect chinese customs 
chinese students also put up wall posters criticizing the 
leadership of the student union at the institute which they said 
organized the action but did not participate because it was afraid 
we dont need this kind of leadership said one of the 
posters about the schoolappointed group student union get the 
hell out of china 
a wall poster titled whither respect was posted at beijing 
university chinas most prestigious college 
the languages institute school is forever forgiving such 
incidents the poster said we want to know why chinese women 
have to continually suffer such treatment 
another poster told the story of the racially related incident in 
nanking 
according to chinese and foreign students the problem at the 
beijing languages institute occurred at 430 am sunday when a 
chinese student went to the bathroom and was accosted by an african 
student in her third floor dormitory hall 
they said the african sneaked into the womans room while she was 
in the bathroom and attempted to grab her when she returned 
she screamed and ran down the stairs on the second floor she 
slipped on some broken glass and severely cut her leg chinese 
students said 
i saw him run after her said one of the students roommates 
who was awakened by her classmates cries she was yelling save 
me save me 
she said her roommate could not speak to a reporter because all 
she can do is cry 
african students at the languages institute said they did not 
know exactly what happened sunday they said they believed chinese 
were using the incident as an excuse to oppose relationships between 
foreign men and chinese women 
relations between chinese and africans are tense chinese often 
are openly racist and africans are frustrated by a culture that is 
very different than their own the tensions become explosive when 
chinese women are involved 
cbinese students are also unhappy with the way the government and 
their schools are treating them and have jumped on the african issue 
as a pretext to vent complex feelings of discontent about their 
position in society 
last week thousands of chinese in nanking demonstrated against 
african students following a fight dec 24 over chinese women 
su xiaoxun an official at the jiangsu province foreign affairs 
office denied allegations by african student and diplomats that 
chinese forces attacked and tortured africans at a guest house

militia shocked his classmates on their genitals 
the 140 mostly african students had been forced to the guest 
house on dec 26 following the africanchinese clash and antiblack 
protests during which thousands of youths threw rocks at african 
dormitories and destroyed property there 
on monday a diplomat from ghana yn oheneakrasi said china 
had broken its promise not to move the students from the guest house 
until an african delegation returned to nanking 
on tuesday the chairman of the delegation the ambassador from 
the congo went to the foreign ministry but it refused to grant 
him any audience to discuss the situation in nanking he said

the 101st congress convened today with leaders 
of the democraticcontrolled chambers pledging cooperation with a 
george bush white house but with tensions already mounting within 
the capitol over a proposed hefty pay raise for lawmakers 
presidentelect bush acting in his role as vice president 
gaveled the senate into session and then immediately administered 
the oath of office to the new and reelected senators in groups of 
four 
the senate chamber was outfitted with new gold curtains behind 
the presiding officers chair and new carpet throughout there were 
new benches upholstered in bright scarlet for staff members its 
all for television said sen carl levin dmich showing off the 
accommodations to constituents 
the galleries were packed with spectators including lady byrd 
johnson widow of the late president and motherinlaw of virginias 
new democratic sen chuck robb 
in the house the chamber was packed by members their families 
and friends as texas democrat jim wright was reelected speaker in a 
partyline vote of 253170 with two members voting present over 
republican leader bob michel of illinois 
the speaker entered the chamber to a standing ovation before 
leading the mass swearingin ceremony 
democrats hold strong majorities in both chambers 5545 in the 
senate and 259174 in the house today there was talk of 
cooperation with bush from leaders of both parties 
by working together we can help our new president fulfill his 
promise of a kinder gentler america wright said in his 
statement accepting reelection 
were very optimistic that were going to be able to work with 
presidentelect bush and we can solve some of the problems said 
rep tony coelho dcalif house majority whip we need to have 
that cooperation wed like to resolve some problems and get rid 
of some of this confrontation 
i think at least at the outset the appropriate tone is one 
of cooperation and a spirit of bipartisanship and lets see how far 
we can go with that said rep dick cheney rwyo house minority 
whip 
moving to get a jump on other lawmakers rep tom tauke riowa 
announced a bill to force rollcall votes before congress accepts 
any pay increase and delay any approved raise two years until 
after the next election under current law congress automatically 
gets a boost proposed by the president unless it votes it down 
congressional pay adjustments have become a perpetual source of 
debate controversy and embarrassment tauke said 
president reagan is expected to call for a substantial pay raise 
next week for members of congress to take effect march 1 unless 
rejected before then by both houses an advisory commission has 
recommended a 50 percent boost for lawmakers federal judges and 
top executive branch officials with members of congress giving up 
lucrative honorariums in exchange 
current congressional pay is 89500 a year and the commissions 
proposal would raise it to 135000 
if the president goes ahead and proposes a pay raise were 
prepared to go ahead and eliminate the honorariums coelho said 
while the democraticcontrolled congress awaits reagans proposal 
on the pay issue on most of the nations biggest issues its 
waiting for the new presidentelect to make his positions known 
lawmakers from both parties reaffirmed today their hope that 
relations with the bush white house will be good 
but cheney and coelho interviewed on cbs this morning had 
differing views on possible tax increases 
none of us would like to increase taxes but were willing to 
listen and watch and we hope that as we get into this and we have 
to get to the crunch that if he bush cant reach the magic number 
without raising revenue that he would say so and we would go ahead 
and do it coelho said 
i think the american people voted overwhelmingly in opposition 
to a tax increase and i dont believe that he should be giving away 
or making a concession on that point before we even sit down at the 
table to negotiate said cheney 
new and reelected members of the house and senate were being 
sworn in today and then the two chambers scheduled organizational 
chores for two days among them a joint session on wednesday to 
count the electoral votes for president 
after completing its organizational chores congress will adjourn 
until jan 20 although hearings could start before then on some of 
bushs legislative proposals 
president reagan sends his final budget to congress jan 9 and 
bush is expected to submit his own ideas after taking office before 
fiscal 1990 begins oct 1 congress and the new president must agree 
on how to cut more than 25 billion in spending or to raise taxes 
in order to meet the goals of the grammrudman budget balancing law 
awaiting bushs proposals before offering their own are house 
speaker jim wright dtexas and the senates new majority leader 
george mitchell of maine mitchell succeeds sen robert c byrd 
dwva who will also play a key fiscal role as he moves over to 
the chairmanship of the appropriations committee 
bush pledged repeatedly during the campaign he would not support 
any new taxes but many democrats are openly skeptical he can keep 
that promise 
among the doubters are the chairmen of the house and senate 
budget committees both new to those posts rep leon panetta 
dcalif and sen jim sasser dtenn sasser has publicly predicted 
that bush would be coming to congress within two years asking for a 
tax increase 
bob michel rill who returns as the house minority leader 
said he suspects some new taxes might have to be combined with 
spending cuts for the deficit goals to be achieved 
i suspect down the road a piece that may be part of the 
answer michel said in a television interview last weekend 
sen bob dole of kansas reelected senate republican leader 
said he hasnt seen any indications that bush is softening his 
antitax position but he warned demands on the federal till are 
increasing including tens of billions of dollars needed to bail out 
failing savings institutions and to reopen the nations nuclear 
weapons plants which have been plagued by safety problems

construction spending rose 08 percent in 
november reflecting an increase in work on homes and government 
projects that more than offset slower building of offices and 
shopping malls the commerce department reported tuesday 
novembers seasonally adjusted construction spending at an 
annual rate of 4111 billion marked the third consecutive monthly 
increase revised figures put spending at 4078 billion in october 
4069 billion in september and 4032 billion in august 
for the first 11 months of 1988 construction spending was up a 
lackluster 1 percent over the same period of 1987 that figure was 
not adjusted for increased construction costs which were up 15 
percent 
the november spending increase was largely driven by a increase 
in spending on housing construction which was up 07 percent to 
2004 billion the housing figure included a 23 percent rise in 
spending on singlefamily homes 
there was a 19 percent decrease in apartment construction 
economists said that reflected aftereffects of the 1986 federal tax 
overhaul which made such projects less attractive and high 
apartment vacancy rates particularly in the south 
until we see vacancy rates decline were not going to see a 
whole heck of a lot of construction in those markets said mark 
obrinsky of the us league of savings institutions 
rising mortgage interest rates likely will dampen growth in 
singlefamily housing in 1989 said john savacool an economist with 
the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm he said recent 
increases in singlefamily construction arent going to stick 
however obrinsky predicted another reasonably strong year for 
singlefamily homes though not equal to 1988 he said mortgage 
rates could drop in the second half of the year and take some 
sting out of expected increases early in the year 
spending on nonresidential construction was down a seasonally 
adjusted 08 percent in november to 923 billion including a 25 
percent drop in work on office buildings 
there was a 13 percent increase in spending on factories and 
other industrial projects and savacool said that was a result of 
continued strong export markets while companies first increase 
production by investing in new equipment eventually you have to 
build some new structures to put additional equipment in he said 
its finally starting to show up 
the weakness in office construction meanwhile reflects high 
vacancy rates obrinsky said 
the same has been true for shopping centers and malls he 
said they seem to have been a bit overbuilt 
hotel and motel construction was up 66 percent for the month and 
other commercial projects such as shopping malls were down 22 
percent 
spending on construction of government projects was up 4 percent 
in november to 81 billion including a 27 percent increase in the 
largest category of highways also up was spending on construction 
on schools and sewer systems

a man stole an unoccupied transit authority 
bus today and drove it through three counties as police gave chase 
and at least 14 people were injured authorities said 
the halfhour chase ended when the southeastern pennsylvania 
transportation authority bus crashed into a tree in front of a shop 
middletown police chief frank mckenna said middletown officer 
leroy alexander 39 was injured when he was struck by the bus as 
police vainly tried to halt it by setting up a roadblock of squad 
cars midway through the chase 
details were still sketchy but at least 12 people were reported 
injured in a pileup related to the chase authorities said 
the driver who was not immediately identified was also injured 
authorities said 
transportation authority spokesman james whitaker said the bus 
was stolen from a depot in philadelphia shortly before 7 am he 
apparently drove it to a number of locations before the chase 
began whitaker said 
authorities began the pursuit in middletown township in bucks 
county north of the city when the bus was spotted on a road that 
has no transit route mckenna said 
state police sgt hal lacey said the bus eventually came south on 
a state highway with at least one state police car and four local 
police cars in pursuit when the bus became bogged down in traffic 
police cars pulled in front to try to end the chase he said 
when the traffic cleared the bus rammed two police cars and hit 
the police officer before leaving the scene the bus went through a 
portion of philadelphia into lower moreland township in montgomery 
county where it finally stopped after ramming a tree 
elle rudolph a spokeswoman for st mary hospital in langhorne 
said alexander was in guarded condition with multiple injuries 
edward ennis a police dispatcher in lower moreland township 
said several people suffered serious injuries in a traffic accident 
that was caused by the pursuit 
between five and 12 cars ran into each other at an intersection a 
couple of blocks from the place where the bus finally came to rest 
either because they had been hit by the bus or because they were 
trying to avoid it authorities said 
a dispatcher who declined to give her name said 10 injured people 
were taken to holy redeemer hospital and medical center two were 
taken to abington memorial hospital and one was flown by helicopter 
to hahnemann university hospital 
abington spokeswoman linda miller said one of the two injured 
persons at that hospital was the 35yearold man who had driven the 
bus the mans name and condition were not immediately released 
ennis said the chase ended when the bus hit a tree in front of 
the huntingdon valley cheese shop in lower moreland township 
northwest of the city the chase caused pretty bad traffic 
tieups in the area ennis said

foreign minister moshe arens complained tuesday 
that european nations were making middle east peace moves without 
consulting israel and he said his nation was willing to suffer 
isolation in the world for its own security 
four members of israels parliament meanwhile planned to defy 
israeli law and meet with officials of the palestine liberation 
organization 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip three palestinians were 
reported wounded in clashes with soldiers and troops demolished or 
sealed three houses of arabs suspected of attacks on soldiers or 
arabs cooperating with israeli authorities 
three residents of gazas jabalya refugee camp were sentenced to 
14 years in prison each for throwing firebombs taking part in riots 
or belonging to groups organizing the nearly 13monthold 
palestinian uprising the army said 
arens in his first news conference with foreign reporters 
criticized the us decision to hold talks with the plo he 
emphasized that negotiating with the plo could not further the peace 
process but he refused to outline israels plans for reaching peace 
with the palestinians and its arab neighbors 
arens said israel does not approve of the european communitys 
plan announced monday to start a middle east peace initiative by 
encouraging an international conference on the region 
i think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind of 
intitiative the members of the european community were to meet with 
us he said i think there is probably no reason why european 
countries should not listen with considerable attention to our 
opinions to our feelings 
arens 63 became foreign minister with the formation of israels 
new government dec 22 he is a member of the likud bloc of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir which has opposed an international middle 
east peace conference 
arens a former ambassador to washington also criticized the 
us talks with the plo saying we are concerned that this 
decision might impair our ability to fight the plague of 
international terrorism 
asked if israel felt isolated by the europeans and the united 
states arens said his government does not welcome isolation but 
will accept it if necessary for its security 
we should not be expected to take any step that might decrease 
the sense of isolation if they are steps that would endanger the 
state of israel he said 
also tuesday an israeli legislator said he and three colleagues 
plan to attend a european symposium on the middle east defying a 
ban on meetings with plo officials 
we have to speak to the palestinians directly and reach peace 
with them through compromise said legislator lova eliav our 
generation must speak to the palestinian leadership and the 
palestinian leadership is the plo 
those attending the meeting in paris on jan 1213 include eliav 
and ora namir of the mainstream labor party yair tsaban of the 
socialist mapam party and shulamit aloni of the leftwing citizens 
rights movement 
the plo is banned in israel and meetings with its members are 
illegal but the four legislators have parliamentary immunity 
recent opinion polls show a majority of israelis support talks 
with the plo 
in jabalya soldiers demolished one palestinian home and sealed 
parts of two others after arresting residents suspected of attacks 
on israeli soldiers or arabs cooperating with israel the army said 
the action against the arab homes came monday night after two 
other palestinian houses were demolished earlier in the day 
the army statement announcing the sentencing of three 
palestinians to prison said that all three were from the jabalya 
camp but that house demolitions were not tied to their cases 
the moves against palestinian houses seem to be part of a 
steppedup campaign to try to halt the palestinian uprising against 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
israel also deported 13 palestinians on sunday the international 
committee of the red cross on tuesday appealed to israel to stop 
such deportations saying they violated international law 
in the west bank soldiers shot and wounded three palestinians 
during clashes with stonethrowing youths in the towns of ramallah 
and tulkarem arab news reports said one of the victims was an 
8yearold boy shot in the back a hospital official said the army 
said it was checking reports of injuries 
since the uprising began in december 1987 at least 345 
palestinians and 14 israelis have died in violence

the government considers the issue of 
making the solidarity trade union legal again a topic for discussion 
at proposed talks with the opposition a government spokesman said 
tuesday 
our standpoint is the following lets sit down as we have 
agreed without preconditions lets talk about everything therefore 
about solidarity too and lets try to come to agreement as far as 
the time form and assumptions of setting union pluralism into 
motion said spokesman jerzy urban 
it would be a mistake to state that one does not want to 
consider the issue of solidarity he said in an opening statement 
at his weekly news conference 
solidarity leader lech walesa has refused to enter the talks 
first proposed during a wave of strikes in august until he 
receives a clear signal of official intention to make his union 
legal again 
asked about urbans comments walesa reiterated his position in a 
telephone interview im saying clearly and frankly there is no 
freedom without solidarity the sooner all sides including the 
authorities realize it the sooner we will make progress and 
solve the problems poland faces 
the government has said it is willing to talk about anything but 
urban appeared to be emphasizing more forcefully than before that 
the government wants talks on the oppositions chief demand the 
restoration of solidarity 
he said the government wants to discuss how to implement a 
longsuspended 1982 law that provided for trade union pluralism and 
said he meant by that more than simply coexistence of branches of 
the official union movement opzz 
urban said prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski at a communist 
party plenum last month asked central committee members about their 
stance toward the aims of a portion of the people for a resumed 
legal existence in appropriate form of a union under the name 
solidarity 
the party leader wojciech jaruzelski in summing up the first 
part of the plenum left the issue open for reflection and 
consultation urban said 
the plenum which began dec 2122 was broken into two parts it 
will convene again in midjanuary with the central committee 
members instructed to give their answer to the questions posed by 
rakowski about solidarity 
urban referred to the present as a touchy moment and appealed 
to observers to show patience 
he said there was vigorous discussion not only among 
authorities but also among the opposition and alleged that some 
former associates of walesa believe he has betrayed solidarity 
i hope that illustrating the opinions and program of lech 
walesas rivals will not be understood as an expression of our 
solidarity and political friendship with mr walesa personally i 
would prefer to hang myself than be suspected of that urban said

prime minister sadek mahdi is stalling on 
reforms needed to mollify a populace fed up with a lingering civil 
war and a foundering economy while moslem fundamentalists in his 
coalition fight proposed changes 
sudanese and western experts agree he needs to come up with 
solutions and soon otherwise they fear a return of street 
violence like that which gripped the country for four days last week 
many sudanese believe mahdi allowed the war and the economic 
problems to drag on too long taking no decisive action until the 
course of events pushed him into it 
what finally turned the streets into arenas of broken glass and 
burning barricades was mahdis imposition of steep price increases 
at a time when unrest already seethed over his refusal to endorse 
officially a draft peace agreement negotiated by a coalition partner 
what we need is action said mohamed omer beshir a veteran 
political observer and lecturer at khartoum universitys institute 
of african and asian studies we need any action to stop the war 
every day of the war makes the economic situation worse and if 
things get worse the people will not stay silent they will react 
but beshir doesnt expect new demonstrations right away 
the prime minister doesnt have the support of the people 
any more beshir said but as for demonstrations again not 
necessarily things in sudan arent always that logical 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity wasnt so 
sure 
its basically an explosive situation he said the reasons 
the people took to the streets last week still are there while the 
situation might be dormant today it could reignite any time 
last weeks trouble followed smaller food riots late last year 
and severe and widespread criticism of mahdi because he refused to 
endorse the peace agreement it was signed nov 16 by the democratic 
unionist party and sudan peoples liberation army and followed 
several failed efforts by mahdi to come to terms with the rebels 
despite support for the agreement from across the sudanese 
political spectrum except for the fundamentalist national islamic 
front mahdi stalled until too late to convene a constitutional 
peace conference dec 31 as the agreement required the democratic 
unionists quit the coalition 
most observers in sudan see mahdis refusal to act on the peace 
agreement was an attempt to satisfy the fundamentalist coalition 
partner at the expense of the centrist democratic unionists 
the islamic front flatly rejected the pact because it would 
freeze the countrys legal code which is based on islams 
1350yearold code of ethics and laws by which moslems are supposed 
to live 
elmahdi is like someone trying to ride two horses no one 
knows how long he can keep this up said beshir we need 
immediate action but it doesnt look like elmahdi will provide it 
soon 
as tensions built the prime minister announced that salaries 
were being increased by up to 500 percent then followed the news 
two days later with steep price increases on sugar and cigarettes 
and a 15 percent sales tax on locally manufactured commodities 
if the people had been hopeful on peace maybe the government 
would have gotten away with the price increases the western 
diplomat said this way they just made the people too angry to 
sit and take it any more 
the street violence enticed the government to roll back the price 
increases and make the salary increases retroactive to july 1 and 
the disturbances slowly stopped 
it was all very sudanese to see how things all went back to 
normal on saturday with the usual terrible traffic and people at 
their desks said the diplomat it looked like all hell had 
broken loose on thursday and there was chaos 
indicative of restiveness in the army was that the generals 
refused to honor mahdis request that they intervene to help police 
put down the trouble 
the military refused to get involved said a western military 
source the price increases affected the military as well and 
they didnt like it a bit 
the foreign expert said the sudanese military viewed the 
tentative agreement as a means to end the war but sadek didnt 
take it 
the current government is the third reshuffle since mahdi was 
elected in april 1986 after mahdi brought in the national islamic 
front last year as a counter to his traditional enemy the 
democratic unionists

rival shiite moslem militias blasted each 
other with gunfire tuesday as fighting intensified in the sector of 
beirut where the 15 western hostages are believed held and in 
southern lebanon 
police said nine people were killed and 19 wounded on the fourth 
straight day of clashes between the prosyrian amal arabic for 
hope and the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
the latest deaths brought the casualty toll to 29 killed and 66 
wounded since the violence began saturday said a police spokesman 
who demanded anonymity it was the heaviest fighting between the two 
militias since november 
amal and hezbollah gunners lobbed mortar and gun shells at each 
other in south beiruts shiyah district as militiamen staged 
hitandrun grenade attacks the police spokesman said 
amal mounted a barrage of tank fire on hezbollah strongholds in 
the hajjaj neighborhood but but our fighters turned back the 
attack hezbollah said 
hezbollah fighters wearing black headbands defended sandbagged 
positions in the ghobeiri and moawadd districts which face 
amalcontrolled territory 
syrian peacekeeping troops in south beirut appeared to be making 
no moves to stop the fighting 
the syrians only call on the combatants through 
loudspeakers to cease firing but fighting starts again once the 
syrian officers leave the area said abu ali jouma a south beirut 
resident who fled his apartment 
jouma said he was taking his wife and three children to stay 
with relatives in west beirut until this is over 
syrian troops had taken adequate security precautions to 
prevent the fighting from spreading to west beirut according to a 
source at the syrian military command who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the source said no military crackdown on either side is 
contemplated at the moment 
it was the heaviest fighting since november between amal and 
hezbollah in their struggle to dominate lebanons 1 million shiite 
moslems the countrys largest sect the street battles in november 
left 40 people dead and 87 wounded 
the police spokesman said there was not way of knowing whether 
the fighting had affected the 15 western hostages believed held by 
members of hezbollah in the slums of south beirut the hostages 
include nine americans three britons an irishman an italian and a 
belgian 
in an effort to end a threeweek bloodbath in may between amal 
and hezbollah that left nearly 300 people dead and 1000 wounded 
the syrians sent 4500 troops to the slums that stretch across more 
than 16 square miles 
syria also has 7500 troops in west beirut and 25000 soldiers in 
northern and eastern lebanon under a 1976 arab league mandate to 
halt the 14yearold civil war between lebanons christians and 
moslems 
the syrian military presence does not include the villages in 
southern lebanon 
on tuesday amal and hezbollah gunners traded howitzer shells in 
five villages in southern lebanon near the selfdesignated security 
zone israel patrols just north of its border a police spokesman 
said 
smoke billowed from houses hit by howitzers in jbaa ein bouswar 
jarjou arab saleem and louwaizeh said a resident of the town of 
nabatiyeh reached by telephone from beirut 
most civilians left the villages more than two years ago after 
hezbollah set up guerrilla bases there for launching attacks against 
israeli troops in the security zone and against proisraeli 
militiamen in lebanon

the soviet bloc made concessions in human 
rights reforms and allowed better monitoring of compliance in the 
draft version of the helsinki conferences final accord presented to 
the members tuesday 
western diplomats hailed the document as including landmark 
agreements including greatly enhanced freedoms for soviet bloc 
citizens to travel emigrate circulate and receive information 
practice religion and reunite with relatives in the west 
the document unexpectedly contained firm dates for a disputed 
human rights conference in moscow tentatively scheduled from oct 
22 to nov 15 1991 it includes one key us and british 
requirement for agreeing to a moscow conference a commitment by 
hosts of such meetings for free access to the forums 
the draft worked by nine neutral and nonaligned nations at the 
vienna forum was introduced to a closeddoor meeting of delegations 
tuesday diplomatic sources afterward made a copy available to the 
associated press 
us secretary of state george p shultz has recommended that 
president reagan accept a soviet proposal to hold the conference a 
us official said if reagan takes shultzs advice the stage also 
will be set for a new round of eastwest negotiations to reduce 
conventional troops tanks and artillery in europe 
the consensus of all 35 nations the united states canada the 
soviet union and all european states bar albania is required for 
final accord at the vienna meeting which opened in november 1986 
the meetings purpose is to review compliance with the 1975 helsinki 
accords on humanitarian issues including human rights 
diplomats from both the soviet bloc and the west said a first 
glance at the draft document indicated it could serve as the basis 
of a final agreement in time for foreign ministers of all states 
present to meet in vienna jan 1719 as suggested by austria 
outstanding difficulties however include 
east german objections to a requirement to phase out minimum 
currency exchange requirements for foreign visitors east germany 
earns millions of dollars in hard currency each year from visiting 
west germans required to exchange such sums 
continuing difficulty over the precise zone within turkey to be 
included in new talks on conventional security from the atlantic to 
the urals diplomats hope to resolve this this week 
lastminute insistence by cyprus that a followup meeting on 
the peaceful settlement of disputes be held in nicosia this has 
drawn objections from turkey 
the soviet union and its allies are still not ready to guarantee 
completely free emigration or to dismiss the idea that it is 
legitimate to put people in prison for what they say or what they 
believe us ambassador to the conference warren zimmermann said 
in an interview last week 
but the proposal of a moscow human rights conference and kremlin 
conduct at the vienna forum have shown that the soviet union has 
elected to put human rights at the top of its own agenda 
zimmermann said 
on tuesday zimmermann declined to comment on the draft document 
until he has studied it thoroughly 
the draft document provides for the solution of all outstanding 
emigration cases at the latest six months after the vienna 
conference ends 
it also says citizens who may be prevented from emigrating on 
grounds of national security a frequent reason given for refusing 
soviet exit visas shall in the future be informed of the exact 
restrictions their work might place on foreign travel 
the draft outlines plans for annual conferences on human rights 
in each year before the next helsinki review conference due in 
helsinki in 1992 
the human rights conferences will take place in paris may 30june 
23 in copenhagen june 5 to july 29 1990 and in moscow according 
to the draft document 
the final accord is to include a separate mandate worked out by 
the 16 nato nations and seven warsaw pact countries for new 
23nation talks on reducing conventional forces and weapons in 
europe 
those talks are to replace negotiations on mutual and balanced 
force reduction which have been going on in vienna without agreement 
since 1973

farmers who do not have an approved 
conservation plan for highly erodible land have less than a year in 
which to comply the agriculture department said tuesday 
the plans subject to usda approval are blueprints for managing 
and reducing erosion of highly susceptible land 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said farmers must have their conservation plans approved by 
the end of 1989 to remain eligible for usda program benefits 
most farmers who still need a conservation plan will receive 
written notice from local agency offices within the next few weeks 
he said 
about 65 percent of the nations farmers who participate in usda 
crop programs already have obtained approval for their conservation 
plans scaling said but an estimated 800000 have not yet done so 
we know some farmers are holding off because they are afraid 
the rules for erosion reduction were too rigid scaling said 
thats a misconception the final rule provides for flexibility in 
reaching acceptable erosion reductions base on local conditions and 
standards in field office technical guides 
farmers who have highly erodible land and fail to develop 
acceptable plans stand to lose usda farm program benefits including 
price and income supports crop insurance farmers home 
administration loans commodity credit corp storage payments 
conservation reserve program annual payments and other benefits 
scaling said farmers who do not have plans approved by dec 31 
1989 will forfeit benefits on all the land they farm not just on 
the highly erodible acres

a government licensing panel said tuesday it 
refused to believe teachers would abandon pupils in an emergency and 
had conditionally approved evacuation plans for 17 new hampshire 
towns around the seabrook nuclear power plant 
the 56 billion plant was completed two years ago and operation 
has been held up in disputes over the adequacy of the evacuation 
plan 
a threemember panel of the commissions atomic safety and 
licensing board said in a 290page decision dated friday and 
released tuesday it found reasonable assurance that adequate 
protective measures can and will be taken within the new hampshire 
portion of the evacuation zone 
four conditions were attached to the approval three seemed 
technical state submission to the federal emergency management 
agency of satisfactory personnel rosters for workers at emergency 
reception centers extended hours at one center if necessary for 
decontamination of workers arriving from the other three centers 
after those centers close and confirmation that promised plan 
revisions had in fact been made 
the fourth requires resolution of an omission in forecasts of 
road traffic in an emergency traffic of people going from jobs in 
the evacuation zone to nearby homes 
tuesdays decision was hailed by backers of the plant opponents 
said they would appeal 
this is very good news said ron sher spokesman for the 
plant we were quite certain the plans would be approved said 
richard strome head of the states emergency management agency 
on the other side jane doughty spokeswoman for the seacoast 
antipollution league said they have no basis to ignore that 
sworn testimony that teachers would leave she added its human 
nature to take care of your family first 
six massachusetts towns lie in the seabrook zone but that state 
has refused to participate in the planning on the grounds that it 
would be impossible to move crowds off the beaches near the plant in 
an emergency 
the plant lead owner public service co of new hampshire has 
submitted a plan for massachusetts for which the board still has to 
schedule public hearings 
on nov 18 president reagan gave fema authority to draw up such 
plans and carry them out if a state refuses the job 
in hearings last summer the board heard testimony from 13 
teachers working in the evacuation zone that the teachers would 
promptly leave the schools and their pupils in order to care for 
their own children and other dependents and they believed other 
teachers would do so too 
there was similar testimony from some officials of the five new 
hampshire towns that have refused to take part in planning 
we must recognize that these claims were made with the 
knowledge that seabrook has yet to be licensed and that its 
licensing may still be prevented the decision said 
the panel said 597 teachers working in the zone signed a petition 
stating they do not accept the conflict of duty which the 
emergency response plan assigns us 
the concept of abandoning their children was not expressed to 
them when their signatures were gathered the decision said 
the board does not accept the implied conclusion of the 
teachers testimony that virtually all of the teachers in the zone 
will abruptly abandon their pupils without even pausing to account 
for them and seeing them to a school bus it said we would 
expect teachers to perform better than the general population in an 
emergency 
the board said it relied heavily on expert testimony that trained 
workers with welldefined emergency roles do not generally leave 
their jobs and on testimony by dennis s miletti professor of 
sociology at colorado state university that experience in 
hurricanes and other disasters shows that crises elicit altruistic 
public behavior in which a therapeutic community is formed

for freshman rep ronald k machtley who made 
a national splash in november as the only challenger to defeat a 
house chairman it didnt take long on his first day in congress 
tuesday to savor the perks of office 
look theres cooter he told his family during their walk to 
the swearingin ceremony in the capitol when he spied a fellow 
newcomer rep ben jones a georgia democrat best known for his 
portrayal on televisions the dukes of hazzard of the good ole 
boy cooter ive met him hes a nice guy 
its like that in washington for members of congress who are big 
fish at home but in the capital are just one of 535 lawmakers most 
of whom have little notoriety 
machtley rri is unlikely to immediately acquire the clout of 
the man he defeated two months ago 14term veteran democratic rep 
fernand j st germain the chairman of the house banking committee 
for now hes starting at the bottom a member of the minority party 
in the house and with no seniority either 
his surprising victory over st germain by a 5644 percent 
margin came in his first try for public office and made him one of 
just six challengers to defeat an incumbent machtley is one of just 
33 freshmen in the 435member house 
i accept that i wont go down there and turn congress 
upsidedown legislatively the 40yearold lawyer said last week 
from his office in newport ri but i have the educational 
background so that ill do a good job 
machtley a naval academy graduate who went on to become an 
attorney defeated st germain after a campaign in which he took 
popular positions in the overwhelmingly democratic district such as 
favoring a womans right to abortion and reduced spending on 
president reagans star wars missile defense proposal 
he was also boosted by his rivals ethics problems which 
centered on accusations that st germain had accepted favors from 
lobbyists the justice department and house ethics committee have 
studied those allegations but never moved against st germain 
ive tried to be realistic he says ive said id go down 
and try to put people first and my own wealth second and that id 
do the best i can 
his work began tuesday a day that featured much pomp and 
circumstance but little of substance 
he and his wife kati who for now are staying with their two 
children at a local hotel began their day working out in an 
exercise room at 8 am 
he was in his longworth house office building suite across the 
street from the capitol an hour later like most freshmen he faces 
an earlysession case of chaos since he has almost no office 
equipment a bare desk and empty bookshelves and still gets lost a 
lot 
im learning my way around he said 
a few family members gathered in his office and his wife 
children parents and motherinlaw accompanied him to the capitol 
to watch a twohour session of the house that culminated in members 
taking the oath of office 
its a real big deal concluded his 12yearold daughter 
erin 
then it was back to his longworth office where a small group of 
lobbyists staff and other lawmakers dined on cold cuts soda beer 
and wine and mingled with relatives who told of the days machtley 
while in the naval academy earned spare change by diving for balls 
in golf course ponds polishing them up and selling them 
i was the one who had to clean them said his younger sister 
susan carl 
above the din of the reception machtley juggled interviews with 
rhode island reporters and posed for photographs with his family it 
was all interrupted by a strange series of loud buzzes a wellknown 
sound to the ears of capitol hill veterans 
what is that he asked his aides 
it turned out to be the signal used to summon members to the 
house floor for a vote

gov michael s dukakis announced today he would 
not seek reelection in 1990 but added without elaboration that 
he aimed to continue working in public service 
this will be my last term as governor of massachusetts he 
told a crowded news conference 
though he lost the presidential race two months ago dukakis said 
that loss had little impact on his decision even if he had not run 
for president he said he probably would have not sought an 
unprecedented fourth fouryear term 
he gave no immediate indication of his longterm plans including 
whether he would seek the presidency again in 1992 or seek any other 
elective office asked for a hint to his future dukakis would say 
only public policy and public service is what im all about its 
what i love 
he said he intended to spend the last two years of his term 
fulfilling his responsibilities wrapping up his programs and 
working to make certain he was succeeded by a democrat he said he 
would announce his legislative agenda later this week he did not 
endorse anyone as his successor 
dukakis said he would miss the governorship but had no regrets 
its one of those moments theres a certain sadness ive 
loved this job he said 
dukakis announcement comes at a time when massachusetts is 
facing a fiscal squeeze he has acknowledged a shortfall of at least 
600 million for the current fiscal year in the state budget which 
totals 116 billion he has ordered spending cuts but has not said 
whether he will seek new taxes 
in recent weeks dukakis had been urged by fellow democrats to 
announce his plans so they could begin making their political plans 
for the governorship 
one has to make a decision ive made that decision he said 
it seemed to me desirable to make the decision now rather than 
later he added 
at age 55 dukakis is midway through his third fouryear term as 
governor of massachusetts he has already served longer as the 
states governor than any of his predecessors 
he was first elected to the massachusetts governorship in 1974 
then lost the democratic primary when he sought reelection four 
years later but he won back the post in 1982 and was reelected in 
a landslide in 1986 
during the second week of december dukakis took a weeklong 
vacation his first since the presidential election in florida 
before leaving dukakis said he planned to spend some of his 
vacation time reflecting on the campaign against republican george 
bush and on his own plans for the future 
in the past few weeks speculation has mounted about dukakis and 
his plans with some saying he would seek a rematch with bush in 
1992 or would run for governor again or would drop out of politics 
for some sort of academic position 
in a recent poll dukakis appeared to enjoy a commanding lead in 
popularity statewide compared with such likely democratic 
challengers as boston mayor raymond flynn the survey taken by 
dukakis political operation said he would defeat flynn to a margin 
of 67 percent to 27 percent if the gubernatorial election were now 
in his interview two weeks ago dukakis said he wanted to make 
the next two years the best two years the state has ever had 
but he gave no hint of how that goal might relate to his political 
plans

the timing was right just after christmas and 
about the date that income tax forms arrive but everything else was 
phony about the 1 million checks sent to a dozen people nationwide 
say postal service officials 
they regard the hoax as such a bad joke that they dont plan to 
pursue it 
according to bank and postal authorities someone in the phoenix 
area found a packet of checks from a discontinued account wrote the 
checks and marked them sweepstakes winners in imitation of a 
television commercial then used envelopes bearing the return 
address of various companies to mail them 
officials of first interstate bank told one victim of the hoax 
that about a dozen people had called about the checks officials 
declined to release the recipients names 
the checks were signed percy eubanks jr 
percy eubanks sr said his son who once worked for a fastfood 
restaurant here had closed the first interstate account months ago 
the phone number listed on the checks for the younger eubanks has 
been reassigned to virginia hughes who said she had received four 
or five calls 
ms hughes said one of her call came from bonnie benson of 
barnesville ohio who said she called the bank as well 
you dont sneeze at a million dollars you never know ms 
benson said 
she said she believes the prankster got her name and address from 
an advertisement she ran in a national clubs newsletter 
bonnie baker an employee of the arizona republic tipped 
reporters from her newspaper after receiving a check herself she 
said she got hers in a subscriptionpayment envelope for phoenix 
newspapers inc 
i would like to go and deposit it you know its not true but 
deep down you hope it is kind of like the old millionaire tv 
series ms baker said 
the perpetrator of the joke mailed the envelopes using 
magazineselection stamps rather than us postage stamps the women 
said however the stamps were canceled and the envelopes were 
delivered 
the us postal inspectors office and phoenix police said they 
didnt plan to pursue the case because it was so obviously a hoax 
that they would have difficulty proving criminal intent

the reagan administration made a mistake in mouse and senate on tuesday 
but presidentelect bush administered 
at least one oath that wasnt on the schedule 
bush soon to be the nations 41st president turned to the 
photographers surrounding him in the old senate chamber and asked 
them raise their right hands and to swear an oath an oath of good 
conduct during his administration 
the moment came in a banterfilled pause during the ceremonial 
reenactment of the oath of office for senators 
at one point bush turned to reporters and announced im going 
to make a little news up here for you guys 
he was then asked if he planned to contest his subpoena to 
testify at the irancontra trial of former white house aide oliver 
l north 
im not going to make that much news bush replied 
although most senators eagerly strode down the senate aisle to 
take the oath to preserve and protect the constitution of the 
united states against all enemies foreign and domestic there was 
one prominent absentee 
sen edward m kennedy dmass postponed taking the oath so he 
could be in providence ri to watch his son patrick take his 
own oath of office as a member of the rhode island legislature 
thats something that as a proud father he could not miss 
said melody miller a kennedy staff member 
in both house and senate there was much talk of bipartisan 
cooperation with the incoming bush administration dozens of 
senators walked up to bush who was seated in the presiding officers 
chair in the senate to shake his hand and wish him well 
because presidentelect bush has served in this house i am 
encouraged that he will exhibit appreciation for the constitutional 
responsibilities of the congress and will seek avenues of 
cooperation said house speaker jim wright of texas 
wright was reelected speaker 253 to 170 in the 
democraticcontrolled house and his vanquished opponent house 
minority leader bob michel of illinois announced achievement of a 
record 
michel said he is the first man in our history to suffer the 
indignity of losing this contest for speaker five times in a row 
he also had a wish list 
we should ban proxy voting reduce the numbers of 
subcommittees cut staff cut spending halt abuses of franked 
free mail stop campaigning at taxpayers expense and most 
importantly blow the doors off this chamber and let in the clean 
fresh air of open debate 
scores of members small children dressed in their 
starchedandpressed finest were on hand as the house opened its 
session precisely at noon 
but soon some were squirming in their parents laps or crawling 
over the seat backs and along the floor 
rep robert dornan rcalif placed a toddler on the republican 
committee table the child walked along its length holding onto the 
congressmans lapels for support 
outside the chamber members stood in long lines to pick up their 
electronic voting cards and the lapel pins that identify them as 
members of congress authorized to enter the capitol without walking 
through metal detectors 
one freshman congressman rep glenn poshard dill was seen 
still wearing a charcoal gray topcoat standing in a sixthfloor 
corridor of the longworth house office building 
he was looking at directional signs and muttering to himself

here somewhere which way 
a reporter escorted the new congressman to his new office 
in the senate children and other senatorial relatives and 
friends were confined to the galleries filling every seat 
lady bird johnson sitting near her daughter lynda watched 
soninlaw charles robb take the oath of office as a us senator 
from virginia 
the ceremony occurred on the 40th anniversary of the day her 
husband the late president lyndon b johnson first took his oath 
as a us senator 
the senate chamber was resplendent 
since the 100th congress adjourned in october a patterned 
darkblue carpet had been laid down the presiding officers chair 
framed with a backdop of gold curtains bordered with blue and red 
and the staff benches in the corners of the chamber upholstered in 
brilliant scarlet 
its obviously all been done for television sen carl levin

a fierce legal battle is shaping up in el 
paso countys courthouse not between litigants but between two 
district judges who covet the same courtroom 
one judge got so steamed up monday that he threatened to hold 
court under a tree to make his point and this desert city is not 
known for an abundance of trees 
the gavel started to fall friday when newly elected district 
judge jose troche went home thinking his papers books and other 
property were stowed safely in the sixthfloor office of his 
predecessor ward koehler 
one of koehlers last acts as district judge was to decree that 
troche would get his old office and courtroom the onepage order 
was posted on the office door friday 
but monday morning troche got a rude surprise in place of 
koehlers order was the nameplate of koehlers former political 
rival judge peter peca jr some of troches files and papers had 
been stacked on a table in a jury room down the hall others were 
stashed in pecas former secondfloor office and even in a trash 
can 
troche and koehler were outraged 
judge peca has resorted to some awfully highhanded tactics to 
try to take over the courtroom said koehler 
peca on the other hand considers the courtroom his due el paso 
has 11 district judges and 10 courtrooms for the past two years 
peca had been like a loser at a game of musical chairs banging his 
gavel in whichever courtroom happened to be free now he said he 
has seniority 
troche is a new judge he said he can take his turn 
without a courtroom 
troche has asked county commissioners to intervene in his behalf 
in the meantime hes scheduled a plea in the disputed courtroom 
were going to take the plea he said even if we have to 
do it under a tree someplace were going to do it

attorneys for bess myersons boyfriend carl 
andy capasso asked a federal judge tuesday to recommend that he 
be moved to a halfway house to help him earn money and deal with 
family problems 
capasso 43 a millionaire contractor has been in a lewisburg 
pa prison since pleading guilty to federal tax evasion charges in 
january 1988 
he was acquitted dec 22 along with ms myerson 64 a former 
miss america who was the citys cultural affairs commissioner of an 
alleged divorcefixing scheme 
defense attorney jay goldberg asked us district judge charles 
e stewart to recommend to the bureau of prisons that capasso be 
moved to a minimum security facility in midtown manhattan which 
provides a transition for prisoners reentering society capasso is 
scheduled to be released from prison june 26 
there is a family crisis involving the children said 
goldberg 
capasso has two children 16 and 14 and three grown 
stepchildren goldberg told the judge that the 16yearold 
particularly suffered because of the latest trial 
capasso also needs to earn money to pay a 500000 fine goldberg 
said 
were dealing with a nonviolent offender who erred with respect 
to his income tax the lawyer said 
the judge said he would consider the request 
the government is opposed to any action by the judge said david 
lawrence deputy chief of the us attorneys criminal division 
we think its inappropriate he said of the request 
we think its for the bureau of prisons to decide without a 
judges recommendation where mr capasso should spend the remainder 
of his six months the family situation the business situation has 
been raised time and time again before the court he said

a plan by the american medical association to 
develop treatment guidelines for doctors may lead to cookbook 
medicine one critic said tuesday but supporters contended 
medical care could improve 
what this plan may do is encourage doctors to learn more about 
what works and what doesnt work and do it in a more structured 
way said harold luft a professor of health economics at the 
university of california at san francisco and a supporter of the 
plan 
but critics said the guidelines could hamper doctors in their 
treatment of patients 
the standards will either be inordinately vague to the point of 
being unacceptable or if they are strict the ama is likely to 
disown them said dr sidney wolfe director of the public 
citizens health research group in washington dc 
under the ama plan announced last month clinical experts in 
medical specialties will issue guidelines on appropriate treatments 
for various problems said dr john kelly director of the 
chicagobased organizations newly created office of quality 
assurance 
research on patient health will be used to develop the 
recommendations said kelly a california emergencycare physician 
the first guidelines to be issued by the end of 1989 probably 
will deal with areas in which the preferred treatment is still 
unclear kelly said a condition such as clogged coronary arteries 
for example has several rival therapies 
the goal is to provide doctors with better information on 
treatment choices he said 
what we believe is if the guidelines are credible physicians 
will follow them if a physician chooses to practice outside of what 
the guidelines are he may have to document why he does it kelly 
said 
the question is are they going to be precise guidelines or are 
they going to be anything goes asked wolfe 
this may lead to cookbook medicine he added it amounts to 
writing out recipes to tell doctors how to treat their patients a 
lot of doctors are going to come out on the wrong side of this 
recipe or cookbook and theyre not going to like it 
luft defended the plan in general it will probably improve 
the practice of medicine if its done with sensitivity he said 
one needs to be concerned however that guidelines are not set in 
concrete and are not so broad as to be meaningless 
luft said the amas involvement was encouraging i would worry 
much more about cookbook medicine if it guidelines was coming from 
insurers and the government 
doctors have been under great pressure from insurance companies 
patients and government agencies to set treatment guidelines said 
dennis oleary president of the joint commission for the 
accreditation of healthcare organzations in chicago 
if physicians dont do this themselves governments or payers 
insurance companies will do it for them he said the ama is 
the right organization to do this 
the ama is the nations largest organization of physicians with 
more than 280000 members said dr james todd the groups deputy 
executive vice president 
luft said the guidelines may also help physicians defend 
themselves against malpractice lawsuits 
a doctor will be able to say look i followed the guidelines 
set down by the ama i didnt do anything wrong he said

the democraticcontrolled 101st congress staged 
opening ceremonies on tuesday filled with pomp and pageantry and 
spiced by controversy over a recommendation for a large pay raise 
for lawmakers 
on a day given over largely to swearingin ceremonies and 
receptions democrats pledged cooperation with theadministration leaders 
of both parties laughed off a question about 
higher taxes 
presidentelect bush ad incoming bush 
ministered the oath of office to new and 
newly reelected senators in groups of four a few hundred feet 
across the capitol speaker jim wright swore in house members 
wright dtexas in a speech marking his election to a second 
term as speaker vowed to use the next two years to attack the 
budget deficit the trade deficit and the social deficit caused by 
the widening gap between rich and poor 
he offered bush unstinting cooperation toward a bipartisan 
foreign policy but his rhetoric on other matters was more 
restrained without mentioning taxes he prodded bush to submit 
budget plans within six weeks if possible and said democrats were 
eager to help the new president improve education child careesident reagan 
notifying him 
that congress was in session this they did and when asked by 
reporters about the possibility of higher taxes the lawmakers 
laughed in unison 
bush has said he will fight any proposal to reduce the deficit 
through new taxes but many democrats and some republicans believe 
he will have to change his mind to win agreement on a comprehensive 
deficitfighting plan 
opening day was a combination of the carefully scripted and the 
unexpected 
freshman rep glenn poshard dill arriving for his first day 
on the job stood perplexed in the hallway of a house office 
building sixteeenohfive 1605 its got to be around here 
somewhere which way he muttered aloud 
a reporter escorted him to his new office 
events went more smoothly on the senate and house floors 
followed by a seemingly endless series of lunches and parties to 
celebrate victories won last november 
the senate bore a new blue patterned carpet for the occasion as 
well as new scarlet benches in the corners for staff aides to view 
the proceedings the galleries were packed with spectators as bush 
swore in 32 elected senators and dan coats rind appointed to 
replace vice presidentelect dan quayle 
quayle mingled with his former colleagues on the senate floor 
incoming white house chief of staff john sununu also attended 
the pomp was nowhere better on display than in the senate where 
outgoing majority leader robert c byrd off west virginia was named 
president pro tempore the post that goes to the longestserving 
senator of the majority party 
first a resolution was passed appointing byrd then as he took 
the presiding officers chair a resolution was approved notifying 
the house of his appointment finally a resolution was approved 
congratulating him for attaining his new position 
the atmosphere was less staid in the house where many lawmakers 
were accompanied to the openingday session by spouses or young 
children 
republicans waged a symbolic battle to rewrite house rules to 
their liking but majority democrats brushed them aside republican 
leader bob michel said his troops would make their views known in a 
clear and forceful manner all year 
if no one wanted to talk about taxes rep tom tauke riowa was 
eager to begin a debate over reagans expected recommendation for a 
hefty pay raise for members of the house and senate 
congressional pay adjustments have become a perpetual source of 
debate controversy and embarrassment he said in calling for a 
twoyear delay in any increase and requiring a roll call vote in 
both houses before salary hikes take effect 
reagan is expected to call for a substantial pay raise next week 
for members of congress to take effect march 1 unless rejected 
before then by both houses an advisory commission has recommended a 
50 percent boost for lawmakers federal judges and top executive 
branch officials with members of congress giving up lucrative 
honorariums in exchange 
current congressional pay is 89500 a year and the commissions 
proposal would raise it to 135000 
while mitchell says the senate will vote on any proposed pay 
raise democratic leaders in the house say they are hoping to have 
reagans proposal take effect without a vote 
under current law congress automatically gets a boost proposed 
by the president unless it votes it down 
leaders in both parties spoke of cooperation on the first day of 
the session 
were very optimistic that were going to be able to work with 
bush and we can solve some of the problems said rep tony coelho 
dcalif house majority whip we need to have that cooperation 
wed like to resolve some problems and get rid of some of this 
confrontation 
i think at least at the outset the appropriate tone is one 
of cooperation and a spirit of bipartisanship and lets see how far 
we can go with that said rep dick cheney rwyo house minority 
whip

with six weeks to go before soviet 
troops are to be out of afghanistan the chairman of the 
pakistanbased afghan resistance on tuesday announced a lastminute 
effort to form a transitional government 
sibghatullah mojaddidi said a consultative council with half 
its members drawn from guerrilla commanders fighting soviet and 
afghan government troops would convene within two or three weeks 
the council would draw up a transitional government 
apart from the difficulty of selecting and convening the more 
than 400 members of such a council the decision offers the 
resistance little time to maneuver 
the soviet unions first deputy foreign minister and ambassador 
to kaubl yuli vorontsov planned to arrive in islamabad the 
pakistani capital on wednesday and meet mojaddidi by the end of the 
week it will be the second session between the kremlins afghan 
specialist and the rebels in attempts to find a political settlement 
to the afghan war 
the first meeting in the saudi arabian city of taif last month 
was the kremlins first official recognition of the moslem 
guerrillas it has been fighting for more than nine years it was a 
tacit acknowledgment that moscow is exploring a noncommunist 
alternative to preisdent najib head of the embattled government in 
kabul 
vorontsov was in tehran on tuesday meeting iranianbased leaders 
of shiite moslem afghan guerrillas who operate separately from the 
sunni moslem groups based in peshawar 
the main guerrilla alliance consists of seven squabbling parties 
who operate out of peshawar under the name of the islamic unity of 
afghan mujahedeen 
the group generally called the alliance rotates its 
chairmanship among the leaders of the seven groups every three 
months mojaddidi who became chairman jan 1 is the leader of the 
afghan national liberation front one of the alliances relatively 
moderate but least militarily effective groups 
the decision to convene a consultative council or shura was 
announced after a fractious threeday meeting of the alliances 
140member executive council the council comprised of 20 
representatives from each of the seven parties failed to 
unanimously endorse the plan alliance sources said 
some executive council members also opposed more meetings with 
vorontsov the sources said on condition of anonymity 
mojaddidi said the council was a temporary measure because the 
war in afghanistan makes an election impossible at least two of the 
seven guerrilla leaders have advocated the election of a national 
parliament instead of summoning a consultative council 
but mojaddidi said the alliances supreme council consisting of 
the top leader of the seven peshawarbased parties approved the 
shura plan a week ago 
he told a news conference the shura would have 400 or 500 
members with an equal number to be nominated by each of the seven 
parties after the news conference however he told reporters each 
party would name 60 delegates for a total of 420 
he said 50 percent of the delegates would be rebel commanders 
the rest would include wellknown intellectuals tribal leaders and 
good moslems 
he rejected the participation of any officials of the current 
sovietstyle kabul government 
mojaddidis formula appears to exclude the iranianbased shiite 
guerrilla groups but he said the seven peshawarbased parties were 
free to nominate people who did not belong to their own ranks 
shiites comprise only about 17 percent of afghanistans 
population but they make up about 40 percent of the afghan refugees 
who have fled their country since 1978 when a communist government 
seized power through a coup and needed the soviet unions 1979 
military intervention to survive 
of the estimated 15 million afghans onethird now live outside 
afghanistan 3 million in pakistan and 2 million in iran 
asked whether the former afghan king zahir shah would be asked 
to participate in the shura mojaddidi said any of the 
peshawarbased groups was free to invite anyone 
the new attempt to form an interim government will take place in 
pakistan mojaddidi said asked where and how it would operate he 
first predicted confidently that the najib government would fall 
quickly after feb 15 when the soviet union is scheduled to 
withdraw its last remaining forces estimated at about 50000 
but in response to questions he said that if the guerrillas were 
not in control of the capital the interim government would operate 
in provinces they did control

president reagan asked congress on tuesday to 
ratify a treaty signed by more than a score of nations pledging 
punishment for terrorists who attack ships at sea or oil platforms 
offshore 
the seizure of the italian cruise ship achille lauro in 1985 
and the murder of american passenger leon klinghoffer demonstrated 
that no country or form of transportation is immune from the 
criminal savagery of those who engage in terrorist acts reagan 
said 
he said the agreement consists of a convention covering shipping 
and a protocol that deals with fixed platforms offshore 
he said they are modeled on earlier treaties dealing with 
aircraft hijacking and sabotage and include provisions requiring 
states to provide severe punishment for such offenses and to 
extradite or prosecute those who commit them 
work on the treaty began in 1986 under the auspices of the 
international maritime organization on the basis of an initial draft 
cosponsored by italy austria and egypt 
both the convention and protocol were adopted at an international 
conference in rome in march the united states and 22 other states 
signed the convention and the united states and 20 other nations 
signed the protocol dealing with platforms 
it is clear that the convention already has broad support in 
the international community and it is hoped that all states will 
join in this major step to deter acts against the safety of maritime 
navigation the president said

president reagan announced tuesday he has 
decided against tariffs or other action to curb oil imports 
although conceding that the free world will become increasingly 
dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecure sources 
the president acted on the recommendation of commerce secretary 
william verity who he said reported to him that import restrictions 
would not be cost effective and in the long run would impair 
rather than enhance national security 
veritys report was the outcome of an investigation requested in 
december 1987 by the national energy security committee a domestic 
oil industry group which said the president should use his powers to 
restrict import of goods where imports would hurt national security 
reagan said verity concluded that there has been a substantial 
improvement in us energy security since the last similar 
investigation in 1979 
however declining domestic oil production rising oil imports 
and growing free world dependence on potentially insecure sources of 
supply raise a number of concerns including vulnerability to a 
major supply disruption the president said 
the investigation found that the maintenance of us access to 
sufficient supplies of petroleum is essential to our economic 
security foreign policy flexibility and defense preparedness he 
said given these factors the secretary of commerce found that 
petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security 
imports of crude oil and refined products currently are running 
at about 41 percent of consumption up from 315 percent in 1985 but 
not yet back to the 477 percent recorded in 1977 the peak year for 
imports several forecasts including those of the energy 
department predict that imports will reach and pass 50 percent in 
the 1990s 
a department study concluded in 1987 that a 10abarrel tariff 
would add 120000 jobs in the oil industry but cost 400000 
elsewhere in the economy would bring 46 billion worth of benefits 
at a cost of 200 billion secretary john herrington has said 
exemptions that would be politically necessary in any tariff plan to 
accommodate canada and residential users of home heating oil in the 
us northeast would make it unworkable 
reagan said that in deciding not to recommend any import 
restrictions verity took into account the administrations program 
to improve energy security 
in particular reagan cited decontrol of oil prices and 
elimination of allocation controls as actions his administration has 
taken to strengthen the domestic oil industry 
the strategic petroleum reserve contains over 555 million 
barrels compared to 108 million barrels eight years ago he said 
today the nation is far less vulnerable to an oil supply 
disruption than in 1973 or 1979 he added 
despite these improvements important energy security concerns 
remain the president said citing rising oil consumption 
declining us crude production and rising oil imports 
in addition projections show that the free world will become 
increasingly dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecure 
sources 
in a message to congress that accompanied his statement the 
president urged the lawmakers to deregulate natural gas prices 
permit expanded oil exploration in alaska and the outer continental 
shelf liberalize the depletion allowance for oil and gas producers 
streamline nuclear power licensing procedures and sell the naval 
petroleum reserves at elk hills calif and teapot dome wyo 
the administration has advocated all these measures in congress 
in recent years but without success 
the 1979 study was requested by the treasury department in 1978 
based on that study thenpresident carter determined that oil 
imports were a threat to us security

of the house pledged tuesday to cooperate with george bush and 
called on the presidentelect to submit his budget recommendations 
within a month after taking office 
today i pledge to president elect bush the earnest and 
unstinting cooperation of the leadership of cooperatin of the 
leadership of this house in seeking true bipartisanship in every 
area of our nations foreign policy wright said a his speech to 
his colleagues accepting a second term as speaker 
because presidentelect bush has service in this house i am 
encouraged that he will exhibit appreciation for the constitutional 
responsibilities of the congress and will seek avenues of 
cooperation between our executive and legislative branches he 
said 
wright said republicans and democrats within congress must also 
learn to work together the speaker known for strongarm 
parliamentary tactics said he now is eager to encourage a 
house republican role in policy making 
wright said the domestic agenda was plagued with three 
deficits the budget deficit the trade deficit and the social 
deficit caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor as 
costs soar for housing higher education and health care 
by working together we can help our new president fulfill his 
beautiful promise of a kinder gentler nation he said we in 
the house leadership are eager to help him attain the goals he has 
expressed of wider access for all americans to education to child 
care to affordable housing and to a cleaner environment 
wright specifically pointed to cooperating with jack kemp the 
former republican congressman who bush has chosen to head the 
department of housing and urban affairs kemp has long been an 
advocate of urban lowtax enterprise zones to lure business back 
to the inner city 
for congress to carry out its responsiblities on time including 
approving a fiscal 1990 budget by april 15 the new president must 
submit his recommendations not later than feb 20 said wright 
who drew cheers from his colleagues for promising to get the 
legislative work done on time 
wright himself the subject of a probe for allegedly violating 
ethics rules in his personal finances and for revealing government 
secrets said he and republican leader bob michel rill would 
quickly appoint a panel to review house ethics rules 
the speaker also repeated his promise to pursue changes in 
federal campaign law including a bill passed by the house but not 
the senate last year to have polls close at the same time across the 
nation in presidential elections 
we can clean up the murky areas of campaign financing and 
reduce the influence of special interests he said 
to profess love for democracy but disdain for politics is to 
pretend to honor the product while despising the process that 
creates the product wright said 
politics is as necessary to the functioning of a free society 
as water is to the flow of a river he said it doesnt have to 
be filthy and corrupted and neither does the river 
the conservative campaign fund a rightwing political action 
committee filed on tuesday with the federal election commission a 
complaint against wright the group contends that wright and his 
supporters illegally staged and financed a gala salute to the 
speaker four weeks before the november election without properly 
declaring it a campaign event 
house republicans wondered aloud about wrights promise to treat 
them more fairly as the democrats rammed through on tuesday a 
revised version of the house rules further limiting the gop 
minoritys parliamentary options in battling for their views 
was it just flimflam or was it serious said rep newt 
gingrich rga a conservative opponent of the speaker

television evangelist jim bakker appealed 
for money tuesday the second day of his new show being broadcast to 
a halfdozen stations 
but the retired judge who ruled over the ptl bankruptcy case said 
bakker could not handle the millions of dollars raised in his first 
show 
in his second broadcast since he was forced off the air two years 
ago in a sexandmoney scandal bakker asked listeners to send in 
100 or 25 or more in return for a crisis book of 
scripture 
bakker told viewers he did not want to raise funds every day but 
expressed the belief the heritage usa complex that was recently sold 
to a canadian businessman would be restored to the ptl members who 
paid for it 
meanwhile on cbs this morning rufus reynolds the judge who 
supervised the 65 million sale of ptls assets said his stomach 
cringed at the way bakker and his wife tammy faye handled the 
money he raised in the name of religion 
they just wasted a lot of it he said why take religious 
money collected for one purpose and throw it away for another 
thats the whole picture 
the broadcasts of the new jim and tammy show originated in 
the living room of the bakkers borrowed home and were sent by 
satellite to a six stations mostly cable in california ohio new 
york pennsylvania and louisiana bakker said 
bakker 49 and a former top associate were indicted last month 
on charges of diverting 4 million in ptl money for their benefit a 
trial date is expected to be set jan 17 
the bakkers had not preached together on television since january 
1987 two months later allegations surfaced of his 1980 sexual 
encounter with church secretary jessica hahn forcing bakker to 
leave the ptl ministry 
bakker said one of his supporters donated money to put him back 
on the air for the first month 
mrs bakker said tuesday she did not think daily fundraising 
would be necessary 
i believe god is going to start touching peoples hearts she 
said i believe that were not going to have to tell the people 
that god will tell the people 
but in the interview the judge who ordered the bakkers in a 
civil suit to repay the ministry 77 million in excessive benefits 
said jim bakker was not a very good businessman 
reynolds who retired as a bankruptcy judge saturday said bakker 
once chartered a plane for 130000 just to take him out to 
california kept it out there two weeks things like that just 
money that you wouldnt think about spending he did

immigration agents seeking illegal aliens 
unlawfully used pretexts to enter job sites and sweep up 
hispaniclooking workers civil rights lawyers argued tuesday at the 
start of a federal trial over the raids 
but a government lawyer contended the immigration and 
naturalization service has met constitutional requirements on 
searches and noted that rulings by judges in other parts of the 
country have upheld ins practices 
the central issue in the case before us district judge robert 
aguilar is the type of evidence the ins must show and what type of 
warrant it must present in entering a workplace and questioning and 
arresting workers who cannot prove legal residency 
an array of groups representing hispanics labor unions and 
employers is seeking strict regulation of the agents who go to 
factories and farms in search of illegal aliens 
the case affects only an ins region that covers most of northern 
and central california from bakersfield to the oregon line but 
lawyers in the case say it could be influential elsewhere 
in opening statements and testimony from the first of more than 
100 expected witnesses the plaintiffs contended the federal agency 
since at least 1982 has violated constitutional standards that 
require warrants to identify the person or evidence being seized 
witnesses will establish that there is a consistent pattern of 
nonspecific or general warrants said suzanne needles 
spokeswoman for the employment law office of the san francisco legal 
aid society 
a warrant would name two persons but the ins would arrive with 
as many as 20 agents with guns drawn and visible approach the 
property at high speed locate the two persons named and then 
approach anyone who appeared to be hispanic detaining us citizens 
as well as undocumented workers 
according to court papers in 25 northern california raids the 
ins identified 32 people in search warrants but made 481 arrests 
aguilar has issued a preliminary injunction outlining warrant 
requirements for workplace entries but francisco garcia a lawyer 
for the mexicanamerican legal defense and educational fund 
contended the ins violated those standards last year in raids on a 
sacramento factory and a fort bragg fishery 
us attorney joseph russoniello representing the ins contended 
the agency has the right to enter a workplace with a warrant based 
on information that illegal aliens are there once inside agents 
can question and arrest specific aliens he said 
the ins used the warrants of inspection solely for entry 
purposes and after entry independently developed the probable 
cause to arrest illegal aliens russoniello said in papers filed 
with the court 
the lawsuit seeks court orders requiring specific warrants to 
arrest workers and prohibiting the ins from targeting workers of 
hispanic ancestry for arrest and abuse 
the case stems from ins raids in 1982 known as operation jobs 
because they were supposed to create job openings for us citizens 
and legal residents the first witnesses were from a mushroom farm 
in petaluma that was raided by the ins in 1982 allegedly without a 
warrant or the owners consent 
aguilar has issued a number of rulings against the ins in the 
case but several have been reversed 
he declared in 1982 that agents violated privacy rights by 
surrounding a workplace and questioning workers on the mere 
suspicion that they might be illegal aliens 
after the supreme court overturned that ruling aguilar issued a 
new injunction in 1985 barring the ins from detaining or 
questioning workers who had not been specifically identified in a 
warrant he also prohibited the ins practice of referring to one or 
two workers in a warrant along with unspecified others 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1986 upheld aguilars 
finding that the ins had an apparent systematic policy and 
practice of illegal searches but the court overturned the 
requirement of specifically identifying workers

a jehovahs witness who was given a blood 
transfusion against her will won an appeal tuesday that set aside a 
lower courts order for the transfusion her lawyer said 
the lawyer donald ridley of the jehovahs witnesses said the 
appellate division of state supreme court in brooklyn also ruled 
that a hearing must be held before any new order for a transfusion 
is issued 
the woman denise nicoleau 35 of moriches is in critical 
condition after giving birth to a boy by caesarean section thursday 
at brookhaven memorial hospital on long island 
after the birth the woman continued to bleed and doctors 
performed an operation to stabilize her but those efforts failed 
and on friday doctors ordered a transfusion 
however ms nicoleau a registered nurse and her husband rico 
a radiologist told the hospital they did not want the transfusion 
because it conflicted with their religious beliefs 
jehovahs witnesses contend blood transfusions violate the 
biblical passage in leviticus that reads whatsoever man eats 
any manner of blood i will cut him off from among his people 
the hospital obtained a court order from state supreme court 
justice saverio fierro in hauppauge permitting the transfusion 
relatives surrounded ms nicoleaus bed in an attempt to prevent 
the transfusion three were arrested on criminal trespass charges 
hospital spokesman richard semple said tuesday that ms 
nicoleaus condition has improved but she remains critical he 
refused to comment further 
ridley said there is no proof that the transfusion kept his 
client alive rather he said it could have exposed her to fatal 
complications 
he said ms nicoleau doesnt want to die she wants her medical 
problems solved by nonblood means 
under state law competent adult patients generally have the 
right to determine their own medical treatment

former white house chief of staff donald regan 
says he hopes presidentelect bush will avoid president reagans 
baffling reluctance to give orders or even guidance to his close 
subordinates 
in a paperback reissue of his book for the record regan 
who was ousted as reagans chief of staff in february 1987 said 
bush immediately after his inauguration ought to tell his 
cabinet and his staff exactly what he wants them to do laying out 
his objectives in every field of policy in a way that cannot 
possibly be misunderstood 
in the paperback update of regans book which caused a stir in 
the spring of last year with its harsh judgments of reagans 
presidential management style regan also said bush should consider 
a recession inevitable and must be prepared to deal with it 
regan could not immediately be reached for comment on the chapter 
that he added to his original for the record and spokeswoman 
kathy reed said the former chief of staff was in florida the 
reissue of regans book is scheduled to hit the newstands and 
bookstores on feb 1 
sheila tate a spokeswoman at bushs transition headquarters 
here said that to my knowledge he bush has not solicited 
advice from donald regan i do believe they have always had a 
cordial relationship 
the initial publication of regans book caused a furor in the 
nations capital as reagan and his wife nancy denounced the 
former chief of staff for telling insider stories white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater labeled regans work as a kissandtell 
story in the mold of all books that seek to exploit the presidency 
or the first family for personal selfinterest 
in his initial book regan among other things depicted reagan 
as a handsoff president who was a reluctant decisionmaker and 
said much of the reagans schedule was dictated by nancys reliance 
on the advice of an astrologer 
in the new presidency the chapter regan added in the 
paperback to be published by st martins press inc the former 
chief of staff said that while he believes bush understands the 
lessons of reagans successes he also said bush must sometimes 
stand against his advisers 
as long as he listens to his own instincts and to the voice of 
his own experience the american people will be wellserved regan 
said of bush 
it is to be hoped that president bush will make it equally 
clear from the start of his administration that he has learned from 
reagans shortcomings his baffling reluctance to give orders or 
even guidance to his close subordinates and the tendency to permit 
some of his advisers to manage the presidency for effect rather than 
for results regan said 
he said bush must bring the white houses relationship with the 
news media under control so that he and his people spend the 
greater part of their time dealing with the reality of the nations 
problems rather than catering to the natural tendency of the media 
to transform the presidency into entertainment 
a source in the bush transition office declining to be named 
publicly said bush has not spoken with regan except during a chance 
encounter the pair had at burning tree country club a suburban 
maryland golf course when bush when there last summer to play golf 
with longtime friend james a baker iii

two courts on tuesday rejected appeals to 
block the hanging of two sikhs for the 1984 assassination of prime 
minister indira gandhi news agencies reported 
in one appeal the supreme court refused to consider kehar 
singhs petition that said his sentence should be commuted to life 
in prison because of excessive delay in carrying it out the united 
news of india and press trust of india reported 
the men were convicted and sentenced in 1986 
the news agencies also reported that the delhi high court 
rejected kehar singhs appeal challenging the presidents refusal to 
grant him clemency 
the other condemned man satwant singh is not appealing 
however kahar singhs appeals have also stayed his execution under 
indian law 
kehar singhs lawyers vowed to take the clemency part of his 
appeals before the supreme court on wednesday 
president ramaswamy venkataraman rejected clemency monday after 
the supreme court ordered him to reconsider his refusal in november 
he gave no explanation of mondays decision which automatically 
lifted a stay blocking execution of the two convicted men 
warrants reordering the execution were issued immediately after 
the presidents decision the date has been kept secret for security 
reasons 
the two men are being held on death row in new delhis maximum 
security tihar jail 
mrs gandhi was shot in the garden of her new delhi residence on 
oct 31 1984 by two of her sikh bodyguards

bodyguards minutes later the other was satwant singh 24 
kehar singh 54 is a maternal uncle of beant singh and unrelated 
to satwant singh he was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to 
death 
mrs gandhis assassination evidently was carried out in revenge 
for an army raid she had ordered on the golden temple in amritsar 
the holiest sikh shrine four months earlier to rid the complex of 
sikh militants holed up inside 
the militants have been fighting a sixyear guerrilla war for a 
separate nation in northern punjab state 
they claim discrimination by the countrys hindu majority who 
comprise more than 80 percent of indias 880 million people sikhs 
make up less than 2 percent of the national population but hold a 
slight majority in punjab 
more than 2400 people were killed in sikh militant violence in 
1988

the husband of a longmissing woman was 
charged with murder tuesday after his wifes body was found frozen 
in a locked ice chest at the couples home authorities said 
leonard tyburski 45 of canton township was arraigned in 35th 
district court on one count of murder in the death of dorothy 
tyburski 37 who disappeared in october 1985 the degree was not 
specified 
ive been a lawyer a prosecutor and a judge for more than 30 
years and this is definitely a little different said judge james 
garber who arraigned tyburski its not your everyday thing 
it has some indications of edgar allen poe and even some alfred 
hitchcock the judge said after ordering tyburski held without 
bond in the wayne county jail 
tyburski is in charge of attendance at mackenzie high school in 
detroit school officials said he will undergo psychiatric 
evaluation to determine if he is competent to stand trial garber 
said 
one of the couples two daughters 20yearold kelly tyburski 
pried the lock off the chesttype freezer and found her mothers 
clothed body monday according to detectives 
i believe the freezer was there during the whole time period 
but it never came into play said canton township police detective 
keith lazar he said investigators searched for the woman for about 
two years before dropping the case for a lack of leads 
the daughter was suspicious the actions of her father she was 
dreaming about it that her mother was somewhere in the house 
he said her father made up stories about why the key was missing 
for the freezer 
the cause of mrs tyburskis death was undetermined lazar said 
an autopsy was scheduled for later this week 
neighbors of the family said the tyburskis seemed friendly but 
that they seldom spoke with mrs tyburski who kept to herself and 
raised rabbits in the garage of the familys suburban home about 25 
miles west of detroit 
tyburski had reported his wife missing said lt larry stewart a 
canton township police detective assigned to the case and he told 
police his wife may have left because of emotional problems stemming 
from the death of a sister 
police never suspected foul play in the disappearance and handled 
it as a missing person case questioning tyburski more as a source 
of help than as a murder suspect he said 
weve done a lot of work and come up with nothing he said 
all investigations led nowhere

the environmental protection agency proposed 
requirements tuesday for the land disposal of 72 types of wastes 
part of a continuing program that eventually will ban the disposal 
of more than 450 hazardous materials unless they are first treated 
the epa said the 72 waste products under the latest proposed 
regulations involve about 17 billion gallons a year of hazardous 
waste including some cyanidecontaining industrial wastes 
the proposed treatment is expected to cost industries involved 
about 25 million a year the agency said 
the most toxic and most widely discharged wastes already are 
banned from land disposal without prior treatment under existing epa 
regulations covering 62 types of wastes 
the agency said in a statement that most of the 72 types of 
wastes covered by the latest proposed regulation will meet the 
proposed treatment requirements if incincerated before being buried

earthquake in armenia 
french and british broadcast reports said the survivors existed

rep robert dornan offered advice to 
presidentelect bush on tuesday for dealing with the aids epidemic 
launch a justsayno campaign involving sex and make experimental 
drugs available to people with the disease 
theres no such thing as safe sex theres safer sex dornan 
rcalif told a news conference 
dornan said a special review board should be set up to approve 
use of experimental drugs on terminally ill patients who request 
them 
in a letter to bush dornan also suggested that federal money 
intended to finance treatment of aids patients should be funneled 
through a single federal program 
such a program would replace the existing programs that are 
overburdened inadequate and inappropriate to the specific health 
care needs of aids patients dornan wrote 
i also believe that aids can only be brought under control 
through a fundamental shift in our values pertaining to sexual 
relations dornan wrote that is why i would encourage you 
and your eventual surgeon general to adopt a just say no approach 
to dealing with the question of what constitutes safe sex 
dornan said he was not making a moral statement about homosexual 
behavior but was concerned about stopping the spread of the disease 
which renders the body incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections 
he said it was fine if homosexuals wanted to practice safe 
sex by using erotic telephone conversations

a frostbitten man sought in a weekend 
manhunt after the fatal shooting of a sheriffs deputy was charged 
in his hospital bed tuesday with 10 felony counts stemming from the 
death 
raul lopez 31 was told of the charges in his room at flagstaff 
regional medical center where he was in fair condition with 
frostbite 
the charges include assault and burglary stemming from the 
saturday night shooting of deputy bob varner and the subsequent 
manhunt 
lopez was one of two men sought by police the other douglas 
savory 45 who police believe was the primary gunman in varners 
death was found dead monday with a selfinflicted gunshot wound in 
the face 
sedillo set bond at 311675 for lopez and scheduled a jan 11 
preliminary hearing in navajo county superior court in holbrook 
police arrested lopez on monday without incident after he was 
seen limping along a street in holbrook about 33 miles east of 
winslow where savory was found dead 
varner 51 was shot three times on saturday night after he tried 
to make a traffic arrest on interstate 40 the eastwest freeway 
across northern arizona he died monday 
the attackers abandoned their stolen california car near joseph 
city and briefly took hostage a joseph city couple in their home 
the men stole the couples car and abandoned it in a ditch fleeing 
on foot authorities said 
navajo county sheriff gary butler called savory an extremely 
dangerous man on monday he said savory shot at officers and a 
police helicopter and then shot himself 
every time we had contact with him he turned on us butler 
said he shot officer varner before he even had a chance to react 
he turned on two of our cars while we were trying to pursue him 
every time that we made contact with him i ended up with several 
bullet holes in my patrol cars 
police said little was known about lopez who they described as a 
survivalist 
sedillo said the absence of homicide charges left him no choice 
but to allow bond for lopez he said county officials had told him

arizona law allows a person to be charged with murder or other 
felonies committed as the result of the defendants participation in 
a different crime

went to the cabin and saw that someone had broken in 
the cabin is less than a quartermile from interstate 40 and 
traffic was rerouted around a 33mile stretch for at least six hours 
on monday until savorys body was found officers cheered when they 
learned savory was dead 
schmidt said a california warrant from san bernardino county 
accused savory of robbery and kidnapping in a september gunstore 
robbery in which five other people have been arrested savory also 
allegedly was involved in manufacturing and sale of illegal weapons 
and explosives schmidt said 
lopez apparently separated from savory on saturday night and 
spent part of that night hiding under a boat along the little 
colorado river officials said lopez walked along the river sunday 
to holbrook where he spent the night at a motel they said

former teamsters president roy williams 
says he reluctantly helped mob bosses obtain a 60 million loan from 
a union pension fund on the advice of jimmy hoffa after his family 
was threatened 
williams said two men working for nick civella the late kansas 
city crime boss blindfolded him in 1974 and took him to a building 
and threatened to kill his wife and children if he didnt use his 
influence to obtain the loan for civella 
so what the heck can you do williams said i went along 
thats all and who are you if you dont protect your family 
his remarks were published tuesday in the warrensburg 
starjournal which interviewed him last month at his farm south of 
warrensburg near leeton 
williams 73 and in poor health was released from a federal 
prison in springfield in september after serving three years of a 
10year sentence for attempting to bribe thensen howard cannon of 
nevada in 1979 
williams was teamsters president from 1981 until april 1983 when 
he was forced to resign in order to stay out of prison while 
appealing his conviction 
he is cooperating with the us justice department in new york 
which has filed a civil suit aimed at removing teamsters officials 
and mobsters who allegedly have corrupted the union last month he 
gave a deposition from his home that was beamed to new york by 
satellite so that a federal judge could observe the proceedings and 
make comments 
williams joined the teamsters in 1938 as a truck driver and later 
became a protege of hoffa who was teamsters president from 1958 to 
1971 hoffa disappeared in 1975 and was presumed murdered 
williams said hoffa advised that he help get the 60 million loan 
for civella and the argent corp to buy las vegas casinos 
he said you can run but you cant hide you can quit but you 
cant hide and they were here a long time before us and they will 
be here a long time after we are gone and they are in every large 
local union every council including the aflcio and they thrive 
on pension plans because they dont intend to work thats where 
the money is 
williams who was paid 1500 a month by civella from late 1974 
until mid1981 in exchange for securing the loans said the loans 
were repaid and that the union no longer has money invested in las 
vegas 
williams said he knew nothing about the skimming of gambling 
receipts from the las vegas casinos which led to the argent corp 
skimming trial that resulted in prison terms for mob bosses from 
chicago milwaukee cleveland and kansas city 
in the interview williams claimed he never attempted to bribe 
the nevada senator and that he was set up by frank fitzsimmons who 
was teamsters president while hoffa was in prison 
williams was convicted in 1982 along with four other men of 
offering cannon exclusive rights to buy a choice piece of 
teamsterowned property in las vegas at a bargain price in 
exchange the senator was to help in defeating legislation to 
deregulate the trucking industry cannon was never charged and the 
legislation became law

an adviser to plo chief yasser arafat said tuesday 
that investigators should not expect too much help from the group in 
tracking down the bombers of pan am flight 103 
the adviser khaled hassen repeated the palestine liberation 
organizations offer to help in the investigation but he said fbi 
director william sessions was mistaken when he asserted sunday that 
arafat has a wealth of information to give to the investigation 
i think the plo is ready to help but that doesnt mean what the 
director of the fbi said that arafat has a wealth of information 
hassen said in an interview with britains channel 4 comercial 
network 
it doesnt mean we have a file that we can pick up and give to 
the americans and say well it was done this way by so and so he 
said 
hassen was asked if a radical palestinian faction led by abu 
nidal which opposes arafats peace overtures to israel might be 
responsible for the dec 21 crash in which 270 people died 
i doubt that abu nidal would do something like that he said 
because they the victims were americans abu nidal was always 
against israelis and against palestinians loyal to arafat but not 
against americans not american people 
asked what arafat would do if it turned out that a palestinian 
group was responsible hassen said all those who are under the 
protection of any of the arab governments we can do nothing to 
them if arafat can get hold of them he will put them in front of 
the court 
he said he thought arafat would not hand over the suspects to the 
united states or britain for trial 
if he got them and they are palestinians he has to put them in 
front of the palestinian court he did not elaborate 
hassen said he did not think the bombing was the work of 
palestinians seeking to undermine the plos peace efforts 
i dont see any organization which is up to the standard of 
doing what was done if it is a bomb and if it is that kind of 
technology they are talking about on television there must be 
either a government or a highly experienced secret branch 
somewhere he said 
another plo official faisal aouidha said in a separate 
interview that it would not be difficult to discover the 
perpetrators 
i am sure there are ways and means we can find out one way of 
the other and its not very difficult to find out aouidha a plo 
spokesman in london said on the british broadcasting corp 
television news 
we know the people we know how to get with them the countries 
they live in and we are really convinced its not palestinian groups 
which have done it which gives us a better way even to go into an 
investigation of the matter he said

col moammar gadhafi has stepped up a campaign to 
improve libyas foreign image and rebut charges that he is building 
a chemical weapons plant 
in recent weeks the libyan leader purportedly helped free two 
french girls held hostage in lebanon offered to return the body of 
a us pilot killed in a 1986 attack on libya and invited 
television correspondents to interview him 
in addition he has appealed to international organizations from 
the united nations to the arab league to defend him and he has used 
friendly nations to convey to washington his contention the plant 
does not produce chemical weapons 
there is no doubt that the libyans have launched what has 
become known as their charm offensive in europe said a british 
foreign office official tuesday speaking on condition of anonymity 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
tuesday that libya has secretly started producing limited quantities 
of chemical weapons at the plant near rabtha about 50 miles 
southwest of tripoli 
a statement tuesday by the official libyan news agency jana 
accused the united states of lying about the plant as an excuse to 
attack libya and kill gadhafi 
the united states along with at least 20 other countries 
produces chemical weapons 
attention has focused on libyanus relations in recent weeks 
after president reagan told an interviewer that a military attack on 
the plant near the libyan capital of tripoli was under 
consideration although gadhafi says the facility makes 
pharmaceuticals 
a us carrier group steamed toward the mediterranean on tuesday 
in what the pentagon said was a normal rotation of forces but the 
movement prompted speculation of an impending strike 
italian newspapers and politicians billed the ships as a direct 
threat to libya the us navy has said the movement of the 
nuclearpowered aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt and 12 other 
ships in its battle group is part of a previously scheduled 
routine deployment to the us sixth fleet a reagan spokesman on 
tuesday declined comment on the reports 
gadhafis reaction to the us charges is more conciliatory than 
his response to threats of an attack three years ago but whether he 
will succeed in winning allies is unknown 
i think its pretty clear that he did not believe the us 
would bomb the country in 86 said lisa anderson a columbia 
university professor and a leading us specialist on libya 
now i think he takes threats on the part of the us and 
even floating ideas in oped pieces by people who are not part of 
the reagan administration extremely seriously 
shortly before the april 15 1986 strike on tripoli and 
benghazi gadhafi threatened a campaign of subversion in the united 
states earlier that year he defied us forces to cross his line 
of death in the gulf of sidra off libya 
but since the us state department alleged in september that 
libya was on the verge of making chemical weapons gadhafi has 
portrayed himself as the victim of us aggression 
after the united states said it was talking with allies about a 
possible raid on the factory gadhafi called dec 24 for the release 
of hostages particularly two french girls held in lebanon by a 
libyanbacked palestinian group for a year 
marielaure betille and her sister virginie were handed over 
to french officials in tripoli six days later gadhafi followed up 
with an appeal on french tv for the release of the girls mother 
but in france newspapers alleged he was using the children to 
boost his image 
anderson said in her telephone interview that during his 20 years 
in power gadhafi won support domestically but has not learned how 
to generate positive international public opinion 
gadhafi also offered to return the body of a us soldier using 
the vatican as an intermediary there has been no indication whether 
the offer will be fulfilled 
arab governments have rallied behind gadhafi and the arab league 
council met in emergency session in late december to denounce the 
us warning 
gadhafi dispatched a top aide staff maj abdulsalam jalloud to 
italy in november for talks italys foreign minister giulio 
andreotti then sent a telegram to us secretary of state george 
shultz describing libyan assurances about the plant 
libya again through the italians then invited the united states 
to visit the plant washington said it needed more than one trip 
libya says it abides by all accords on chemical arms it plans to 
send jalloud to a multinational conference on chemical weapons this 
week in paris

rescue workers ended their search 
inside the sunken bateau mouche on tuesday and said all bodies now 
were off the tourist boat which capsized on new years eve and 
drowned at least 53 revelers 
two bodies were recovered from the bay on tuesday 
valmir rabelo of the fire departments maritime group said that 
any further search for victims will be on the bottom of guanabara 
bay we doubt we will find more bodies though its possible one or 
two might wash up on rio beaches in the next days 
the victims had sailed out hoping to watch a fireworks display 
from the ocean off famed copacabana beach 
police still have no exact count of how many were on the 
flatbottomed boat when it sank 15 minutes before the new year 
estimates range from 130 to 150 owners said the only passenger list 
sank with the boat 
the number of rescued also is not known operators of one boat 
said they alone saved 30 people 
rio gov wellington moreira franco told a news conference 
wednesday evidence shows that someone is responsible for this 
tragedy and they will be punished we will make sure that those who 
are responsible for the sinking will go where they belong to 
jail 
survivors told of overloading of not as many life jackets as 
needed of life preservers tied to boat rails and of the boat 
swaying precariously from side to side in the rough seas shortly 
before it sank 
but a navy communique on monday said the excursion boat was 
neither overcrowded nor dangerous and carried more than enough life 
preservers according to inspections on dec 28 and just two hours 
before the tragedy

the threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals agreed

major charges against north could be scuttled if the government

but an administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was too early to assess the impact of gesells 
decision on the case against north

involving norths right to a fair trial 
gesells refusal to accomodate some of the objections of us 
intelligence agencies to divulging certain classified information in 
the prosecution exhibits also raises new problems for walsh 
the judge is insisting for instance that references to iran 
israel and central american nations remain in the documents despite 
a government request that the nations be referred to by letter the 
cia and other agencies also object to the judges requirement that 
the full text of intelligence reports be presented verbatim 
gesell meanwhile granted walsh permission to subpoena norths 
daily diaries of his activities that were kept throughout his 
involvement in the irancontra affair 
the judge gave north until jan 18 to either produce the spiral 
notebooks or object to turning over the material which would be a 
key piece of evidence for prosecutors 
in the dispute over the summary of the defense case the defends 
contends that giving the 162page document to walsh will give 
prosecutors an unfair look at the defense strategy for the former 
national security council aide 
the appellate panel agreed to consider norths request for a writ 
of mandamus that would permanently bar gesell from turning over the 
defense summary to walsh it also issued an administrative stay that 
prohibited gesell from proceeding with his original plan to give 
walsh the summary by 4 pm on tuesday 
the purpose of the administrative stay is to permit the court 
sufficient opportunity to consider the pending motion and petition 
and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits 
said the brief order by circuit judges kenneth starr james buckley 
and david sentelle 
the stay has no time limit so it could delay the scheduled start 
of norths trial on charges he conspired with three codefendants to 
illegally divert more than 14 million in usiran armssale 
profits to the nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
the summary would provide prosecutors with a detailed road map 
to the defense case and to potential crossexamination of 
prosecution witnesses norths lawyers said in court papers 
no defendant in the history of federal criminal jurisprudence 
has been compelled to reveal before trial the details of anticipated 
defense testimony on virtually every disputed factual issue in the 
case norths lawyers said 
in reply papers filed tuesday walsh told the appeals court that 
he needed access to the defense summary in order to determine 
whether the classified information north wants to disclose in 
testimony is relevant to the case 
under the classified information procedures act the defense must 
notify the government of its intention to disclose any classified 
information at public trial 
in addition to seeking to disclose thousands of pages of 
documents north has proposed revealing a variety of secrets 
possibly about covert operations while questioning current and 
former government officials called as witnesses in the case 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and richard v secord also charged in the 
case are scheduled to be tried separately

the only sailor sent to the brig for the 
drowning of a recruit during rescueswimmer training has been 
released but neither his case nor the debate over the navys 
practices is over 
a courtmartial in september convicted petty officer 3rd class 
michael combe 28 of negligent homicide and conspiracy to commit 
battery in the death of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 
combes 90day sentence would have been up dec 21 and he was 
released about two weeks early for good behavior said cmdr dennis 
hessler a spokesman for the pensacolabased naval education and 
training command he also was reduced in rank one grade 
mirecki drowned march 2 in a training pool at pensacola naval air 
station after several instructors pushed him back in the water when 
he panicked and climbed out shouting that he wanted to quit the 
voluntary training the job of a rescue swimmer is to jump out of 
helicopters to aid downed fliers 
combe was accused of repeatedly forcing mireckis head under 
water 
other students said they were ordered to face away from mirecki 
and sing the star spangled banner while he was in the water with 
combe 
combe of tempe ariz is on leave but has been attached to the 
pensacola bases facilities maintenance department pending further 
action on his case hessler said it is unlikely he will return to 
the rescue swimmer school he said 
the courtmartials verdict will not be final until it is 
reviewed by vice adm john s disher chief of naval education and 
training 
disher who could approve or reject the decision has yet to 
receive a transcript of the case and hessler said it would be at 
least a month more before the admiral decides 
at that point combe can appeal to the judge advocate generals 
office in washington dc his lawyers have said they intend to 
appeal if the admiral upholds the decision 
once the admirals review is complete combes commanding officer 
could recommend to the naval military personnel command in 
washington that the sailor receive an administrative discharge one 
reason allowed for an administrative discharge is conviction of a 
felony which would include negligent homicide hessler said 
mireckis death spurred numerous changes designed to make 
rescueswimmer training safer and a review of all hazarous training 
in the navy but the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress issued an interim report that charged the navy 
failed to go far enough to improve the safety of rescueswimmer 
training 
the new regulations prohibit instructors from touching trainees 
and require training to cease immediately if a student is panicky 
fatigued or asks to quit 
sharks and daisies the exercise being conducted at the time 
of mireckis death also was banned in that drill instructors 
playing the role of panicked drowning victims would grab trainees in 
head holds the students were supposed to extricate themselves by 
dragging the instructors underwater to break their holds 
the interim gao report stated that the new rules allowing 
students to drop out or take time out are not adequately 
formalized or standardized leaving too much room to instructor 
discretion 
the report also contended instructors are inadquately screened to 
determine their suitability for the highrisk training and dont 
receive proper training for that job 
courtmartial testimony revealed mirecki had a fear of being 
dragged under water but that information was not given to 
instructors although it was available from his training and medical 
records 
a pathologist concluded mirecki literally was scared to death 
when his phobia triggered heart failure that was followed by 
drowning 
four other enlisted instructors received administrative penalties 
of rank reductions or fines in the case and the commanding officer 
of the naval aviation schools command was reprimanded before his 
retirement earlier this year 
one other courtmartial was held lt thomas a torchia 32 of 
princeton ill was acquitted of dereliction of duty torchia had 
been officer in charge of the swimmer school

investigators have little hope of ever 
finding the missing bodies of 28 people killed in the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 police sources said tuesday 
in london the head of the us federal aviation administration 
called for tighter security for all american flights in europe and 
the middle east in the wake of the bombing of the jumbo jet 
a government prosecutor in west germany said the bomb had been in 
the forward luggage compartment that contained baggage loaded both 
in frankfurt and london 
flight 103 exploded over scotland and crashed dec 21 killing 
all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground flaming wreckage was 
scattered over 150 square miles of countryside 
police sources speaking on condition they not be identified 
said investigators see little chance that the missing bodies of 20 
passengers and eight residents would ever be found 
they are believed to have died in the sherwood crescent area of 
lockerbie where parts of the planes fuselage and wings crashed 
forming a 30footdeep crater investigators fear that little or 
nothing remains of them the sources said 
the search is still going on for bodies and it will continue 
but it would be quite unrealistic for anyone to have an 
expectation that we would be able to find all of the victims 
bodies said police superintendent angus kennedy 
kennedy said between 80 and 90 percent of the planes structure 
had been located and charted on maps including most of the huge 
tail section but only 20 percent had been picked up 
collecting the wreckage is a long process because many pieces 
must be picked up by helicopter from a huge partly inaccessible 
area he said 
t allen mcartor head of the faa met with representatives of 
us airlines operating at gatwick airport and called for a 
heightened level of security on all american flights operating out 
of european and middle eastern airports 
mcartor told airport and security chiefs he wanted to see greater 
use of screening halls where only selected baggage now is thoroughly 
searched the officials agreed but emphasized problems of space and 
expense 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 switching 
to the larger boeing 747 at londons heathrow airport 
in london the independent newspaper said one of the items found 
by searchers is a piece of the luggage that belonged to lebanese 
student khalid jaafar who news reports have said may have 
unwittingly carried the bomb aboard 
the independent quoted an unidentified civilian searcher as 
saying that part of a zippered bag that was recovered contained the 
21yearold students identity card and a roll of currency from a 
country in the middle east 
the bag was clearly nowhere near where the bomb exploded the 
searcher was quoted as saying 
kennedy refused to comment 
jaafars father nazir who lives in dearborn mich has denied 
us and british reports that his son who lived in frankfurt may 
have been duped by middle east terrorists into carrying the bomb 
aboard 
hubert harth a spokesman for the frankfurt prosecutor said the 
bomb that destroyed the jet was in the forward luggage compartment 
which contained all of the baggage from frankfurt airport and some 
of the baggage from heathrow 
thats where the bomb was but we still dont know whether it 
got on board the flight in frankfurt or in london harth said 
noting that the information came from scotland yard 
an adviser to plo chief yasser arafat said investigators should 
not expect too much help from the palestine liberation organization 
in tracking down the bombers 
the adviser khaled hassen said in an interview with britains 
channel 4 comercial network that fbi director william sessions was 
mistaken when he asserted sunday that arafat has a wealth of 
information to contribute 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said 
his government was ready to help find those responsible for the 
crash but did not give specifics 
as search teams continued to hunt for wreckage and victims 
police said 126 of the 242 bodies recovered had been released to 
relatives 
in lockerbie more than 130 pan am employees from around the 
world were expected to join about 100 relatives of the crash victims 
at a memorial service wednesday at dryfesdale presbyterian parish 
church 
les jardine spokesman for the dumfries and galloway regional 
council said the 2500 residents of lockerbie hope the service will 
mark the end of the international attention the town has received 
for the past two weeks and enable them to return slowly to normal 
life

oil from a 231000gallon spill off 
the central washington coast nearly two weeks ago has drifted more 
than 100 miles into the strait of juan de fuca separating the state 
from vancouver island 
the spill has killed more than 3200 sea birds state officials 
said with more expected to die despite handcleaning by volunteers 
the latest bird cleaning station was set up tuesday at neah bay on 
the northwest tip of the olympic peninsula 
for residents of port angeles on the southern shore of the 
strait the appearance of oil brought to mind the december 1985 
spill of 239000 gallons of alaska crude into the citys harbor when 
the a tanker ran aground the worst oil disaster in washingtons 
waters estimates of birds killed in that disaster ranged as high as 
4000 
oil from the dec 22 has been detected as far south as newport 
ore and as far north as the coast of british columbia a 300mile 
stretch the leak began when a tugboat towing an oil barge punched a 
hole in the barge in high seas the hole was plugged and the barge 
taken to portland ore for repairs 
damage to the coastline from the oil and the cleanup including 
raking up the beaches and the use of helicopters and other machines 
will be hard to measure said chuck janda olympic national parks 
chief ranger 
forty beachcleaners worked tuesday on northern wilderness 
beaches soiled over the weekend when storm waves brought in oil 
thought to have dissipated at sea said doug zimmer a spokesman for 
the state department of wildlife 
roughly 5000 birds have been contaminated by the oil he said 
volunteers recovered more than 2600 birds which are cleaned and 
kept in holding ponds until natural oils critical to their buoyancy 
return but about 800 have died 
volunteers in the neah bay area reported seeing flocks of birds 
unable to fly but resisting capture a dead oilcoated seal also 
was found near the bay though the cause of its death was unknown 
washed and healthy birds are being shuttled from the biggest bird 
cleanup center at ocean shores near the site of the spill to hood 
canal a saltwater inlet 60 miles inland from the coast where the 
birds wont meet with more oil zimmer said 
thirty cleaned birds were released monday and tuesday along hood 
canal near members of their own species he said last week 12 
birds were released

president reagan will undergo surgery at 
walter reed army hospital in washington on saturday for correction 
of a longstanding contraction of the ring finger of his left hand 
his doctor said tuesday 
col john hutton the army doctor who is the white house 
physician described the procedure as elective surgery and said it 
should not interrupt the presidents normal schedule except that he 
will have a bandage on his left hand 
hutton said the president would be admitted to the hospital 
friday the operation would be performed on saturday and the 
president is expected to return to the white house on sunday 
he said an axillary block a form of regional anesthesia numbing 
the arm would be used for the operation he said no general 
anesthesia is anticipated 
the operation is expected to take two to three hours he said 
the presidents contracture was minimal but present when he 
took office in 1981 and has been followed over the past eight 
years hutton said within the past year it has progressed to 
the degree that surgical therapy is now necessary 
the condition is known as dupuytrens contracture after baron 
dupuytren a french surgeon who described it in 1833 
the white house described the condition as a progressive 
usually painless contraction of the digits which is common in men 
over 60 
reagan 77 last underwent surgery in january 1987 when he was 
operated upon for a prostate condition 
reagans previous operations as president have been performed at 
bethesda naval hospital white house spokesman roman popadiuk said 
walter reed was chosen because the hand surgeons who will perform 
the operation are at that hospital 
the physicians will be dr george bogumill of georgetown 
university a consultant at walter reed col alan smith and maj 
paul perlik of the hand service at walter reed and hutton 
hutton said the president would rest in his room after the 
operation and should be ambulatory by afternoon the surgery is 
scheduled to begin at 730 am est 
the white house distributed a fact sheet from the hand surgery 
section of the walter reed orthopedic department saying the 
condition most commonly affects the ring or little finger or both 
the sheet said it affects men up to ten times more frequently 
than women and the chances of a person contracting it over the age 
of 60 may be as much as one in five 
it said the treatment when surgery is required consists of 
surgical removal of the affected tissue when the first knuckle is 
contracted or bent inward 30 degrees or more or when the second 
or third knuckled are affected it said the operation usually 
results in full correction at the first knuckle but often leaves 
some residual contraction at the second knuckle 
after treatment it said the patient wears a bulky dresing from 
the fingers to the upper arm for one to three days active motion is 
encouraged 
a smaller dressing is then used sutures are removed 10 to 14 
days after surgery 
it takes about six to eight weeks for the patient to recover the 
ability to use the affected finger 
dr charles lane a hand specialist in private practice in 
beverly hills said the cause of the disease is unknown 
he said the disease causes a thickeninging of the gristle under 
the skin resulting in limited motion of the fingers 
it pulls the fingers down so the fingers cant be 
straightened lane said 
he said this could be particularly troublesome in the case of 
someone like reagan who has to shake hands frequently because he 
would be tickling peoples palms 
also its hard when you shave and when yhou try to get your 
hands in your pockets he said 
he said the operation is delicate but not particularly risky 
when told that reagan would spend friday and saturday nights in 
the hospital the doctor commented medicare would never pay for 
that they make us do them all as outpatients two nights is 
probably just a matter of convenience 
lane said patients are often required to wear a dynamic or 
spring splint to help straighten the fingers after the operation 
and sometimes also do exercises as part of their therapy

there were 132976 cases of aids 
reported to the world health organization by 177 countries by the 
end of 1988 according to a who survey released tuesday 
the total which represents all cases ever reported to who is 
28 percent higher than that of nov 30 chiefly due to updated 
reports from the united states with 80538 cases as of dec 14 and 
from other western countries 
uganda with the secondhighest number of cases 5508 has not 
filed a new report since august france ranks third with 4874 cases 
listed by the end of september 
the actual number of cases worldwide is estimated by who at more 
than 350000 dr jonathan mann director of the whos global 
program on aids predicted that during 1989 and 1990 more than 
400000 new cases are expected to occur with another 600000 
anticipated in the following three years 
the who estimates at least 5 million people are infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids sharply reducing its 
previous projections of the spread of the disease about 20 percent 
to 30 percent of hivinfected people develop aids within five years 
according to who 
in march 1987 a who report said 50 million to 100 million people 
may be infected by 1991 but a new estimate last month put that 
projected figure at 6 million to 7 million dr mann spoke of 
dramatic evidence of behavioral change in some highrisk groups 
including homosexuals prostitutes and intravenous drug users 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

a computer hacker charged with infiltrating 
systems in the united states and england was declared a very 
very great danger to the community tuesday by a judge who renewed 
his imprisonment without bail 
us district judge mariana r pfaelzer made her ruling after 
kevin david mitnick 25 pleaded innocent to computer fraud charges 
and his attorney urged the judge to release him on bail 
attorney alan rubin argued that mitnick is being held 
incommunicado and is being treated more harshly than men charged 
with violent crimes 
my client is being portrayed as some sort of machiavellian 
figure either out of government paranoia or some other 
government agenda im not aware of said attorney alan rubin 
rubin accused the government of exaggerating the seriousness of 
the case and suggested that mitnick be released to his family with a 
tap placed on his telephone 
but the judge citing mitnicks previous misdemeanor conviction 
on a similar computer related crime rejected that suggestion 
isnt it highly likely hell do it again she asked 
rubin insisted he wouldnt repeat the action a mitnick associate 
who turned him in has told of the young mans genius with computers 
and his alleged ability to tap into computers operated by the 
national security agency among others 
the supersecret nsa is responsible for electronic eavesdropping 
gathering data from us spy satellites and conducting sophisticated 
signals intelligence 
assistant us attorney leon weidman said he will file further 
charges against mitnick next week we believe hes extremely 
dangerous and should not be allowed any access to a computer or 
telephone weidman said 
mitnick is being held in a maximumsecurity cell at the federal 
metropolitan detention center where he is not allowed to make phone 
calls unless he is monitored by an administrator 
a federal grand jury indicted him dec 20 on computer fraud 
charges he is accused of unauthorized use of mci longdistance 
codes to tap into computers at leeds university in england and the 
university of southern california and of causing 4 million damage 
to a digital equipment corp computer system 
leonard dicicco 23 an associate who reported mitnick to 
authorities has described the defendant as a big fat slob of a 
guy who couldnt get through a day without breaking into a computer 
somewhere 
its scary to think of the things hes capable of said 
dicicco 
the 511 240pound mitnick clad in a khaki prison uniform 
answered not guilty twice when asked for his plea to the 
charges against him 
his trial was tentatively set for feb 21 but judge pfaelzer said 
that would be changed if a new indictment is filed 
i have no doubt that he is a very very great danger to the 
community she said i also believe he is a flight risk 
she ordered restrictions on his telephone use to remain in effect 
when rubin objected to mitnick being housed in a high security 
area of the prison ms pfaelzer declared the court thinks high 
security is entirely appropriate with this defendant 
rubin said he believed authorities were reacting to technology 
fear and other reports of computer viruses elsewhere in the nation 
mitnick reportedly used the code name condor in his 
electronic activities taking the name from the 1975 film three 
days of the condor in which robert redford played a cia 
researcher and telephone expert 
dicicco contends that mitnick is obsessed with two things fast 
food and computers all he did was eat fat burgers drink slurpees 
and work on computers dicicco said

a federal judge has given singer wayne newton 
until feb 1 to accept a reduced 53 million award in his libel 
suit against nbc or face the prospect of proving his case again in a 
new trial 
us district judge myron crockers decision filed last week in 
fresno calif came after attorneys for newton argued for a new 
trial solely on damages while nbc attorneys sought a complete rerun 
of the original 1986 las vegas trial which lasted eight weeks 
crocker said in the ruling that he was convinced that the 
issues of liability and damages are so intertwined that they should 
be determined by the same jury 
newtons attorney morton galane was not immediately available 
for comment on what the entertainer would decide to do 
newton won a record 228 million verdict against the network 
when a jury ruled the singer was defamed in a series of nbc 
broadcasts that linked him to organized crime figures 
crocker however later threw out all but 53 million of the 
award and gave newton the option of accepting the money or seeking 
a new trial strictly on damages 
both sides submitted lengthy legal briefs in october in us 
district court in los angeles where the case was transferred for a 
retrial scheduled for may 
the newtonnbc case stems from an oct 6 1980 broadcast 
entitled wayne newton and the law 
in the report nbc correspondent brian ross reported that newton 
had gone to organized crime figure guido penosi for help with a 
problem 
newton argued the report left the impression that his october 
1980 purchase of the aladdin hotel was linked to organized crime 
the hotel has since been sold and is currently owned by japanese 
businessman ginji yasuda 
galane has suggested he will call as witnesses such luminaries as 
president reagan frank sinatra and lucille ball to testify in 
newtons behalf for assessing damages in a new trial

a judge ruled tuesday that joel steinberg 
accused in the slaying of the 6yearold girl he illegally adopted 
must submit to an examination by a psychiatrist retained by 
prosecutors 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax who is presiding over 
the murder trial said he would grant the manhattan district 
attorneys request to have steinberg examined because his lawyers 
appear to be presenting an insanity defense even though they are not 
saying so 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer is charged with 
seconddegree murder in the november 1987 beating death of lisa 
steinberg the girl he illegally obtained from an unwed teenager 
and raised as his own 
the judges ruling forces steinberg to decide whether he will 
argue that he is not criminally responsible by reason of mental 
disease or defect 
when a defendant claims he is insane and therefore not 
responsible the prosecution has the right to examine him to try to 
disprove that claim 
rothwax left it to lawyers for both sides to work out an exam 
schedule 
the judge said that if the defense does not invoke an insanity 
defense at any point in the remainder of the trial then the 
prosecution psychiatrist will not be called and there will be no 
harm to the defense case 
if the defense clearly presents an insanity defense later then 
the prosecution will be prepared to rebut the testimony the judge 
said 
ira london one of steinbergs lawyers said he will probably not 
argue insanity and will probably refuse to allow prosecution 
psychiatrists to examine steinberg he said the judge misunderstood 
the defense position 
rothwax noted that the defense last month asked to be allowed to 
enter an insanity plea and was turned down with permission to try 
again

a judge on tuesday ordered dartmouth college 
to lift suspensions against two former editors of the dartmouth 
review a conservative student newspaper citing the bias of a 
disciplinary board member 
grafton county superior court judge bruce mohls ruling did not 
address first amendment claims and other broad issues in the 
students underlying lawsuit which he termed a massive legal 
battleground 
in a state lawsuit and a companion federal action review 
staffers accuse dartmouth of violating their rights and 
discriminating against conservatives the two former editors sought 
reinstatement while they pursue those lawsuits 
mohl also left the door open to further disciplinary action by 
the ivy league school against former dartmouth review staffers 
christopher baldwin and john sutter by a reconstituted disciplinary 
panel 
baldwin 21 of hinsdale ill and sutter 22 of st louis 
were suspended in march for 18 months for their role in a classroom 
encounter with a black professor of music william cole a third 
review staffer involved in the incident has completed his sixmonth 
suspension a fourth served probation 
the students who are white denied any racial motivation but the 
incident sparked renewed racial tensions on the hanover campus 
mohl ruled that disciplinary panel member albert lavalleys 
presence on the panel was fundamentally unfair to the students 
lavalleys objectivity was disputed because of a letter he had 
signed four months before the incident the letter condemned the 
offcampus weekly review for slanderous articles that 
seriously threatened the principle of academic freedom and 
complained of sexist and racist characterizations of faculty 
members 
no citation is needed to conclude that the letter lavalley 
signed and that he testified that he agreed with demonstrates 
substantial bias and prejudice on his part against students who 
write for the dartmouth review mohl wrote 
had the content of the letter been known to the disciplinary 
board the court cannot imagine the board reaching any conclusion 
other than that lavalley should not sit on the panel 
the decision noted that lavalley who was not identified in the 
decision other than as a panel member discussed the letter with the 
disciplinary board chairman the day hearings for the students began 
lavalley could not recall details of the letter at the time and 
said he believed he could be objective others on the panel whose 
members include students faculty members and administrators 
accepted his judgment the court wrote

sources said writer andrei sinyavsky returned to 
the soviet union for the first time in 15 years tuesday for a 
reunion with the widow of yuli daniel with whom he stood trial in 
1966 on charges of illegally publishing abroad 
sinyavsky and his wife arrived after irina uvarova daniels 
wife made an appeal to soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze to allow them to come to moscow said western 
journalists who met sinyavsky at the airport 
daniel died of a stroke at his home friday night he was buried 
monday but sinyavsky did not get his visa in time to attend the 
funeral 
the trial of sinyavsky and daniel 22 years ago was a worldwide 
sensation and marked the beginning of a long crackdown on dissidents 
during the years of former soviet president leonid i brezhnev 
the two were arrested about a year after brezhnev ousted nikita 
s khrushchev who had given writers somewhat more freedom after the 
years of josef stalins repression 
daniel received a sentence of five years in prison and labor 
camps for publishing his writings abroad he remained in the soviet 
union after his release and refrained from any dissident activity 
sinyavsky received a sevenyear term and emigrated to france 
after he was released 
i think they gave me the visas for fear of a big scandal if 
they refused the journalists quoted sinyavsky as saying 
the journalists who spoke on condition they not be identified 
quoted sinyavsky as saying he was pleased with improvements in the 
soviet press and in cultural life but that they were not yet 
irreversible

president oscar arias of costa rica asking for his help in reopening 
peace talks with the sandinistas

poland will cut tens of thousands of people 
from its military and reduce the percentage of national income spent 
on defense because of decreasing eastwest tensions the defense 
minister was quoted as saying tuesday 
gen florian siwicki forecast such moneysaving steps as 
consolidating military academies and officers schools cutting the 
number of reservists called up for active duty and increasing the 
number of units whose personnel are reduced in peacetime according 
to the state news agency pap 
we assume that these changes will bring considerable benefits 
running into tens of thousands of fulltime jobs as well as big 
material and financial savings pap quoted him as saying 
poland has the secondlargest army in the warsaw pact military 
alliance after the soviet union the londonbased international 
institute for strategic studies in 1987 estimated polands army as 
having 394000 active troops and 491000 reservists 
siwicki said poland had reduced the size of its military by 
15000 troops in the past two years liquidated two mechanized 
divisions and retired many older planes tanks and artillery pieces 
the news agency reported 
the planned 19 billion military budget for 1989 represents 36 
percent of the total national income compared to 38 percent of 
national income spent on defense in 1988 siwicki was quoted as 
saying 
siwicki did not specify the size of the 1988 military budget but 
said the 1989 budget represented a reduction in real terms from 1988 
of 4 percent that would indicate a 1988 military budget of around 
198 billion 
the minister said poland generally has spent about 4 percent of 
its national income on the military but now intends to lower that 
ratio 
if peace trends are lasting they will make it possible for us 
to ensure national security at a correspondingly lower cost 
siwicki was quoted as saying a process of reducing the defense 
budget is a logical consequence of this

teams of federal state and local 
inspectors toured a floodravaged area tuesday to assess damage from 
a dike break that damaged more than 150 homes an official said 
there were no injuries from the dike break but four bridges were 
washed out and a number of livestock were killed by tuesday about 
80 people mostly tenants at damaged apartment buildings still were 
displaced said jerry lewis chairman of the washington county 
commission 
four teams including one from the federal emergency management 
agency were surveying damage to homes businesses farms roads 
bridges and sanitation plants said david grier of the fema regional 
office in denver 
itll be a few days before final figures are in and the 
figures will be influenced by flood insurance and other 
considerations including whether people have found place to live or 
whether they have other unmet needs he said 
if fema issues a disaster declaration the federal government 
could reimburse residents for up to 75 percent of their losses with 
the remainder covered by state and local governments 
as the teams investigated the damage many residents complained 
they were warned either too early or too late of the flood early 
sunday some 1500 people were evacuated from along the virgin river 
before a wall of water rushed from a 200footwide gap in the dike 
at quail creek reservoir 
we could have gotten a lot of stuff out if we had been given a 
more realistic time said myron nelson a resident of the 
riverside apartments complex south of st george we got the tv 
and the sewing machine out but there was a lot more we probably 
could have taken with us had we known 
ruth ann basile said the flood swept away her horses chickens 
dogs and 20 cows and demolished fences chicken coops and alfalfa 
fields 
they should have alerted people sooner than they did she 
said if we had just had notice we could have moved our livestock 
to higher ground and saved them 
the flow from the broken dike was down to a trickle by monday 
power was restored and residents in st george and its suburbs were 
cleaning up bulldozers were being used tuesday to build a 
cofferdam a small temporary watertight barrier 
lewis said engineers have begun evaluating the cause of the 
break the dike has seeped off and on since 1985 when the reservoir 
was filled 
gov norm bangerter has declared the county an emergency disaster 
area but he underwent knee surgery tuesday and had not signed the 
necessary documents said press secretary francine giani 
she said the governor was expected to formalize the declaration 
upon his return to duty possibly wednesday bangerter has vowed to 
rebuild the 2000footlong 50foothigh dike which would take an 
estimated six months

the lawyer for torturemurderer gary heidnik 
criticized prison officials tuesday for not supervising him more 
closely before his drug overdose and a prosecutor said he doubted 
heidnik wanted to kill himself 
heidnik was semicomatose and in serious condition tuesday at 
west penn hospital where he was taken from the state correctional 
institution after being found unconscious sunday in his death row 
cell prison officials said 
a prison statement tuesday said heidnik is believed to have 
stored medications that were prescribed for him by pretending to 
take them at the designated times 
a psychiatrist who interviewed heidnik before his trial said 
hospital officials told him the medicine was an antipsychosis drug 
thorazine prison spokesman tom seiverling refused to identify the 
drug 
heidnik faces the death sentence for the slayings of two of six 
women he kept chained in the basement of his philadelphia row house 
his attorney a charles peruto jr said his client should have 
been under a 24hour watch because of past suicide attempts 
they obviously did not check his mouth to make sure he was 
taking his medication peruto said he was never off suicide 
watch in philadelphia 
peruto said heidnik had a history of trying to commit suicide 
with stockpiled thorazine were unsure how many tablets heidnik had 
swallowed he said but his client had been getting one tablet daily 
the ironic thing is now theyre going to work on him around the 
clock so he can regain consciousness so we can execute him peruto 
said 
assistant district attorney charles gallagher who prosecuted 
heidnik said tuesday he understood from prison officials that 
heidniks condition was not lifethreatening he said heidnik had 
feigned suicide attempts in the past 
he said heidnik has used claims of suicide attempts and failures 
to get better prison conditions the attempts have succeeded in the 
past in getting him into hospital settings instead of the general 
prison population he said 
dr clancy d mckenzie a philadelphia psychiatrist who spent 110 
hours interviewing heidnik said west penn doctors told him heidnik 
took an overdose of thorazine which he probably had been 
stockpiling for three months 
the 45yearold selfproclaimed minister was convicted july 1 of 
murdering two of six women he abducted and kept shackled in a 
basement torture chamber in his north philadelphia home a jury 
sentenced him to death a day later and his formal sentencing is 
scheduled for feb 9 
next week a federal bankruptcy judge is to distribute more than 
500000 in stocks and bonds found in heidniks house after he was 
arrested

college students from 19 nations have 
arrived at princeton university to match wits in a war of words 
the students will begin competing wednesday in the ninth annual 
world universities debating championship a most argumentative forum 
that pits nearly 250 top speechmakers in what is considered the 
world cup of debating 
this is the largest and most diverse debate tournament ever 
held said drew graham a princeton university student who is 
organizing the event for the first time weve even got students 
from eastern bloc countries a polish delegation will participate 
and the soviet union is sending a delegation to observe were very 
excited about it 
the tournament sponsored by princeton universitys 
whigcliosphic society north americas oldest debate organization 
will conclude with a championship round on monday 
some 120 teams are represented including 33 from the united 
states a team from oxford university in great britain won last 
years championship 
the debaters will duel under rules made famous by great britains 
parliament under a style where delivery and wit have a lot of 
emphasis graham said theyll debate topics such as whether 
education is a right or privilege 
youve got to have a convincing style and a persuasive 
manner said graham who is one of 60 judges in the tournament 
theres no prepared research 
to some participants a quickthinking mind and a lively tongue 
are key ingredients to a successful debate 
the concept of winging it when you dont know much about the 
topic is one of the most oftused expressions said australian 
julian mcmahon 25 of melbourne university when we need to wing 
it we emulate the politician by getting as few ideas as possible to 
the gallon 
present day politicians however are not held in as high esteem 
by the australians 
wed be happy to debate dan quayle any time laughed mcmahon 
some nations such as new guinea have sent participants for the 
first time 
wialo sakatao 19 of papua new guinea said his challenge will 
be debating in english which is his second language 
in new guinea debating is popular in the schools said 
sakatao but culturally there are a lot of tribal arguments over 
many things including politics 
suzanne hagedorn a spokeswoman for the 300member 
whigcliosophic society at princeton said debating in the united 
states was once viewed as college sports are today 
in scotland which will hold next years championship debating 
is part of our fabric said david rennie 22 a debater from 
glasgow university the only team that has won two championships 
its interesting to see how the different countries approach 
the debates said rennie the americans tend to be more 
analytical while the scots are more direct and to the point the 
irish theyre a wee bit more philosophical 
staving off defeat can require some fancy brainwork especially 
if the debater stumbles rennie said 
youve got to turn it to your advantage if you stumble 
rennie said youve got to keep it going the one thing you cant 
do is to say im sorry ive got nothing left to say 
us teams participating are augsberg college bates college 
bucknell university columbia university cornell university 
emerson college fordham university furman university harvard

1978 and soviet forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 
replacing one promoscow regime with another 
an estimated 115000 soviet soldiers were in the country when the 
kremlin signed a unmediated agreement april 14 to withdraw them 
half the troops were out by aug 15 according to un reports and 
the rest are to be gone by feb 15 
the soviets temporarily suspended their troop pullout in late 
1988 complaining that the united states and pakistan were still 
arming the guerrillas who continued fighting 
but islamabadbased western diplomats said tuesday the soviet 
pullout has begun from shindad and herat in western afghanistan and 
they quoted afghan officials as saying the main soviet military 
withdrawal will begin jan 15 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said an exodus 
of soviet civilian advisers from the afghan capital is going on 
at least 55 million afghans have fled their country during a 
decade of civil war most of them to pakistan the insurgents use 
border cities and refugee camps as bases and supply points for 
operations inside afghanistan 
a senior pakistani diplomat told the associated press on tuesday 
we have been informed that vorontsov is bringing a message from 
the top soviet leadership for president ishaq khan and prime 
minister benazir bhutto as moscow thinks there is too little time 
left to settle the afghan problem 
the foreign ministry sources said the soviet envoy would meet 
with ishaq khan on thursday and confer with ms bhutto on saturday 
those meetings are considered important but the centerpiece of 
his visit will be sessions friday with leaders of the sevenparty 
afghan guerrilla alliance based in peshawar pakistan 
sibghatullah mojaddidi new leader of the peshawar alliance told 
a news conference in the border city tuesday he would meet with 
vorontsov this week the alliance chairmanship rotates among 
factions every three months and mojaddidi took over jan 1 
one foreign ministry official said representatives of guerrillas 
based in iran also might join the talks with vorontsov 
voronstov was in iran on tuesday for talks with iranian officials 
and the iranbased afghan rebels on the future of aghanistan soviet 
and iranian media reported 
the official soviet news agency tass said vorontsov met iranian 
president ali khamenei and foreign minister ali akbar velayati and 
held a separate session with afghan opposition leaders headed by 
mohammad karim khalili 
in both meetings tass said vorontsov urged that a peace 
conference of all afghan political parties and groups be formed soon 
about 2 million of the afghan refugees are in iran the 
iranbased guerrillas who are shiite moslem occasionally have been 
at odds with the pakistanbased guerrillas who are sunni moslem 
at the first talks between vorontsov and the pakistanbased 
insurgents dec 35 at taif saudi arabia the alliance proposed 
selection of a council of about 400 members that in turn would 
choose an interim government 
guerrilla leaders insisted that the soviets remove the current 
government before the council was established in kabul and refused 
to accept communists in a postwar government 
vorontsov took the demands back to moscow but the kremlin has not 
replied pakistani diplomats said moscow wants the communist party 
represented in afghanistans next government 
this is mainly a facesaving provision one said such 
representation will let the soviets feel they have not pulled out of 
afghanistan in humiliation or dumped najib 
najib is president in the current government 
leaders of the alliance have criticized the soviets since the 
december meetings in saudi arabia 
they feel unhappy because vorontsov met former king zahir shah 
and offered him an opportunity to return and play a role in the 
future government the diplomat said a majority of the 
resistence leaders are opposed to zahir shah because of his western 
lifestyle while he ruled afghanistan and the fact he did not 
partricipate in the war civil war 
zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 and lives in italy

nicaraguan women many of whom fought 
on the battlefield to help bring about the sandinista revolution 
are back in combat demanding the new society change its macho 
attitude toward females 
in the past year a growing womens movement has obtained equal 
rights in divorce and had a satirical newspaper suspended for 
presenting women as sexual objects 
its not a battle won easily in latin america where women are 
expected to remain subservient to males stay at home and raise 
children this despite the fact that many women must work outside 
the home to survive 
womens lives are further burdened by primitive conditions 
shanty homes lack of potable water or plumbing woodburning stoves 
these daytoday struggles coupled with the lack of education 
and sexist attitudes make the job of the womens movement more 
difficult when asked about womens rights a peasant woman in the 
rural south asked what is that 
we are trying to change the level of consciousness said lea 
guido head of the luisa amanda espinoza association of nicaraguan 
women 
ms guidos group is linked to the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front and takes its name from one of the martyrs in the 
fight to depose anastasio somoza who was ousted in 1979 
participation by women in politics is a new phenomenon she 
said it started because everyone was against the dictator and 
that caused everyone to fight it was the first victory for women 
during the war women served as guerrilla fighters or messengers 
and ran safe houses organized demonstrations set up contacts and 
sought the release of prisoners 
dora maria tellez was a guerrilla commander she is now the 
minister of health doris maria tijerino was a clandestine member of 
the sandinista front she is now the nations chief of police 
rosario murillo the nations first lady worked secretly with 
the guerrillas rosa pasos a lieutenant colonel in the army and 
spokeswoman for the defense ministry acted as a gobetween in 
clandestine contacts 
many women especially in the capital wear olive green uniforms 
for their administrative jobs with the army and interior ministry 
the government even provides maternity uniforms 
thousands of civilian women underwent arms training for militia 
work some in the use of sovietmade antiaircraft guns they are 
barred from combat but serve behind the lines as cooks and in 
administrative jobs 
women here traditionally were not just housewives they always 
worked ms guido said but they used to be exploited by the men 
and not paid fairly 
most women work to add to the family income and just finding 
scarce goods and budgeting with 20000 percent inflation can be a 
fulltime job 
the official sandinista newspaper barricada says 70 percent of 
the pickers for coffee the nations main export crop are women 
almost 49 percent of the states administrative positions are held 
by women but none is among the ninemember directorate that runs 
the sandinista front 
were working on it ms guido said in a country so poor 
so backward its not easy but theres a political will 
the sandinista party has vowed to abolish the discrimination 
that women have suffered with respect to men it will establish 
economic political and cultural equality between women and men 
but old ideas are hard to change 
a womans job is to take care of the family what is this about 
rights they have rights said a man at a vegetable market 
several other men agreed 
having women in battle creates problems jealousy you know 
what i mean a young male army lieutenant said 
ms guidos organization opened a legal affairs office in 1983 to 
deal with abuses separations and muchneeded sex education 
the legal office has had to overcome womens traditional 
timidness and fear in publicly discussing problems that have long 
been considered exclusively private and better left unexamined 
said envio a magazine published by the central american institute 
a sandinista think tank 
ms guido points out that education is an important part of the 
movement 
many women in the rural regions are not married they have too 
many children its part of the machismo she said 
before the triumph we didnt even have day care guido said 
its still insufficient but its enormous in comparison

who are cautious about keeping fingers and feet away from the moving 
parts 
but for most the traditional snow shovel remains the tool of 
choice or at least of necessity 
the international chiropractors association whose members treat 
many of those strains and sprains that occur in snow shoveling have 
compiled some suggestions to help lessen the potential for injury 
lifting a heaping shovel of snow without bending the knees can 
subject the spine to severe stress the chiropractors warn the snow 
may weigh only 10 or 15 pounds but holding it out from the body 
increases the pressure on the back by up to 15 times that amount 
the answer of course is to bend from the knees not the waist 
when lifting 
thats a lesson learned quickly by people who must lift and carry 
loads constantly such as warehousemen and mothers but people who 
only do so in winter need a reminder 
in addition other causes of shovelingrelated pain and injury 
include simply trying to lift and throw too much snow at one time 
twisting at the waist and overexertion 
this extra work causes severe stress on the heart and lungs a 
burden made worse by working in frigid air 
people who have serious spinal lung or heart conditions or who 
are out of shape should simply not shovel snow the chiropractors 
stress hire a neighborhood youngster to do the work call a plowing 
service or ask friends or relatives for help 
folks who do plan to shovel need to begin with some gentle warm 
up exercises rather that just jumping into the effort 
and dress warmly wearing long underwear to protect and warm the 
back and other muscles 
where possible the chiropractors suggest pushing rather than 
lifting the snow and deposit it nearby rather than straining 
muscles by trying to throw it over a large area 
try to use the arms legs feet and thighs in a coordinated 
movement in moving snow and change sides from time to time to avoid 
straining the muscles on one side of the body rest frequently and 
dont shovel in extremely cold weather 
snowthrowing machines are becoming a more and more popular 
alternative for removal of the white stuff 
they can save the back but they chew up a remarkable number of 
fingers of careless users according to the federal consumer product 
safety commission here are that agencys suggestions for safer 
snowthrower use 
keep hands and feet away from all moving parts 
stop the engine by removing the key spark plug or power cord 
whenever leaving the operator position to make adjustments remove 
debris of whatever 
never put a hand in the discharge chute or near the auger or 
collector to remove sticks or other materials stop the machine and 
use a trowel long stick or other object to clear blockages 
never leave a running snow thrower unattended 
never fill the fuel tank of gasoline engines indoors or while 
the machine is hot or running 
always be aware of the position of the power cord of electric 
machines

editors note its an emotional movement that is picking up 
momentum and sometimes turning violent animal rights groups are 
becoming more militant and scoring some successes even the 
respected humane society of the united states has taken on the very 
symbol of consumerism american express

rockville md the humane society of the united states is 
urging people to cut up their american express cards because the 
credit institution mailed a fur coat catalog announcing fur 
because winter is long and life is short 
follow your heart drop your american express the 
washingtonbased humane society told its 830000 members 
that is but one more confrontation in a burgeoning animal rights 
animal welfare and animal liberation movement that has been 
gathering strength across the nation 
it is by no means monolithic or even united the majority would 
not agree with some of the direct action resulting in burned 
buildings theft of records and research animals and death threats 
there are large differences about philosophy and tactics many 
for example are unprepared to espouse vegetarianism while others 
go so far as to feed a meatless diet to their dogs and cats to spare 
the suffering of a farm animal it also has closed down some 
research projects caused one company to drop its cosmetics line 
and improved conditions for some research animals 
consider the following 
more than 2000 protesters led by bob barker walked up 
manhattans fifth avenue the day after thanksgiving fur free 
friday there were smaller demonstrations in 66 other american 
cities 
a research scientist at new york universitys prestigious 
cornell medical college made research history when she or the 
university or both yielded to demonstrations and a letterwriting 
campaign and returned a 530000 grant to the national institute of 
drug abuse for a study of barbituate withdrawal in cats 
in england a few days before christmas the animal liberation 
front claimed responsibility for firebomb attacks on five of 
britains leading department stores causing millions of dollars of 
damage in retaliation for selling fur dingles the largest store in 
plymouth was gutted 
presidentelect george bush drew flack for hunting quail on a 
vacation in texas 
police in norwalk conn are holding animal rights activist 
fran stephanie trutt 33 of queens ny on 500000 bail as she 
awaits trial on charges of attempted murder and possession of pipe 
bombs trutt was arrested on nov 11 outside the united states 
surgical corp a firm that experiments with dogs and has been a 
frequent target of demonstrators 
in december bloom county a political comic strip ran a 
week of satire on testing rabbits for cosmetics 
and in huntington ny on long island a tray of vegetarian 
dog and cat biscuits wowbow and wowmeow are baked by an 
entrepreneurial activist 
the radical side of the movement dates back to the 
antivivisectionism of victorian england but interest was rekindled 
by a 1978 book animal liberation by australian philosopher 
peter singer 
at last were starting to look like a movement but i think 
animal rights is in its early stages says ingrid newkirk chief 
strategist and director of people for the ethical treatment of 
animals peta the most radical of an estimated 3000 to 7000 
groups involved in animal welfare 
a peta spokeswoman estimates that 10 million americans are 
involved and guesses that the operating budgets of the myriad groups 
come to about 50 million thats not counting the money held in 
endowments by the established giants who tend to be less militant 
while businessmen and scientists say they are worried activists 
claim they have never hurt a human nor an animal alex pacheco a 
cofounder of peta says arson property destruction burglary or 
theft are acceptable crimes when they directly alleviate the pain 
and suffering of an animal the same goes for sitins disruptions 
at stockholder meetings in attempts to pass resolutions to ban 
product testing on animals 
animal rights people say the experiments are the real crime and 
that 40 percent of all research animals are used for cosmetic and 
product testing often as insurance against a theoretical lawsuit 
not as safety measures 
do we really need the 48th brand of oven cleaner newkirk 
asks 
the blitz against wearing fur is the most visible campaign there 
are ads atop taxis on billboards in subways and buses celebrities 
such as rue mcclanahan and loretta swit have participated even 
princess di was commended for her refusal to wear fur 
the fur industry tries to keep the activists off the air 
richard parsons executive director of the fur retailers 
information council says furriers have been asked not to give 
interviews because they tend to shoot themselves in the foot 
like the time one told a reporter that all american furs are 
farmraised not true 
we cant threaten to pull our ads because thats how we sell 
our furs parsons says but were big advertisers and sometimes 
we get a pretty good response sometimes we can keep them off the 
air we try 
we dont debate them we dont dignify them we dont need to 
defend the use of fur its a matter of personal freedom this is 
still a capitalistic society and it is supposed to be a tolerant 
one 
sales have not been affected parsons says although the industry 
is looking to increase the international levy at auction houses to 
increase its war chest to combat the antifur forces 
the american fur industry has had locks jammed arson bomb 
threats and windows smashed parsons says giving this movement 
credibility gives in to more violence 
dan mathews a 24yearold peta member in charge of the antifur 
campaign says the fur industry will be the first domino to fall 
we are not asking you to change your life just give up cruelty 
besides the furriers the cosmetic industry research scientists 
and producers of livestock eggs chickens and milk factory 
farmers as the activists call them are under attack 
so what if we put a few businesses under mathews says the 
slave traders lost an industry too 
the antivivisectionist faction believes that man has evolved to 
a point where he can live without any animal products meat milk 
leather fur wool etc they feel that neither the cosmetic 
industry nor medical researchers have the right to experiment on 
animals that zoos rodeos race tracks even the household pet is 
an exploitation of the animal kingdom 
we are not saying animals have the same rights as man says 
george cave of transspecies unlimited sometimes we have to make 
choices

cave a former professor of philosophy exempts american indians 
and eskimos whose survival is dependent on the hunting of game 
the movement is marked by a hyperbolic rhetoric reminiscent of 
the 60s some activists call themselves freedom fighters for 
animals newkirk is happy to reiterate a statement some others wish 
she had never said in the first place 
i cant even remember it exactly says britishborn newkirk 
but i stand by it l00 percent what i said was a pig is a boy is a 
dog is a rat in that they are all sentient beings they are all 
capable of suffering that is indisputable 
the various groups are not above squabbling especially over 
funding 
cave says the humane society of the united states which has an 
annual budget of 9 million has a stranglehold on the funds that 
is totally unethical its president john hoyt is paid 139000 a 
year the massachusetts society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals has a fortune sitting idle in investments they could wipe 
out the pet overpopulation in one year if they would use some of 
that money 
the mspca founded in 1839 has an endowment of 42 million and 
spent 15 million last year supporting three veterinarian hospitals 
nine shelters and various educational projects 
the humane society doesnt support some of the statements of the 
radicals and deplores the violence 
we like to be taken seriously when we go to the hill says a 
humane society spokeswoman we dont like to be seen as frothing 
at the mouth 
cave who lives on a 10000 salary part of his groups total 
budget of 350000 led the cornell campaign he calls it a landmark 
in that the challenge was not about sloppy laboratory conditions 
but the very nature of the research 
he maintained that barbituate addiction is a complex human 
problem and that it was inappropriate to expose cats or any animal 
to the horrors of withdrawal a selfinflicted condition in humans 
cave is now attacking a gluesniffing experiment using monkeys at 
new york university hospital in nice weather transspecies has 14 
tables out every weekend on new york city streets explaining its 
philosophy 
the biomedical research community has reacted by forming a 
washingtonbased educational and lobbying group 
were not talking here about little old ladies in blue hair 
says frankie trull president of the foundation for biomedical 
research we have heard of over 50 death threats the research 
community is so unprepared for the animal rights movement first of 
all they have jobs and they dont have time to hang out at shopping 
centers with signs 
it is costing millions in increased security replacing animals 
that were stolen and buildings that were torched it is no laughing 
matter 
the research scientist at cornell dr michiko okamoto refuses 
to talk to reporters her colleagues say she was shocked by the 
developments 
dr michael e debakey a cardiovascular surgeon who became a 
household name has emerged as one spokesman for the researchers 
now 80 but working daily from 4 am till midnight debakey says he 
occasionally gets death threats he sees the animal rights movement 
as one with great emotional appeal but one that is not telling the 
whole story 
these people are intimidating a lot of people debakey says 
if you want to become a jehovahs witness and refuse blood from 
another person i have no argument i dont agree with it but i 
respect your right to do it what i object to here is the attempt to 
enforce this view on others 
i have yet to see a patient who refused treatment from research 
gained from animals do these people plan on turning down such 
treatment if they need it 
debakey says his surgical breakthroughs which saved thousands of 
lives resulted from experimentation on dogs 
almost everything in the cardiovascular field was developed 
through animal research you cant use cells or cell cultures or 
computers 
the surgeon says animal activists are not improving the 
conditions of animals used in research they are pricing it out of 
the market twelve states have now passed laws prohibiting the use 
of pound animals yet the taxpayer spends 600 million a year caring 
for pound animals and putting them to sleep 
the activists have great political strength and slick 
organizations they say alternative methods can be used they are 
wrong 
debakey worries about the cornell decision 
it is disturbing to see an institution of higher learning cave 
in debakey says the integrity of that academic institution is 
eroded 
medical scientists point to the great strides made using animal 
models everything from polio vaccine to treatments for such 
diseases as diabetes cancer and heart disease have benefited from 
research on animals 
the activists insist the same advances could have been made using 
different kinds of research 
dr frederick king director of the yerkes primate center at 
emory university in atlanta also a target of death threats is 
eager to speak out researchers at his institution are injecting 
chimpanzees with the deadly aids virus so far it has not jumped 
their immune barrier but king says that does not mean it will not 
with a longer incubation 
the animals rights militants say that is not necessary since 
there are thousands of dying human victims who would gladly allow 
themselves to be experimented upon 
forget the ethical questions newkirk says its bad 
science they are retarding the aids research by using animals 
king dismisses that argument he says its yet another case of 
nonscientists throwing in their nonscientific opinion 
my question is where have all the moderates gone king says 
even jane goodall who came here about a year ago has turned to 
their side shes a oneagenda person fanatically attached to 
chimps 
the moderates all seem to have gone into the woodwork

a vegetarian lunch is served every day by 
the people for the ethical treatment of animals 
peta as it is called likes to describe itself as a grassroots 
organization it does have access to a large network of people it 
can mobilize for a specific cause 
however it is also a centralized operation with computers 
direct mail solicitation an aerobics class at 6 pm and a parking 
lot filled with meat is dead and liberate lab animals bumper 
stickers 
it says its average contribution from its 300000 members is 20 
and there are no big angels it is armed with a 10000 squarefoot 
warehouse bright leadership 65 employees and a 5 million budget 
peta is often the clearinghouse when crimes such as arson or 
property theft occur in the battle against abuse of animals they 
get the word from the underground groups animal liberation front 
true friends human bondage and others 
we know our phones are tapped and we entertain the fbi 
frequently says carol burnett 36 the public relations director 
is peta in fact the animal liberation front or does it know 
who the alf members might be 
we would never consider discussing the identity of anyone who 
is talking too much says executive director ingrid newkirk who 
has been arrested perhaps a dozen times but has yet to spend a night 
in jail 
we have one page of company rules but its not like youre 
joining the army or entering a religious cult we have a voluntary 
ban on smoking and ask employees not to bring in mcdonalds burgers 
we ask people not to wear animal products to work but we dont 
run around and inspect peoples apparel like the marines we hope 
eventually people will get rid of it but a lot of people just 
coming to work here still own something made from an animal 
there are warnings not to leave anything exposed on your desk 
that is not ready for public consumption 
peta is compartmentalized into research and investigations 
education cosmetics a whistleblower hotline and under the 
freedom of information act it constantly writes in for reports on 
publicly funded projects 
an educational team of three animal rights 101 flies out 
just about every weekend to train local groups in how to picket and 
become effective in their community 
a dozen companion animals accompany employees to work each 
day and all of the dogs are vegetarians some wander through the 
halls others are in offices one is behind a closed door with his 
picture and a caption that says make my day but thats a joke 
its a friendly dog 
posters are everywhere one shows rabbits being blinded not in 
the name of science but in the name of a new shampoo there are 
pictures of cats with electrodes in their heads cute young white 
foxes in cages waiting to become fur coats if you liked pulling 
the wings off flies as a kid one sign says you may be cut out 
for a career in animal experimentation 
the foundation for biomedical research has recently entered the 
poster war one shows a little girl in a hospital bed surrounded by 
stuffed animals the caption says its the animals you dont see 
that saved her life 
peta says it doesnt advocate violence but wouldnt be surprised 
if more incidents occur 
if anyone brings on this violence its those who commit the 
obscenities inside the labs says alex pacheco its founder if 
anyone is responsible for bombs going off its the national 
institutes of health im surprised there is not more violence 
activists are trying to get laws enforced i work mostly with 
congressmen and i find it just outrageously frustrating here we 
have government agencies lying to the us congress lying to the 
public and the courts are not enforcing the existing laws against 
cruelty and nothing substantive has been passed in a decade 
peta publishes lists of companies that use animals in their 
research and those that do not 
what we must make people realize is that they as a consumer 
run the world newkirk says good intentions dont mean a thing 
if you continue to use the product

editors note it was a sure sign that cajun culture has gone 
global when crawfish etouffee and file gumbo showed up on the menu 
at last summers moscow summit now busloads of foreign tourists

to sample a hot and spicy lifestyle in the rough

hunched over his accordion in the 
shade of a live oak tree lennis romero was letting his ethnic pride 
show 
cher it dont surprise me one tam bit that cajun food is a 
big yeah in london holland and russia he says the rest of 
the world just been a ti slow in catching up with the good things 
in life 
lennis and his brother ophe a virtuoso on the ti fer or 
triangle had just stomped out jambalaya for some foreign 
french tourists who arrived on the banks of bayou teche in a bus 
marked un voyage au vrai pays des acadiens a trip to the real 
cajun country 
me oh my oh cajun culture has busted out of the bayou and gone 
global suddenly last summer crawfish etouffee and file gumbo were 
on the menu at the summit in moscow amsterdams hottest new 
restaurant is riekje sluizers cajun louisiana kitchen geopend 
voor lunch london has two cajunstyle restaurants and liberal 
doses of sauce piquant are spicing up traditionally bland british 
cuisine at such posh nosheries as wiltons and the savoy grill 
now busloads of european tourists led by the french are 
venturing deep into the bayous where before world war ii paved roads 
seldom penetrated 
as ophe conceded there was a ti language problem at first the 
romero brothers speak quaint french that like the meandering bayou 
has been bent out of shape in the last two centuries but once the 
visitors from paris and lyons figured out that ti was cajun for 
petit and that an alligator was neither un caiman nor un crocodile 
they were able to communicate their desire to sample soupe de 
cocodrie 
in st martinville the spiritual capital of cajunland the tour 
group posed for photos around the statue of evangeline the 
heroine of longfellows epic about the british expulsion of french 
settlers from acadia or nova scotia in 1755 then in the old 
indian cemetery they saw the grave of emmeline labiche whose 
reallife separation from her lover inspired the poem 
like americans cramming into the crazy horse saloon in paris the 
french contingent braved the overflow crowd at mulates the cajun 
nightclub in breaux bridge for a fais dodo literally make go to 
sleep the saturday night dance named for the tiny room where 
small children dozed while their parents twostepped until dawn 
cajun music like cajun cooking is echoing around the world 
bayou artists such as fiddler michael doucet and pianist zachary 
richard have rabid fans in paris montreal quebec martinique san 
francisco and new yorks greenwich village don montoucets cajun 
combo had the comrades jumping when chef john folse from lafittes 
landing in donaldsonville set up a cajun restaurant at the moscow 
world trade center at the summit in june 
if paul prudhomme had shown up that night at mulates he would 
have been mobbed like a young charles boyer for autographs by both 
the locals and the french pilgrims on the trail of what their 
culture has brought forth on this continent 
prudhomme the first american chef to be awarded the merite 
agricole by the french government is proprietor of kpauls 
louisiana kitchen in new orleans a culinary superstar on tv radio 
and videotapes and the author of cookbooks that have sold more than 
600000 in hardback 
he is also the author of such insights into cajun culture as 
an authentic cajun is one who anticipates the start of the 
crawfish season as much as his wedding night 
good cajun cooking doesnt taste country it tastes grandma 
if you dont hover between pleasure and pain when you eat it 
chances are you havent made your sauce piquant hot enough 
prudhomme popularized the blackening method of sealing in the 
flavor of meat and fish with intense heat as if cooked over an open 
fire its ubiquitous popularity has produced such menu aberrations 
as blackened meatloaf and blackened omeletes and has made the lowly 
redfish once snubbed in haute cuisine an endangered species in 
texas and louisiana some months ago undercover agents from the 
texas parks and wildlife department mounted a sting operation to 
foil a ring of commercial fishermen and food wholesalers dealing in 
illegally caught redfish 
dining out these days you dont know if that blackened menu 
special is the chefs favorite or his latest failure laughs joe 
cahn who presides over the new orleans school of cooking which 
daily instructs nearly 100 students and was the finishing school for 
andre numan amsterdams cajun chef 
cajun cooking has been around since the earliest exiles from nova 
scotia found love at first bite of alligator tail meat but its 
delights took a while catching on beyond the swamps of the 
atchafalaya 
when fannie merritt farmer collected americas best recipes for 
her boston cooking school cookbook in 1896 the word cajun didnt 
make the index 
even today antoines in new orleans founded in 1840 doesnt 
mention the word cajun in its extensive menu although creole 
has a halfdozen listings from gombo sic creole to poulet a 
la creole bernard guste the greatgreatgrandson of founder 
antoine alciatore admits however to being a bit more heavyhanded 
with the pepper pot to please tourists who expect louisiana cooking 
to be hot real hot which was never the creole style 
prudhomme points out that as louisiana food has grown in 
popularity throughout the country the distinction between cajun and 
creole has almost vanished 
in history the distinction is clearer creoles are descended 
from aristocratic families who fled the terrors of the french 
revolutions sometimes with their chefs dressmakers and dancing 
masters they intermarried with louisianas spanish settlers whose 
cooking pots bubbled with spices and condiments from the aztecs 
incas and the caribbean black cooks on the plantations added 
another dimension like okra and gumbo both african words creole 
culture was cavalier gallant refined its cuisine elegant subtle 
rich in sauces 
cajuns a corruption of archadia the name given to canadas 
maritime provinces by the explorer verrazano on first sighting their 
virgin forests were victims of one of this continents worst human 
rights atrocities

originally from normandy brittany and picardy they were 
deported from nova scotia which france lost to england in the war 
of spanish succession the year of le grand derangement was l755 
and dday was sept 5 when entire villages were summoned to their 
churches to hear king george iis proclamation confiscating their 
land homes and cattle and exiling them along the atlantic seaboard 
soldiers hurried them down to the waiting boats sometimes 
separating husbands from wives parents from children and parting 
lovers as in the tale hawthorne told to longfellow 
their tragedy fell just short of genocide the british commander 
lord jeffrey amherst who got a liberal arts college named for him 
was all for it in a letter to a col bouquet he urged you will 
do well to try to spread smallpox by means of blankets and by every 
other means which might help exterminate that abominable race 
mostly trappers fishermen and farmers the exiles settled into 
louisianas swamplands where their hardy foodloving descendants 
seldom ventured beyond the range of their pirogues and pickup trucks 
until 1947 when the first oil rigs loomed over the marshes their 
cuisine culled from the woods bayous tiny gardens and barnyard 
animals too old to produce called for slow cooking and high octane 
sauces to tenderize briskets of squirrel wild rabbit alligator and 
senile sows 
even down to this generation as both prudhomme and cahn recall 
cajuns seldom went to the store even more rarely to a restaurant 
we grew virtually everything we ate says prudhomme who grew 
up the youngest of 13 children on a farm near opelousas if a 
chicken didnt lay or a rooster couldnt fertilize eggs or a mother 
pig was too old to have babies we killed them for food for the 
family 
cahn points out that sauce piquant was a necessary camouflage 
when gourmandizing on possum muskrat and nutria 
it is doubtful whether many yuppies hovering over their 
cuisinarts in quest of authentic cajun fare could bring themselves 
to trim away any and all hair in preparing a 12pound hogs head 
for fromage de tete de cochon head cheese or remove the 
glands located on each shoulder and behind the knees of squirrel 
and game rabbit as prescribed in the prudhomme family cookbook 
as for real backbayou cooking prudhomme regrets there are 
almost no sources for purchasing fresh pigs blood to make red 
boudin cajun sausage and admits he couldnt sell food cooked in 
pork lard in my restaurant 
the five flags fluttering from the columned porch of the 
presbytere or priests house in st martinville chronicle the 
course of cajun culture from the rule of french bourbon kings in 
1756 to the spanish in 1762 napoleons first republic in 1800 
jeffersons purchase of louisiana states in 1803 and a confederate 
government during the civil war 
just down the road a piece bubble the vats of two of the most 
prodigious purveyors of the cajun napalm known as hot pepper sauce 
the peppers called tabasco from the spanish word for damp earth 
have been grown in louisiana since an unknown soldier back from 
the mexican war gave some dried peppers to edmund mcilhenny who 
planted the seeds in his wifes garden on avery island one war 
later trying to salvage his plantation ravished by union troops he 
bottled and brought to market a batch of hot sauce 
now the family owned mcilhenny company with annual sales of 
nearly 12 million exports the incendiary elements of the bloody 
mary to 100 countries and goes beyond avery islands still thriving 
tabasco patch to pick peppers from mexico honduras venezuela 
colombia and the dominican republic 
in nearby new iberia bf trappeys sons have been marketing a 
variety of hot sauces pickled okra candied yams redbeans and 
other cajun staples for 90 years 
the arab countries are our best overseas market for pepper 
sauce says jack blenderman from behind the presidents desk at 
the trappey plant at lunch theyll empty a threeounce bottle on 
a bit of bread and cheese the japanese are also big importers of 
our 55gallon drums 
like bringing red hot coals to newcastle trappeys now ships its 
smoldering sauces to nova scotia where natives deprived of the 
louisiana experience have perpetrated a bland diet 
in the pepper sauce business hotness is measured by the scoville 
heat index a sort of intestinal btu scale that ranks the relatively 
hot tabasco jalapeno and cayenne peppers in the 30000 range far 
behind the tiny chinese pepper which festers above the 100000 
mark to handle the heat on trappeys pepper picking assembly line 
workers wear special gloves and are warned not to rub their eyes 
the craze for cajun culture has seemingly endless manifestations 
cajun humorist justin wilsons cooking show is now aired in bizarre 
bayoubusted english on 284 public tv stations belizaire the 
cajun is emblazoned on movie marquees and for mystery fans author 
daniel woodrell chronicles the cases of cajun cop rene slade 
cajun gumbo mixes crab boils and other delicacies are available 
by mail order from boudin king chef chauvin frey of louisiana 
tony chachere cajun magic which is a paul prudhomme enterprise 
and an evergrowing list of dealers 
now there is a cajun beer cajun cola cajun potato chips cajun 
popcorn cajun mary cocktail mix cajun pickles with the label 
upside down in keeping with justin wilsons selfdeprecating brand 
of cajun humor cajun sweet smoke pecan shells even a cajun 
kosher cookbook aggressive marketing has brought the four foot 
shelf of cajun spices to many supermarkets across the country 
to preserve the language msgr jules daigle an 88yearold 
retired priest in welsh la compiled a 600page cajun dictionary 
that was accepted by the french academy as a scholarly work it was 
the monsignors thesis that although deeply rooted in french cajun 
evolved into a separate language over the span of two centuries at 
the time of his dictionarys publication he cited the example of 
a french priest who came to st martinville some years ago and 
announced from the pulpit that a foire the french word for 
bazaar would be held in the parish next week the congregation fell 
apart laughing in cajun foire had come to mean diarrhea 
chef cahn credits food writers and restaurant critics with 
helping heat up the cajun craze theyre like fashion writers in 
setting new trends when i was working in los angeles one 
restaurant went from nouvelle cuisine to mexican to sushi to cajun 
in a fouryear period same chef same owner same location when 
youre hot youre hot and right now cajun is hot every which way

editors note what do the people in southern louisiana have in 
common with the people in northern louisiana very little beyond 
the same color license plates but two women from opposite ends of 
the state recently set out to try to bridge a cultural gap between 
the heavily protestant north and the cajun catholic south through a 
youth exchange program 
</TEXT>

rachel thompson had never tasted shrimp in 
her native louisiana which is famous for its seafood and ronnie 
emonet had never heard the wind moan through the piney hills of his 
own state 
both are 16 and represent the best hope for dismantling a wall of 
mistrust built generations ago by two clashing cultures says carole 
andrepont of opelousas who turned a joke into a serious experiment 
that worked 
andrepont a member of the louisiana tourism board who has been 
active in international youth exchange programs for years jokingly 
told a friend one day if you want to have a real cultural 
exchange have folks from north louisiana come to south louisiana 
its like two different countries 
an almost visible line across the center of louisiana separates 
the staid upstate protestants from the catholic cajuns who make 
time for work around a busy schedule of consuming the full cup of 
life 
the descendants of the exiles from nova scotia make up a third of 
the states population and those of different ancestry living in 
south louisiana have absorbed the laidback lifestyle of the cajuns 
former gov edwin edwards the first frenchspeaking catholic 
elected to the states highest office this century says the 
division is more a perception than anything else but a perception 
can be real 
the barrier exists in the minds of those who have not had the 
opportunity to visit one end of the state or the other he says 
but invariably when they do they come away with an amazement of 
how much in common they have 
the barrier is exaggerated but its there adds gov buddy 
roemer whose family plantation is not far from the arkansas border 
in north louisiana 
a real factor has been a lack of quality transportation its 
hard to get from upstate shreveport to new orleans in fact its 
easier to get from shreveport to dallas 
edwards and roemer agree that an exchange program aimed at youths 
can eventually erase the perception 
the idea for the exchange program gnawed at andrepont and finally 
she talked with linda graham her ruston counterpart at a tourism 
meeting in baton rouge 
i told her i had an idea about two cities having an exchange 
program and the more we looked at it the more we liked it she 
says we talked to our mayors school officials and civic leaders 
now weve done it 
in a recently ended twoweek program about 20 ruston high school 
students spent a week in opelousas and an equal number of the south 
louisiana students stayed in ruston 
host families provided homes and meals treating their guests 
like their own kids andrepont says 
the mayors and civic leaders visited each others municipalities 
and like the kids discovered that even with the cultural 
differences people are just folks and get different views of what 
they see depending on personalities 
the people are more free more open down here says rachel 
who attends ruston high school up north were very polite but 
down here 
i called my mom and said i was staying here another two weeks 
she just laughed 
i like ruston better than here says telameckus anderson a 
16yearold junior at opelousas high school theyre so nice the 
hills are beautiful 
the family i stayed with made me feel like we were related 
says emonet a junior at opelousas catholic 
asked if they laughed at his cajun accent emonet said the 
girls thought it was cute i laughed at their drawls we laughed 
with each other 
graham says she learned something important from her visit to 
south louisiana 
i need to go home and loosen up a bit were more conservative 
in ruston and we are organized i find myself regimented to the 
point where i get a little bit irritated when everything doesnt go 
just like clockwork 
i learned to relax i need to come down here about once a 
month 
andrepont meanwhile says cajuns can learn from the other 
lifestyles maybe find a middle ground 
everything we do is almost overdone she says when we eat 
its a lot and the best if its seasoned its highly seasoned 
people who drink they drink 
graham and andrepont say the two cities are going to conduct such 
programs each year and encourage other communities to do the same 
thing 
i think this is going to be a state program andrepont says 
weve got church point interested in finding a north louisiana 
city for an exchange program the governor is interested we need to 
end the division in this state the 40 youngsters in this program 
dont have the old attitude anymore it works 
roemer the governor says this is the first of several such 
programs that will happen over the next year one of the issues in 
my campaign was the need for all of the state to pull together

editors note whether the khmer rouge communist guerrillas have 
changed their murderous ways has become a critical issue with the 
emerging possibility of a negotiated settlement of the decadeold 
cambodian war heres a report from an ap reporter who traveled the 
thaicambodian border interviewing government officials and 
fugitives from refugee camps run by the khmer rouge 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
khmer rouge communist guerrillas are 
holding tens of thousands of cambodian refugees virtual prisoners in 
camps in thailand to serve a war machine bent on reseizing cambodia 
international aid officials say 
some refugees have escaped to tell the story people like mom 
sokhon a teenage girl 
mom sokhon survived four years under a khmer rouge regime that 
slaughtered six of her relatives and hundreds of thousands of other 
people in cambodia after invading vietnamese forces ousted the 
regime she headed to refugee camps in thailand seeking haven from 
the war 
but mom sokhon wound up in the khmer rougecontrolled camp of 
huay chan and there she said the horror began again 
the guerrillas forced the 15yearold girl to toil all day making 
punji bamboo spears for impaling enemy soldiers hauling punishing 
loads of punji rice and b67 antitank rounds she had to make 
regular treks through heavily mined mountain passes from the camp to 
guerrilla bases inside cambodia 
often on the journey at times a month long two or three women 
had their legs blown off by mines or were shot dead in firefights 
with the vietnamese she says 
if anyone refused to join the transport team she would be 
punished with no food and sent to an underground prison she says 
after five years at huay chan mom sokhon fled in november to 
this refugee camp in eastern surin province controlled by the 
noncommunist guerrillas of prince nodorom sihanouk she fears the 
khmer rouge will hunt her down 
other cambodian guerrilla groups and thai security personnel also 
have frequently abused refugees in the camps along the cambodian 
frontier but the khmer rouge is different 
a senior official experienced with rebel movements in africa and 
the middle east says that even in the ruthless world of guerrilla 
warfare its an unusual feature to use children as military 
porters 
the disregard for the sick and the disabled is extreme he 
says theres a kind of totalitarianism i dont see elsewhere 
aid officials say hundreds perhaps thousands of refugees have 
died of malaria tuberculosis and other diseases because the khmer 
rouge refused to treat them properly or would not allow them to see 
foreign doctors because they would be polluted by them 
another official also speaking anonymously said the people 
being held in the khmer rouge camps hardly smile at you never 
greet you they are afraid in the other camps the children run up 
and talk to you this never happens in a khmer rouge camp i think 
they are systematically educating the parents to tell the children 
not to talk to foreigners 
concern over khmer rouge abuses has sharpened with the 
guerrillas recent relocation of thousands of refugees out of two 
united nationsassisted camps 
some 7000 refugees were moved from ta luan camp to a border area 
where they came under heavy shelling in november many refugees were 
believed hurt but the guerrillas have refused to allow aid officials 
access to them 
the khmer rouge has denied all charges of abuse or hy an 
administrator at its showcase camp of site b said the people were 
moving and portering voluntarily and added that all khmer 
cambodians should fight back the vietnamese 
when the khmer rouge ruled cambodia in 197578 they attempted to 
create a new agrarian society with purges torture and mass 
relocations of people from the cities to rural slave labor camps it 
destroyed religion culture and history to bring cambodia back to 
year zero and held the people under the fearful grip of 
angka the organization 
vietnams invasion in late 1978 drove the chinesearmed khmer 
rouge to the thaicambodian border where it set up base camps tens 
of thousands of civilians under khmer rouge control were driven into 
thailand by the devastating vietnamese offensive of 1985 
in the few camps where aid workers have access the khmer rouge 
seems to have abandoned the mass killings but it maintains its 
militaristic and xenphobic control over virtually every aspect of 
peoples lives marriage must be approved by camp authorities 
religious practice is banned most men wear chinese military 
uniforms in some camps people cannot walk outside their own 
section

western officials say the same brutal shadowy leaders of 197578 
now run the refugee camps pol pot ta mok son sen ieng sary and 
others 
refugees who escape rarely report having seen killings in the 
camps officials say little physical force is needed because the 
guerrillas control through their fearsome reputation and by denying 
the refugees all contact with the outside world 
but one official cautioned that unknown atrocities may be 
committed in the militaryrun camps where foreigners are barred 
these camps including satellite villages around the united 
nationsaided camps hold thousands of civilians and are supplied by 
china and overseen by task force 838 the thai military secret 
service aiding the khmer rouge 
one official who has interviewed dozens of escapees said 
people disappear in the middle of the night sometimes with their 
families and thats all some come back some dont 
the khmer rouge last year boldly executed two soldiers inside 
site b where it has allowed a buddhist temple free markets and 
elections to show the world it has embraced capitalism and 
democracy it is the only khmer rouge camp news reporters can visit 
one victim moeun noeun 30 left his unit without permission and 
went to site b in april to celebrate the cambodian new year with his 
family 
his widow rom yon said they were sleeping in their bamboo hut 
when the guerrillas shouted in the darkness 
they asked if my husband was inside or not and they came in 
and shot him she said they shot him here took him outside and 
shot him again 
the khmer rouge has allowed the un border relief operation to 
provide food and other assistance to 60000 refugees at four camps 
that are supposed to house only civilians site b borai ta luan 
and otrao 
in may the un agency ended aid to huay chan because 
authorities there defied all attempts to monitor its use there and 
elsewhere some of the food appears to have been siphoned off for 
the guerrillas use 
one official heard lots of shooting when he visited otrao in 
sisaket province a few months ago he saw a huge chinese military 
truck loaded with antitank mines topped with undonated canned 
fish fifteen heavily armed men and four women with backpacks jogged 
past saying they were going to fight the vietnamese 
even in the unaided camps few refugees have been allowed 
outside the camps for emergency medical treatment and many of those 
have been children already too sick to be saved wounded soldiers 
are never evacuated for fear they will defect aid officials say 
refugees must get permission from camp authorities even to go to 
foreignrun clinics inside the unaided camps only a limited 
number are granted permission and many of them have no apparent 
illnesses said one doctor who called the camps potemkin villages 
you never see the people whom you should see you see an outer 
village and you think you are there but you are not really there 
near otrao aid officials in june stumbled upon a village of 
several hundred handicapped people who were believed to have been 
separated from the others because they were no longer of any use to 
the khmer rouge 
refugees say the camps are governed by a strict vertical 
hierarchy with many amenities of life depending on ones personal 
relationship with the privileged top cadres the cadres hold regular 
indoctrination sessions and send errant refugees to the military 
camps for reeducation or punishment 
chea cha 52 says he and his family spent their time at a camp 
near ta luan portering or attending daylong classes on how to 
fight the vietnamese or carry weapons nothing else those who 
refused were jailed with their ankles chained together he says and 
many came out emaciated or injured 
chea cha recently fled to the sok sann camp run by the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front 
officials say most refugees would leave the khmer rouge camps if 
they could in the first 10 months of 1988 415 people fled to site 
b and sok sann 
niem chouleng the sok sann administrator said a khmer rouge 
official in a military uniform has twice visited him and asked that 
the refugees be returned 
it seemed to be a kind of warning chouleng said adding that 
he has not complied

editors note in a small coastal town in rural southeast 
georgia you used to get the impression that anything destined to 
happen there happened long ago that was before the navy started 
building a 17 billion base for 10 trident submarines which begin 
arriving this month with their nuclear arsenals st marys is 
unlikely ever to be the same again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
just across the tracks from the antebellum 
charm of historic st marys where old oaks drip spanish moss a new 
nuclear submarine base is changing the face of the countryside with 
shopping malls and lowcost housing 
the kings bay submarine base to be home to the trident subs 
means stability money and lots of jobs in this area on the 
southeastern tip of georgia just north of jacksonville fla but 
the boom also is bringing urbanstyle headaches to rural camden 
county 
the base under construction for a decade will add more than 
22000 people to the population of camden county which had only 
about 13000 in 1980 
planners are worried about schools crime water and sewer 
systems libraries fire protection and recreational facilities 
the county had no movie theater until recently now a sixtheater 
cinema complex has opened in a shopping center and another is 
probable for a center being built down the road 
the countys landfill projected to last up to 40 years was used 
up in 10 because of the baserelated boom 
from 1980 to 1988 school enrollment in the area increased 54 
percent projections show that in 1995 enrollment will be 173 
percent above the 1980 level 
backers of the base say the navy is trying hard to be a good 
neighbor 
even so says roger alderman of the kings bay impact coordinating 
committee the degree that it affects a small area especially one 
such as camden county is unimaginable 
the first trident submarine was to arrive at the 17 billion 
base on jan 14 welcomed in an invitationonly ceremony 
eventually the base will house 10 trident subs each carrying 24 
missiles packing eight nuclear warheads per missile each warhead is 
35 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on hiroshima 
japan in 1945 
each submarine will have more atomic destructive capacity than 
most nuclear powers but if the people of st marys are nervous 
about that it is subdued the few protests held at the base have 
not been locally organized 
over the centuries up to now residents of st marys have 
preserved its charm with a minimum of tackiness 
the spanish settled the community in 1566 and stayed 120 years 
aaron burr came to town in 1804 after killing alexander hamilton in 
a duel in the 1930s cartoonist roy crane visited and was so taken 
by the town streetcar that he used it as a model for his 
toonerville trolly 
visitors to st marys once got the impression that anything 
destined to happen here happened long ago the nearness of the base 
is changing that 
crime is up although local officials blame transient 
construction workers not the military for most of it 
lowcost housing developments are popping up everywhere only 
about 600 navy personnel mostly in the lower ranks will be housed 
on the base 
fields and pine woods have given way to shopping malls and the 
mushrooming strip of development along highway 40 is cheek by jowl 
with the city limits 
tom sterling 80 runs the grocery store his father founded more 
than 100 years ago in st marys 
we used to sell everything here from horse collars on up or 
maybe i should say on down he says 
old friends stop by to pass the time and remember when 
but the shelves are thinly stocked these days and customers are 
few malls and shopping centers built for the base trade sterling 
says are drawing shoppers from st marys few businesses as well 
in the basement of orange hall a greek revival splendor from the 
1820s elvira wildes tends a small information center 
the navy she says has gone out of its way to put the base in a 
positive light especially to st marys older residents 
they come to tell us the facts she says they told us it is 
the only navy base being started from scratch they give us tours on 
the ships and we eat in the mess hall sometimes 
if there is dirt and trash going on and if there are people 
acting like they shouldnt well i dont go to those places so i 
dont know about those things 
there is no entertainment in st marys she observes correctly 
so why would they bother us 
it is not an adversarial relationship agrees kenneth kent a 
financial analyst with the coordinating committee which is trying 
to soften the impact of the base on the area the navy is trying 
to be a good neighbor 
alderman says the federally funded committee made up of local 
government leaders is to lay out the realities of a highgrowth 
area and foresee problems down the road 
the area has received some 375 million in federal impact 
payments since 1984 alderman says washington wanted to make 1989 
the last year for impact funding 
we estimate we would need 87 million in 1991 and 53 million 
in 1992 he says the navy isnt even thinking in terms of 1991 
or 1992 
kent says a residential tax base generally is not sufficient to 
support residential services 
there is virtually no industrial tax base here and only a 
nominal commercial base he says 
much of the county is in timber which is taxed at a low rate and 
thus provides little county income he says 
the county school tax already is 9 percent above that of other 
counties in the region he says and camden county cannot absorb 
even the matching portions of the increased cost 
the current tax situation allows counties to keep up existing 
schools but not to build new ones required by the increase in 
population kent says 
a high percentage of the jobs on the base were to go to the 
local people but this has not happened the way it was expected to 
alderman says 
because special skills are needed for many jobs he says camden 
county area residents generally have gotten lowerpaying jobs toward 
the service end of the scale 
both the navy and the region realize the need for a 
jobtraining program he says 
alderman says navy officials at st marys are aware of the 
problems and are trying to get washington to do more 
the critical point is at hand alderman says we have found 
out now what has to be done

editors note in a small automated plant in the middle of a 
scenic forest in upstate new york men in green jump suits are 
testing a way to safely deal with radioactive waste and render it 
harmless advocates of nuclear power are optimistic 
environmentalists are skeptical while the local folk swap 
glowinthedark jokes

all is not as it seems in this wooded 
idyllic slice of the allegheny mountains known as the enchanted 
hills 
true the cattaraugus creek still snakes through sylvan glades of 
the zoar valley as it has for centuries cutting a 200foot gorge 
that enthralls the trout fisherman and thrills the whitewater rafter 
but less than a mile away a cluster of white buildings 
surrounded by barbed wire marks the site of some of the most highly 
concentrated radioactive waste in the world stored in a massive 
underground tank 
if released into the environment the resulting radiation from 
the corrosive nearboiling liquid would make the scenic area 
uninhabitable for almost as long as it took to make the gorge it is 
the legacy of a former nuclear fuel reprocessing operation 
that ominous distinction has made west valley 35 miles south of 
buffalo the scene of the nations first largescale attempt to try 
out radioactive waste treatment technology 
the principles tested here are expected to be used in stabilizing 
similar wastes at federal installations in savannah river ga and 
hanford wash both of which have significantly greater amounts of 
radioactive wastes 
were proving that the nation can deal with nuclear wastes 
safely and effectively says willis bixby the department of 
energys project director 
many environmentalists disagree however pointing out that 
modern science does not yet know how to render radioactive waste 
harmless 
the goal of the 700 million project is to get the liquid wastes 
out of the aging tank and into a more stable form 
although other countries such as france which relies on nuclear 
power for 70 percent of its energy needs have been using the 
technology for 20 years the united states has simply stockpiled its 
nuclear wastes until now 
west valley was the nations only commercial reprocessing 
facility during the late 60s and early 70s it took in spent fuel 
from nuclear power plants around the country and extracted usable 
uranium and plutonium the byproduct of the process was some 600000 
gallons of waste 
when it was built in the mid1960s new york gov nelson 
rockefeller saw the facility as an opportunity for the state to get 
in on the development of a technology that promised to solve the 
nations energy needs he envisioned a massive nuclear complex that 
would include reactors and research facilities 
but that promise all but disappeared a few years later as 
declining markets tougher federal regulations and the radiation 
hazards to workers forced the facility run by getty oil co to 
close 
it was inoperative from 1972 until 1982 when the federal 
department of energy began the west valley demonstration project a 
multimilliondollar cleanup effort 
the first step in a complicated process that has taken years to 
set up is to filter the liquid waste through columns filled with 
zeolite a sandy clay the filtering reduces the radioactivity of 
the liquid by 99 percent the liquid is then blended with cement and 
poured into 71gallon steel drums officials expect to produce some 
15000 of the drums each weighing 1000 pounds by 1994 
the remaining concentrated zeolite wastes are to be transformed 
into 300 glass logs the 10foot logs will eventually be shipped to 
a federal repository for highlevel wastes scheduled to be opened in 
nevada in the year 2003 until then the glass logs are being kept 
on the site 
west valley nuclear services co a westinghouse electric co 
subsidiary handling the project activated the treatment systems 
last spring with some 500 people involved in operations inside the 
white buildings technicians in green jump suits with meters 
attached to their collars to measure their exposure to radiation use 
remote controls to pump the wastes through filters and 
solidification processes 
except for an incident in 1986 when 11 construction workers were 
contaminated after passing around a contaminated tool there have 
been no major problems at the facility all but one of the workers 
were back on the job several hours later 
project director bixby thinks the safety record will contribute 
to greater public acceptance of the nuclear power industry 
we cant make up for the negative publicity of three mile 
island and chernobyl he says but we can be a positive factor 
when people consider the risks of energy sources and begin to 
reevaluate nuclear energy 
increasing attention to the wastes produced by combustible fuels 
and the socalled greenhouse effect and acid rain will lead people 
to reconsider nuclear power he said 
local environmental activists however say the project will 
prove otherwise 
its impressive what they are doing but its no solution 
says carol mongerson a member of the coalition on west valley 
nuclear waste all weve really done is change it from one form to 
another 
mongerson says solidified radioactive waste remains harmful for 
thousands of years a single glass log will give off some 8500 
rems enough radiation to kill a person exposed only for a few 
minutes 
the coalition sued the state and federal governments to force 
westinghouse to conduct an environmental impact study of its plans 
to hold cement drums in a vault at the site a federal judge ruled 
that until the study is completed the company must store the drums 
in a temporary facility 
mongerson says west valley officials are engaging in a lot of 
wishful thinking about the future of the nuclear industry 
there really isnt any feasible way of dealing with the 
byproducts she says 
meanwhile life in the nearby farming community life proceeds 
undaunted with residents scoffing at suggestions of a catastrophic 
accident at the site 
heck were the ones who make up those glowindark jokes 
says bernard bud williams supervisor of the town of 2000 
people

what the general idea was based on 
we went to paris shortly after the movie the cotton club had 
been a good hit in paris 
but now harkening back to some of the fine old hits of an 
earlier golden age of cabarets and broadway revues she is not only 
comfortable she promises new success 
if black and blues three singers are patterned after 
anybody she says it is the peters sisters a trio of american 
sisters who became a hit in europe the last one virginia peters 
is living in paris she saw the show and said she was pleased it 
was reminiscent of her good times 
miss brown had three solos in paris and she still does but 
mood indigo has been replaced by body and soul singing 
those songs she says was really like going back to my beginning 
she was born ruth weston on jan 12 1928 in portsmouth va 
the oldest of seven children whose father was a methodist choir 
director 
at 16 she joined lucky millinders band 
traveling with millinder she says i was keeping company with 
one of the fellows in the band unless i wanted to be buried when i 
got home i thought i better get married thats how i got brown 
by the time she got to washington she and trumpeter jimmy brown 
were separated and millinder fired her for fetching drinks for the 
musicians 
she had left home against her fathers wishes and found herself 
without the price of a bus ticket home standing on a street 
corner by the howard theater with my suitcase in my hand 225 miles 
from home 
a young man walked up i recognized he was a singer with horace 
heidt he took me to the crystal caverns and introduced me to 
blanche calloway she gave me a chance to sing for her audience 
they received me in such a way she said shed put me to work for a 
week 
blanche was cab calloways sister she was one of the first 
female band leaders and one of the most gorgeous women ever to grace 
the stage this show would have been her cup of tea 
blanche calloway became her manager miss brown says she 
called the son of the turkish ambassador who was starting a record 
company and suggested he get down and listen to this girl ahmet 
ertegun listened and ruth brown was signed to the fledgling atlantic 
records in 1949 
miss browns first recording at atlantic records was a ballad 
so long then staff writer rudy toombs brought in a fast song 
teardrops from my eyes which she also recorded for atlantic 
it took she says it was the first thing id done with a 
back beat it was really danceable it went into the charts at 3 or 
4 moved into no 1 and stayed about 27 weeks 
she says that the song of hers people remember best is mama he 
treats your daughter mean 
no matter where i go 35 years later they ask for that song 
other big records were 51015 hours of your love oh 
what a dream mambo baby and lucky lips which moved from 
the rhythm n blues bestselling charts to the pop charts unusual 
in those days 
it wasnt always sunshine she has had to get 9to5 jobs from 
time to time and dropped out of show business to raise her children 
record royalties stopped until in 1985 attorney howell begle a 
rhythm n blues fan began to look into her case and others 
now she gets monthly statements and has received one lump sum 
payment going back to 1970 im satisfied she says a lot of 
people have been helped even at this late stage of the game ahmet 
made the decision to let us go ahead amicably he could have caused 
us to stay in court a long time and most of us didnt have the money 
to do that 
last season miss brown was offbroadway in the musical 
staggerlee a casting director saw that and invited her to read 
for motormouth mabel in the film hairspray she got the part in 
december she was featured in a pbs documentary that rhythm those 
blues 
she has been married four times i have two fine sons theyre 
actors in california waiting for the big moment theyre going to 
get their star on the sidewalk her grandson recently appeared in 
a mcdonalds commercial as a future olympics longdistance runner 
ive been more active in the last year and a half than ever 
she says ive been back doing nightclubs and i went to a jazz 
festival in japan ive really got the bug for acting fantasy 
records put out have a good time cut live in los angeles ive 
got the feeling as the old folks say im on a roll

what melanie griffith does in working girl to get ahead in 
the business world would get her fired from any financial house in 
new york so why do audiences cheer for her masterful connivings 
because griffiths tess mcgill is quite the most endearing movie 
character in years with her wide innocent eyes and shy lispy 
voice she conceals a quicksilver mind that outraces the executives 
who treat her like a servant with a note pad 
tess is a threetime loser as she is reminded by her employment 
counselor olympia dukakis in a preoscar bit but tess manages to 
land another job joining a bullpen of anonymous secretaries her 
boss is the smarmy katharine parker siguorney weaver who 
professes to be democratic but steals tess ideas and demeans her as 
much as the male superiors 
by careful reading of the gossip and financial columns tess 
divines that a moneyrich conglomerate might be ripe to buy a radio 
chain her boss dismisses the notion then goes off on a ski 
vacation and breaks her leg tess usurps the boss office and 
wardrobe and sets her plan in motion enlisting the help of an 
ambitious broker harrison ford 
kevin wade has fashioned a screenplay filled with crisp dialogue 
witty observation and delightful surprises so what if all of tess 
plans as well as her personal life turn out beautifully working 
girl is a story that demands a happy ending 
the proceedings are given a sophisticated polish by mike nichols 
at the top of his directorial skill adding to the happy blend is a 
lilting score by carly simon who employs a handful of old standards 
melanie griffith occupies the screen almost throughout and the 
fascination never fades she emerges as a major star harrison ford 
aka han solo and indiana jones handsomely fits his brooks 
brothers clothes he is the ideal prince charming for griffiths 
cinderella courageously abandoning her usual star turn sigourney 
weaver plays the heartless boss with great flair 
another star of working girl is the manhattan cityscape it 
has never looked more stunning than through michael ballhaus camera 
douglas wick produced the 20th century fox release the r rating 
seems harsh in view of the limited nudity and few sex scenes 
running time 113 minutes

writer john patrick shanley who took viewers to the sweet 
streets of brooklyn in moonstruck moves to the mean streets of 
the bronx in 1964 with five corners 
unlike moonstruck this 1988 movie was no hit 
but both shanley products have an appealing fairytale feel with 
their roots squarely planted in the mundane 
jodie foster is lovely as linda a tough young woman frightened 
at the release of a man sent to prison for trying to rape her john 
turturro is truly terrifying as heinz still obsessed with linda 
tim robbins bull durham plays harry lindas savior who after 
his policeman father is killed becomes profoundly affected by the 
work and words of martin luther king jr 
the characters paths cross in a neighborhood of violence and 
poverty some escape into a private fantasy world others by 
leaving like harry who plans to go south to register black voters 
heinz cannot escape and turturro makes you feel how penned in his 
character feels 
there are drugs and pointless vandalism penguins in a fountain 
a st bernard named the buddah dark humor and mostly people just 
trying to get by in a world that shouldnt be so tough 
five corners is eccentric and engaging and above all worth 
watching but the end is less than satisfying as a world lacking in 
peace and order is tied up a little too neatly by the credits

when in rome virgin when in rome 
 
this selftitled debut record from a trio of englishmen sounds 
like a lot of todays pop music synthesizerbased danceable and 
rather emptyheaded 
when in rome is the nom de guerre of vocalist andrew mann 
bassistvocalist clive farrington and keyboardist michael floreale 
on their album the three are joined by a host of session musicians 
who chime in on percussion guitars keyboards and horns 
the songs center around floreales multifaceted keyboards and 
the dual vocals of farrington and mann the two singers harmonize 
perfectly singing lead vocals together on nearly every tune 
the music is generally bright and perky sort of what the pet 
shop boys probably sound like when theyve had too much coffee in 
fact the bubbly bongobased percussion often reminds the listener 
of one of those percolating coffee pots 
the promise a hit in great britain is typical starting 
with a piano that picks out the melody the song throbs along 
electronically with the clear harmonies of mann and farrington 
piercing through the catchy melody 
most of the record thumps along in this vein although on side 2 
there is a greater reliance on real instruments as opposed to their 
synthesizerproduced imitations that makes things more interesting 
childs play sports a clean trumpet solo over the vocal duet 
while total devotion is a fastpaced raveup with a real rock 
n roll piano solo and some fullthroated sax licks 
all in all when in rome makes hipsounding dance music that 
probably will blast out of speakers at college parties around the 
country the group however has little to say lyrically or 
musically and their debut album just glides along the mainstream 
like driftwood

greatest hits live arista carly simon 
 
last year barbra streisand released a recording of a rare live 
performance she gave before a small audience now carly simon 
another pop singer who seldom gives concerts has copied the 
strategy 
but miss simon does it better miss streisands one voice had 
problems with pacing and song selection but greatest hits live 
is a nice mixture of wellknown and unfamiliar material the album 
title notwithstanding and the emphasis throughout is on the singer 
and the songs 
in her first performance before a live audience in eight years 
miss simon makes such hits from the early 1970s as anticipation 
and the right thing to do sound fresh and the record climaxes 
with the ambitious coming around again which includes the 
nursery rhyme itsy bitsy spider as a descant 
a crack band and intelligent varied arrangements complete the 
package miss simon has been accused in the past of singing flat 
but this set is sharp all the way around

you might expect an intensely serious actor 
such as john malkovich to delve into 18th century french history in 
order to play a decadent aristocrat in dangerous liaisons wrong 
mostly you just play the part as written he admits 
peoples behavior and the way they view the world and their very 
actions are just in the writing study the characters motivations 
and history not for me afraid not 
dangerous liaisons is based on chonderlos de laclos 
scandalous 1782 novel and christopher hamptons modern play les 
liaisons dangereuses malkovich as the unscrupulous valmont 
connives with glenn close another sexobsessed aristocrat in 
bedroom games that ruin the lives of several people 
i wouldnt really describe valmont as evil the actor mused 
he has a lot of suspiciousness to him and he does a lot of things 
that are really mean but i dont think in the end that he is really 
evil 
one of the things the picture is about is that he is unaware 
that he is capable of love unaware that he is capable of feeling 
unaware that he is capable of provoking that emotion in someone 
else once he discovers that he can do that it goes against 
everything he has ever believed about himself finally it destroys 
him 
malkovich seemed a reluctant recruit to warner bros hoopla for 
dangerous liaisons although highly visible on the screen since 
his 1984 debut as the combat photographer in the killing fields 
he has maintained a low profile in the media but he considered the 
selling of dangerous liasions to be part of his job 
a softspoken man he carefully chooses his words as if wary of 
being misinterpreted he bristled somewhat at the intimation that he 
was not exactly typecast as the dashing amorous valmont 
any character i play is not like me so it doesnt really 
matter what the differences are he said if youre intimating 
that im not sexcharged or romantic you may be completely correct 
im also not a psychopath or a robot or blind or anything else i 
play 
the stars of dangerous liaisons malkovich close michelle 
pfeiffer are american and their speech is americanized this is 
part of the plan by the original producer lorimar telepictures 
although the original novel was french and the play on which 
the movie was based was written by an englishman christopher 
hampton and the director stephen frears is english they 
lorimar very much wanted american actors said malkovich we 
tried to make a more or less concerted effort to sound not too 
american also we didnt want to sound english at all 
no chance of john malkovich sounding english he was born in the 
american heartland in the small town of benton ill his life 
changed in 1973 when he happened into a drama class at eastern 
illinois university 
i had a girlfriend who was an actress and i knew absolutely 
nothing about theater or films he said we didnt have theater 
within hundreds of miles of my hometown 
so she was an actress and i started following her around 
watching rehearsals eventually i started doing it myself i kept 
doing it the last two years in school then i met the people who 
started the steppenwolf theater in chicago in 76 when we all left 
school i went with them 
malkovich became one of the pillars of steppenwolf with which he 
is still associated he attracted rave reviews when the company 
played in new york and he won an obie in sam shepards true 
west his second film places in the heart won him an academy 
award nomination as supporting actor and he has followed with 
eleni making mr right the glass menagerie and 
empire of the sun 
he played biff to dustin hoffmans willy loman in death of a 
salesman on broadway and won an emmy for the television version 
were movies an early ambition 
no its not something i gave a lot of thought to 
did it happen by accident 
i think we could say that i did some plays and people asked me 
to do this film and that film and it sort of mushroomed and spiraled 
out of control 
is film work as fulfilling as the theater 
rarely this particular one yes because it was a particularly 
good part i enjoyed the people i worked with and i really cared 
about the story plus i worked a lot usually on films that doesnt 
happen thats the thing that usually drives me nuts theres so 
much waiting around its too long between times of working

the famous mezzosoprano marilyn horne pauses in 
detailing her busy life to ruminate about one difference between 
actors and singers 
actors she said dont always get to do the works of the 
greatest writers and playwrights but in classical music were 
dealing with the masters all the time 
the good things shes singing range from the most obscure which 
she relishes introducing to the very familiar such as bizets 
carmen 
i keeping saying im going to pull up a bit on opera and do 
less she said i keep doing more it seems like there are so 
many offers coming up all the time its crazy 
in september and october miss horne sang seven performances of 
maometto ii an 1820 rossini opera having its american premiere 
at the san francisco opera in november she sang dame quickly 
eight times in falstaff a verdi masterpiece at the lyric opera 
of chicago in december she was at the metropolitan opera six times 
as carmen in january and february the concentration is on 
rossinis tancredi first in chicago then los angeles 
after that comes a recital tour and more tancredi in 
barcelona followed by rinaldo in venice and rossinis comic 
the italian girl in algiers in london 
miss horne who has a coloratura facility rare in voices lower 
than soprano is especially acclaimed for singing rossini who 
expected coloratura singing even from men 
maometto ii is a really fabulous rossini work that he 
rewrote she said he wrote it in his naples period and when he 
went to paris he rewrote it as the siege of corinth that i sang 
at la scala in 1969 the versions are quite different 
the san francisco opera and miss horne decided on maometto 
instead of siege because maometto had never been presented 
in the united states 
it was an enormous success much beyond our expectations 
she said the rossini seria operas are still something that people 
are not too familiar with i think theyre bowled over by the 
music 
in opera seria which came before grand opera each scene had a 
recitative to relate a plot event followed by an aria that 
commented on the event the arias often were written to show off 
particular singers these operas were slim on acting but the good 
ones were stuffed with beautiful music 
next season miss horne will sing in falstaff and vivaldis 
orlando furioso in san francisco 
its a staggeringly beautiful opera which whenever weve done 
it has never been less than a screaming stomping success she 
said 
my dream is to talk the met into it so far theyre not 
interested im hoping theyll come and see this and say we have 
to have this i would love to be the first person to bring a 
vivaldi opera to the met as i did with handel 
in may shell sing concerts with the detroit and indiana 
symphonies 
ive always felt a balance between opera and concerts is good 
for me vocally i think its good for the longevity of the voice 
one is so outgoing and one is so intimate you can get too much one 
or the other you can get yourself into a little bit of trouble 
vocally 
sometimes a singer needs to have a real good sing you need to 
get out there and belt it out and sometimes you need to use the 
utmost of control with your voice 
instead of dieting these days miss horne says she does aerobics 
and calisthenics an hour a day six days a week 
i have a trainer who comes and puts me through my paces if i 
have to walk 20 or 30 blocks i just walk out the door and do it 
im really pleased because i feel so good 
miss horne has been singing in public since 1954 when she dubbed 
the voice of dorothy dandridge in the movie carmen jones 
im on maintenance for my voice now too im trying to 
maintain what ive got 
angela the daughter of miss horne and her former husband 
conductor henry lewis recently moved to los angeles where she has 
a job assisting a director on a film 
lewis will conduct tancredi in los angeles and barcelona 
we occasionally do concerts together too miss horne said 
weve always remained really close friends and conferred on 
anything serious that had to do with angela all the time she was 
growing up 
angela loves carmen and norma she saw her first norma 
when she was 5 at covent garden joan sutherland and i did it 
there 
but angela soon spoke of my music rock and your music 
classical her mother recalled then i phoned her a couple of 
years ago and heard what i thought was singing in the background 
she said im taping some of your records to play in the car i 
thought thats it weve finally done it

don and david was authors of the hit single 
spy in the house of love would like to thank many people for 
the success of was not was moonie krupka jazz critic david 
weiss funk king george clinton music executive michael zilkha 
and of course dons 2yearold son 
get the picture well theres more 
the was would also like to extend their appreciation to singers 
sweet pea atkinson and harry bowen rocker elvis costello and frank 
sinatra jr all contributors to the groups third album what up 
dog 
still confused then go back about 20 years when two young smart 
alecks named donald fagenson and david weiss were growing up in the 
suburbs of detroit the story begins with our heroes in eighth grade 
gym class 
this is where moonie krupka comes in 
some of the students were using tumbling equipment without 
supervision weiss recalled in an interview at the manhattan 
offices of chrysalis records when the teacher found out he asked 
who had done it don and i decided to withhold information but a 
guy named moonie krupka ratted on us we met outside the teachers 
office 
and so the friendship was born weiss the poet who could not 
remember lyrics to the motown hits sung in the school bathrooms and 
fagenson the natural musician experimenting with multitrack 
recordings at age 14 
they each attended the university of michigan at ann arbor but 
eventually went their separate ways weiss headed west and became a 
jazz critic for the los angeles herald examiner 
i fancied myself a writer weiss said i was really just a 
big jazz fan 
fagenson meanwhile took to the trenches in detroit doing 
studio work and performing gilbert osullivan songs alone again 
naturally get down in local bars 
i was at wits end fagenson recalled you can only do so 
much hackwork itll drive you nuts especially if you have a 
statement youve got to make i felt the moment slipping away i 
called david and said lets go down in glory 
so in 1980 was not was was formed the name being inspired by 
none other than dons little boy who had invented phrases such as 
blue not blue and hot not hot 
the was write most of the groups material and also play a number 
of instruments including keyboards flute harmonica and mandolin 
for singers they recruited atkinson and bowen who had been 
performing backing vocals at the sound suite 
clinton mastermind of parliamentfunkadelic enters the story 
because his music and satirical style of writing are powerful 
influences on was not was 
george clinton played at our high school dance when his group 
was still called the parliaments weiss said they came and 
lipsynced i just wanna testify at our dance he was obviously the 
first black hippie anybody had ever seen so he really made quite an 
impact 
with the help of a friendly jazz critic was not was managed to 
get signed to ze records an independent label in 1980 
i violated journalistic ethics by sending the demo to ze 
records with a cover letter record from myself as a critic saying 
you must listen to these guys weiss confessed 
the ploy worked zilkha the president of ze liked was not was 
and the groups selftitled debut album came out in 1981 
the record sold poorly however and was not was tried its luck 
the following year with geffen records formed by david geffen who 
had helped discover the eagles and jackson browne among many others 
it was in weiss words the beginning of the end of the 
beginning 
we came in as this panethnic dance act this heterosexual 
village people weiss said geffens people thought in terms 
of hit records get rid of the black guys atkinson and bowen 
they told us youre blueeyed soul you need a paul young or daryl 
hall to front the group 
out of this promising relationship came the groups sole album 
for geffen born to laugh at tornadoes released in 1983 the 
record bombed and was not was spent the next two years trying to 
get out of its contract 
we were pariahs at our own record companies weiss said 
was not was did manage to have a couple of hits in europe and 
is now happily signed with chrysalis records what up dog is a 
mix of funky tracks such as spy and anytime lisa the 
offthewall earth to doris featuring weiss anguished vocals 
and the heartfelt love can be bad luck 
sinatra can be heard crooning wedding vows in las vegas a 
lessthanromantic look at life in the gambling mecca 
it was a case of him seeing the song and being glad he had an 
original piece of music that he could relate to said fagenson 
inspired to use the singer after seeing his name on a marquee 
there was a great deal of pathos in that lyric its a sad place 
and i thought he captured it 
now that they are commercial successes fans will no doubt want 
to know weiss and fagensons secret to writing hit singles 
explained weiss were the first audience for each other i 
think our relationship is like a great authors relationship with 
his publisher where you really need that third eye on things if we 
can prove this to each other we can prove it to the audience at 
large because were so tough on each other 
added fagenson hes just a lazy guy he wont compose until he 
has words

the story of child abuse that sylvia fraser tells 
in my fathers house would be chilling on any terms 
but even more so the story is the writers own 
fraser created a separate identity another self to exist when 
her father sexually abused her during childhood the other self 
remained hidden and unknown to her for 40 years until she realized 
she had been an abused child and summoned back the memories 
in an interview in her nearly allwhite living room the author 
said she started to write a novel about what had happened but was 
offended by the idea that she was putting into fiction something 
that was fact she decided to go ahead with the book despite the 
selfexposure needed 
the response has been positive she said including many letters 
from people who tell her youve written my story 
my fathers house was first published last year by doubleday 
canada and now in paperback has been high on the canadian 
bestseller lists it recently was published in hardcover in the 
united states 
without being distracted by the freak element one can relax 
and enjoy ms frasers writing which is rich yet superbly honed 
jill johnston wrote in the new york times book review 
while the story has been told before in such books as sybil 
this is the first book by a professional writer about her own abuse 
and multiple personality 
unlike sybil whose case has been documented by psychologists 
fraser did not seek psychiatric help she completely blocked out all 
conscious memory of her abuse and maintained that the child victim 
was a completely separate personality through personal awareness 
and woman consciousnessraising sessions in the 1970s she slowly 
came to terms with who she was the actual memory came spontaneously 
while she was socializing one day with friends 
fraser was a journalist before her first novel pandora was 
published in 1972 she has written four novels since all of them 
including themes or incidents of sexual violence 
of course now i understand that it was my other self she 
said my whole writing impulse had really come from my abused 
self 
my fathers house is a sort of detective story in which 
fraser searches for the unknown portions of her own past yet it 
also is a remarkably vivid memoir of growing up in hamilton a city 
about an hours drive southwest of toronto in the 1940s and 50s 
we were all stereotyped and terribly repressed fraser said 
proceeding with the interview despite having a beastly cold 
i think it was a very nasty time to grow up it wasnt an age 
of innocence it was an age of repression 
fraser believes her fathers secret may have been known or 
suspected among their relatives or neighbors but was simply too 
horrendous to be considered in that era when even divorce was 
thought of as a dirty word 
the times were such that it was better not to remember she 
said 
while she blocked the memories of the experiences lived by her 
other self she had nearly total recall of everything else 
were now talking about memories that are 40 years old the 
author said 
fraser attributes the crucial decisions made in her life from 
walking out on a good marriage to an affair with the father of a 
childhood friend to the confusion underlying an always outwardly 
strong front 
the whole emotional drive of my life was to reunite my two 
selves she said i spent a lifetime with this mystery at my 
core 
fraser who started her career as a feature writer for the 
toronto stars weekly said the dual personality she developed 
during her childhood was an extension of the device most people use 
to show different aspects at different times 
the difference in her case she said was the blocking off so 
that one self was not aware of the other perhaps in response to 
puzzled looks she said its not something to intellectualize too 
much you feel it or if you dont you dont 
her memory of the other self came back in december 1983 
this i do know my father was not a monster his life was a bud 
that never opened blighted by the first frost his crime became his 
prison his guilt his bars she writes in my fathers house 
the force with which i came to hate my father was a measure of 
the love i and my other self once bore him i know that now 
fraser said she no longer is angry 
i was a very angry child and a very angry adult she said 
id worn that out id used up all my anger basically i dont 
care anymore it really is behind me 
her next book whether a novel or nonfiction probably will be 
fantastical imaginative much airier in contrast to her 
previous works 
im just not interested in sex and violence she said

harold happy traum can help you learn 
to play a musical instrument without being lectured about 
practicing and you dont even have to leave home 
traum and his wife run a mailorder business known as homespun 
tapes they produce audio and video tapes of instructional music 
lessons featuring top musicians as instructors 
in 20 years of business theyve sold hundreds of thousands of 
such tapes to aspiring musicians around the world 
weve sent tapes to just about any country you can name 
malaysia lots of african countries japan and we get letters from 
people in poland czechoslovakia and the soviet union who say they 
cant send money they send us items in exchange like a crystal 
vase traum said 
each of the 60 and 90minute tapes feature one of the 50 
musicians who are teachers 
the whos john entwistle teaches electric bass chet atkins 
teaches country guitar livingston taylor teaches acoustic guitar 
and clarence gatemouth brown teaches blues guitar for blues 
harmonica the teacher is john sebastian formerly of the lovin 
spoonful 
other lessons teach fiddle banjo mandolin autoharp dulcimer 
flute keyboards and synthesizer altogether more than 400 tapes 
have been done 
tapes are categorized according to level beginning easy 
intermediate intermediate and advanced intermediate most audio 
tapes are 1295 or 65 for a series of six video tapes added 
about seven years ago cost 4995 and 5995 
theres just about every kind of music imaginable with one 
exception 
were not interested in heavy metal the 50yearold traum 
said during a visit to nashville for a taping session the traums 
live in woodstock ny 
traum who teaches guitar and banjo himself on the tapes says 
learning to play this way has several benefits 
you cant get personal lessons from these people they are 
the best in the world he said you can rewind and play as much 
as you want they dont get mad at you if you dont practice 
lots of adults dont like to go to a teacher because of a bad 
childhood experience or maybe their schedule doesnt permit it this 
way you can come home from work or get up in the morning and put a 
tape on 
it does not have the personal contact that a human teacher has 
so i would say that people should take lessons from a real teacher 
as well if they can but these tapes are the closest you can get to 
that we try hard to make these personal our name suggests that 
he says the tapes also are a bargain because one hour of personal 
music instruction could range anywhere from 15 to 50 
any onehour video gives the average student five or six 
lessons and several weeks or even months of practicing traum says 
he says the results depend on the individual 
i cant make a talented person out of an untalented one but if 
you have the dedication theres no limit especially if you 
supplement it by going to listen to a professional or forming a 
band you dont get better in a vacuum 
traum got started in the mail order business after making tapes 
for his guitar students 
it was a kitchen table operation for two years he recalled 
when dinner time came we cleared the tapes off and set the table 
for the kids 
today his business has a staff of eight and a mailing list of 
about 30000 sales of audio tapes outnumber the videos by 2to1 
but he figures it will be even soon 
were geared to the teens on up he said we have a lot of 
senior citizens with time on their hands they have a fiddle 
collecting dust in the attic and they want to put it to use 
some people have been buying the tapes as long as weve been in 
business we know their names by heart every few months we hear 
from them so we know people do progress 
we send questionnaires to all those on the mailing list he 
said we hear how the lessons have changed their lives and how 
theyve gotten in a band and so forth it makes us feel like were 
doing something right

poor attitudes not poor working 
conditions are the reasons many frustrated employees consider a job 
change a central michigan university researcher said 
the findings released on monday stem from a twoyear study of 
workers at five michigan companies said terry beehr a psychology 
professor at the university 
small changes in the workplace probably wont satisfy employees 
who carry their old restlessness to a new job beehr said 
people who see one job as stressful are prone to seeing all 
jobs as stressful he said even when jobs are substantially 
different people tend to hold the same kinds of attitudes about 
them some people are more prone to complaining than others and will 
complain regardless of objective reality 
the study funded by the us department of labor also found 
that workers who stay on the job despite their frustrations report 
better experiences than those who leave for other positions 
beehr and two university of arkansas psychologists nina gupta 
and douglas jenkins studied a mixed sample of 211 bluecollar and 
whitecollar michigan workers at two automotive supply companies a 
research and development company a printing business and the 
service departments of a large hospital 
most workers experienced an initial satisfaction with their new 
jobs but in many cases the happiness quickly faded beehr said 
by the time we did our followup interviews about a year and a 
half later the honeymoon was over he said their encounter 
with reality drives down those heightened expectations and the 
emptiness of unmet expectations takes over people begin to feel 
negative about their new jobs 
those who remained happy with their job changes had taken new 
positions with tangible benefits such as a higher salary or a better 
chance for promotion he said 
the study suggests that disgruntled workers should examine their 
reasons for leaving before they resign and avoid unrealistic 
expectations about new jobs beehr said 
i would just caution them to make sure the job isnt any worse 
in any way including nonwork factors such as location he said 
if every factor looks at least as good as your current job go 
ahead but dont expect youll be elated by the new job it probably 
wont happen if it does it wont last long

angeles man is an expert hacker who calls himself condor and is so 
dangerous he must never be allowed to use even a telephone without 
supervision 
he is truly a threat to society someone who uses computers to 
act out personal vendettas against people said jim black a 
computer crime specialist with the police department 
the bottom line with kevin is that if you have a job pay a gas 
bill use a phone or drive a car he can find you and ruin you 
electronically black said in a telephone interview if he 
wasnt in jail he could be listening to us right this minute

a nuclear regulatory commission panel has 
conditionally approved the new hampshire portion of the emergency 
plan for the seabrook nuclear power plant saying it does not 
believe area teachers claims they would abandon their pupils in an 
atomic emergency 
in a 290page decision dated friday and released today a panel 
of three administrative law judges said there is reasonable 
assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken 
within the new hampshire portion of a 10mile evacuation zone 
around the plant 
part of the zone lies in massachusetts which has refused to 
cooperate in the planning for an evacuation 
the plants operator public service co of new hampshire has 
submitted a plan for massachusetts communities but the atomic 
safety and licensing board panel of law judges has yet to hold a 
hearing on it 
a recent order from president reagan gave the federal emergency 
management agency authority to draw up a plan and operate it if a 
state refuses to take part 
todays approval was conditioned on several paperwork tasks and 
resolving a traffic issue the board said had not been considered 
workers in the area going home before they begin evacuating the area 
the board said it would seek advice from various groups on how to 
deal with that issue but added that the omission of the commuter 
trips to home will not have a large effect on the plan 
several local officials including teachers had testified at 
board hearings they would abandon their jobs or pupils in favor of 
taking care of their own families rather than carry out duties 
assigned to them in the evacuation plan 
the board does not accept the implied conclusion of the 
teachers testimony that virtually all of the teachers in the 
10mile zone will abruptly abandon their pupils without even 
pausing to account for them and seeing them to a school bus 
the law judges said 
while we would not expect heroic behavior from all of the 
teachers neither would we accept panic from all of them the 
licensing board said 
the law judges found the teachers testimony perplexing and 
said it does not represent traditional american values and 
history 
where those relied upon to respond in an emergency know that 
they have a role and are trained to that role as a group they will 
not fail their communities the board opined 
the 57 billion seabrook plant was completed two years ago but 
has been idle because of the dispute over the evacuation plan 
the commission has said it will grant a lowpower testing license 
as soon as public service co can present evidence that it would be 
able to pay for closing and decommissioning he plant once its 
components become radioactive 
the company which is operating under the protection of 
bankruptcy courts has said it expects to satisfy that requirement 
in a few weeks

mcorp continues to get close looks from potential 
bidders and newspaper reports say that kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
is the latest to begin reviewing the dallas firms records 
mcorp senior vice president for corporate affairs george a 
mccane today told the associated press the company is obligated 
after seeking fdic assistance to allow potential bidders to review 
the troubled bank holding companys records but he said the company 
has no intention of revealing who those interested parties are 
im not going to go into any detail about who might have been 
in or who might be coming in mccane said 
the teams of outsiders combing through the companys financial 
records to establish what kind of bid if any their company should 
make have not been particularly distracting although mcorp hopes to 
convince federal regulators that it can bring itself out of 
financial difficulty with a little help mccane said 
the thing people are focusing on within the company is taking 
care of their customers mccane said addressing the needs and 
concerns of customers that keeps people busy 
newspaper reports say a team of analysts from kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co moved in last week to begin reviewing mcorps records

50member team out of the building 
besides wells fargo several other large banks are thought to be 
eyeing mcorp including citicorp of new york the journal said

secondlargest bank holding company in texas remains confident that 
it can convince federal regulators that it can bail itself out of 
trouble with a little help from the government and a few outside 
investors 
we feel good about the proposal we are putting together

a federal judge has barred toyota motor corp 
from using the lexus name for its new line of luxury cars on grounds 
that the name could infringe on the lexis trademark used by mead 
data central inc for its computerized dataretrieval service 
the ruling friday by us district judge david n edelstein came 
in a lawsuit filed by mead against the japanese carmaker and its 
us affiliate toyota motor sales usa inc mead said in a 
statement today 
on monday toyota obtained a temporary emergency stay of 
edelsteins injunction mead said on thursday a panel of the 2nd 
us circuit court of appeals is expected to hear arguments on 
whether the stay should be extended said mead which is based in 
dayton ohio 
if the stay is not extended toyota will be prohibited from using 
the lexus name when exhibiting its new car line at the detroit and 
los angeles automobile shows which open saturday mead said 
edelsteins ruling came under a new york law that entitles a 
trademark owner to relief if it can demonstrate that the quality of 
its trademark is likely to be diluted by another companys use of 
the same or similar trademark 
edelstein gave toyota five days to accept an alternate order that 
would permit it to use the lexus name provided it meets certain 
conditions including making payments to mead to enable the company 
to preserve the distinctiveness of its lexis trademark and clearly 
indicating in ads that the car line is not connected with mead or 
its lexis dataretrieval product 
toyota motor sales spokesman jim olson said today that he could 
not comment on whether the company would accept the alternate order 
but the official launch of the car line scheduled for thursday in 
detroit would go ahead as planned despite the lawsuit he added in 
an interview from the companys torrance calif headquarters 
toyota unveiled the lexus line last month and said it planned to 
have the japanese cars in us showrooms in september the cars 
represent a move to the high end of the car market for toyota which 
established its reputation as a maker of highquality moderately 
priced vehicles 
toyota said the lexus line which consists of two models is 
intended to compete with mercedesbenz and other luxury cars the 
move mirrors that by other japanese carmakers which also are 
entering the luxury car market 
the lexus models will cost 20000 to 35000 and will be sold 
through a separate dealer network the company said

everything youve heard and read about the 
linkage between the budget deficit and the trade deficit is wrong 
federal budget deficits are not responsible for pushing up the 
trade deficit raising taxes or cutting spending will not do 
anything to cure americas trade problems 
this at least is the contention of peter l bernstein an 
economist and forecaster who admits he is in a minority a rather 
small minority in fact 
i agree with very few people bernstein who runs a new 
yorkbased consulting firm said in an interview this week 
frankly i think his ideas are nonsense agreed david wyss a 
mainstream financial economist at data resources inc in lexington 
mass 
bernstein may indeed be wrong but he is worth listening to 
because he is raising the right questions he is certainly right 
that cutting the budget deficit is no cureall 
it leads to belief in a quick fix if we raise taxes a little 
bit and cut spending a little bit the terrible hemorrhage in 
trade will take care of itself bernstein said 
conventional wisdom says budget deficits create a shortage of 
national savings and push up interest rates high interest rates 
attract foreign investors who compete to invest in dollars the 
foreign demand for dollars pushes up the exchange rate so american 
products are expensive overseas and foreign products are cheap in 
the united states 
the result shrinking exports growing imports and a trade 
deficit 
its indisputable that a savings shortfall and a trade deficit 
occur simultaneously thats necessarily true by accounting rules 
but bernstein questions whether the one causes the other 
in fact he suggests it may be that the trade deficit is causing 
the budget deficit and the overall savings shortfall the idea is 
that the trade deficit depresses the national income holding down 
the governments tax revenue and resulting in a budget deficit 
bernstein makes one telling point in the mid1980s economists 
were saying the dollar was high because the budget deficit was so 
big now they say the dollar is low because the budget deficit is so 
big 
any piece of conventional wisdom that purports to explain 
diametrically opposite results deserves closer scrutiny than it 
usually gets 
bernstein produces charts showing no statistically significant 
correlation between countries that have big budget deficits and 
countries that have big trade deficits britain for example is 
running budget surpluses and trade deficits canada has a big budget 
deficit and often runs trade surpluses 
conventional economists respond that bernstein is ignoring the 
role of private savings 
countries like japan and west germany can afford to run federal 
budget deficits because they have big pools of private savings to 
borrow from wyss said in contrast the united states needs to 
exercise budgetary restraint because the pool of private savings is 
small 
americans arent likely to start saving more wyss said so to 
balance its trade account the united states must either cut its 
budget deficit or which is worse decrease investment 
even people who believe the budget deficit must be cut can agree 
with bernstein that fiscal measures are not the final answer to 
americas persistent trade difficulties 
ultimately bernstein said in a recent paper americas 
ailments all derive from the real economy and are only incidentally 
financial in origin 
the united states needs to improve its productivity so that it 
can export products that the rest of the world wants and still 
afford to buy the imports that the rest of the world has to offer 
higher productivity does not come in neat packages however 
he said it comes in thousands of different bits and pieces of 
education motivation and innovation

poultry producer holly farms corp said 
today it would fight a court ruling won by hostile suitor tyson 
foods inc that blocks holly farms from a friendly merger with 
conagra corp 
holly farms officers said in a statement that despite the ruling

shareholders of both holly farms a 100yearold memphis company 
and conagra based in omaha neb are scheduled to meet in separate 
sessions the first week of february to vote on the merger 
delaware vice chancellor maurice hartnett ruling against the 
proposed deal on friday in wilmington del reopened the door for 
tyson foodss hostile takeover attempt of holly farms 
tyson of springdale ark is the nations largest poultry 
processor and has been attempting to buy rival holly farms since 
oct 11 
tysons lawsuit to halt the holly farmsconagra merger was heard 
in delaware because both holly farms and tyson are incorporated 
there 
hartnett ruled that provisions of the merger agreement did not 
serve the best interest of holly farms stockholders because it did 
not give them an opportunity to consider tysons offer he enjoined 
holly farms and conagra from acting on a merger agreement they 
reached nov 17 
the courts decision does not in any way affect our resolve to 
complete the transaction with conagra holly farms president and 
chief executive officer r lee taylor ii said in the statement 
released monday 
despite the courts findings the board believes it acted 
properly in order to secure what was and continues to be the 
best available alternative for holly farms and its stockholders we 
intend to pursue our proposed merger with conagra vigorously 
jim blair a lawyer for tyson foods said he had hoped holly 
farms would open the bidding to tyson as well as conagra following 
the court ruling in delaware 
a holly farms manager in view of what the court now has said 
ought to say since were liberated from our obligations to conagra 
we would like to negotiate with both parties and get the best price 
we can get for our shareholders blair said i dont understand 
why theyre not doing that 
tyson foods announced today it has extended its 54ashare cash 
tender offer for all outstanding share of holly farms until 5 pm 
est on friday 
blair said tyson officials will meet this week to see if that bid 
should be raised 
tysons attempt to buy holly farms began with a friendly offer 
for about 900 million in cash or stock when the holly farms board 
of directors rejected that offer tyson launched its hostile 
takeover attempt going directly to holly farms shareholders with a 
52ashare offer 
holly farms turned to a white knight opting to sell the company 
to conagra in a stock swap valued at 1 billion 
tyson responded by offering shareholders 54 a share in cash for 
their holly farms stock making the deal worth about 977 million 
the financial markets were closed monday because of the new 
years holiday on friday holly farms shares closed at 55625 up 
50 cents and conagra shares closed at 29 down 125 cents in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
tyson shares closed at 17125 up 25 cents in overthecounter

british petroleum co plc agreed tuesday to sell 
off most of its mineral operations for 432 billion and in a 
separate transaction pay 357 billion to buy back more than half 
the 132 billion bp shares held by the government of kuwait 
rtz corp plc a mining company with global interests said it 
agreed to buy the mineral operations which includes operations in 
the united states mexico brazil norway zimbabwe south africa 
australia papua new guinea and indonesia for 24 billion pounds 
or 432 billion 
the sale includes bps biggest us asset bingham canyon in 
utah one of the worlds largest open pit gold and copper mines 
frank fisher bps director of external affairs in salt lake city 
confirmed tuesday however it does not include most of bps 
canadian mineral assets 
the stock buyback follows a british government order to the 
kuwaitis last month to reduce their bp holdings from 2168 percent 
to under 10 percent within three years 
bp said it was buying 790 million shares from the kuwait 
investment office the londonbased investment arm of the kuwaiti 
government for 195 billion pounds the equivalent of 357 
billion the transaction is subject to approval by bp shareholders 
the company said 
the british governments order to the kuwaitis came after a 
ruling in october by the monopolies and mergers commission that the 
big kuwaiti holding could operate against the public interest 
because of kuwaits membership of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
bp chairman sir peter walters said tuesday that allowing such a 
large stake in bp shares to remain in limbo for a period of up to 
three years isnt in the interests of the company or its 
shareholders 
the kuwait investment office built up its holding by buying 
partly paid bp stock in the months following the governments 72 
billion pound or 132 billion public offering of bp shares in 
october 1987 
the major sale by the conservative government under its policy of 
privatization coincided with the stock market crash the offering 
which included the governments remaining 315 percent stake in bp 
was seriously undersubscribed 
bp will pay the kuwaitis 305 pence each for their shares 
compared with a purchase price of 287 pence 
however bp will effectively pay 247 pence a share because of tax 
credits bp shares rose as high as 259 pence on tuesdays 
announcements and its partly paid shares gained 10 pence to 1575 
pence on the london stock exchange 
meanwhile rtz shares rose 7 pence to 424 pence 
walters said bp began negotiating the mineral sales in mid1988 
and said they were not undertaken to finance the share buyback 
the minerals transaction also covers the canadianbased qit the 
worlds leading producer of titanium dioxide a 49 percent stake in 
australias olympic dam copper uranium gold and silver mines and 
south africas richards bay minerals a top producer of titanium 
minerals iron and zircon from beach sands 
the bp assets involved had sales of 88572 million and an 
operating profit of 3294 million for the nine months ended sept

european officials on tuesday put 
finishing touches on a proposal to strike back at the united states 
in a trade dispute incited by a ban on american meat treated with 
growth hormones 
nico wegter a spokesman for the european economic community 
said that by thursday he expected representatives of the 12nation 
trading bloc would be given a proposal for imposing higher duties on 
certain us products 
the plan would be offered to counter measures the united states 
put into effect sunday to retaliate against the european meat ban 
approval of such a proposal would escalate a dispute that already 
threatens to become a serious transatlantic commercial war hurting 
a market in which twoway trade totaled an estimated 166 billion 
last year 
the communitys executive body the european commission earlier 
vowed to slap higher duties on such us imports as walnuts honey 
dried fruit and canned corn 
wegter said the principle of retaliation on our part is 
already confirmed its already there the only question is how we 
put that into practical terms 
the final details and enforcement date of any such action would 
have to be approved by the member governments 
american officials have raised the prospect of taking additional 
steps against any countermeasures imposed by the europeans alfred 
kingon us ambassador to the eec said last week i think its 
fair to say that you can anticipate further action on our side 
the friction was touched off by the enforcement on sunday of an 
eec ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones 
the trading bloc also known as the common market wants to prohibit 
for health reasons all meat from such animals 
officially there is no possibility of accepting meat coming 
from the united states that has been treated with hormones wegter 
told reporters 
the ban is expected to block the importation of about 100 
million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the united states 
some of which are used in making pates and sausages the measure 
exempts imports used to make pet food 
us officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten 
cattle a common practice among american farmers does not pose a 
health risk 
the prohibition was to have taken effect jan 1 1988 but the 
trading bloc agreed to a oneyear delay it has since refused us 
appeals for another postponement 
in retaliation for the meat ban the united states applied on 
sunday trade sanctions worth about 100 million against european 
goods 
the measures impose 100 percent duties on boneless beef hams and 
pork shoulders prepared or preserved tomatoes instant coffee 
fermented alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol 
by volume certain fruit juices and certain packaged pet food made 
from grains 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said last week that the 
eecs ban on us meat was an unfair trade practice and therefore 
justified the american retaliation 
the additional tariffs are to remain in effect for the duration 
of the meat ban 
but wegter contended the us retaliatory duties were not 
justified 
we are entitled to have our own standards for the quality of 
our foodstuff he said 
if the americans would like to breed with hormones its 
completely their affair he said the only thing we are asking 
is that to the extent they are exporting to us they should certify 
that there is no breeding with hormones 
eec members could adopt the countermeasures against the united 
states later this week wegter said but he added they also could 
refer the matter to key ministers scheduled to gather later in the 
month agriculture ministers from the 12 nations will meet jan 16 
and foreign ministers on jan 23 
wegter said we do not like the idea of having a trade war 
the more things can be kept under control and kept in its own 
proportion the better it is 
wegter said that last fall the eec proposed settling the dispute 
by boosting imports of highquality us beef in return for american 
acceptance of the hormone ban the offer he said was not accepted 
eec members are france west germany italy luxembourg 
belgium the netherlands denmark greece ireland portugal spain 
and the united kingdom

the weather and export fronts

metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices and rumors 
circulated tuesday of new soybean meal sales to the soviet union 
meanwhile the national weather service has predicted

president reagan said tuesday he has decided 
against any oil import fee or other action to curb oil imports but 
conceded that the free world will become increasingly dependent on 
oil supplies from potentially insecure sources 
the president said he acted on the recommendation of commerce 
secretary c william verity who reported that import restrictions 
would not be cost effective and in the long run would impair 
rather than enhance national security 
veritys report was the outcome of an investigation requested in 
december 1987 by the national energy security committee the 
president said 
he said verity concluded that there has been a substantial 
improvement in us energy security since the last similar 
investigation in 1979 
in a message to congress that accompanied his statement the 
president urged lawmakers to deregulate natural gas prices permit 
expanded oil exploration in alaska and the outer continental shelf 
and liberalize the depletion allowance for oil and gas producers 
reagan said that declining domestic oil production rising oil 
imports and growing free world dependence on potentially insecure 
sources of supply raise a number of concerns including 
vulnerability to a major supply disruption 
the investigation found that the maintenance of us access to 
sufficient supplies of petroleum is essential to our economic 
security foreign policy flexibility and defense preparedness he 
said given these factors the secretary of commerce found that 
petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security 
he said that in deciding not to recommend any import 
restrictions verity took into account the administrations program 
to improve energy security 
in particular reagan cited decontrol of oil prices and 
elimination of allocation controls as actions his administration has 
taken to strengthen the domestic oil industry 
the strategic petroleum reserve contains over 555 million 
barrels compared to 108 million barrels eight years ago he said 
today the nation is far less vulnerable to an oil supply 
disruption than in 1973 or 1979 
despite these improvements important energy security concerns 
remain the president said citing rising oil consumption declining 
us crude production and rising oil imports 
in addition projections show that the free world will become 
increasingly dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecure 
sources he said 
the president also called on congress to streamline nuclear power 
licensing procedures and sell the naval petroleum reserves at elk 
hills calif and teapot dome wyo

the ambassador hotel where charlie chaplin 
lived robert f kennedy died marion davies rode a horse through 
the lobby and generations of stars entertained at the cocoanut 
grove lounge closed its doors tuesday 
the last guests bid farewell to the 68yearold wilshire 
boulevard landmark an imposing building on 23 lush acres now in 
disrepair 
it was one of the citys first luxury hotels its palmlined 
property exemplifying the california lifestyle pictures of happier 
days line the corridors of the 350room main building but 
detracting from its elegant history now are peeling paint worn rugs 
and stained wallpaper 
the ambassador was host to top personalities in its heyday 
including soviet premier nikita khrushchev and entertainers elvis 
presley elizabeth taylor lena horne harry belafonte bing crosby 
and ray charles 
miss davies rode through the hotel lobby on horseback to amuse 
her lover multimillionaire publisher william randolph hearst the 
playground for yesteryears elite abounds with such tales 
jack benny proposed to mary livingston at the hotel built on the 
site of gottfried schmidts dairy farm marilyn monroe modeled 
clothing during fashion shows and for a halfcentury newspaper 
columnist walter winchell called the ambassador home for much of the 
year 
its going to be a landmark i will always remember there will 
nver be anything like it said roy gardner 72 a retired 
inglewood plumbing contractor who roamed the lobby on its last day 
distance was calculated using the ambassador said gardner we 
would say a place or somebodys house was five miles from the 
ambassador like that he said 
but the glitz wore off the venerable hotel in the last few 
decades as newer more fashionable hotels opened downtown and on 
the citys westside the ambassador in the midwilshire district 
between those areas made few physical improvements began losing 
money and had been up for sale for three years 
in may the owners the j myer schine family closed about 
threequarters of the 500 rooms because they failed to meet fire 
standards and more than 1 million was needed for earthquakesafety 
improvements 
maid elvira bell changed the sheets for the famous as well as the 
ordinary for 31 years it was a party by tiny bubbles 
entertainer don ho resulting in a hallway splashed with pineapple 
juice that she remembers vividly 
in those days the music was so loud that it began to run you 
crazy the 60yearold woman said now i miss it i have dropped 
tears when i see those singers on tv 
theyre getting so old and i wonder how about me 
the hotel had been a wellknown landmark for years before thanks 
in part to its famous cocoanut grove nightclub where such stars as 
sammy davis jr nat king cole and bob hope performed 
the ambassador dramatically came into the national limelight when 
new york sen robert kennedy was assassinated in the hotel pantry on 
june 6 1968 he was shot to death by sirhan sirhan moments after 
declaring victory in californias democratic presidential primary 
the sites future is uncertain with two companies negotiating to 
buy it said hotel spokeswoman margaret burk the estimated sale 
price has risen above 100 million with preservation of some or all 
of the building possibly at issue 
burks anecdotes include the time john wayne was a guest when 
john wayne came they said dont let any press in until he got to 
his room and put his toupee on ms burk said 
fearing developers would carve up the property and sell it off 
for commercial and residential ventures the city council voted in 
august 1987 to declare the ambassador a historic monument but the 
declaration expired after a year without a buyer being found 
despite its colorful history there was no fanfare to mark its 
closing management decided against a party because people have 
known for two years that the hotel would be closing ms burk said 
one visitor betty szeden who first set foot in the ambassador 
30 years ago as a model in a fashion show came back monday with her 
husband 
it was sad and quiet last night she said but im glad to 
see it again

the dollar began the year tuesday by skidding 
lower largely because of pessimism about the us trade deficit 
a variety of factors were behind the dollars decline but most 
pointed to concerns about trade analysts said 
jack barbanel an analyst with gruntal amp co said the dollar was 
affected by comments by west german officials that the us currency 
had reached its peak against the mark 
barbanel said the remarks led traders to believe the dollar was 
getting too strong too fast and therefore set off selling 
he said financial markets including foreign exchange traders 
also wanted to send a message to the incoming bush administration 
that the problems of the us budget and trade deficits must be 
dealt with 
jim mcgroarty a vice president with discount corp said news of 
an increase in the west german trade surplus also fueled the 
dollars decline 
the us government has seen a lower dollar as a means of 
reducing the us trade deficit so increases in the trade surpluses 
of other countries are taken by the markets as portending a drop in 
the dollar 
the dollar also fell now that traders have completed their 
yearend position squaring barbanel said 
the us currency started its day on a down note overseas and 
continued to fall in new york before regaining some ground barbanel 
attributed the late buying to technical market factors 
in london where bank base lending rates are at a high 13 
percent a government assurance that the rate would be kept high to 
combat inflation drove the british pound up more than 2 cents 
one pound cost 18270 in london late tuesday up from fridays

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co would not confirm or 
deny reports tuesday that it has been studying mcorps books in a 
possible bid to buy texas secondlargest bank holding company but 
one source says the presence of the leveraged buyout firm is no 
secret 
ive talked to people from within the bank that substantiate 
that theyre doing due diligence said frank anderson an analyst 
for stephens amp co theyre looking over the books we were all 
surprised when we found out kkr is involved 
several firms reportedly are interested in the dallasbased firm 
a report in tuesdays editions of the wall street journal said 
that a kkr team had quietly moved into mcorps office tower in 
downtown dallas last week the newspaper said the team had moved in 
just as a 50person team from wells fargo amp co of san francisco 
departed 
were declining comment on that story altogether said a 
spokesman for kkr ruth packman of keks amp co she said the company 
typically chooses to divulge no information until it makes a 
decision whether to try to acquire a company 
george a mccane vice president of corporate affairs for mcorp 
also said he could not say anything other than that the bank holding 
company is obligated by the fdic to allow potential bidders to 
review its books 
im not going to go into any detail about who might have been 
in or who might be coming in mccane said 
ray escamilla a security officer at mcorp said anyone reviewing 
records at the dallas firm would be working in an area accessible 
only by magnetic cards and could not be reached for comment 
an unidentified mcorp employee who provides public information 
in the towers lobby said she was not even familiar with kkr 
but anderson said word that a kkr team had descended on the bank 
had spread rapidly and aroused much curiousity among other investors 
neither party is disclosing what they are up to anderson 
said are they looking at buying the institution themselves or as 
part of a group or possibly at strengthening managements bid by 
being an outsider investor 
mcorp which has 201 billion in assets has said it intends to 
submit its own proposal for recapitalization of its troubled banks 
we would expect it to be completed and presented at the same 
time other proposals are completed and presented mccane said 
when that period will be is not being disclosed by fdic officials 
fdic spokesman alan whitney said tuesday he could not say 
anything about the mcorp situation 
all i can tell you is that the fdic is addressing the mcorp 
situation he said 
anderson said the investment community is watching the mcorp 
situation closely he said other investors would probably follow a 
kkr lead if the new york firm steps into the banking industry 
the investment community historically has had sort of a herd 
instinct he said 
anderson said it would seem like an advantageous time for kkr to 
branch into the financial services industry if it desired kkr just 
won a bidding war for rjr nabisco inc 
its probably a onceinalifetime opportunity to get in 
especially in the southwest where you can have the government as 
your partner anderson said its a real opportunity if you can 
structure the deal so that it cushions your downside i doubt this 
opportunity will ever present itself again 
anderson said that just the chance to browse through the mcorp 
records also provides an unprecedented opportunity 
if you wanted to get a good idea of what the southwest really 
looked like what better medium could you use he said noting 
that mcorp has banks in all of texas major markets 
undisclosed sources told the wall street journal that kkr has 
assembled a war chest of 5 billion to 6 billion and will use part 
of it to gain a major stake in the financial industry 
besides wells fargo several other large banks are thought to be 
eyeing mcorp including citicorp of new york the journal said

settled at 1037 cents a pound 
the selloff was mostly technically inspired with no fresh 
supplydemand news in the market analysts said 
but judith ganes of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
said lower prices could bring some of the physical buying that many

everyones waiting for the soviet union and china to buy to 
bridge their domestic shortfalls she said after this drop in 
price it might become attractive to them to enter the market 
cocoa rose 29 to 39 with march at 1539 a metric ton on

futures prices for frozen orangejuice concentrate tumbled 345

the federal milk price support will continue at 
1060 per 100 pounds through march 31 agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng announced tuesday 
the agriculture department buys surplus butter cheese and 
nonfat dry milk at prices high enough to keep milk prices paid to 
farmers by dealers from dropping significantly below the support 
level 
under drought aid legislation passed last year the department 
would have been required to boost milk supports 50 cents per 
hundredweight as of jan 1 if lyng had estimated dairy purchases in 
calendar 1989 would be less than 25 billion pounds of milk 
equivalent 
but lyng said the department estimated net purchases by the 
commodity credit corp will be 65 billion pounds thus overruling 
any increase in supports 
in a separate announcement the ccc said its price support crop 
loans to farmers will carry an 8 percent rate for loans made in 
january up from the december rate of 8 percent officials said the 
increase reflects the rate charged ccc by the us treasury

the department of transportation agreed tuesday 
to award the lucrative seattletokyo air route to continental 
airlines and will allow the houstonbased carrier to start service 
as early as march 
the department earlier had awarded the route to united airlines 
but two weeks ago the s court of appeals in washington dc 
ordered the department to give the route to continental and the 
department said tuesday it would not appeal that decision 
we are doing what they ordered said hal paris a department 
spokesman we feel the court has spoken and we will have to live 
with that decision 
the route which generates more than 100 million in revenue 
annually has been the focus of an intense twoyear battle between 
three of the nations largest airlines continental united and 
american 
at various times over the past two years administrative law 
judges and top department officials have awarded the route to all 
three airlines 
most recently the department had awarded the route to united 
but continental immediately asked the appeals court to overturn that 
decision which the court agreed to do 
rob doughty a united spokesman in chicago said his airline 
would have no comment on the departments decision tuesday to 
give the route to continntal 
doughty had said earlier that united was considering appealing 
the appeals court decision granting the route to continental 
us sen brock adams dwash who urged united be given the 
route expressed his disappointment in a statement released by his 
washington dc office 
this was a tough fight from the beginning and we did everything 
we could to see united succeed said adams who was president 
carters secretary of transportation 
while i think the decision was wrong i will do what i can to 
help keep the commercial airline industry stable inthe northwest and 
to help those working men and women affected by this decision he 
said 
united has been flying the nonstop seattletotokyo run since 
1983 
but when united bought pan american world airways pacific 
division in 1986 the transportation department said it wanted to 
take another look at whether united would be allowed to continue 
flying the route 
both northwest airlines and japan air lines also fly nonstop 
between seattle and tokyo 
continental has previously said that it would offer oneway fares 
between seattle and tokyo as low as 299 
american had said if it received the route it would construct a

budget rent a car corp says it has settled a 
dispute with the federal trade commission over compliance with 
automobile recalls 
the ftc charged dec 28 that budget had rented cars subject to 
recall notices without having them inspected or repaired 
budget said friday that it had reached a consent agreement with 
the ftc basically agreeing to continue the recall practices it has 
followed since 1984 
the company said there was no merit to the ftc charges budget 
said the charges stemmed from the companys inability to provide the 
government with sufficient proof that some cars had been inspected 
and the repairs made 
the ftc action arose from an industrywide investigation in 1981 
in which carrental companies were required to document their 
compliance with recall notices

we are serious and will continue to be serious about making 
payments on the debt salinas said in a new years speech to armed 
forces chiefs delivered monday 
we prefer firm negotiation to confrontation but let me 
emphasize that for me the interests of mexico are more important 
than the interests of the creditors salinas said

deficiencies and now its up to them creditors to do their part 
since he took power on dec 1 salinas has maintained that the 
priority is no longer to keep paying but to start growing again 
mexico last year paid 9 million in interest and 5 million in 
principle to service its debt it faces total payments this year of 
about 16 billion salinas maintains that mexico cannot continue to 
make such high payments if it wants to grow because it needs the 
money to invest

inaugurated feb 2 is due to arrive tuesday for a oneday visit 
his meeting with salinas comes in the wake of venezuelan president 
jaime lusinchis decision to suspend debt principal payments 
salinas said 1989 will be a year of economic transition 
between a period of unstable inflation and one of low inflation 
transition between stagnation and sustained recovery transition 
towards a better standard of living for all mexicans 
the rhythm of transition will depend on the conditions of debt 
renegotiation we have to take excessive debt service charges off

tyson foods inc is considering an increase 
in its 54ashare offer for holly farms corp a rival poultry 
processor headquartered in memphis a tyson spokesman said tuesday 
holly farms in an effort to fend off the tyson offer is trying 
to be absorbed by conagra inc a processor of food and agricultural 
products headquartered in omaha neb 
but a conagra spokesman declined to say tuesday if that company 
still is pressing for the merger which has been temporarily blocked 
by a delaware court 
we are reviewing our options and we really dont have anything 
more to say right now walt casey conagras vice president for 
corporate communications said from his office in omaha 
jim blair general counsel for tyson said company officers were 
planning to gather at their headquarters in springdale ark this 
week to discuss the holly farms project 
were going to try to find a way to make the holly farms board 
and holly shareholders a fair and generous offer that they cant in 
good conscience turn down blair said 
asked if that meant an increase in the 54 bid blair said i 
think its a possibility 
tyson the nations largest poultry processor has been trying 
since oct 11 to take over holly farms but hollys board of 
directors has resisted those attempts tysons latest offer is worth 
about 970 million 
holly farms a diversified food company heavily involved in 
poultry processing announced plans in november to head off tysons 
takeover by merging with conagra in a stock swap valued at 1 
billion 
tyson went to court in delaware where tyson and holly farms are 
incorporated and a chancellor issued a ruling friday temporarily 
blocking the holly farmsconagra deal tyson argued that holly farms 
owed it to its stockholders to consider all buyout offers 
holly farms issued a statement monday saying the ruling would be 
appealed and that shareholders of holly farms and conagra would be 
asked at separate meetings next month to vote on the proposed merger 
the courts decision does not in any way affect our resolve to 
complete the transaction with conagra holly farms president r 
lee taylor ii said in the statement 
blair said he was surprised that holly farms was so eager to 
appeal the chancellors ruling 
a holly farms manager in view of what the court has said 
ought to say since were liberated from our obligation to conagra 
we would like to negotiate with both parties and get the best price 
we can for our shareholders i dont understand why theyre not 
doing that blair said 
holly farms which has more than 15000 employees in 20 states 
had net income of 362 million in 1987 on sales of 16 billion 
conagra had 95 billion in sales last year making it the 
fourthlargest food company in the nation according to fortune 
magazine 
tyson which processes some 14 million pounds of chicken a week 
had total sales last year of just under 2 billion blair said 
tysons attempt to buy holly farms began with a friendly offer 
worth about 900 million in cash or stock when the holly farms 
board rejected that advance tyson launched its hostile offer 
presenting its bid directly to holly farms stockholders 
on the new york stock exchange tuesday holly farms closed at 
5675 up from 5562 on friday the financial markets were closed 
monday because of the new years holiday

the worlds largest bank daiichi kangyo bank 
ltd said tuesday it is selling its chicago retail operations to 
first american bank corp a suburban bank holding company so it 
can focus entirely on business banking 
terms of the transaction were not disclosed the deal includes 
assets of 35 million including about 6000 checking savings and 
other accounts and a retail loan portfolio of less than 5 million 
the companies said in a joint statement 
daiichi said the chicago office was its only us branch with 
retail operations but yoshiro aoki joint general manager of the 
chicago branch said a daiichi subsidiary in los angeles the 
daiichi kangyo bank of california also offers retail banking 
daiichi also operates branches in los angeles new york and 
atlanta and has offices but not full branches in houston and san 
francisco 
tokyobased daiichi with more than 375 billion in assets 
worldwide said it plans to relocate and expand its downtown chicago 
branch to accomodate the rapid growth of its business banking 
activities 
first american based in elk grove village has 500 million in 
assets and 18 banking locations in the chicago area the firm said 
it would retain daiichis chicago retail staff 
the deal marked a milestone for first american by giving the 
company its first downtown location said chairman thomas e wells 
iv 
it fulfills a critical goal in our strategy of geographical 
expansion wells said 
but for daiichi with assets of about 3 billion at its chicago 
branch alone this is insignificant with a capital i said 
frederick wightman a banking analyst with duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago 
wightman said japanese banks with us branches generally are 
more interested in largescale commercial business than in consumer 
checking savings and loans 
retail banking is tied closely to depositgathering and with 
the high savings rate in japan attracting retail deposits 
overseas is not a big concern for japanese banks wightman said 
the deposits are available in more than adequate quantities back 
in japan 
daiichis chicago branch established by the company in 1972 as 
the first pacific bank of chicago and converted to branch status 
late in 1981 counts among its customers such wellknown midwestern 
corporations as brunswick corp ford motor co goodyear tire amp 
rubber co mcdonalds corp and sears roebuck and co 
fumiyasu konno general manager of the chicago branch said 
specialization was synonomous with survival in the banking business 
banks must focus resources and expertise in the markets that 
offer them the greatest opportunities he said in a statement 
the sale is expected to be completed in the spring after 
regulatory approval
